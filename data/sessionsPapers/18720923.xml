                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I commenced examining the accounts about 13th December—my partner and I commenced simultaneously, and from that time up to June we have been continually engaged, and also subsequently to 5th June, up to the end of July, the day the prisoner was given into custody—he attended almost daily up to 15th July; he was there that day—I am not aware when Mr. Newsom knew that the prisoner had signed that memorandum—he was absent almost the greater part of the time—Mr. Burke would be aware of it almost immediately, I dare say—there are three partners—I believe Mr. Burke is at the office—he was present at the Police Court—he has not been examined as a witness during these proceed<lb/>ings—he did not take an active part in superintending the accounts; he placed the accounts in our hands for investigation, and we made our report to the firm—I did not say I told Mr. Burke of this occurrence; no doubt he would be made aware of it, whether by my partner or myself, I am not aware—on all these three occasions the identical cheques were paid into the bank on the respective days—the fair cash-book was very much in arrear; I can't say how much, several months—the rough cash-book was entered up, but never balanced for a good many months; it was net balanced in any way that I could understand—the fair cash-book had not been balanced from the June previous; the ledgers, of course, were cor<lb/>respondingly in arrear with regard to the cash—I could not tell you how long there had been no entry made from the previous balance—the cash-book appears to have been balanced by Mr. Rutherford; he had audited the accounts up to the previous June—there was no change of partnership at that time—the firm of Newsom, Burke &amp; Co. commenced business on 1st November, 1870, and this book refers alone to their business—there had been an audit or balance since then by my partner—on 30th June, 1871, the cash-book was balanced; there is no signature to it, but I know my partner performed the work previous to my being in partnership—I was not present—I have seen his balance-sheet—I had no concern with it—the prisoner told me that he was going to Yokohama—he did not tell me that his father, at the suggestion of Mr. Burke or Mr. Newsom, had made pre<lb/>paration for his going there—I did not hear from either Mr. Burke or Mr. Newsom that he had—I suggested some place to him where he could see the Brazilian papers, that was with a view of his obtaining any information he might want—I did not tell him that at New York I should be able to introduce, him to some of my friends—I suggested that I might be able to do so conditionally, upon his satisfying his employers as to the state of his accounts—that was about the end of June—it was after the 15th June when he signed the document which he called his death warrant—I most likely gave him an advertisement of the route—there are entries in the</p>

               <p>cash-book of goods received from his father in respect to this money; they are not the prisoner's entries; they are all subsequent to the signing of the document spoken of—an estimate of the amount has been made—I should say it amounts to between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., consisting of tea warrants, policy of insurance, debts owing, and harmoniums, watch and chain, &amp; c.—the entries are Mr. Burke's writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a summary of them; they are all credited; the prisoner was not present at the time they were credited to him; that was prior to his being given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These things were credited against the general deficiency—the 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not represent the total deficiency, it would be about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, of this firm alone; there was also a deficiency in the liquidation of the old firm—the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went against his general deficiency—he did not tell me anything about the tea warrants—I find entries in the ledger by the prisoner after April and May, 1871—the books have been balanced once after that date; they could not be correctly balanced, if omissions are made, no one could do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">CHARLES RUTHERFORD</hi>. I am partner of Mr. Baird—I have been engaged in going through the books of the firm—I had a conversation with the prisoner, about 18th March, as to the subject of his deficiency and the accounts of the firm—a large deficiency had been discovered at that time—Mr. Newsom spoke to him for a very long time in his private room, urging him to confess the deficiency, and so save us further trouble in the investigation—he said "I can't confess because to do so would be to confess to an untruth, and I say in the sight of God, "or "I call God to witness"—I am not sure of the precise words—"I have not had one penny or one farthing of your money"—reference was made to the sums that were then shown as deficient in the cash-book, which amounted to the somewhat singular sum of 1111<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that was subsequently corrected, but it forms part of the 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 8th April, I was present at a further conversation with the prisoner and Messrs. Newsom &amp; Burke, in their private-room—he was asked to account for two specific sums of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into the bank—he said "Oh, I can't account for them, for their not being credited; but have you traced the notes?"—he was told there was no use in fencing any longer about it, that Mr. Burke had been to the bank—after a good deal of sparring and fencing the prisoner said "I suppose I must have had the money"—he said "I have securities to a very large amount, I have private property, and I will not only make good the whole amount of my deficiency, but I will pay for the expense of the investigation of the accounts"—he said he had property at Dorking, in the hands of the London and County Bank, which was in the joint names of himself and his uncle, Mr. Kilner—he spoke of his property as about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 13th April I saw the prisoner in the presence of his father and Mr. Newsom at his father's house, in Goswell Road, very late in the evening, I believe it was after 12 o'clock—the prisoner had not been at the office for three or four days, and Mr. Newsom and I went to his father's house and saw him there—his father said that he must make restitution of all the property that he could, that he, the father, could not do anything himself, otherwise he would do so; but that his son must give up all the property he had—his father asked him what property he had—he said some tea warrants and some jewellery, and a harmonium there, which he pointed out—his father said "Well, will you give up your watch and chain"—he said yes, he would on Monday—he said "Give it now, "and he took it out of his pocket and handed it to Mr.</p>

               <p>Newsom, who returned it to the father—I said to Mr. Newsom, "I don't think you need have any hesitancy in taking it, seeing his father is willing that you should have it, as it has been purchased with your money, "and Mr. Newsom did keep it—I believe these things were credited at their full value—the prisoner said that on the following Monday he would make out a list of all that he had, and hand it over to Messrs. Newsom &amp; Burke—I believe he did make out a list, and property was given up estimated at 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it has not been realised; that was partly the estimate of the firm and partly ours; as regards the warrants it was the estimate of the firm entirely—the total deficiency in round numbers is, I should say, within tens of pounds of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I mean nearly 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of this firm alone, not the old firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The old firm made a composition—I believe the harmo<lb/>nium is entered at 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe that was what it realised—I dont know whether Mr. Burke is here; I have not seen him for some time—he was present at one of the conversations—he did not say in my presence that if the prisoner would hand over what he had they would not take any proceedings against him—I don't know why he is not here—I think Mr. Wontner asked at the Mansion House where Mr. Burke was—I don't think Sir Sidney Waterlow asked for him—Mr. Newsom and I did not go to the prisoner's father to see what we could get; we went to ascertain where he was, and if there was any truth in his statement respecting the private property which he said he had—Mr. Newsom did not in my presence ask the father to insure his life for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; something was said about insuring the father's life or the son's life—it was not said that the prisoner would give up all he had and the father would pay the difference—no doubt the prisoner was to give up all he had; probably it was suggested that he should raise the deficiency among his friends—the list of property we made out amounted to 714<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the whole deficiency was not known at that time; I don't know that we have found out the last item yet—up to 5th June, it was over 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we found out large items after that, before the prisoner was given into custody—he was not assisting me in making up the books on 15th July—he was present, I was not; my partner was—I had audited the accounts up to June, 1871—many of these items would be included in that audit—I looked at the green cash-book; I noticed items struck out, but those were explained—the cash-book was made up to the 30th June—it was not made up subsequently—it was about the end of August that 1 balanced up to 30th June—I saw at the time that I made that audit that the cash-book did not go any further than June—I mentioned it to the firm, and urged upon them and the prisoner that the cash-book should be made-up and balanced monthly, and the prisoner promised that it should be—I found that had not been carried out, and that the firm had not had any balance since June.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I audited I relied on the fair cash-book being correct, and also the ledger—I did not go through the rough cash-cook at all; I simply compared, as I was instructed to do, the amounts paid into the bank as shown by the fair cash-book and the banker's pass-book, and they agreed—the books tallied and justified one another—none of the amounts were entered twice over in the rough cash-book—I have gone into the prisoners accounts with the old firm, and found them largely deficient.</p>

               <p>prisoner has been in the service of that and the previous firm seven or eight years—at the time he was given into custody, on 15th July, his salary was, I think, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was confidential clerk and ledger-keeper—it was his duty to keep the books, the rough cash-book, the fair cash-book, and the ledger—on the receipt of moneys, he made entries first in the rough cash-book, then in the fair cash-book, and afterwards debited the accounts in the ledger—on 27th April, 1871, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to us by Sentence &amp; Co.; on 12th May, 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the same firm; and on 13th May, 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by Mr. Howgate—those sums were never accounted for to me by the prisoner—in the beginning of the present year, his books were very much in arrear—I spoke to him on the subject, and accountants were after<lb/>wards called in to go through the books, the prisoner remaining in our service—in March I had a long conversation with the prisoner, lasting five or six hours; the whole time he strongly asserted his innocence—I pressed him very hard indeed to confess what he had really taken, and be said "I solemnly swear in the sight of God I have not had a farthing, "and I said "If you can say that, you had better leave the place at once"—on 13th April I went with Mr. Rutherford to the prisoner's father's house—I think the prisoner had not been at the office for several days—previous to seeing the prisoner we had an interview with the father, detailing the circumstances of the case, and when the prisoner came in his father interrogated him on the point, and he confessed to having taken the moneys—his father said, "What is this that you have done"—he was rather vague in his answer, and I said "Now, Lake, tell the whole truth"—the exact answer he made I really forget, but he admitted taking the money—the father turned to him and said "Give up that watch"—he said he would do so on Monday; but his father took it from him and handed it to me, and I kept it—he said that he had tea warrants which he would give an account of on Monday, and the father said he should be in attendance on Monday morning to do so—I know of the balance of 1230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being worked out—I was not present when the prisoner made the entry in the book—I found a large number of racing telegrams in his desk—they were produced in Court, but were mislaid—I have looked for them and cannot find them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I discharged him, I think, in March—I can't say the date exactly—it was not before the conversation with his father; I am sure of that—it was before the watch and chain were given up; I don't know whether it was in January, February, March, or April—I don't know whether Mr. Burke is here or not; he is in London—I heard you ask for him on the former trial, and I heard Mr. Wontner ask for him at the Police Court—I don't think Sir Sidney Waterlow asked for him; he asked if he was there—he took an active part in the matter—I am not aware that he made all the entries in this book about the receipt of the property—he received the amounts; I received nothing but the watch and chain and A' ring—the prisoner's father called on me several times—I did not tell him that if it would be any comfort to him and his daughters he might tell them that no proceedings would be taken—something was said about his son going away, and he said to me "Will you get him off?"—I said "I can't say so; but, if he will do his duty now, I will do the best I can with Mr. Burke, but Mr. Burke is determined to prosecute"—I did not say what his duty was, but my idea was that he should show where he had altered the accounts—the circumstances have been much aggravated since—I had not been speaking to the father about the property; I swear that—this</p>

               <p>interview was on the Sunday, as the prisoner said he would bring the list of the property on the Monday—the prisoner remained till 15th July, when he was given into custody—we had then got from him all the property mentioned in this list; I don't know whether it included his school books—Mr. Burke received the property—Mr. Lake's visit to my house was some weeks prior to the prisoner being given into custody—items were being continually found out in the interval—Mr. Rutherford audited the accounts in June, 1871—I don't recollect his telling me that there ought to be a monthly audit; he said the books were not kept up—I did not after that see that they were kept up; I presume Mr. Burke did—I was very much surprised to find they were not kept up—we have always been in the habit of calling in an accountant to audit our books at our half-yearly balance—the fair cash-book should be a copy of the rough—I never looked over it.</p>

I live at Rotherham—I am clerk to Mr. Coward, solicitor, of that place—the defendant called at our office in October, 1869, and I have seen him several times since—when he called in October, Mrs. Bailey was with him—Mr. Hoyland, an articled clerk, was also present—Mr. Coward was up stairs in his own room—it would be about the middle of October—Mr. Coward was engaged with a gentleman, and the defendant and Miss. Bailey remained in the office for about twenty minutes or half-an-hour before I went up to Mr. Coward—I had a good opportunity of seeing them during that time—the other clerk was there part of the time—after the gentleman had gone I fetched Mr. Coward down as the old lady was not able to walk up stairs; she was very feeble—Mr. Coward came down and asked their business—Davis said "She has come to make her will; she is to leave all her property to me, and I am to take care of her as long as she lives"—Mr. Coward then asked her whether she had any relations—she made no reply—Davis said she had some relations, but they lived some distance away—Mr. Coward said she was in such an imbecile state that he should decline to make her will; they then left the office—the old lady did not speak at all; she was asked questions, but she appeared to be in a</p>

               <p>perfectly helpless, imbecile state, quite unconscious of anything—it was between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day when they came—the whole con<lb/>versation took place in my presence—Hoyland heard part, but he went away to his dinner before they left—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man that came—I never saw either of them before—I saw Davis again at the first trial in Westminster Hall, in February, 1871—when he was at the office he said "I live at Masboro'"—I was present at the trial, but I did not hear him examined—I was not in Court—I have not heard where he lives—he gave his address as Masboro'—he did not say where the old lady lived—I have no interest in this matter—I was merely subpoenaed to prove these facts as the attorney's clerk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the trial—I was never asked the question with reference to the defendant having said that he resided at Masboro'—I was examined at the Police Court before Mr. Arnold, but the question was not put to me there—this is the first time I have stated it—I never saw Mr. Davis till I saw him at the office in October, 1869, and I did not see him again till 1871, at Westminster—he described where the property was—it was about the middle of October when they came, it would be before the 21st—I have not heard that Mr. Coward fixed the date as a particular day when one of his articled clerks went to Leeds for the purpose of having his preliminary examination—I came up to London on both trials—I did not hear a person named Salmon examined on the second trial—I saw him there—I know to whom you refer—he was a client of Mr. Coward's—he had been to Mr. Coward's on one or two occasions—I was asked whether he had ever been to Mr. Coward's office, and I said he had been on other business—I was not asked whether I had made a mistake, and that the person who brought the old lady was Salmon, and not the defendant—Salmon was brought into Court, and I was asked whether I had seen him before, and I said yes, that I knew him well—Davis was not asked to stand up—I was asked whether I had seen Davis, and I said "Yes," but he was not put up in the Court before me—Mr. Coward came down to the office to see the prisoner and the old lady—Hoyland was there when Mr. Coward came down—the old lady seemed unable to speak, and to all appearance unconscious—she did not reply to any questions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The clerk would have made an entry if any business had been transacted—I believe the man said his name was Davis—I heard no other name; except that the name of Davis was made use of, my mind is a blank—I asked the parties who they were, the man answered "Her name is Mrs. Bailey, and my name is Davis"—Williams, Mr. Hoyland, and I another think clerk were there—Mr. Hoyland is here—the other clerk is not, that I know of—this matter was not called to my attention in any shape or form for eighteen months afterwards—I did not say that it occurred on a day when my clerk went to Leeds to pass his examination—I did not get to the Court in time at the first trial—I arrived just as Lord Penzance had commenced summing-up—the Jury retired to deliberate, and during that time I was in conversation with some of the counsel, and Dr. Tristram asked me if I thought I could fix the date, and I said it was some time about when Mr. Hoyland was going up for his examination—I have not since found out that that was on 28th October—I have not investigated the case at all—I was in time for the second trial, and I was also before the Magistrate.</p>

I live at Park Gate, and am a moulder—I was examined at the trial in the Probate Court in March this year—on a Friday in Febru<lb/>ary, 1870, I saw Mrs. Bailey at the Masboro' Railway Station—it was three or four days before her death—she seemed very weak and feeble—I went with her to Mr. Coward's office—she said to me "I am so glad to see you Mr. Salmon; I shall come to your house, and I will live and die with you, and what I have got you shall have, and I will go to Mr. Coward's office to make the will, "and we went direct from there to Mr. Coward's—we walked there—it was about 1 o'clock when we got there; it was something like a mile—she walked there with me—I went in there, and told William the clerk what I had got to do—he told us to sit down, and the old lady sat down in the chair—Mr. Coward was engaged, some gentleman was with him—we waited some twenty minutes, and when this gentleman came down I went up to see Mr. Coward—he said "Salmon, I advise you to have</p>

               <p>nothing to do with it, "and I am very glad that I took his advice and had nothing to do with it—when we came down, the old lady was dozing to sleep like—she went with me to the College Inn—she wanted some re<lb/>freshment and I gave her some, and I took a cab and took her to Park Gate, to my son-in-law's, and she slept there—she got a little worse next day, and I got an order and took her to the workhouse on the Saturday night—I heard of her death on the Wednesday, as she died on the Tuesday—I left the neighbourhood before I knew of any dispute about the property, and resided at Darlington—I was there twelve months, and then came back to Rotherham, when I was asked to give evidence on the case; that was after the first trial—I gave ray evidence in the Probate Court last March—I went to Mr. Edwards first—I had not heard anything about the old lady going to Mr. Coward's office until I was at Mr. Edwards'—it was not about the will that I went to him, but on other business, and he asked me to come to give evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I was the last witness in the case—it was on the Friday before her death that I went with her to Mr. Coward's—she had not any home then—I picked her up at the railway station, knowing her so well—she said she was turned out altogether, and clung round me and would not loose me—she had not been drinking—she looked as if she wanted some one to take care of her—Mr. Coward knew me well; he had done business with me—I did not say my name was Davis; I did not know Davis at that time—I was then residing at Park Gate; that is not at Masboro'—I did not say that I was living at Masboro'—I went up stairs into Mr. Coward's room—a clerk showed me up—I can't say positively whether it was a younger clerk or whether it was William, that is Mr. Williams (<hi rend="italic">pointing him out</hi>)—I can't speak to the other gentlemen—I knew Mr. Williams perfectly well by going there to do business—I got paid for going to the Probate Court—I expect to be paid for coming here—I was paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. something for going to the Probate Court, besides my expenses—I am a moulder, and get 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Newsom, Burke &amp; Co., wholesale tea merchants, in Great Tower Street—the pri<lb/>soner was in our service as confidential clerk and ledger keeper—he kept the books, received money and passed it in to the bank; it was his duty to add up the sums; he had to pay in and enter the particulars in the coun<lb/>terfoils; the credit slip would agree with it, and be sent to the bank with the money—the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sent by Mr. T. C. Newsom would be proper to be entered as one of the sums to be paid in on 1st March as well as the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Bradford, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Briscomb—that 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has not been accounted for in any way, nor the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 22nd March—I was present at a conversation with the prisoner on 18th March, when he called God to witness that he had not taken any money of the firm—on 8th April he was called on to account for these two sums; he at first said "I know nothing about them;" I then said "Do not tell any more untruths about it, here is your own handwriting, unless you confess at once I shall give you into custody." (<hi rend="italic">The Court decided that what was said by the prisoner upon this could not be received</hi>). I have been quite unable to trace these two sums in any way; they have not been accounted for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner's father on a Saturday, I don't know the date, and he gave me a watch and chain—the prisoner promised to make out a list by the following Monday of goods which were afterwards received chiefly by Mr. Burke—I am not aware that Mr. Burke is here—the goods ultimately received amounted to somewhere about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the father came to me on the Sunday—I did not tell him I would not pro<lb/>secute—I said my partner was determined to prosecute him—I said I would do what I could with my partner—I did not try to get the father to pay the rest; I am not aware that Mr. Burke did—I did not try to get him to get money from his friends, or to insure his life, I never heard of it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230022"/>
               <p>—I never heard of it before yesterday—I am sure Mr. Burke never pro<lb/>mised that if they would pay over all they had, he would not prosecute—Mr. Finch is still in our employment; he has been sent for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Burke is a party to this prosecution—the prisoner's father keeps a small grocer's shop—I went to his house with Mr. Ruther<lb/>ford on 13th April, the prisoner had not been to our premises for some few days; we had some communication with the father, and afterwards saw the prisoner in his father's presence—it was at the father's instance that I took the watch and chain, I refused at first—we determined to prosecute the day we gave him into custody, 15th July, from various circumstances which we thought very much aggravated the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the prosecutors' service, and have been so since April, 1866—in the event of my receiving any money I should enter it in the rough cash-book if the cashier, Mr. Lake, happened to be out at dinner—this entry of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st March, 1872, is in my handwriting—the mark against it shows that it was composed of notes—I should keep the notes till the prisoner came in—I should say I gave them to him; I am sure of it—it would be my duty to make the entry, and then hand over the notes to the cashier when he came in—I know nothing further about that 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner would make out the counterfoil and credit slip—on 22nd March I find an entry of "Bradford 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Briscomb 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that is my writing, it consisted of notes—I should do the same with those as I did with the others—I very often came before the prisoner in the morning—one of the partners would open the letters—if the prisoner was not there at the time, probably the things would be given to me to enter—the two first entries on these two Occasions appear to have been entered by me—I can say that I did not misappropriate these sums.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After so long a time, I could not, of course, say whether I gave them to the prisoner—I should say that I gave them to him most certainly—I would sometimes take on to the bank a slip made out by the prisoner; it was always made out by him—it was not sometimes made out by one of the partners or myself; chiefly by the prisoner; it was his duty to do it—I never made out a slip at that time; I have since—it was not my duty to make out the slip—as to this 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one of the partners would have opened the letter and handed the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over to me—it would be Mr. T. C. Newsom—no—it would be Mr. Burke—he would open the letter and hand me the money, and I should keep it till the prisoner came—either Mr. Burke or Mr. E. B. Newsom, whoever came first would do so—I did not make any entry of the numbers of the notes, nor was any made by the partners—I should say either Mr. Burke or Mr. E. B. Newsom handed me over the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. C. T. Newsom being away in the country at the time; they always opened the letters, not the prisoner—I often took money to the bank before that time; perhaps once or twice a week, perhaps three times—if the partner handed money, to me to take on to the bank, I should take it on—I should make an entry in the green-book before I took it on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did it in self-defence. My intention was to take the child where she would get properly treated and made clean, to go away on the following Sunday. I was mending her boots, and the woman wanted to put her to bed. I said "Don't put her to bed, I am going to take her away to-night"—(the woman had given me notice to quit, because she had found out that I had taken another lodging). The prosecutor said "Are you, you b—, you shall not go away without a broken head, that is what I will let you have; I have an iron-arm here that will do it; I have let many a man have it." I had this iron hook in my hand, and threw it to keep them from me, and it caught him on the side of the head. I was not going away myself that night, but I wanted to take the child away because she was not properly treated. The prosecutor and his wife were the real cause of it. I never thought of doing such a thing. If the prosecutor had not commenced the attack upon me it never would have happened. The hammer was never in my hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a fireman on 3rd August, in charge of the escape stationed at the corner of Liverpool Street opposite King's Cross Station, between four and five minutes' run from the Britannia—on the Saturday morning between 3.50 and 3.55 I received a call—I went at once with my escape to the Britannia—I noticed smoke issuing from underneath</p>

               <p>the window and the doors of the bar; the door's were shut—I saw a light in the top floor window and I pitched my escape right under that window and I was in the act of going up when the constable told me I could get up the staircase—I then found that the side door was open—I took one of the lamps off the escape and went in and up the staircase to see if there were any inmates—I went into the prisoner's bedroom and there I found him and his wife ready dressed and a child lying on the bed undressed, fast asleep—that was the room where I had seen the light, the second floor front—I said it was rather a curious game to see his child lying a-bed fast asleep like that and his house on fire, and I was in the act of taking the child off the bed when the wife said she would carry it down—the prisoner made no reply to what I said; he seemed perfectly calm and cool about everything; all the dress that he was minus of was his cap—I then went into the ser<lb/>vant's bed room on the same floor, the next room, I found her, as I thought, fully dressed—there was an infant lying in her bed fast asleep—I took hold of it and brought it down and gave it to a stranger or a policeman; it was undressed, in its nightgown—I did not see the lodgers at that time—when I came down the firemen had arrived, the volunteers came first—after I had moved my escape to the opposite side of the road, I walked back and found they had got the cellar-flap up, and had a branch down there working from a stand-pipe—I remained until the fire was put out—I examined the pre<lb/>mises as far as I could—I noticed a quantity of paraffin or petroleum or some other kind of mineral oil on the top of one of the casks in the cellar, right under the funnel-hole which communicates with the taproom; the cask was standing on its end, the oil was on the head of the cask, not in anything—there was a very strong smell of this oil in the cellar, but I was a long time before I could find out where it was, the smoke was so dense—I afterwards went into the taproom with Mr. Bridges, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, and the officer, and there we found a quantity of wood shavings strewed all over the taproom, but the greater part was just round about the funnel-hole—there was a very strong smell of this oil in the taproom, the shavings were saturated with it; and there were stains on the wainscoting partition about two thirds of the way up.</p>

I am the officer in charge of the Metro<lb/>politan Fire Brigade at Farringdon Street—at about 4.54 on Sunday morning, 4th August, I was called by a policeman in a cab to go to the Britannia public-house; I went immediately—the Volunteer Fire Brigade had arrived at that time, and had been pumping with a portable hydrant—I went in at the street-door, and went first into the taproom—I observed a considerable quantity of shavings on the floor of that room—they were smouldering in two distinct places—there was a very strong smell of paraffin—I at once took up the shavings and smelt them; they smelt of paraffin of some description—I should say there had been a great quantity of paraffin upon them—they were wet, but, of course, water had been poured upon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230029"/>
               <p>them as well—I examined all the shavings in different parts of the room, and they all smelt of paraffin—the wooden partition had streams of wet oil in one or two places—I put my hand on it, and drew the oil from it—that was a boarding against the wall, 4 or 5 feet high—there were settles attached to the walls, and the greater part of them were covered with paraffin, and some had splashed on to the sawdust—there was also a quantity of paraffin on the table, and a large empty sack was nearly half saturated with it—there was nearly a sackful of shavings about the room, and many of them were burnt—the door between the taproom and bar being shut, there was no draught—the wooden panellings in the corner behind the tap-room door were considerably burnt; they had most certainly blazed—I then went into the cellar—there had been more fire there by a great deal than there had been in the taproom—there were consumed shavings on the floor; some partly burnt, and some not burnt—they were principally in the back cellar, the spirit cellar, immediately under the taproom—there is a funnel-hole about the size of a crown-piece communicating between the cellar and taproom, for the purpose of pouring 'spirits down—the taproom floor forms the ceiling of the cellar; it is only flooring, joisting—by the quantity consumed, I should say there were more shavings in the cellar than in the taproom; there would be at least a sackful—the staircase or passage, about 8 or 10 feet in length, leading from the ground floor to the cellar was else strewn with shavings—there was a smell of paraffin in the cellar, but not quite so strong as in the taproom—the ceiling was charred, but not to a great extent—the cellar is about 6 1/2 feet in height—on one of the casks, which was lying on its <hi rend="italic">belly</hi>, there was a mound of sawdust and burnt shavings deeply saturated with paraffin, that was nearly consumed—I found an empty two-gallon stone bottle in the cellar which smelt very strongly of paraffin—I poured some into my hand; there were three or four table-spoonsful of paraffin, or a little more, left in the bottom—I should say there had been two distinct fires in the taproom, but not enough to clearly swear by, and one fire in the cellar distinct from the taproom fire—I am quite sure of that—I saw the prisoner shortly afterwards next door—I told him that the circumstances were very curious, and asked if he had had any repairs done lately, or could he in any manner account for the shavings—he made no reply at first, but he ultimately said, within a minute or two, that he had carried some through the previous evening into the back place, and he might have dropped some—I called his attention to the shavings more particularly in the taproom—he said he could not account for them—I asked who was the last in the place—he said he was—I think he said he went to bed about 1 o'clock—I took a cursory view of the stock; I did not see closely into it—I saw that all the spirit casks were empty; I should say there were about eight or nine in the cellar—the one on which the little mound had been was charred—I went up stairs with the inspector and the prisoner; he accompanied us through the house—a bed was pointed out to me in the front room second floor—the prisoner said that was his bed where he had slept, and a person drew my attention to the fact that only one person had lain in it—I noticed only the impression of one person—I put my fist on the bed to see if it was one—that would give an impression of a person lying on it, and my fist went into it; it was an ordinary soft bed—I told the prisoner the facts did not look as if he had slept there—he made no reply that I know of—I saw a cask standing on its top in the cellar—it is a mistake of the last witness; it was not paraffin on that, it was water</p>

               <p>that he had lain there—I went downstairs and spoke to Mr. Bridges, and then came up again to the same room—the prisoner and his wife were then both on the bed, at least his wife was lying on the bed, and he was leaning half on and half off the bed—I told him that everything was very sus<lb/>picious, and as he could give no account as to how the fire originated, I considered it my duty to take him into custody for wilfully setting fire to the house, there being other persons therein at the time—he made no reply—he took the policy of insurance out of his coat pocket, and handed it to his wife, and I took charge of it—I produce it.

               <p>must get fresh lodgings; that was about a fortnight before the male prisoner was taken up—she said she would take it, and she did take it to the hospital; she did not leave it there—I did not speak to her more than once about it; she said it was in a decline—the man used to be very good to the child in regard of giving it little nourishments—I have seen the woman unkind to it, shaking it, and swearing, and saying she wished it was dead—she used to go out in the daytime and come home very late at night; 11 or 12 o'clock—the man always used to have the child in the daytime; he took it out; he used to come home about 7 or 8 o'clock and get the child tea, and they used to go to bed—he fed it; he always set it down at the table with him, and when they were having their victuals together they would set the child in the middle of them, and it had what they had; but the woman was a very cruel mother; she would take and shake the poor little dear—it was very bad when they came to my place, very sickly—I don't know what the man did—he used to go out of a morning and come home in the middle of the day, and go out again with the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13 and 14, Flower and Dean Street—the prisoners lived there as man and wife—I don't know how they got their living—the man went out in the daytime and took the child with him—I never knew him to do any work—the woman used to go out in the course of the day, and we did not see her again till 10, 11, or 12 o'clock at night, sometimes—the day before he was taken into custody, when he came home he said "I very nearly got into a deal of trouble about the child"—I said "What trouble?"—he said "Being taken up with the child"—I said "Certainly, and serve you right for taking the child out; it is in a dying state, "and he said "I will not take, it out anymore"—next morning I heard him say to his wife that he would not take it out—she said he should, and she swore at him; he put on his cap and coat and went out, and she followed him out with the child in her arms, and I never saw any more of them—that was about 10 or 11 o'clock in the day—I have spoken to her about the illness of the child, and told her that Mrs. Smith said she should not stop unless she took it to the hospital, and with a great deal to do she took it once to the hospital—the child appeared to be in a very bad state—I thought all along that it would not live, it looked dying—she was not altogether a good mother to it, the man treated it well; in regard of buying it little nourishments, eggs, and a little wine, and arrowroot, and stewed eels, and any little thing the child would eat; he was very kind to it, but as for the mother I can say nothing for her—I have not seen her give it food, without they were sitting together; but she gave no attention to it—they seemed to have comfortable food—I think the child was greatly neglected before this man took to the child; I don't think it was kept without food.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness here pointed out on a model the position of the swing bridge, the wicket gate, and the lock gates.</hi>) I ran across the lock gates with the buoy—there are three iron chains on the bridge, with stanchions about 3 feet 2 inches high.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter—I lived with him and my late mother at 19, Cable Street—on Saturday night, 10th August, I got home between 11 and 12 o'clock, and saw my mother standing by the street door; the prisoner was in the kitchen—I had not seen my mother strike him, but he got up and said that if she struck him again he would strike her with the shovel, which he was picking up at the time; and he got up and struck her with it on the right side of her head, I think, but I cannot tell for certain; I know it was on the top of her head—she put her hand up to her head and said "Oh, my God!" but she did not fall—no blood flowed from the blow—it was with the flat part of the shovel, not the sharp</p>

I am a chimney-sweep, and lived in the same house with the prisoner and my late mother—on Saturday, 10th August, I came home and saw my mother and his daughter, the last witness, standing in the shop, and the prisoner standing in the kitchen, the door of which opens into the shop—he could hear what passed between me and my mother—I said "What is the matter?"—she said "Nothing"—I said "If you go to bed, open the back door and I will come in at the back, "and when I came in again they were in the kitchen, and they followed me—I lit a candle and walked up stairs into the top back room and then walked down on to the next landing, and heard the prisoner using language which is not fit for publication—I did not see him do anything to my mother nor did she in his presence make any complaint, but she showed me her on the Sunday, and I saw a small dent which you might lay your finger in—I could not see whether the skin was out or broken, but seemed to be a white rim round it—it was not bleeding—she afterwards complained of dizziness and flashings across her eyes—she saw Mr. Low, a doctor, and had two bottles of medicine from him—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi> (M. R. C. S.) On 20th August I was called to the deceased and found her partially insensible and paralysed on the right side—she recognised me, but she could not articulate distinctly—she was not able to make any statement to me as to the cause of her illness—my attention was not then called to any injury on her head, and I did not look for it—I saw her on Wednesday and twice on Thursday and on Friday—when I went again she was dead—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found no injury on the body, but there was a mark of a recently healed wound on the left side, very near the centre of the head—it had apparently been a contused wound—on opening the scalp there was a congested and inflamed patch of imflammation under the external mark, and a corresponding one on the pericranium or covering of the skull—there was no mark on the internal surface of the skull, but under the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and directly under the external mark there was a large clot of blood on the surface of the brain—she was an immensely fat woman—there was a layer of 3 or 4 inches of fat over her bowels—all the organs were moderately health; the liver was rather congested and the spleen was large—the heart was quite healthy—there was a tendency to a deposition of fat in all the organs; a tendency to fatty degeneracy—her death arose from extravasation of blood on the brain—that would not be caused by the injury, but it would predispose to the formation of the clot—the mark was evidently from some external cause, and it must have been caused by some violence, which, in such a subject, would predispose to the formation of that clot of blood—there being an interval of nine days, it prevents my being so positive; if she became paralysed immediately on the receipt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230043"/>
               <p>of the blow, I should say that that was the cause; but during those nine days I cannot say what happened, because she died from apoplexy, which is pressure of blood on the brain—the complaint of dizziness of the head and eyes would lead me to come to the cause of the injury, but it is only an opinion—my idea is that there was an injury received which set up an injury or congestion of the vessels underneath, and some after cause might cause the blood to form, such as a violent fall, or another blow, or great excitement—there was undoubtedly mischief set up in her head, and if she had lain up and not attended to business, the chances are that it would have become absorbed—the predisposing cause was, I should say, the injury received.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the principal clerks in the Savings Bank Department of the Post Office—if a person wished to withdraw a sum of money from the Savings Bank the first thing would be to obtain a notice of withdrawal, which can be had at any post office—he would then write on that notice the name of the office at which his book was obtained and the number of the book, fill in the amount he required, and give the name of the office at which he wished to receive the money—he would then sign the notice and give his address where he wished the warrant to be sent to him—that notice would be received at the head-office, and the signature would he compared with the signature to the declaration made when the account was opened, and, if correct, his account would be debited with the amount, and the warrant sent to him, and, at the same time, an advice would be sent to the office of payment—this notice was sent to the Post Office in August, and this is the warrant and advice made out in consequence—the notice of withdrawal applies for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the warrant is for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the advice also—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230044"/>
               <p>the signature to the notice was compared and found to be correct—on the same day a notice was also sent to the Post Office for the sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these are the advice and warrant, and they were sent on the same day to the same office—this is a correct copy of the prisoner's account—it shows that there was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to his account on that day, and he draws out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so that the account was not closed—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be entered before the warrant was sent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in charge of the High Street Branch Post Office, Notting Hill—the prisoner made this declaration before me on 6th January last; he signed it in my presence—a savings bank book was then issued to him—at that time he lived at 40, Kensington Place, and since that at 2, Palmerston Street, Notting Hill Gate—the number of the book is 4476—on the 22nd August I received this letter of advice, "Pay to Middleton 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I also received a letter of advice to pay Harriet Baker, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were put into a pigeon-hole—they are always put in one place—Miss Crockford is also a clerk in the office—about 10.45 she brought me the book and the warrant—I went to the counter and saw the prisoner—I compared the signature on the warrant with that inside the cover of his book—after the warrant issued from the office gets into the hands of the prisoner he is required to put his name to it as the form of receipt for the money—I found his name there, and compared it with the signature in his book—I found they corresponded, and I took up the advice which I thought Miss Crockford had laid down for me, as she generally used to do so, and put it over the warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—upon looking at the advice I found it was for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I paid the prisoner that amount with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, half a sovereign, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I took it from the ordinary till—I put down the date and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the prisoner's book, and signed my name against it—I stamped it, showing that that money had been paid in reduction of the account—I laid the money on the counter in front of the prisoner—there is a brass network in front, between me and the customer—I laid the net: down first and counted the gold and silver on to it—he took it up, and returned him the deposit-book—I put the warrant and letter of advice together on the file with the paid warrants; that is the ordinary course—there was no one on my side of the counter at that time—Miss Crockfond was doing her work at the other end of the counter—Mr. Taylor was on the public side; he could see all that was done; he was waiting to cash a money order—there was a telegraph messenger there—in the course of the day Harriet Baker came for her money, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid her—I looked for her letter of advice and found it on the file with the warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; nearly at the bottom of the file—I think it was between 4 and 5 o'clock that she came in—a short time after that I proceeded to make up my accounts and found I was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. short—on looking into the matter I found the letter of advice for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pigeon hole—it had not been taken out at all—the warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was alone on the file, and the advice in the pigeon hole—I went to the prisoner's house, but he was not at home—I "was going a second time, but Mr. Taylor came after me and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230045"/>
               <p>said would he go, if I was afraid, and I was to follow—I saw him bring Middleton out, and I went back—Taylor brought him into the office—I asked him what money I gave him in the morning—he said "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said "What else?"—he said "My book"—I said "What else did I give you?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "Yes, I did; I gave you a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, half a sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver"—he said "I am quite sure you did no such thing"—I said "I have a witness to prove that I did do so"—he said "lam quite sure you have not"—I had sent for a constable—he came in, and I repeated the questions again—I said "Have you got your book in your pocket"—he replied "No, I have burnt it"—I said "Why did you burn it?'—he said "Because, I had no more money in"—I said "That is not the reason, you have burnt it because you saw the entry I had made in it"—he replied "I have seen no entry"—I said "I have a witness to prove that you had the money, "and then I pointed to Taylor, and said "That is my witness"—Taylor said "I saw you take the money; it is no use denying it, and I will go into any court of justice and swear that you had it"—the prisoner said" Is that what you have brought me here for Joe; I am sur<lb/>prised at you"—the policeman refused to take him into custody, and I took out a summons—the prisoner said he had burnt the book because there was no more money in—there would be a shilling left, and he would not be able to obtain that without producing the book—there was only one figure different in the numbers of the two warrants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The defendant said "I declare to my God I never received more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" and he also said the policeman might search him—I can't say how many entries there were in his book; I should not look at the former entries—they are all-on one page—this is a correct copy of his book—he paid in 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on January 6th—I merely signed the book, and I did not notice that he had only got 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—there is not a single sovereign down except the first item—there is not a single entry for a sovereign of money drawn out; I say, in the face of that, that such a mistake might arise—I don't look at the depositor's book except for his name—if I had seen that he only had 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I should not have paid him what I did—I was busy at the time—I might have paid out 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day in small sums—when I paid Baker I thought there was some mistake, but I did not find it out till made up my accounts—I had filed the wrong warrant, and I took it off the file again, but I was not certain till I balanced my accounts in the evening—I was afraid I had paid it, but I was not sure; it was some hours afterwards—I did not know that I had paid any one too much until after I had balanced my accounts—I did not know that I had paid any customer 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. who had presented a warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew Taylor, as a neighbour, as long as I have been in the office, nearly three years—I did not know the prisoner, only by his coming in—I went to the prisoner's house first and then I went to Taylor—I asked him if he knew who he was speaking to in the office in the morning, and he said he knew perfectly well—Taylor is a hairdresser; I don't know what the prisoner is—I asked Taylor if he knew what money I gave him—he said "Yes, you gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some gold and silver"—I heard Taylor say, at the Police Court, that he heard me count out the money to the prisoner: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, but he corrected himself afterwards—he said he heard me count out the sovereigns in that way, but on the instant he said "I was wrong, it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold"—I recollected that I had paid a note when the circumstance came before me and I came to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230046"/>
               <p>remember—I did not take the number of the note—before we went to the Police Court Taylor said that I had given a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked Taylor, for my own satisfaction, to know if any one else really knew what I had given; I knew that I had done it before I went to Taylor—a corporal of the tele<lb/>graph boys was at the office in morning when the prisoner and Taylor were there—I can't say whether Taylor or the prisoner come in first; I don't know—I can't say how long Taylor was there; the prisoner was there two or three minutes, while the entry was made—he went out first—I did not make any entry on the sheet till the close of business in the evening—I copy the amounts from the letters of advice—I made the entries on the sheet before I balanced—I entered on the sheet a payment of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Middle<lb/>ton from the warrant—the thought did not strike me that I had given this man too much until I balanced my accounts—Taylor said, "I am quite sure if you did pay him he will give it you again;" that he was a very respectable man, and he thought he was not quite sober at the time; that he might have taken it not knowing what he had, and he would certainly return it if he had it—that was what Taylor said of Middleton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I make these sheets up at the close of the day—the red ink marks are the corrections by the Post Office—the entry "Middleton, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., "is scratched out because I did not send the warrant—presuming it was right I placed the money down with the intention that he should take it up—I had not power to part with money belonging to the Post Office—this money did belong to the Post Office—I should not have paid him the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I had known the warrant was for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I found Baker's letter of advice on the file I concluded that I had put it there improperly.</p>

I allowed him to stop on the floor all night because it was a wet night, and it is only waste-paper that we burn in the furnace, and I can assure you we burn lots of it; it is no use to us at all"—I advised him to go quietly to the station, which he did—I said to Moseley "How came you in possession of the wood?"—he said "Oh, I brought the watchman his supper, and it being a wet night he asked me to sleep on the floor of the warehouse"—I said "It had not been a wet night"—I happened to be on duty all that night; there was a little rain in the evening—I did not say that to him, but I knew it was not a wet night; it had rained a little between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230060"/>
               <p>would not allow her there)—she said "I am going to stop to protect my child, as I hear you were going to cut her throat again this morning"—he said "You don't stay here, none of the b—crew of you, "and he turned us all out into the court, my mother and me, and the three children, his daughter and my two sons—I quarrelled with him—I may have said I was not going to leave my home—he struck me slightly in the mouth, in the court outside the door—I said "Let me go in and get my shawl"—I went into the house, and went towards the mantelshelf to get some lucifers to get a light—my back was towards the door, and in an instant he came behind me—he never spoke a word, but he flung his left arm around my head, and with the right tore at my throat; I did not know it was cut till the next morning—I put my hand to my throat and found the blood pouring out—I gave one long scream and rushed to the door, and fell either on the mat, or against some one, insensible—I said to my next neighbour, Fanny Atkins, "Fanny, he has done it"—I did not know my throat was cut; I knew it was torn with something—I knew I was injured, but I did not know it was cut till I was told next morning in the hospital—I came to when I was on the stretcher, and my husband was standing by the side of me outside my door, and I charged him with doing it, and he made no reply—he took up a knife, and would have cut my throat at breakfast-time that morning, but I flew out to a neighbour's, and he dropped the knife behind him, and said "You b—cow, you are not worth being hung for; I will do it quieter than that"—my mother came in a few minutes after, and I told her of it, and that was the reason she made the observation she did at night—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my husband's razor—I have no wish to hurt him, but he has assaulted me so many times I want protection—there is no truth whatever in the suggestion that I did the injury to my throat myself.</p>

Lea—Mr. Smart, one of the partners, is here to-day—he was bail for him when I locked him, up before, two years ago, when he cut my head to pieces pretty well with a chair—I never attempted to commit suicide—I swear that; six years ago I was taken to the workhouse by a policeman, who found me wandering fifty yards from the water; it was four days after a bad confinement, and I was very low, and could not tell where I lived—the prisoner had always been very kind to my mother before this, and my father too—this was the first time he complained of my mother's presence—he did not complain that she was addicted to drinking—he has given her drink and me too, and then knocked me about for having it—he has not complained that she induced me to drink, and that he could keep nothing in the house from the pawn shop—I know the Duke of York public-house, at the corner of Felix Street, Somers Town—I did not six weeks ago, in the presence of Charles Harden, there take a penknife from my pocket, cut my linger, and smear the blood over my face and on the door, and say I would have my revenge of my husband, and say that he had done it—it is false—Harden did not say to me "Oh, you wicked woman!"—my husband's friends did not get him out of the window when I went to charge him—about six or seven months ago one</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter—my mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is my stepmother—I was at home about 9.30 on the evening of 26th August—father did not turn us out, but he told my grandmother to go home, he would not have her there—I was not in the room, I was outside the door—she was not in the room at all—I ran and got some matches, and when I came back Mrs. Harrop and Fanny were inside the room, and they called my father in to hold my mother's head between his knees—I don't know where my brothers were at the time my father told my grandmother to go home; my mother was inside the room, and father stood outside against the fence, with his hands behind him, smoking his pipe—the fence is close by the door—that was where I left him when I went for the matches, and when I came back, in about ten minutes, he stood there still, till Mrs. Harrop called him in—he said "I will do any thing; what shall I do?'—she said "Put your knees like that, and hold her head up, "and he did so—I went and looked, and I saw the hole in my mother's throat, and ran away—I went off to fetch a doctor—nobody told me to go; I went of my own accord, and came back with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only had to go to the next corner for the matches, but I did not hurry back—I judge that I was gone about ten minutes—father stood against the door when he told grandmother to go home—he did not go right in the house all the time I was there—grandmother never went into the house at all; she was against the window—mother was inside the house, but whereabouts I don't know—I did not see her come out—when father was outside smoking his pipe, there was no one in the house but mother—I have heard father complain to mother about grandmother coming there and pawning his things—I know things were pawned, I don't know who by—father has asked for his clothes, and mother said they were pawned—I never heard him complain of grandmother leading mother away drinking—I did not hear any scream, nor did I hear my mother say "Fanny, Fanny, I have done it!"—When I came back with the doctor, a policeman was there.</p>

About 9.45 on the night of 26th August, I was called to 5, Adam and Eve Place—I went into the sitting room, and there found Mrs. Radley on the floor, just inside the door—she was in a sitting position, with her head resting between the prisoner's knees—she appeared to be insensible—I saw blood running down her throat—I could not see the cut at the time—I asked Mrs. Harrop, who was there, if a doctor had been sent for—she said "No"—a lad who was there went for one—I did not see the girl there—Fanny Atkins was there—the prisoner said his mother-in-law and him were at variance about her coining there enticing his wife; that she had been there that evening, that they had had a quarrel, and he had sent her out—I went and fetched Dr. Griffiths, and when I returned with him another doctor was there—the woman had not been moved—I helped to move her to a chair, and just by the place where</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SARAH ANN RODWELL</hi>. I am single, and at the time this happened I was living with the prisoner as his wife at Earl's Court, Kensington; we lived in the top front room—a little girl, thirteen months old when I took her, was left with me on 22nd July by Hannah Weeden—I was to be paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, quarterly, but I had received no money at all—I was then living in Palmer Place, Victoria Street, Westminster—on the evening of 7th September I was out shopping, five or ten minutes' walk from home, and as I was coming out of a public-house, the prisoner met me and said "Sarah, I want you"—I said "What is it?"—he said "You had better make haste off home, for I am afraid you will find the child dead"—I went straight home; he did not go with me; I found the child exactly where I left it on the bed—I took it on my lap by the fire, and gave it some tea—it was not dead when I found it, but it died in my arms, and I laid it down on the bed again, and went out and met the prisoner coming towards home crying very bitterly—I said "<hi rend="italic">Ted, Ted</hi>, what have you done? you have been and done it"—he said he was very sorry, but he did not do it with the inten<lb/>tion of killing the child, he had not that thought in his head for a moment; that he went home with the intention of changing his clothes, and the child was making a grunting noise and crying, and he took it and nursed it for some considerable time and it did not leave off crying and would not be quiet at all, so he laid it down again, and then he took the pepper-box off the table, and sprinkled a little on the child's mouth—he did not say then that the top came off—I went down with him to my sister's house, Mrs. Spaul, and asked her to speak to <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>, as he was in trouble—she asked him what it was that he had done—I was crying too bitterly, to hear what was said—we remained there about twenty minutes—he was taken into custody that night, Saturday, and on Monday morning he was taken before a Magistrate—I went and saw him in the House of Detention on the Tues<lb/>day, and asked him how he did it—he said that he laid the child down, and took the pepper-box off the table, and wanted to sprinkle a little in the child's mouth, and the top fell off it—he was in drink on the Saturday night—the child was left with me on 22nd July, and I was to be paid when the quarter came, but I have never seen the mother since, or received a farthing of money—I had been in the habit of giving the child hot things with its meals, pepper, mustard, and a little horse-radish—it seemed to like it; it did not seem to throw it back again, it seemed to eat it just as another child would—I gave it pepper mixed up on a bit of meat, the same as I had for my own meals; it had exactly the same as I had, I fed it from my own plate—my age is twenty-two; I have no children—I have seen my brother's child two years and a half old eat pepper.</p>

I am the wife of William Soames Spaul, of Earl's Terrace—the prisoner is my brother; he is a builder, and has been acting as carman to a builder for some weeks past—on 7th September the prisoner and Mrs. Rod well came to me together—she had been there before, to pay me some money she owed me in the week, and I asked her to go out and get me some coppers; she did so, and came back with the prisoner; she looked very much excited, in fact both of them did—I said, "What is the matter? come indoors;" and then she said "<hi rend="italic">Ted</hi> has done something, may he speak to you?" and then she said "Tell Susan what you have done, <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>"—I took hold of him, and said, "What is it? tell me the truth"—he said that he had done something to the child—I asked him what he had done; he said he had given the child a little pepper, and he was afraid he had killed it—the girl said, "What do you think he had better do?"—I said, "Go to Dr. Parker at once"—I went too, sending Edwin back first to Rodwell for the key—he was crying a good deal; he was very much excited, and I believe it was from liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was very much distressed, and crying, and he said going along how sorry he was that it had happened—I have been married to his brother ten years, and have known him from a little boy; he bears a very good character, but he is very excitable and hot tempered—he told me that he got some water to wash the pepper out of the child's mouth. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> By hot tempered I mean easily annoyed, passionate. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE SEYMOUR</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer T</hi>). On 7th September I was spoken to, and went to the prisoner's house—I found the dead body of a child on the bed; there was some pepper on its mouth and some on its face—I fetched Dr. Orton, and Mr. Parker was in the room when I came back—I asked the doctor the cause of the child's death; he said no doubt it had been killed by pepper being administered to it—the prisoner was sitting on a chair on the other side of the room, and Rodwell said, "<hi rend="italic">Ted, Ted</hi>, you know you done it in one of your mad freaks"—he went to a washhand-stand, and drank some water out of a jug, and said, "You know I never killed a rabbit or cat in my life, leave alone a child"—he was very much excited and quite hysterical; he seemed to have been drinking—I said I should charge him and his wife with causing the death of the child—I received the pepper-castor from the Coroner's officer, who took it from the table, and took it from the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of 47, Earl's Court Road—on Saturday night, 7th September, I was called to the house, and saw the child lying on the bed—it had been dead about half-an-hour—there was pepper all over its face, principally about its mouth; its eyes were open,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230068"/>
               <p>and there was pepper upon the eyeballs, also in the nostrils, and there was a lump of pepper on the tongue, which appeared to have been worked to<lb/>gether with the saliva into a body—I think the pepper would cause a flow of saliva—there was also pepper in the crevices of the neck—the front of the pinafore was wet, and there was pepper on it—It appeared to have been washed from the face, and that is the way I believe it found its way into the crevices of the neck—there were two bruises on the face; a large one on the left cheek, extending from the angle of the mouth to the lobe of the ear, about three days old—there was also a recent bruise, very slight, on the right cheek—by the colour I should not judge that it had been done more than half-a-dozen hours—I made &amp; <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the mouth and throat, by which I mean the cavity of the mouth, not the gullet, contained a large quantity of pepper—I could have got a teaspoonful of pepper from the throat which had not entered the gullet—there was a little pepper in the throat, and a little in the passage of the stomach, but the greater quantity I found in the air passages, which led to death—there was a very large quantity there—I should think the child must have had half-an-ounce of pepper in its mouth, apart from what appeared on its face—I saw the pepper-box when I went into the room, the top was on; there was very little in it. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I observed wet about the child's dress, as though there had been an attempt to wash the pepper from its neck—I have said that if the top had fallen off accidentally, there might be enough escape from the bottle to account for all I saw—it holds two ounces.</p>

I "am an accountant, of Burdett Road, Limehouse—I was employed by Mr. Ryland to receive moneys on behalf of the estate of Samuel Bradley &amp; Son, and came to London for that purpose on 29th December, 1871—the business was being carried on at the head premises of the firm, at St. George's, and Providence Road, Limehouse—the prisoner was employed at 3, Providence Place, Limehouse—I told him that all moneys collected by him would have to be handed over to me—he had a till-book containing entries of money received—his salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week—I, as Mr. Ryland's representative, received moneys on account of the estate, and acted in the management of the business—Mr. Bradley also assisted, and was paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—I kept the banking account at the Whitechapel branch of the London and Westminster Bank; there was a separate account in the name of Mr. Ryland—all moneys were paid into the bank and partly used for the business—I paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week myself; it was his duty to receive moneys due, and enter them in the till-book—there is no entry in the till-book of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Salt on 27th April; there are no entries by the prisoner that day, or the day before, or the day after—the last entry by him was on 20th April, and the next afterwards on May 6—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due from Mr. Raphael on May 6, but here is no entry of it, although there are entries that day of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the proper way—here is no entry of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Cutler on 11th May, or of any other sum; I see no entry after 6th May—he was discharged on June 15; Mr. Ryland gave him a written notice, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him in lieu of a month's notice—those sums still stand in the books—on 5th June I made out this list of accounts owing from the ledger which the prisoner was supposed to keep—it is called "Accounts owing considered good"—I told the prisoner to go through that list and tick off each that was good, and make any memoranda against those that are doubtful or bad—he ticked various items, and returned the list to me, with this memorandum in his own writing: "All I have ticked are good, and will pay, but most of them next quarter, J. H."—Salt's, Cutler's, and Raphael's accounts are ticked on tbat list—after he was discharged further investigation was made, and about the latter end of May, or the beginning of June, I asked the prisoner how it was that there were so many accounts still owing, as we considered they were very good customers and ought to pay; he kept putting it off, saying</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230070"/>
               <p>that they would pay next Saturday—up to the present time the composition of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound has been paid regularly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some accounts are marked "Promised, Saturday"—this is an ironmongery business, and a very good one—freed from difficulty, the profits would work nearer 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it might be made a good deal better than that—I first took proceedings against the prisoner about two months after he left; it was in August—I found out these sums in July, after he was discharged—I heard that he was doing something of the same kind of business, and attracting some of our customers, but pro<lb/>ceedings had commenced before that—Mr. Ryland had instructed our solicitors at Bristol in consequence of something I wrote to him, but I did not urge him to do so—Mr. Temple's is a very good shop, in the Mile End Road, two or three miles from ours—the prisoner was carrying on business at his own house, just across the road—our business is still carried on in the name of Bradley &amp; Son—Mr. Bradley is here—he received money from the prisoner to my knowledge—when the prisoner paid any of these sums he might pay them over to Bradley, and I find Bradley's entries in this book on receiving moneys—this is the till-book—this "till" means the contents of the till taken over the counter in the day—the entry is Mr. Penfold's, the assistant—he received money—if the prisoner brought in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, he might pay it to Mr. Penfold to pay to me—he would put it in the till—Bradley received money, but he had no right to I kept an account between the prisoner and the firm, and reported it to Bristol—this is the cash-book—this "Raphael 72, T. Hart, folio 442, 7, 7, "is simply entered and charged to suspense account, on the other side—"S. B." is put against that entry, which means Samuel Bradley—those are entries where Bradley has told me that he has received the moneys—the only entry that I know of where the prisoner has handed money over to Bradley is this of January 31, where he received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over to me—he paid Bradley 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was included in 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received by Mr. Bradley—35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is entered in the till-book, and the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he paid over to Bradley, to my knowledge, is not entered—if Bradley received it, or any other sum from him, it was his duty to enter it in the till-book; and if he paid over to Penfold, it would be the prisoner's duty to enter it—Penfold did not re<lb/>ceive money from the debtors—I have entered in the till-book moneys which he paid in when he neglected to do so—I then entered what I had received from him—that has occurred six or seven times, perhaps—I hare sometimes made an entry in my own cash-book, and I applied to him after<lb/>wards for the name of the person from whence he received the money, when I found he had neglected to do so—I then entered what I had received from him—I have never entered in the till moneys received from him—I applied to him two or three days afterwards for the name—nobody used the till-book but Penfold, Bradley, and myself—Hunt did not use it—he did not receive money—he was at the other part of the business—he only came there to make up the books—there is one day of entries of the prisoner after 20th May—from 20th April the other entries are Penfold's, Hender<lb/>ville's, and mine—Henderville entered from my cash-book when he found the prisoner had neglected to do so—I find no entry of Bradley's there—this entry marked "S. B." is in Henderville's writing—that means some money which he has received—I find that Bradley has received about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has received sums since the prisoner left, and he has received cheques, and appropriated the money—Mr. Watkins had occupied the position I oc<lb/>cupy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230071"/>
               <p>before—I have no written appointment; I am general clerk to Mr. Ryland—there are not in the list I have handed to you sums which to my knowledge the prisoner has collected and paid over to Bradley—I do not recollect one that Bradley or Bond has received—Bradley received this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the Millwall Engineering Company on January 14th, and gave a receipt for it—that was before the list was ticked—that was not received by the prisoner, and handed over to Bradley—I know that 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of North's account was paid by cheque, and the prisoner gave a receipt for it—I asked the prisoner on the day he left whether there were any accounts which were not entered—he said that there was a few, and that Bradley had had the money; that he had received it, and paid it to Bradley—I applied to Dun<lb/>can's myself for about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and saw some of the prisoner's receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I find that the prisoner has received from 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and not entered it—the till-book was kept at the premises of the firm, and if the course of business had been regular, each person who received money would enter it there—I was not present when he paid Penfold any money—when he paid money over he paid it at his risk—I was there every day—Henderville was a clerk at the other shop, he is now down at Limehouse because the other place is given up—the prisoner ought not to have paid money over to Bradley—on 30th January, there is an entry of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I have found out that 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Bradley, but I know of no other case—after the prisoner left I enquired particularly into the accounts and reported to Mr. Ryland every day—I consulted Mr. Bradley as to the management of the business—here is a regular debtor and creditor account against Bradley.</p>

On this Sunday morning, between 2 and 3 o'clock, Mrs. McCarthy called for my assistance, and came to my door—I went down to her; she was bleeding from the lower part of her person, and was in a most fearful state—I found two or three awful wounds—I took her indoors, and sent for a policeman and the doctor—I stopped with the doctor while her wounds were dressed—she appeared to me to be sober.</p>

I was called to York Buildings, Westmin-on Sunday morning, 25th August—in consequence of what I heard I went to the prisoner's house; I found him in a room, on the ground floor, lying on some empty sacks—there was a child there—the door was locked—I opened the shutters, and got in at the window—the prisoner's wife was out in the court, on her hands and knees, crying and bleeding; I helped to get her into the house—the prisoner was asleep—I asked him if he knew anything about his wife—he said "No"—I sent for a doctor, and waited outside the house when he came—I went back to the room where the prisoner had been—he was not there; I found him behind some sacks of sawdust, on the opposite side of the court—I took him into cus<lb/>tody; he was quite sober—the woman appeared to be sober—she was re<lb/>moved to the hospital.</p>

I am a doctor of medicine, and also a surgeon—I was fetched to see Margaret McCarthy about 3.30 or 4 o'clock—I found her lying on a bed in York Buildings—I was given to understand that she had received some injury in her private parts—I found one side very much swollen, and the vagina presented all the appearance of a magnified black eye—it was also bleeding, and on opening up the parts in order to get a better view, I saw an incised wound, about an inch and a-half long, and as I did so there was a spurt of blood sprung from her, so I felt it my duty to stop the bleeding—I did not see any blood coming from anywhere else—I got some pieces of rag and put over the wound, and the natural movement of the parts stopped the bleeding—the surface was swollen about as big as my hand, and upon the swollen surface there was a wound—I found the plugging was sufficient to stop the bleeding—I advised her instant re<lb/>moval to the hospital—she was advanced in pregnancy; I should say about six months—I did not examine the other parts of her body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there on Sunday morning, 25th August, about 1 o'clock; she was perfectly blanched, she had lost a great deal of blood—I ordered her into the ward immediately; she was in a state of collapse—there was a bruise all round under her chin, and her temples were bruised—I examined the vagina; it appeared as if there was a large tumour projecting between the labia; I sent for the consulting surgeon—I did not like to interfere without his advice, and when he came we put her under chloroform and examined the state of affairs, and he, in trying to pass his finger up, accidentally ruptured the tumour, it was composed of blood clots; he put his hand further up and found a wound at the side of the vagina—he could pass his hand right through the wound; one labia was very much swollen—the tumour was certainly not the result of natural causes, it was the result of injury—we thought at first the wound hid touched the peritoneum, and thought she would die in a couple of hours, and sent for a Magistrate immediately—I continued to attend her for some weeks—she vacillated between life and death for about three weeks—she was pregnant, and gone about six months—I have seen her here to-day, and consider she is in a fair way of recovery now, quite out of danger—I should imagine the wound was incised—I thought it was done by some pointed instrument; falling on the floor or on a broken dish would not cause such an injury; a kick would cause the tumour, but the wound could not have been caused by a kick.</p>

I have heard of the bar the constable has described—it would be very improbable that that caused the wound, assuming it to be standing up—if the bar was in an upright position in the tub and the woman fell over the tub and on to the bar, it is possible it might have caused such a wound, but very im<lb/>probable—it must have been caused by a pointed instrument; it need not have been sharply pointed—it is possible the leg of a chair might have caused it, if the chair was upside down—I think it is absolutely impossible it could have been caused by a bit of broken dish, from the position of the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. For many years I was clerk to the Greenwich District Board—I was so in 1861—the prisoner was then in my service as my principal clerk—he also worked and acted for the Greenwich District Board; that was his principal duty—I should say that he was recognised as my clerk by the Board—by a minute passed by the Board in 1856 he was recognised as my assistant—he principally devoted himself to the business of the Board, under my superintendence—in May, 1861, Mr. Samuel Hobbs was a contractor to the Board for the paving—he did the work—it was his duty to send in quarterly accounts to each parish for the work done—all those accounts were submitted to Mr. Smith, the surveyor, who certified that the work was done, and the usual practice was then to hand them to Mr. Chapman—they were then laid before a Parish Committee, that is a committee for the particular parish to which the work applied; they went through the accounts to see whether the work had been done according to the order of the Board, and after that they were handed to the finance Committee, whose duty it was to examine and audit the bills, and</p>

               <p>initial them after they had gone through them—a report was then drawn up and submitted to the District Board at their next meeting—that report ought to contain a true account of the bills audited—it was then the prisoner's duty to draw cheques for the amount claimed in the report—a cheque was then drawn for the whole amount due to each particular person—there was the usual counterfoil to the cheques used in the office—after the cheques were drawn and signed by members of the Board, it was my duty to countersign them—it was my usual practice to see that the cheques agreed with the report—I seldom countersigned any cheque until I saw that it agreed with the report of the Board—the cheques were generally sent to me for signature, probably by the messenger, from Mr. Chapman—sometimes I signed them at the office—these four accounts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated May, 1861, are Mr. Hobbs' accounts—the account for the quarter ending Lady-day, 1861, for St. Nicholas, Deptford, is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—it is endorsed by Mr. Chapman, "St. N., D.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In 1861 the prisoner was in my service, but recognised as my assistant by the District Board—he was paid by me—whatever he did as my clerk, the Board accepted as an act of my own—he was my own clerk, and had been so for a great many years—he was with me in 1856, when I was appointed Clerk to the Board—there was no written agreement when he entered my service—I was not then employed by the Board—I was Vestry Clerk of Greenwich parish, and he was my assistant, and he became my clerk afterwards, when I was appointed Clerk to the District Board—he was simply my clerk in my public capacity; he was not a clerk in my private office as a solicitor—I was not allowed anything for his salary; he was my clerk, paid out of my pocket, until '66, and he was appointed accountant by the Board in '66—the pass-book and counterfoil cheque-book for May, '61, are missing—between '61 and '66 they were kept in the clerk's office of the District Board; and from '66 to '72 they were in Mr. Chapman's custody in his own office, he having an office expressly appointed for him—I had no occasion daring '61 to '66 to make any inquiries about or to look at any of those books, they were always under Mr. Chapman's care—in '72 there was a messenger attached to the Board, named May—I recently applied to Mr. Chapman, by direction of the Board; for certain papers; in fact, for all the papers he had—I think be sent a key by May, but I don't recollect what key it was—we searched the strong room, or rather the chest, to find the books, but we could not find the pass-book of '61—I don't recollect that he sent me a letter stating that all the books and vouchers were in the depository, of "which he sent the key—he simply sent me a key and some papers—I was present when the search was made for books and papers—I have not got a list or inventory of the books and papers which were found—I know nothing of what books and papers were in existence in '66, because they were entirely under Mr. Chapman's care—I mean in the public office, where his duty was—in '66 he waft the accountant to the Board—there was no other accountant—previous to him, I had another clerk in the office named Mayer, and one named Nettleton—their duties were not similar to Mr. Chapman's; they were merely copying clerks—under the Act of Parliament we were bound to appoint three auditors every year—that was complied with—auditors were appointed up to '66—I am not aware that any of them are here—I simply compared the cheques which were drawn by Mr. Chapman with the report of the Finance Com<lb/>mittee, and, having done so, I considered I had done all that was necessary—cheques were not signed by the Board, unless upon the report of the Finance Committee—it was only the duty of the Parish Committee to see that the items agreed with the orders which had been given; they did not check the items—I think Mr. Smith's duty was simply to see that the items agreed with the work that had been done, not to see that the castings were correct—this report of the Finance Committee is in Mr. Chapman's writing, and is signed by Mr. Reeve—he is dead—I am not aware that this came under my personal inspection previous to the cheque being drawn—I can't say that I looked at every item—it was not the usual course of business that I should look over these reports and compare them with the accounts—my duty was simply to read it at a meeting of the Board, which I did—the cheques had been previously drawn, and after the report was read the</p>

               <p>Board agreed to sign the cheques so mentioned in the report—I think I first saw these accounts of Mr. Hobbs within the last three months; they would not come under my inspection in '61—they were in the clerk's office when investigation was made, in Mr. Chapman's office, the office of the Board—there are two distinct offices: my office, as Clerk of the Board, which is below stairs; and Mr. Chapman's, up two pair of stairs—they were found in my office, the clerk's, to which Mr. Chapman might have full access—there were hundreds and thousands of vouchers and papers there of a similar description—they were tied up in bundles relating to the particular years—these were found without any difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Any of the clerks would have access to these papers, and if they wished to destroy them after the accounts were once passed and audited they would remain for years without any one looking at them, no suspicion attaching to them—there was an audit in the regular way, Mr. Chapman being the person to prepare the accounts for the audit, and to attend the auditors—this is the balance-sheet prepared by him; that would carry on the same defalcation, so that the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be accounted for—I had a certain salary, and had to provide a clerk to do the business of the Board—the prisoner was recognised by the Board by a special minute made in 1866—in 1861 it was practically his duty to act as accountant, prepare documents for them, submit them for signature, and attend the meetings—he did not attend to my private business at all, I have my own office at a different place altogether; he attended entirely to the business of the Board.</p>

I am surveyor and engineer to the Greenwich Board of Works—I was the surveyor in 1861—it was my duty to examine the accounts of the work done on behalf of the Board—amongst others I examined the accounts of Mr. Hobbs for the quarter ending March, 1861—I should go through these four accounts to see that the work mentioned there was done—there are marks in the margin in pencil or ink, I can't say that they are my marks—at the end of each of the accounts I have written my name in red ink, and stated them to be correct—the work was done as specified here—the account for Greenwich parish 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would amount to 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to the items—I cannot at this distance of time say whether I could have passed that by an oversight—sometimes I added up the amount—my business was only to see that the work was done and properly charged for; not to see that the total was right.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at New Cross Road, and am a contractor—in 1861 I did work for the Board of Works of the Greenwich district—I did the work mentioned in these four accounts—I made out this account for the Greenwich parish myself—the work was done by my people at Lady Day in that year, this was the account for that quarter—I added it up myself—when I sent it in to the Board, it was an account for 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that, with the other accounts, made a total of 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to me—on the morning of 30th May I called at the clerk's office for payment of those accounts; I had a memorandum book with me, I have it here now—I saw the prisoner; it was a little after 12 o'clock when I went into the office—I said, <hi rend="italic">"</hi> Mr. Chapman, I have called for my accounts for the quarter ending Lady Day"—he said, "I must trouble you to call again"—I said, "For why?"—he said, "I am sorry to say that I have made an error in drawing the cheque for your amount, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in excess, call again in half-an-hour and I will get the cheque cashed and pay you in cash, and pay the excess over to the credit of the Board"—he begged me not to say anything to any member of the Board, it would make no difference, every one was liable to mistake—I did not see the accounts then—I went away and called again in half-an-hour, he then paid me 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank-notes, three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put stamps on the bills and receipted them, all four—these are my signatures—before receipting them I looked at my memorandum-book to see whether the accounts agreed—this is my memorandum: "St. Paul, Deptford, account 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., cartage account 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Greenwich account 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., St. Nicholas, Deptford, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I am certain that the Greenwich account was 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I receipted it—as soon as I received the notes and signed the receipts I went and paid them in to my credit at the London and County Bank at Greenwich, together with a little cheque of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had this memorandum-book before the Magistrate, but it was not asked for—I said that I never mentioned this matter until three years after it occurred—I did not mention that the prisoner said "Pray don't mention it to anybody"—I am not aware, up to the present moment, whether he has or not paid the money back to the Board—I never had the cheque, and never saw it—I mentioned the matter before Mr. Chapman resigned his office—I mentioned it to several members of the Board—I mentioned it to Mr. Hensom—I can't exactly say the time—it was at the time Mr. Chapman kept his saddle-horse, and there was a rumour about his extravagance—that was three or four years ago—I did not build a house in Egerton Road, Greenwich, about 1865; I am no builder—I know Mr. Smith, a builder, who built a house for Mr. Chapman—I con<lb/>tracted to do the stonework for Mr. Smith for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—there was no quarrel between me and Mr. Chapman—he guaranteed the payment, and after the work was done, and Mr. Smith went away, Mr. Chapman repudiated the payment of it, and I never got paid—I did not say that I would take care some day to serve him out—I have not been on bad terms with him—we have had little angry words when I wished him to pass my accounts at the Board, and I could not get them done without applying to the Chairman of the Board—I mean to say that I have failed to obtain my money through Mr. Chapman from the Board—I don't mean that I have not been paid after the accounts had passed the Finance Committee, but the difficulty was getting them before the Finance Committee—I heard this year that Mr. Chapman had resigned his office—I did not hear that his accounts were likely to be looked into—I never saw these accounts, after they were passed and I was paid, till I saw them at the Police Court, and then I had them in my hands—I did not borrow them from him afterwards—since they passed from my hands, previously to payment, I never saw them again till I was at the Police Court—I remember that there was a complaint made by Skinner, in August, '61, about some contract work—I am still positive that I never borrowed these accounts—there was a committee called out to view this little particular work, and they passed it there and then as satisfactory—I did not, pending that investigation, ask Mr. Chapman to lend me these accounts—this figure I at the bottom of the second page was not there when I handed in this account—the I at the top of the third page and at the end of the whole account have been put since—I believe the endorsement on the back is Mr. Chapman's writing; it is not in mine.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I say positively that I never had the accounts back after I handed them in to the Board—the cheques I received previous to this were open cheques, payable to bearer, until, I believe, the time of his being appointed accountant to the Board—that is some five or six years ago—after that they were made payable to order—up to that time they were open</p>

I live at 20, Pitt Street, Commercial Road, Peckham—on Sunday, 25th August, about 2.15, I was in the Crown and Sceptre public-house in the Commercial Road—the prisoner came in hawk<lb/>ing some pencils—I declined to buy any, and told him to go and look for some work the same as we did—he made use of an expression to me about my wife—I attempted to put him out of the house—he struck at me and struck me in the jaw—I returned the blow and hit the door-post; and the blood from my finger splashed on his face—I am sure I did not hit him—then we had a scuffle; he left the house then—a man gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe, to go away—about twenty minutes after that I was returning home I got close to my gate; I turned round and saw the prisoner about twenty or thirty yards from me—he came up and said "You b—I have got you by yourself, and I have come well prepared for you"—I asked him what he meant—he struck me with his fist, and there seemed a hard substance in his hand—we had a tussle together in the road; we fell; my wife came out, and I heard her say "My God, he is stabbed!"—we were both lying in the road at that time—I lost my senses, and I don't recollect any more till I was indoors—the blood was streaming down me from a place under my left arm—they washed me and put me to bed, and my wife sent for a doc<lb/>tor; I was laid up three weeks—I never knew the prisoner before—I am well enough now to go to light employment, but not to hard work—I was stabbed twice in the leg—I did not know that till they got me in bed.</p>

I live with my husband at 3, Market Street, Kennington Lane—on 19th August I was in Kennington Lane with my son by my first husband; his name was Richard White, and he was ten years old—he went out between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening; he had a barrow with him—he turned from Market Street into Kennington Lane, and crossed to the left-hand side, going towards Kennington Cross—I was on the right side, on the pavement, and he was in the road, on the left side, pushing the barrow, with the handles in his hand—I saw a three-horse van close to the pavement, on the same side as my son, who was close to the behind horse of the van—there were two wheelers, and one in the shafts, and he was passing them; they were walking—I saw a Hansom's cab coming in an opposite direction very quickly towards town from Kennington Cross, close to my boy—there was a very wide space between the cab and the pavement; the cab was more towards the left than the right, and there was loads of room for the cab to pass—I heard several people halloa "Look out!"—the cab came very quickly, and overturned the barrow, with all my goods, and my boy was thrown under the waggon—I went to the hospital with him—I did not see the prisoner till the day of the inquest—I am sure the cry occured before my boy was struck.</p>

I am a traveller, and live at 27, Gilbert Road, Lower Kennington Lane—on 19th August I stopped at the Roebuck, Kennington Cross, and just as I started my horse I saw a cab in the middle of the road—there was a cab rank there, but no cab in it, and nothing to prevent the cabdriver from going on his own near side; there was plenty of room—I saw the boy with the barrow, and saw that if the cab did not turn out of the road a little it would touch the barrow—something made me turn round, and I saw the boy ten or twelve yards from me—I called out "Stop! cabman, don't you see the barrow?" loud enough for him to hear, but he made no answer—he drove past me very fast, and his off-wheel caught the front of the barrow and turned it quite round, and turned it under the van—there was plenty of room; ten or twelve yards, I should say, between the cart and the barrow—the boy was thrown under the van; it seemed to jam him up against the horses, and the wheel of the van injured him—it seemed to come up right against him, but it did not go over him, or it must have cut him in two—the prisoner kept going on; I called to him to stop, and he did so—I jumped down and said "You have done a very fine thing; you have killed this poor boy"—he said "Oh, it was not my fault; it was the fault of the van; I did not go near him"—I heard several people call out before he struck the barrow.</p>

I live at 19, Haines Street, Battersea Fields—I was the carman with the three-horse waggon on the day—I was coming from the City with about five tons of goods, and saw the boy with a barrow; he came out of Lower Kennington Lane—I said, "You get back you young rascal, do, "and he got back behind my van, which was going very slow, eighteen inches or two feet from the kerb—the boy came on my off-side, as I was</p>
