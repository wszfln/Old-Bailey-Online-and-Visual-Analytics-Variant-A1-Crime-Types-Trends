Mr. Barlee. Sir. When may I expect the bricks at Cherry Garden Stairs?"—This is the letter I received from Mr. Perry, on 1st February: "58, New Street, Kennington. Sir.

Javey &amp; Co., 17, Great George Street Westminster—on 1st February, I wrote to Messrs. A.

In reply to yours of 1st instant, we beg to say that we always found Mr. Archer punctual in his engagements in any business transactions with us"—In consequence of that I wrote to Archer on 6th February, 1871, stating that as the reference was satisfactory, I would send the barge of bricks, the usual quantity, two-thirds stocks and one-third grizzels, to any wharf at Chelsea he might wish; and on the 7th I received this letter from John Archer: "In reply to yours of the 6th, you can please forward the barge to Lindsay Wharf, Chelsea, as addressed in my former note. I ordered all stocks, but if you have them loaded, I can make use of the grizzels"—In consequence of that letter, I dispatched by the barge <hi rend="italic">Sophia</hi> 17,000 stocks and 8000 grizzels to Lindsay Wharf, Chelsea—on 15th February, I received another letter from John Archer, stating that he had received the barge of bricks, and ordering another barge-load to be delivered at Lindsay Wharf, Chelsea—the delivery note for those bricks has been lost—I have since applied at 18, Herbert Street, New North Road—the letter was returned through the dead letter office—I made a personal ap<lb/>plication, but he had left about a month, and I could not trace him—I went to the office of the reference, he was not there, and his private address was not known—I could not get any information at all—on 23rd February, I sent to Lindsay Wharf, to John Archer, 18,000 stocks and 7000 grizzels—I received the delivery note back, signed—I sent the invoice by post, which amounted to 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—the amount sent to Hedges was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the total amount of the six consignments was 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of not finding the persons referred to, I communicated with the police, and the men were taken into custody, and committed for trial—the men there were Southwell, Baker, and Palmer, with the prisoner Feiler—they were</p>

I am a civil engineer, of Catspaw Road, Ormsby—on Friday night, 1st September, I was in Chiswick Lane, and saw a struggle between the prisoner and a policeman on the ground—it was 12.30, or a little before—the public-houses were closed—I saw the glitter of what I thought was a knife in the prisoner's hand—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife he had—I assisted to take him to the station—he struggled a little at first—he was bleeding freely, and I washed his head—I have been in the Crimea, and the Indian Mutiny—this is the kind of knife served out to troops in the Artillery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present landlord of the Crown at Cricklewood—prior to February, 1869, I carried on business as a wine merchant—I had fallen into difficulties previous to that, and became bankrupt in 1869—I had known the prisoner previously to that, and had dealings with him—at the time of my bankruptcy I owed him about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he, with the rest, was discharged under my bankruptcy—they were money transactions for which I had been paying from 100 to 200 per cent.—to cover the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I owed him he held goods of mine to the amount of about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I have never had back; so that I owed him nothing—in July, 1870, I was travelling for a wine merchant—I again became in want of money, and applied to the prisoner—he was then living in Morton Street, Pimlico—the name of "Mr. Cooper, auctioneer, St. Martin's Lane," was also up there in an inner office—the prisoner had a ticket up, "Money Advanced"—I had interviews with him in July, and he subsequently placed some documents before me to sign, and I signed them—they were read over to me—I had applied to him for an advance of 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the documents were signed, Mr. Cooper's clerk was present; I believe his name was Harden; but they were not read over or explained in any way—at that time I believed I was going to receive 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through the means of the prisoner—I never received a farthing of that money—subsequently to that, by the aid of my friends and the brewers, I was enabled to take the Crown—I took it as it stood, with the furniture and things at a valuation—the prisoner never brought me the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or came to me during the rest of the year 1870—about May, 1871, he came to me, and in consequence of what he said, I was induced to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I hold a bill of sale over your head, give me some money"—he wanted about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—I refused at first to give him any; I told him that I did not owe him a sixpence—he said he should not leave without he had some money, if I did not give him any, he had got some vans, and he should take my goods away—I said I should not give him any, but after some time, having heard what a desperate character he was, having served other people in the same way, taking their goods put of their houses, I was induced to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would damage my credit with everybody—I asserted more than once that I had never received a shilling from him—I did not see the vans at the time, they were left round the corner—I had a policeman on the premises at the time, in con<lb/>sequence of what I had heard—the prisoner was content with the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and went away—previously to that I had seen a man named Tanner in the prisoner's company—the prisoner introduced him to me as Sergeant Tanner—I had heard of Sergeant Tanner, and I believed him to be the man—the prisoner said he was the great Sergeant Tanner who had brought Muller over to this country—I don't think Tanner was with him at the time I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am not certain—on 18th July I was away from home—my wife was ill at the time—when I left home in the morning, I left my fur<lb/>niture and everything safe; when I returned in the afternoon I found all the upper rooms stripped, my wife's dressing-case broken open, and jewellery and money taken away, some spirits and cigars, and goods, altogether to the amount of between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were taken away—I made inquiries of my wife as to who had been there—some of her underclothing and some of the</p>

B. Smith, for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on a bill of sale—that was borrowed capital to go on in business again—I am not certain what I owed you in July, 1868; about that date I owed you 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before my bankruptcy I paid you everything I owed you except 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for that you had a cart, a phaeton, a ring and bracelet, worth 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as security—in November, 1868, you took possession of some of my goods—I never took you to my solicitor—just before my bankruptcy I gave you a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that left a balance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know that the goods you seized realized 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never heard what they realized—I don't know that Mr. Schofield sold</p>

I live at 2, Crown Street, Soho, and am the father of Elizabeth Fry—she was born, I believe, on 10th December, and as near as I can recollect, she will be 18 next Christmas—I had a memorandum, but it was destroyed at a fire at my house—she worked at a cigar manufactory, in Oxford Street, at which the prisoner worked—from information I re<lb/>ceived I went there, and told the prisoner that I understood he was going after my daughter, and if he did not leave her alone I should take him before a Magistrate, and I removed her from the factory—on 2nd July, she was living at my house, and I was not aware of her intended marriage with the prisoner—I have been to Broomhead Street, Stepney—the highest number there is 41, on one side, and 21 on the other.</p>

I am parish clerk of Stepney—I produce the register-book of marriages for that district—on 2nd July I find a marriage purporting to be solemnized between Samuel Moss and Bloomer Fry—I received from my wife the notice-book for the publication of banns—this writing in the register book is not mine, but the Clergyman's—I saw him write it—he wrote it from the certificate which I made up from the prisoner's instructions—I mean to say that I make up a draft for the Parson to copy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I received a deal of injury, and had erysipelas in my head. My cousin was the only relation I have, and I generally had my meals there. We have been brought up together from children. We went out, and had five or six quarterns of rum, independent of malt liquor. We quarrelled, and made it up afterwards, and had a couple of quarterns of rum together, and some beer. I went to Mr. Bird's place, and heard screams of "Murder!" I went up, and the deceased was like a raving madman, and stark naked. He laid hold of me by the handkerchief, and nearly strangled me. We were struggling together ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. He threw me on the edge of the bedstead, and I threw him down on the floor; but there was not a blow struck; first he was below me, and then I was below him. On Sunday morning I found my head cut open, and went up to know which was the worst of us, and found he had been taken to the hospital I have been under medical treatment ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of 14, Tyndale Place, Islington—on Sunday morning, 30th July, I was called to the prisoner's house about 10 o'clock, and saw the prisoner—he said "It is all over, she is dead"—I asked him to show me the body—I went up stairs, and found her laid out in bed—her face was one mass of bruises, from the head down to the jaw—I went down stairs, and said "This is an ugly case"—the prisoner said "It is"—I afterwards received instructions from the Coroner to perform a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I found on the upper part of the chest several blue marks about the size of a sixpence, as if the part had been gripped by pressure just by the collar<lb/>bone—on the chest end of the right shoulder, by the collar-bone, was another bruise about the size of a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and on the upper lip, at the left side, was an abrasion nearly an inch long—the skin was broken; it was a scratch, and a little external to that was another not quite so large, and the whole of the left side of the face, extending from the lower jaw to the temple, was one mass of bruises—on reflecting the scalp I found that the bruises extended down to the bone, and there was considerable extravasa<lb/>tion of blood—on removing the skull cap, and exposing the brain, I found on its left hemisphere an extravasated clot of blood almost as large as the palm of my hand, and on the right side I found another much larger clot—I placed the large clot in my hand, and on rough calculation it would weigh from 2oz. to 3oz.; the clot on the left side was thinner, about the thick<lb/>ness of a penny piece, but it was more extravasated—at the base of the brain I found another clot, much smaller, lying midway between the upper part of the spinal marrow, and the base of the brain—it was about the size of a filbert—the left temporal muscle was one bruised mass, pulpy, but the opposite muscle was perfectly healthy—the cause of death was effusion of blood, producing pressure on the brain, which must have been produced by a series of falls, or a series of blows—the bruises must have been produced from the same cause—the whole of the left side of the face was a series of bruises—they would not have been caused by one heavy fall, and besides that the condition of the temporal muscle was such that it must have re<lb/>ceived a series of blows—it was in a soft, pulpy condition—the fist is the very instrument which would produce those bruises—it must have been an instrument of a yielding kind, because there was no external sore.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Caroline Road, Goswell Road—on Saturday, 12th August, about 8.20 or 8.30 p.m., I saw the prisoner and the deceased—the prisoner asked the deceased if he was a bricklayer—Kenny said "What are you?"—the prisoner said "I am a labourer"—Kenny said "Can you serve a bricklayer?"—the prisoner said "Yes, I can serve two if I like"—Kenny called him a liar—the prisoner left him, and came to speak to the young woman who I was speaking to—Kenny followed him—the prisoner told him to go away; he refused—the prisoner told him to go away three or four times, and Higgins put his hand upon him, and said "Go away; I have told you before what I want; I want eight bricklayers"—Kenny would not go, and the prisoner said "If you do not go away from me, I will <hi rend="italic">slash</hi> you in the b——y roe"—Kenny said "Maybe you would not," and the prisoner pushed him in the chest, and <hi rend="italic">staggered</hi> him back—he hit against another man, and they both fell—I went to pick the other man up, and Kenny got up, and laid hold of Higgins—they struggled, and Higgins brought him down on the flat of his back again—he got up, and made a rush at Higgins—they <hi rend="italic">tussled</hi> together, and Higgins flung Kenny on the ground—I then went away—they were both drunk, and so was the other man who was pushed down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not notice that the deceased was abusive before he was put on his back the first time—the prisoner pushed him away because he followed him—he said "Go away from me," but he would not—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187109180037"/>
               <p>I think he had insulted the other man by asking if he was a bricklayer—I was present till the struggle ended—I saw no blows with the double fist, it was simply putting his hand and pushing him back—even during the struggle I did not see fists used, and I was close, to them and should have seen it if it had taken place—the prisoner being a powerful man to what the deceased was, he gave him a good throw, and he fell very heavily on the ground and twisted himself—I did not see Mrs. Dell there, but she might have been—I went away, and did not wait till it was over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about two yards from them—when Kenny got up after the first throw, he did not seize the prisoner by the dress—the grapple took place as soon as Kenny got up; the prisoner took him up and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him down again—when a man is off his legs, a man can <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> him over his head—I saw no blow with a fist—this is correct in my depositions: "I saw the prisoner with a man in his arms throwing him over his hip"—it was as a wrestler would do, giving his body a twist—the deceased was full of drink, and his death occurred from rupture of the bladder—I cannot say whether that was caused by the twist—I did not see Mrs. Dell, but there was a great mob there—Callaghan was the other man who was knocked down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Johnson, a shoemaker, of 3, Nag's Head Court, Golden Lane—I saw the prisoner and Kenny talking angry—the prisoner asked Kenny whether he bad carried the had, or did carry it—he said "I can carry it," and they spoke across—the prisoner said "If you don't push away I will dash the front of your face in"—Kenny said "What for I" and the prisoner went towards him, and took him by his flesh, or his jacket, and threw him down flat on his back—Kenny got up and went towards the prisoner, to contest again, and the prisoner threw him down again on his back, and he got up again, crawled up the court, and stood against the wall about five minutes—I went and asked him if he was hurt—I saw him in bed next day, and took him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not there at the first—they both spoke angrily about the had—Kenny was several yards from his own door, it may be forty yards—he lives at the top of the court—he was about ten yards from Callaghan's door, who lives next door to me—Callaghan was in the lane, some yards from his own door—Kenny did not get up and go sharply towards the prisoner, he staggered.</p>

               <p>Court—I produce an original summons against Thomas Crouch, of 4, North<lb/>ampton Street, King's Cross, hackney carriage No. 4936—that would be returnable on Monday, 3rd July—I was not present on that hearing—I believe Mr. Humphreys was—I have a note of what passed in his hand<lb/>writing—I was present at the second hearing, the 7th, and took down what the prisoner then swore—that is it: (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On 20th of last month, at 5.40 p.m., the driver, hackney carriage 4936, was driving at a furious pace; on the crossing of the Tottenham Court Rood he came in collision with a cart; the man driving the cart was thrown on the wheel of an omnibus, the wheel of the cart was broken by the wheel of the defendant's cab; the defendant drove off at twelve or thirteen miles an hour, the same pace at which he was originally driving; it was on the crossing of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> "There was nothing within thirty or forty yards; the nearest vehicle was thirty yards off; the cart came from the public-house towards Holborn, in the same direction as the defendant; Mr. Naylor was in the cart; I was talking to him about it to-day, why he did not attend before; he fell on the step of the omnibus, and jumped back into his cart; the defendant did not pull up; the gentleman of last week's evidence is not true; I saw it from the window of the omnibus, which was between me and the cart.")—That was all—the summons was dismissed by Mr. Vaughan the same day, and a summons for perjury was applied for by Crouch against the constable, and granted the same day by Mr. Vaughan.</p>

I live at 4, Northampton Street, King's Cross, and am the proprietor and driver of a hansom cab, 4936—I was summoned to the Bow Street Police Court, on 3rd July, for wanton and furious driving—I at<lb/>tended at the Police Court—I don't exactly know the date—I received the summons on the Thursday, and I attended on the following Monday—the prisoner was there—the summons was called on—I pleaded Not Guilty—the prisoner was called as a witness; he was sworn—I had a witness, my fare, the gentleman who was in my cab at the time—he gave evidence on the first occasion—the prisoner's evidence was that I was coming down Oxford Street at the rate of thirteen miles an hour, galloping, and a beating of my horse; that I caught hold of a cart, and threw two men out into the middle of the road, and the only thing that prevented the cart from going over was lodging up against the side of an omnibus—he said that the cart was injured in the wheel, the spokes, and that I then set to and beat my horse, and galloped away at a more furious pace, he should say about four teen or fifteen miles an hour, and that him and four more took my number—that is all that I recollect—the Magistrate stated that he would grant an adjournment for the production of the constable's evidence; he stated that he had got four more witnesses to call—the case was adjourned to the following Friday, when I again attended—the prisoner was called again—he was sworn again—I can't recollect the exact words he used; he said that I was coming down Oxford Street about twelve or thirteen miles an hour, that the two men were thrown in between the cart and the oumibus, and that it injured the cart, and that I then set to and galloped away—I believe</p>

               <p>he said the step and the wheel of the cart was injured—I won't be positive that he said both the step and the wheel; he said the wheel—I had not had any other summons for furious driving between the first and second hearings; I was attending on that summons—this was what the prisoner alleged had taken place on the 20th; what really did take place was this: I was coming down Oxford Street on the evening in question, about 5.30 or 5.45, in between that time, I won't be certain—I got as far as the Oxford Music Hall, and the traffic was very great at the time—I was in a line of traffic, a walking—I had just got out of a walk, between three and four miles per hour, when I got to Tottenham Court Road, from the Oxford Music Hall, a closely following a vehicle, a cart, standing on the west-ward side of Tottenham Court Road, driven by a man named Naylor, as I was passing Tottenham Court Road, drove between me and the vehicle I was following of, and forced me into the middle of the road in a slanting direction—we both went into the middle of the road together—there was an omnibus standing still at the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, by the brewery, with the horses' heads towards the City; it was drawn just to the corner, where they always pull up; in order to pre<lb/>vent a collision with vehicles coming in a westerly direction, the reverse way, I touched my horse with the whip on the off side, and being a high spirited animal, she caught the wheel of the cart on the near side, and took it straight on with me towards the City to the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> that was standing still at the corner of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, and came into col<lb/>lision with its hind wheel; not very hard, a slight collision—I then drove on for about thirty or forty yards, I should say—the cart did not draw in front of the omnibus, it stopped there, and I drove on—I looked round and saw that the men had got out of the cart, and I then turned my horse and cab round, and waited until vehicles coming that way, and foot pas<lb/>sengers on the pavement said "It's all right, go on, there is nothing hurt," and I went on then—I did not, after the affair took place, whip my horse up, and drive off at the rate of fourteen miles an hour—I did not set to and gallop away—it is not true that when I was coming along, past the corner of Tottenham Court Road, I was coming at the rate of twelve or thirteen miles an hour, nor that I lifted the cart up against the omnibus, and that two men were thrown out—I did not turn it on its side; the men were not thrown out—it is not true that the wheel of the cart was lifted off the ground, it <hi rend="italic">skidded</hi> along at the time, the stones were slippy—the cart was <hi rend="italic">skidded</hi> on to the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—I don't know the exact distance the cart was dragged, from the middle of Oxford Street to the corner—I should say it would hardly measure more than twenty yards; from the middle of Oxford Street, as you cross from Crown Street to Tottenham Court Road, our horses seemed to go together for that few yards only on to the <hi rend="italic">'bus,</hi> that was what it seemed to me—the horses in the cart, and in the cab, seemed to go over towards the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> together—the cart was Watling's pork pie cart—there were a great number of vehicles about at the time—the summons wag dismissed, and I then applied to Mr. Vaughan for a summons against the defendant, and he granted it that same day—I had not called Naylor as a witness, I did not call anyone—I had no occasion for the constable, there was one.</p>

I live at 26, New Peter Street, Westminster—I go about with Naylor, in Mr. Watling's cart—I was with Nayloron the day this affair took place—we were coming down Tottenham Court Road, to go across to High Street, on the left hand side of the lamp post—in the middle of the street there was a line of cabs, coming along Oxford Street, towards the City—we were going across the line of cabs, and the cabman just touched his horse up, and came against us, and our step just caught the off wheel of the omnibus, and then we saw the cabman driving on after this—when he came against us he was driving about eight miles an hour—there were some cabs in front of him, and some behind—he touched our off side wheel—it was not done with great violence; it was just a touch—it did not knock the paint off the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—our step was bent a little bit—it is not true that I and Naylor were thrown out pf the cart—it is not true that the cabman galloped away as hard as he could, whipping his horse—it is true that he galloped away—it is not true that he drove away at twelve or thirteen miles an hour, whipping his horse; he went about eight miles an hour after he done it—after he had driven away, a policeman (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) came up, from towards High Street, where the bank is, at the corner of High Street and Oxford Street—he asked if me and Naylor were hurt, and we said "No," and then Naylor gave him the cabman's number—I saw the prisoner again, I think, on the next Friday, in Tottenham Court Road, where the Camden Town <hi rend="italic">'busses</hi> are—he told me and Mr. Naylor that he had summoned the cabman for furious driving, and that he had pushed me and Mr. Naylor out of the cart, and he said he would summons us, and he thought we should have to go up to Bow Street on the Saturday—I did not hear Mr. Naylor say anything to him, only that he would not go to Bow Street, and then the policeman said he would summons him—that was all that was said—I saw the prisoner outside the Bow Street Police Court on the Saturday, and he told us we were to be up there on the Monday—we went up on the Monday, and the policeman called me and Mr. Navlor on one side, and said he had sworn that the cabman had pushed me and Mr. Naylor out of the cart, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187109180051"/>
               <p>that he had broken seven spokes, and that we were to swear the same—I am quite sure about that—I did not hear Mr. Naylor say anything to that—about five minutes afterwards we were called up into Bow Street—I was not called—I did not hear anything of the sort sworn; only when I was going to say it they stopped me; just as I was going to say it, they called some other gentleman.</p>

I have been about with Naylor ever since—I have not talked this matter over with him; never—I was not just going to say that we were <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> out of the cart—I was going to tell the Magistrate what the prisoner had told me to say—I remember being examined on the charge of perjury against the prisoner—I did not say a word then about the prisoner having said this to me—I was not examined on the charge of furious driving—I have never said a word about it until to-day—I signed my deposition—it was read over to me—Naylor did not tell me to say it—I have remembered it all this time—our cart was not dragged along 20 or 30 yards up against the omnibus, only just from where the pavement is to where the omnibus was, at the next corner—the omnibus was standing still at the brewery corner, with the horses' heads towards the City—I don't know whether we were dragged at all—we were trying to cross the traffic—the cabman did not whip up the horse—he never whipped it up—I did not see him use the whip—I don't recollect that I said he touched his horse up; I did not say it—he did touch it with the whip, to go straight in the line of the City, the way he was going—he dragged our cart away from the direction it was going, over against the omnibus—I don't know what distance it was dragged, about the length of this Court—I was not jerked on my seat a bit—I felt the collision—I did not jump down directly—Mr. Naylor got out on his own side, where he was sitting, to see whether there was any damage done, directly the collision took place—I think Naylor got out first—I was sitting on the side where the step caught the <hi rend="italic">'bus,</hi> and I could not get out on that side—that was the side nearest the brewery, the near side—I could not get out, owing to the step of the cart having struck against the wheel of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—we were right against the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—Naylor got down on to the ground—I think he got on to the steps of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> afterwards, to get the A R on it—that was before the constable came up—the constable could not have seen him on the step of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—he had got everything done before the constable came up—I noticed the cab till it went on to the next corner, by Meux's Brewery, opposite Arthur Street—he did not pull up at all—I did not notice him—Naylor was not put out or angry about this—I don't know what "excited" is—I did not go into a public-house with Naylor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—two children were brought there between 10 and 11 o'clock on the night of 21st August—the elder one, the boy, had nothing the matter with him then—the younger one was suffering from opium poisoning—that was indicated by extreme paleness of the body; the face in particular—it was quite comatose, perfectly insensible in every way, the conjunctive insensible, it would not act in the least; not sensible to touch, in a state resembling deep sleep, it was almost impossible to arouse it—the pupils were very much con<lb/>tracted, almost to pins' points—I was told that they had both been poisoned with opium, and what I saw led me to the opinion that they had had opium—I did not administer an emetic, I used the stomach pump, as being more quick and effectual—I washed the stomach out thoroughly, and that pro<lb/>duced vomiting by reflex irritation—every means were used, and next morn<lb/>ing, about 8 o'clock, it evinced signs of sensibility, and eventually perfectly recovered from the effect of that opium poisoning—it has since died—the boy was not suffering at all at the time—he had had an emetic adminis<lb/>tered by Dr. Muller; he was discharged from the hospital two or three days after—he was not treated at all, there was no necessity for it—they were both kept there for two or three days, simply as a matter of charity, or convenience.</p>

Common Law Stamps, two for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., two for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and four for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "Is that all you have got?—he said "On my honour, it is"—I asked him where he got them from—he said that they were sent to him by the son of a miller, in Norfolk, in part payment of a debt of 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him it was very unsatisfactory, and he would have to go with me to Bow Street police-station—I took him, along with another constable, named Partridge—in Vinegar Yard, on the way to the station, I saw him withdraw his left hand from his trowsers pocket, and he rushed away from us, towards the urinal—I said "Tom, he has thrown something away, in my opinion; he has nothing in his hand now, and he had something"—we ran after him—he ran nothing Old Jewry public-house—I caught him, and took him to the station—I saw Hines at the station, and told him I had reason to believe that the prisoner had thrown something away, "Run back, and see what it is"—he went back—I searched the prisoner's house, and found some skeleton keys.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Little Thames Street, Greenwich, and am a single woman—I knew the deceased and the prisoner, and on the 13th July I saw them at the North Woolwich Gardens—when on the boat I heard a conversation between them which attracted my attention—the prisoner said to the deceased that he was going to Birmingham, and she said that he should not—I left them, and walked to the other end of the boat—I joined them afterwards, and we all three went together into the Gardens—we took some refreshment there—I left the prisoner and the deceased together, and went to the square platform—the deceased came there, too, and commenced dancing with a gentleman—in about ten minutes my attention was again called to the prisoner and to the deceased—I was walking down a path, and heard a scream of "Murder!"—I went to the place, and saw the deceased, bleeding very much from the nose, mouth, and left eye—I asked her who had done it, but she did not answer—the prisoner turned round, and said "I have done it; it was quite an accident"—he was holding her round the neck, and had a handkerchief up to her eye—I made one remark, which I cannot recollect now, and a policeman asked me to move on, or he would take me—the prisoner again turned, and said "Leave her alone; she's her sister, and is a little excited; I will look after them"—I went with the deceased to the hotel, for the purpose of having her eye dressed—the prisoner went with us—the deceased said that her eye was nearly into her head—when the prisoner was following her, she said that he was her husband, and they were not to hurt him—after her eye had been dressed by a doctor, we returned by boat to Greenwich—we went to South Woolwich first, where the prisoner tried to get a cab, but could not; and ultimately we engaged a little boat, and so got home—the prisoner stayed with us all night and next day—the deceased was attended by a doctor—I heard the prisoner use threats to her about two months ago—they were having a few words—they used to live as husband and wife—I have known her for about three years, and the prisoner for about three months—about two months ago I heard were quarrelling—I was in the next room at the time—I heard him say also, "I will murder you"—I never saw him strike her.</p>

               <p>about an hour—we were drinking most of the time—then we went home, and subsequently to Deptford—we asked the prisoner to take us to North Woolwich Gardens, and at first he declined—the deceased persuaded him to go, and on our way we stayed at Mr. Beach's, the Mariner's Arms, I believe, in North Woolwich—we had had some drink before that at the Ship Tavern, in Greenwich, just before we crossed the water—we had some refreshment, too, on the boat—we stayed at the Mariner's Arms for about an hour—the prisoner wanted to remain there a little longer—I did not see him give the deceased any money, or tell her to go by herself—I saw them separate in about an hour after we got there—I went with the deceased, and she began dancing with a gentleman on the square platform—I think she danced with two—there were four or five gentlemen together, and she took refreshment with them—I did not hear the prisoner say anything to her about it—I went away with a gentleman to another refreshment bar—I saw her drinking five or six times in the Gardens—when I heard the cry I was walking down one of the avenues, towards the square platform—the avenue was lighted with gas—I believe it was the chief avenue—I was very near the end of it, going to the square platform, and furthest from the gate—I was with a gentleman—he is not present to-day—there were no persons in that part of the Gardens—the cry came from the right—it was a cry of "Murder!"—I was about, a dozen yards from the place—the deceased and the prisoner were standing at the corner of the avenue—it was quite light there—I saw them before I heard the cry—several young ladies and gentlemen came up, and a crowd collected—I have not noticed any of the persons present to-day—the deceased was bleeding from the nose, and mouth, and left eye—she had a hand<lb/>kerchief up to her eye, and I removed it—the prisoner was holding the handkerchief—when I asked who had done it; he said "I was swinging my umbrella across my shoulder, not thinking that she was near me; I think she must have been behind me at the time"—he said this as we were going towards the hotel—someone fetched a doctor—a gentleman came up the avenue, and I was going to take her away, when he said "I am a doctor; let me see her"—someone brought a little cold water, and he bathed her eye with it—then we went across the river—the deceased did not say any<lb/>thing to me as to how she had been injured—when we got to South Woolwich we went to a public-house, and waited there, whilst the prisoner tried to get a cab—we had something to drink there—we had to get a little boat to take us to Greenwich—the deceased lay at the bottom of the boat—I think it leaked a good deal; at all events, we had to get out, in consequence of the water coming in—I heard the prisoner say that he was sorry for what he had done, and he hoped she would soon get better—I attended to her up to the Monday—the prisoner was at the house constantly—she was then removed to the hospital—he nursed her when he was at home—it was about two months ago when I heard him threaten her—I was in the front bedroom, and they in the back—I did not hear the cause of the quarrel, nor did I think he would injure her at" the time—they lived together for about three months—they became perfectly friendly after their quarrel in the boat—when the prisoner said he was going to Birmingham, the deceased replied, "You shall not go, Bill."</p>

About 12.40, pa the morning of 23rd August, I was on duty in the North Woolwich Road, and saw the prisoners there—I saw a telegraph pole which had been sawn down by the side of the railway wall—I saw the prisoners take hold of that pole, and pull it across the North Woolwich Road—the pole was about 25 or 30 feet long—they walked down the road, and I removed the pole back to where it was lying first—I then saw police constable Scott, and made a communi<lb/>cation to him—the prisoners came back again, and put the pole on the top of the wall—a man and woman came across the railway bridge, and the prisoners moved the pole back again—they placed the pole on the top of the wall again—Sampson jumped over the wall, and took hold of the this end of it, and Swanson shoved it further over the wall—Swanson was in the road—Sampson got over the wall again, and they ran into Swanson's house, which is almost opposite—I went with Scott to where the pole was—it was straight over the platform and across the line—it was on the plat<lb/>form, and about 3ft. above the line; it extended about 7ft. over the line—subsequently I went to Swanson's house—both the prisoners came to the door—I charged them with placing the pole across the road, and took Swanson into custody—Sampson ran through the back of the house, and male his escape—Swanson was sober—he said they only did it for a lark.</p>

About 12.45, on the morning of 23rd August, I was on duty in the North Woolwich Road—I saw a pole lying by the side of the railway wall—I saw the two prisoners take up the pole, and place it across the road—they went down the road—I went after them, and met the last witness, who had just removed the pole to the side of the wall again—we came back to the top of the road, and watched them—they came up the road again to where the pole was lying—they got it near the top of the wall, some persons were coming, and they put it down again, and sat on it—when the persons had passed they took the pole up again, and put it on the top of the wall—Sampson jumped other the wall, and took hold of the end, and Swanson had hold of the other end; and in that way they carried it forward, and left it in the position We found it—Sampson came over the wall again, and they went into the house—we went up, and found the pole was lying at right angles with the line, extending over it 7 ft.—the height of the platform is about 2ft. 6 in.—an engine coming past would hit it—it extended over one rail, and was about 6 in. short of the other—we went to Swanson's house—they both came to the door—Sampson ran out at the back—I took him the next day, near the Stratford Police Court—Swanson said he only did it for a lark; he did not think it would be so serious.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlady of 40, Bermondsey Square—the prisoners lodged there from October, 1865, until 12th August, last year—a child was born on 28th February, 1870—it was a very beautiful baby—I never saw such a remarkably fine child—it continued exceedingly healthy and strong up to the tenth or eleventh month; then it began to fall off—it was weaned between the twelfth and thirteenth month—I told the mother if she had not sufficient milk for the child, to feed it; it was too long to go on nursing it, the milk was of no benefit to it—after it was weaned I saw it three or four times a day—up to fifteen or sixteen weeks ago, the mother had gone out to day work at a firm in Bermondsey Street, furring—before that she was at home—she did not go regularly to work she did not take the child with her—at times, for a short time, it was taken out for a few hours, and there Was a girl had for a week to attend to it, but she did not do so as she ought—the mother frequently left the child; I have known it to be left from 10 o'clock or 10.30 in the morning until 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, with no one to attend to it, except I have gone in and out, or perhaps one of my lodgers—sometimes there would be a little bit of dry bread left for it, and on many occasions nothing at all, except what I or my lodgers have taken—I have many times given it food, it has taken it very ravenously—I have repeatedly told both the father and mother that I was satisfied the child had not sufficient food given to it—I repeatedly spoke to her about it up to the time of her being takes into custody, and about the child being so neglected—I have repeatedly told him of her being so drunk as she has been, and the child being so neglected—he said he was out at his work, and he did not know what was going on at home, and she has told me to mind my own business—she would be drunk for three or four days at a time—I have seen her in that state when she has come back at 5.30 in the evening—her husband knew that she was an habitual drunkard—I have known them on many occasions sit down to meals, and the child lying on the bed crying—if anything was given to it, it would cease crying, when it was hungry—it was more often crying than not, both before and after it was weaned—when I have spoken to her about it, she has said "It is such a hungry little hog I can't satisfy it, give it what I will"—I always considered her to be an extremely dirty, neglectful, and cruel mother to it, in every respect—I have heard her say she had no love towards the child, and she wished it was dead—on the morning of 12th August, she told me that she was then going into the workhouse, and when the child was dead and buried she should come out again, for it would save a wonderful deal of trouble and bother in my house—the husband left about 5.30 or 6 o'clock in the morning, to go to work; sometimes it would be 8 o'clock before he went out, and he would return in the evening.</p>

I am Medical Officer of Bermondsey Workhouse—on Saturday, 12th August I was called to see the prisoners child, at 40, Bermondsey Square—it was lying up some dirty bedding, on a broken-down bedstead, looking very dirty and pale; the eyes and cheeks sunk, the surface of the body cold, the pulse indistinct, and the skin had a shiny appearance, as though it had not been washed for some time—there was rather laboured breathing, and inanition; the abdomen was collapsed, quite soft—the body generally was very much emaciated—it weighed 131/2 lbs. with its clothes on; it ought to have weighed about 24lbs.—it was a large child, with a bony outline—I asked the woman what food she had given the child</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187109180082"/>
               <p>that day—she said "A pennyworth of milk, half a pint"—this was between 2 and 3 o'clock in the day—I asked her if she had ever given him food on any day—she said she had given only a halfpennyworth on a certain day—she was partially intoxicated, and I thought it unnecessary to question her more—the child was then removed to the workhouse, where I at<lb/>tended it till it died the next day, on Sunday, the 13th, about 4 o'clock—everything was done for it; it had food every two hours—I could not detect any disease—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination fifteen hours after death, and came to the conclusion that there was no disease, but that it died of starvation.</p>

Carter, Wood, &amp; Co., of the Ar<lb/>tillery Brewery, Victoria Street, Westminster—the prisoner was lessee and occupier of the Greyhound Tavern, Streatham Common—on 10th April he was adjudicated a bankrupt, and on the 28th of the same month I was ap<lb/>pointed trustee and receiver of the estate—William Ward and George Rae were the inspectors—the next day, or the day after, I went to the tavern to take possession of the property—I saw the prisoner and his wife, and they asked to be allowed to remain there—I said that I would consent to their doing so, but that I must place a barman there as my representative, to conduct the business—in the month of June the prisoner signed a memo<lb/>randum, agreeing to give up peaceable possession of the premises, and to with draw when desired to do so—on the 7th August, from what I heard, I sent a man named Perkins to watch the premises, and in consequence of a notice,</p>

               <p>which I received from the inspectors, I wont there myself on the 9th, about 3.45, accompanied by Mr. Armstrong, a clerk to Messrs. Burchell, solicitors, Mr. Brett, an accountant, Mr. Powell, and others—I saw the prisoner, and read to him the notice I had received, which ordered me to insist on his im<lb/>mediate withdrawal from the tavern, and to take such measures as I should think fit it to effect it—the prisoner was in the bar-parlour on the ground floor, and asked me to wait until to-morrow—I appealed to the clerk, and he said it was necessary that the prisoner should leave at once—I said he could have half an hour, or an hour, to pack up his things, and if he would give me an address I would send the remainder to him—he said that he had only few shillings—I replied that he should not go away penniless, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and promised to pay him weekly the cum which the Court of Bankruptcy might allow—he then said he would go, and proceeded up stairs, followed by Brett—I went in about half an hour to see where he was, and I found him in a little sitting-room on the left hand side of the stairs—I asked him when he was going—he hummd and had for some time, and then went to his bedroom, and I followed him, there about two minutes afterwards, and saw him standing by the mantelpiece, on the oppo<lb/>site side—there was a case like a pistol case before him—shortly afterwards a friend of mine, Mr. Jamieson, entered the room—he had spoken to the prisoner previously, and had appealed to him masonically to leave the pro<lb/>mises in a peaceable manner—the prisoner went into the bedroom for a certain purpose, and shut the door—the pistol-case, was open, and the prisoner took a revolver from it—in a moment he turned round, and pointed it at me—I jumped back, and slammed the door to hard as I could—Mr. Jamieson, was at the head of the door, said in front of me—we both made down stairs as last as possible—the prisoner rushed out of his bed-room, and fired at us—I had descended alert seventh stairs, when I heard a cap snap—I was turning a part of the stairs; when he fired again, and a bullet passe'd about 3 or 4 in. from my head—in a moment or so the prisoner fired a third time, and the bullet entered the wainscotting—it would have gone through me if I had kept straight down the stairs—it lodged in a part of the wall, about 6 in. above my head—Mr. Perkins, and two policemen, rushed up, secured the prisoner, and took the revolver from him.</p>

I have known the prisoner for about six years—I remember his taking the Castle public-house, in Chapel Street, Westminster—that was in 1859 or 1860—I never heard say, at that time, that he had been in America, and had received a sunstroke when there—I never entered into the details of his past life—I do not remember his having an apoplectic fit whilst living at the Castle—I have heard that a Mr. Bryant has been his solicitor of late—I did not advise the prisoner as to taking the Greyhound—he was out of business for some time before he did so—I saw him probably once a week, whilst he lived there—I used to go there as a collector for my firm—I never observed that a small quantity of alcoholic drink had an effect upon him—Messrs. Wood have a' mortgage upon a certain sum of money, secured on the house at Streatham—I think when the prisoner entered it, he paid 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the premium—the ground rent was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—the prisoner had money of his own, to the amount of 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., find borrowed, I believe, 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Messrs.

               <p>of a little <hi rend="italic">brush</hi> or two, till the present year—I was not aware that he signed bills for the accommodation of other persons—I knew of his being involved in a Chancery suit—Mr. Wood, at the wish of the prisoner, was the petitioning creditor in bankruptcy, and I was appointed receiver of the estate—Mr. Bryant was the solicitor—it was a business and not a friendly bankruptcy—Mr. Brett is an accountant, employed by Carter, Wood, &amp; Co.—Mr. Ward was the previous tenant of the Greyhound, and he acted on behalf of Messrs. Tickers, the distillers—I did not undertake that the prisoner and his family should not be turned out of the house—the memo<lb/>randum as to the withdrawal was obtained, because I wished the transaction to be conducted as orderly as possible—I think the Chancery suit was tried this year—I went to his house about once a week after the bankruptcy proceedings were commenced—I placed a barman there, to take the money, because, after the first week, the prisoner did not bring to me sufficient cash for what I believed he had sold—I put in two men with authority—I had some rough men on the common, on the 9th August, to net if force was required to eject the prisoner—Mr. Jamieson was there accidentally—he saw my cab at the door, came in, and offered to mediate between us—I never have been engaged in any forcible expulsion of a tenant—I heard on the 5th August that the prisoner was much incensed against me—ho was, in fact, bound over to keep the peace—on the 8th August I had occasion to go to the Police Court, in consequence of his violent conduct and demeanour—I was led to suppose that he had firearms about him, and I watched him—Mr. Cooper had told me that he had walked about with a revolver in his pocket, and had threatened to shoot anyone who interfered with him—I went into his bedroom simply because I had a duty to perform, and was determined to do it—I knew he had piles, but he did not go to his bedroom for the purpose that has been stated—he went there certainly, and I followed in about three or four minutes—I had a presentiment that he meant to do something wrong—when I heard Jamieson cry out that the prisoner had a pistol, I ran down stairs as fast as I could—when I got to the bottom of the stairs, I turned sharply to the right, and the second bullet missed my head—I had told the prisoner that I was prepared to use violence if it was necessary—Mrs. Mills left after the shooting—no money was given <hi rend="italic">to</hi> her, because she had the takings of three or four days—more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. certainly—the prisoner had threatened the men in possession with violence, and they were afraid of him, and complained of his conduct.</p>

               <p>had a night commode in the room, and then I closed the door and left—I met Mr. Estnll on the landing, and told him what had occurred, when he said that he did not believe the prisoner, and would see what he was doing—he looked through the crack of the door, and saw Mills capping his pistol—as Mr. Estall stood at the door, the prisoner presented the revolver at his head, and I exclaimed "Good heaven, he is going to fire!"—I jumped down the first flight of stairs as quickly as I could, and was followed by Mr. Estall—as I turned round the landing, the prisoner appeared at the door of his room, took a dead level at us, and fired the cap, but the barrel did not explode—had it done so, the bullet might have gone through my head, so close was I to the man at the time—when half way down the second landing, I heard a bullet whiz close by my head, and it lodged in the: wainscoting, about a foot above my right eye—when I reached the bottom, and was looking for the nearest way to escape, I heard a second explosion, and another bullet passed close by Mr. Estall, and lodged in the door frame—the prisoner was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had nothing whatever to do with the public-house—I have valued the property of publicans—this was the firth occasion of my being in a public-house when the landlord was to be turned out—I re<lb/>member the case to which you allude—you withdrew from the prosecution, one of the prisoners pleaded guilty—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me—I had not the slightest idea, when I called at the Greyhound, that Mr. Estall would be there was not told there was to be a spree at the house—I should not consider it a spree, but as a serious piece Of business—I did net see the roughs collect, but there was a very full bar—I told the police all that occurred, whilst the facts were fresh in my memory—I said a good many things at the Court which dire not in my deposition—they said they were not material to the case—I told the Magistrate about the prisoner cappingrthe pistot; that does not appear in my deposition—two barrels only were discharged—I advised the prisoner to leave without making a dis<lb/>turbance, as it would be better for him afterwards.</p>

I aid the landlord of the Woodham Tavern, Upper Norwood—I know the prosecutor and the prisoner—on the after<lb/>noon of 1st August, Mills came to my house, and we had some conversation about the Greyhound—he said he had not sold it, and thought he ought to have at least 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself—he then said he thought the b——s, Mr. Eatall and the others, would rob him of it—I said I thought Mr. Estall would not do that—he replied there was no tolling what they would do—they wanted him to leave, or to get him out, but he would make it hot for them before they did—he said "Before they turn me out I will put something through the b——'s heads."</p>

I am the wife of George Chadwick, of 2, Alpha Cottages, Sheepcote Lane, Battersea—on Saturday night, 12th August, David Chapman and his wife were supping with us—I went out, with Mrs. Chapman, about 11.55, to fetch a half-gallon of beer—we met Mr. and Mrs. Brown in Henley Street—he asked me for a drop of beer, and I gave it him—we were coming down Henley Street, and saw Mr. Pearman, and his brother-in-law, Cox—Pearman said "There goes the b——Irish w——, and false witness," meaning me—he got pushing me and Mrs. Chapman about—Brown said "Who do you mean? do you mean me and my wife?"—he said "Yes, the b——lot of you, and specially Mrs. Chadwick, the Irish <hi rend="italic">musk</hi>"—he still continued pushing us about, and with that, Mrs. Chapman called out "Murder!"—Mr. Chapman overheard the cries, and rushed from my house, to see what was the matter—he no sooner came up to us than Mr. Pearman said "Here comes the b—b—," and Chapman was knocked down over a heap of dirt—he got up again, and was knocked down against the fence, and Pear</p>

If you do, we are not Irish"—Pearman said "The b——lot of you, and the b——Irish w—there," meaning me—I said "Oh, Mr. Brown, do you hear what that mail says to me"—Brown said "Yes, I do"—Pearman said "What did you say?" catching Brown by the collar of his coat—Brown said "Never mind what I say, keep your hands off of me, I don't want to have anything to say to you, nor to do with you; if you don't, I will spend a pound upon you"—Pearman said "I can spend 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon you, and as for that dirty muck there, I could spend more upon her"—I never made any answer—he kept shoving us down the street and abusing us; when we came to the bottom of the street, he collared me by the neck—I screamed, and my screams brought my husband out from Mrs. Chadwick's, without his shoes—Pearman said "Here comes the b——man," and when he came up he faced my husband, and threw him over a heap of dirt, and as soon as he rose on his legs, I saw Mrs. Pearman put her hand in her</p>

The Pearmans have sometimes been very aggravating to me—we have not been on bad terms, for I have not spoken to them till lately—Mr. Pearman has been the worst, he always began it—I did not quarrel with him much, I always shut my door up—I took out a summons against them for abusive language, and he took one out against me afterwards—this occurred a fortnight after that—Mrs. Chadwick and I went out to get a half-gallon of beer for supper—we had only had a pot between five of us, above 9 o'clock—I think they brought that from a beer-shop, but I was not there when it came—Brown was not a friend of mine, I don't suppose I ever spoke half-a-dizen words to him—he asked for a drop of the beer, and we did not refuse, he only met us coming down the street—he had nothing to do with us—I did not come out and spit in Mr. or Mrs. Pearman's face—my husband did not run out and strike Mrs. Pearman on the nose, or knock Mr. Pearman down—I did not see any blood on Pearman's face; the only blood I saw on Pearman was the blood on his clothes, from my husband, where he laid on him—I did not see that he had received a severe injury on his face—I did not go to Mrs. Pearman and pull her hat off—I did not pull her ear; I never touched her ear—I did not pull her back hair down—I caught her by the head, and pulled her off my husband, and shoved her back—I don't know that a piece of an earning was found at the spot—I saw it in the Court, at Wandsworth—I don't know that it belonged to Mrs. Pearman—I did not pull it off—on my dying oath, I never touched it—I swear that I saw her put her hand in the right hand pocket of her frock, take out a knife, and hand it to her husband—I should not know the knife if I saw it—the policeman has told me that he found a knife; I have seen that, I could not say that was the knife—the first stab I saw was when Pearman stabbed my husband towards the breast; I could not say what part of the breast it was—I have seen a girl named Graham up here—I did not see her on this occasion—I did not see her about an hour afterwards and say to her "Will you go up to the Court and say that you saw Mr. Pearman stab Mr. Chapman?"—she did not reply that she would not go up, nor did I say, if she would, I would give her sixpence; I can be on my dying oath that I never spoke to the girl—I did not send her for a doctor, it was an elderly woman, living in Henley Street, that fetched him—I don't know Martha Wills (<hi rend="italic">Wills was called in</hi>) I know that woman by sight, but I never spoke to her—I did not shortly after this occurrence come into the garden with that woman</p>
