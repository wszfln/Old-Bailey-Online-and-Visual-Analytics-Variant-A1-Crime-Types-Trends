On the 6th of June, about twenty minutes or a quarter before nine o'clock at night, I locked up the stable; I returned about a quarter past ten, and found the three prisoners there - Smith stood with the door ajar; I said, "What are you doing here?" I collared him and led him out - he whispered to me, and said there were two more in the stable. He was about a yard within the door; I held him fast, and pulled the door too with my left hand. Wheeler, the groom, locked the door, and called the watchman. I held Smith. A watchman came, and called two others; we opened the door, went in, and found Wright and Wells in the stable; they had moved from the bed-room to the stable five coats, three pairs of breeches, two stable jackets, a silk handkerchief and other things - I had seen them all in the bed-room(which is over the coach-house, and is part of the stable) that afternoon; they all laid loose on the stable floor - one coat was tied in a silk handkerchief, which did not belong to us - they were livery coats. The stable joins master's house, and is surrounded by the same wall - there is a way through the house into the stable.</p>

I was with Benwell, and saw all the men secured, and saw the clothes which had been removed; Smith had three of the coachman's coats on his back, besides his own, when we took him - they are all strangers.

We hope you will shew us mercy, as we are entirely innocent, but were led into it by this man.</p>

I had not been there many minutes when Raymond whispered across the table to Johnson; I became alarmed, and wanted to go out; Raymond said I should not go unless I tossed with them for a pot of beer - I refused, but he said I should not go out till I did - I then tossed, and lost; he said I should not go till I had tossed for another pot, which I also lost; I threw a shilling on the table, then jumped over the table, to get away, but I was directly surrounded by eight or ten of them - the four prisoners were among them; I cannot say that they laid hands on me - my arms were held up, and my throat seized, but I do not know who by; I felt some hands in my pocket, and my money was taken from me, but I cannot say who did it. As soon as they let me go I went to the door; there was a watchman there, I told him I was robbed, and a young man came to the door with another watchman; we all four went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120004"/>in together - I pointed Raymond and Cowley out; they were taken to the watch-house; I said there were two more whom I could describe; as soon as I entered the room Johnson held his head down; he was taken. The watchman went to the bar, and asked the landlord who officiated as waiter; he said George - he called out, "George," and Lovell came along the passage; I said he was the man, and he was taken. I lost a sovereign and 2s. 2d. When we got to the watch-house Lovell said to Raymond, "You know who has got the sovereign as well as I do;" Raymond said, No, he did not - Lovell said, "Yes you do - it is Bill or Jack - I do not know his other name, but you do."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. In whose employ are you? A. In Mr. Palmer's, of Bishopsgate-street. I then lived with Mr. Dobson, of the Strand. There were twenty or thirty persons in the room, and some females, but none at the table with us. Raymond did not complain of losing money in the scuffle - he did not ask me to drink; I believe he said he was a bricklayer, and I said I was a paper-stainer. I am certain that when they let go of my throat the four prisoners were round me, and before they took hold of it they were all as close to me as they could be. I had not talked to any females. It was quite daylight; there was no disturbance except with their surrounding me - the prisoners surrounded me, and prevented my going out, or I should not have been robbed. I cannot say who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Were you not sitting between two women of the town? A. As God is my judge it is false - I spoke to no woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LOVELL. Q. Did you not knock at the door about half-past three o'clock? A. I was in bed at that time; the doors were open when I went in.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Giles'. I was in my box about half-past four o'clock on this morning, when Harman called out Watch! I went to the door - his waistcoat was unbuttoned, and he seemed much agitated; he said he had been robbed, and was in dread of his life; I asked him to go in and point them out - he said he would wait at the door, and they would be out presently; he pointed out Raymond and Cowley; I took them to the watch-house. I returned to the public-house, and he pointed out Johnson in the tap-room; he said the other officated as waiter; I asked the landlord where he was - he called George, and Lovell came; I secured him, and at the watch-house he said to Raymond, "You know who has got the sovereign," or the money; Raymond said, "I know nothing of it." A young man had come out of the house to look for a watchman, before Hariman called me; I cannot find him now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the prisoners? A. Yes - I found several shillings on Cowley, but nothing on the others; he was outside the door when I took him; the man who fetched me pointed him out, and Harman identified him; Harman did not appear intoxicated.</p>
               <p>RAYMOND's Defence. I got up that morning to get some spirits to send to my father-in-law, at Birmingham - I went into the Black Dog, and the prosecutor asked me to drink out of his pot; I sat down, and joined his company; he was between two girls of the town - he said he would toss me for a pot of beer; I did not like it, but Cowley whispered to me to toss him - I tossed, and won two pots - he put a shilling down; I took it to take for the beer: he then offered to fight any man in the room for a sovereign - he had some words with another man, and stepped over the table - he was surrounded, but I was sitting at the table. - When he went out I followed, and he said it was through me he was robbed. I lost 6s. myself in getting over the table.</p>
               <p>The other prisoners made the same Defence.</p>

After tripping me up Wilson took my hat from my head, and in endeavouring to get my hat back they drove my head against the wall - they all three beat my head against the wall - they said nothing; they got my hat, and then ran away; I felt very great pain in my knee, and my head was bruised in the fall. The moment they ran away I observed that my breeches pocket was cut completely out; I had a shilling and 7d. in copper there, and the key of my trunk; my pocket handkerchief was taken from my coat pocket; every think was safe just before; they all made the best of their way off, and I after them; I called out Watch! as loud as I could - none came; but in about two minutes after I got up into my bed-room two watchmen came up, and asked if I was the young man who had been robbed - I stated to them what had happened; one of the watchmen said he knew them, and told me to let it remain till next night - I had seen both the prisoners about the streets in the neighbourhood several times before, but never spoke to them. Wilson was taken on the 13th - I saw him in Pearson's custody - and on the 14th I saw Haggerty in custody at Marlborough-street; I saw them taken - I pointed Wilson out in Church-street, and next day pointed Haggerty out - I knew them well, and swear they are two of the men. I have not found any of my property - it was all taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILSON. Q. Did I get out of your sight? A. Yes, you turned a corner, and I lost you. I had told Pearson of it on the 13th, when I saw him in the street.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 13th of June I saw Williams at the end of Bainbridge-street - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120005"/>said he had been robbed on the Monday; he described Wilson to me, and said he had seen him that night - I told him to go and look for him; he came back to me, and said he had seen him; I went with him to the end of Church-street, where Wilson was sitting on a post - I secured him; Williams had described Haggerty to me, and I took him next day; the prosecutor stood close by - I said, "Is that him?" he said Yes, and I took him; they both said they were not the persons. I found nothing on them relating to the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILSON. Q. You said the prosecutor charged me with robbing him of his hat, and I said I heard so twenty minutes before, and had thrown myself in your way on purpose to clear myself? A. You did not say so to me.</p>
               <p>HAGGERTY's Defence. When he took Wilson from the post I was on the opposite side of the way - the prosecutor knew it, and did not point me out; he said it was a stouter lad than me. On the 13th the officer came and took me - I made no resistance; he took me up to Williams' room - fifteen or sixteen people were there; he asked him if I was the lad; he said No I was not, for there were two a great deal stouter than me, and the other was taller; the officer said,"Are you positive of it?" and he said, "Yes, you may let him go, and he did so. On the 14th I was going along the street, and was taken - Williams said then that I was the lad, and at the office he said he had said I was not because he wanted to take us all together.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WILLIAMS re-examined. I saw him in the street some time before, but not at the identical time that Wilson was taken; I saw him the same evening, but several people persuaded me not to take him into custody. I never said it was a stouter lad than him - I said the one who took the hat was a larger man; I never said he was not the man; he was taken twice - a Bow-street officer took him the first time - I said he was not the person who took my hat, but was one of the party; the officer let him go - I had no doubt of him; I only said he was not the person who took my hat, as I wished to get Wilson.</p>
               <p>WILSON's Defence. I knew nothing of the robbery till twenty minutes before I was taken, when a woman came and said the officers were after me for robbing a man named Williams, of Church-street, of his hat - I said I was innocent, and went into Church-street, and sat on a post at the corner of Bainbridge-street; a man came and said I was charged with stealing a hat, and somebody had gone for an officer - he had not been gone a minute before the officer came and said, "Williams charges you with stealing his hat" - I said I thought so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he strike you with one hand and at the same moment snatch the watch with the other? A. Yes - the blow was first, and I felt him pulling my watch - he struck me violently with one hand, and was pulling at the same moment with the other; I felt the blow before I felt him pulling - it was done as near as possible together, for it was all done in five minutes or less - he wrenched the watch round, and got it in a moment; he ran away - I pursued him down three streets, till I was stopped by the mob, somewhere in St. Giles' - I do not know the name of the place; he got quite away - I had no opportunity of seeing his face; I only saw his size and height as he ran before me; the man was the prisoner's size as exactly as possible; I believe from his size, and what I saw of him, that he is the man, but my sister, who was with me, can tell more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the person standing with his back or his face towards you? A. I did not see him standing - he came with his face towards me, and struck me, but he held his head down, and darted right against me - he ran away immediately; I followed, and was stopped as I turned the third corner; I had come to near the same place as where I was robbed; I followed him into the same street again; he got clear away. I afterwards went to Clerkenwell prison, but did not see the prisoner - I pointed out a person there as being about the size of the man, but did not say he was the man. I did not see the prisoner in the yard; I said a lad there was near the size of the man, but I did not like to identify him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's sister. I was walking with her up George-street, St. Giles'; I was about a yard before my sister; I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the wall as we turned out of George-street into Phoenix-street; he was standing with his back against the wall as I passed him; I took particular notice of him when I passed him, seeing him standing there, so decently dressed, and in such a low place - he had white trousers on then; I saw his face as I passed him, and am certain he is the man; I passed him before my sister - I heard her scream, then turned round, and she said, "He has got my watch;" I knew she had her watch before, for she looked to see if it was right by St. Giles' church; I saw her watch was gone, and instantly followed the prisoner, who ran; I followed him round three streets, without losing sight of him; he got round into the same street again, very near to where he had taken it, but the mob came up so strong I could go no further - I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the person standing at the corner? A. Yes, with your face towards me; I saw your face; any body passing might see it; I ran first, and my sister followed, but we were parted.</p>

               <p>MISS HARRIET ORCHARD re-examined.

            . I am a labourer, and live in George-street, St. Giles'. On the 8th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner standing against the dead wall, opposite my window - I am certain of his person. I saw these two young ladies come up the street; I saw him make a drive at one of them, but what he took I could not see; she had a reticule in her hand I think; she screamed out, and both of them ran after him: my leg was so bad I could not go out to follow him: a crowd collected directly, and several people pursued. I did not see whether he got any thing away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you? A.

            . On the 8th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along George-street, and saw the prisoner; I turned round to speak to Fitzgerald, whom I knew - he was going up the court; the prisoner ran down the court; Fitzgerald put his arm out to catch him, but he slipped down just by him, and ran towards a mob of people, who made way for him to pass between them; these two ladies came up - I took them into a shop, went out to find the beadle, and described the man to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the ladies coming up George-street? A. No, coming down Church-street, I think it is called; Fitzgerald caught you in his arms, coming down the passage; you went round, and came down the passage, so that the ladies met you; I went down Broad-street, and lost sight of you by Phoenix-street.</p>

On the 8th of June I was standing by my own door, and heard a cry that a lady had been robbed - I turned round into the adjoining street, and saw a young man running towards me; conceiving him to be the thief I remained quiet till he came up, then caught him in my arms, but he slipped away; this was in Ivy-street, St. Giles' - it leads into George-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you when you heard the cry? A. Standing at my own door; I saw the ladies running, and a young man in a blue coat and white trousers running before them; I stopped him; I cannot swear you are the man: I caught hold of him in Ivy-street, which was formerly called Rats' Castle; there was nobody very near him. I did not notice who was in the street; a good many people followed him; when he got from me he ran into George-street, and turned, I believe, to the right.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of June, in George-street, St. Giles'.</p>
               <p>JENKIN STRADLING re-examined. I know the prisoner to be the man; I pointed him out at Bow-street, from among other prisoners; he had changed his dress, but I knew him; I saw Fitzgerald lay hold of him, but I do not know the name of the street it was in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of June I was walking down George-street - a man laid hold of me, and said he wanted me, and his brother officer had been insulted in St. Giles'; I said I knew nothing about it: he took me to Bow-street; a gentleman came and looked at me in a little time, and Duke said, "You know what is the matter now?" I said No, and about eight o'clock I was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded till Monday. The first witness came to the House of Correction, with Mr. Beeby, a young gentleman, and another; every body in the yard was told to stand round - the young lady looked round, and said she believed a young man named Anderson was the person; Beeby said, "Put on your hat, and turn round; he did so, and she said she believed he was the person. At my examination on Monday the lady and two or three more witnesses came against me, but none of them swore to me; I was remanded for another week; then Adams and the lady's sister swore I was the person. Now the first witness says she saw me standing at the corner of Phoenix-street, with my head down, that I snatched her watch and ran, and she lost me in turning the third street; the next witness swears she saw me at the corner, holding my head up, that any body might see my face, and when her sister screamed she followed, and in turning the third street she saw a person lay hold of me, and yet the sister did not see that. One witness swears I ran up George-street and the ladies swear I ran down Church-street; I could not run both ways at once. The next witness swears that as I was coming through Ivy-street, the ladies came round and met me, but they say they followed me. God knows I am innocent.</p>

I offered him something to drink; he took nothing, but went away - the instant he was gone I missed my watch, which I can swear was in the room when he came in, for I had just wound it up - he was not there above ten minutes; he lived a few doors off. I went to his house - I found him in bed, and told him I had lost my watch; he denied it, and said"Who was that man that stood behind me in the room?" there had been nobody there but him or I should have seen them - I left him, and went to Bow-street. I have not found the watch - it hung over my bedstead; he kept close to the bedstead all the time. I went to the cupboard to get him something to drink, my head was then turned away - I did not search his room.</p>

I did not take the watch - the gentleman said there were two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120008"/>robberies done there before, and he should make me a thief, and he put it into my breast - it was not found on me, he had it in his own hand.</p>

On Sunday about three o'clock, I wanted some money, and missed it - she was in and out of the room on Sunday morning; I went to her house, in Drury-court, that afternoon, and found her in the second-floor room, which is not her own - I sent for a constable, and found the ring of the purse in her pocket; here it is - I have had it many years, it is a common one. I have no mark on it - I found the cap in a drawer in her mother's room. I also missed a bed quilt which I have not found; the constable who had the cap is dead.</p>

On the 30th of April I was at Newgate-market, and had Newton, my servant, with me there; I passed the City toll-bar at Barbican, with my cart that morning, and saw Payne, the toll-gatherer, there; he knew me very well; I pay him my toll once a week.

My name and address were on the cart, and the number; it was drawn by a bay mare, a very good one, and worth 40l. - value of the meat was 10l., and the cart 20l. I went to the Green-yard, to see for it, but it was not there; I then advertized it, offering 10l. reward - I saw it again in five weeks all but two days afterwards, at Somers' livery-stable, Lambeth. I do not know the prisoner, and never authorized him to take the mare and cart any where - he was a perfect stranger. I afterwards attended at Guildhall, with the same mare and cart, which was shown to the different witnesses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you any partner? A. No. I left home before six o'clock, and arrived at the market a quarter past six; the market was not very full; there were several carts there, but not so many as usual; business was very slack just at that time; it was on Monday morning, the 30th of April; I had left Newton, my lad, in the cart, but he left it to come to me, by my order. I pay my City toll once a week, on a Saturday generally.</p>

            , who is a labouring man. On the 30th of April we lived at Mr. Heath's, No.4, Coronation-place, Borough-road; on that day, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner drove a cart and horse to our door - I took notice of the cart and the horse also; I did not see the name on the cart. The prisoner brought some meat in, and asked me to let him leave it there - I gave him leave; I cannot say how much there was; it was mutton, beef, and veal; there was a great quantity of it: the prisoner went away with the cart and mare. Mrs. Heath afterwards saw the meat. The meat was afterwards taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your husband? A. He is not right in his head now, and is in Newington poorhouse - I also live there. I do not rightly know the day of the month when this happened. I was subpoenaed to come here about three weeks ago; I had one room at Heath's - my husband was not there. I am sure the prisoner is the man; I saw letters outside the cart, but cannot read, and cannot tell the name. I have seen the cart twice since, and have rode in it once; I am sure it is the same cart by the make of it and the gilt letters. I do not swear to it from having rode in it.</p>

F. on the back of the cart, in yellow letters, but I did not see what was in front - I only saw it from my first floor window; I saw the meat taken into the house, by the prisoner and other persons, but who I cannot say.

I was examined at Union-hall - that was before the cart was found. The mare and cart were produced at Guildhall.</p>

I did not see what was inside the cart; it was moved from there, and I saw it again in the Borough-road; I had not seen any body drive it away. I saw the prisoner get into it at the pin manufactory, and am certain of him. I had seen him once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where had you seen him? A. At the Dog and Still public-house, close against where the cart and horse stood. I had not heard of any robbery; it stood there so long different people were noting. I went round to see the name on it, but did not look inside.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the same cart and mare at Guildhall? A. Yes, about a month ago.</p>

            . I am a constable of Surrey. I apprehended the prisoner on the 3d of June, at his own house, in Robert-street, Kent-street; I did not either threaten or promise him any thing; he was sitting in a chair, I said I wanted him for a cart and horse, and a load of meat; he said he had been tried for that and discharged on the Friday before - that he was tried capitally, and knew nothing about it; I told him he must go with us; he did so. Goff was with me.</p>

I sent for the officer, who found it in his hat.</p>

No - that is 7s. 10d.; I have furnished him with a copy of this book since he has been in custody; I gave him a whole week to rectify his book if it was incorrect, and to account for any thing he might be deficient in; Mr. Dowdell's name is not in this book at all; he should account to me every night for the money he receives that day; he had a guinea and a half a week.</p>

I saw the prisoner in Anderson's yard, with a bundle - I kept looking at him, not knowing whether he had stolen it; but a man came out. crying Stop thief! I immediately ran out towards the fence of the Grand Junction premises and the prisoner came running round the corner and dropped this bundle - I am sure he is the man; I secured him - the bundle was claimed by Gingell.</p>

I left every thing safe - I came home after twelve o'clock, and found the prisoner in custody with the bundle, containing this property, which I had left in different drawers in two rooms, on the ground floor; the window was about three inches open when I went out - a person in the yard could open it; I had left the servant girl at home - the property is worth 7l.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . Gingell left me at home. I was in the kitchen - I heard no alarm at all; I went to the bed-room door and could not open it. I then went to the engine house, to ask Mr. Gingell if he had locked it - he came down with me; we then found the door open and the property gone - the drawers were open. I went out and saw a man in the yard, he ran away; and the prisoner was brought back - he was tying up the bundle on the pipes in the yard when I saw him - I will not swear to his person.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Sloane-square, Chelsea. On the 1st of June, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came to me; he seemed in great distress, and said he was afraid his wife was dead; he desired me to go with him directly, which I did. As we went along he said."I am afraid I have killed her." I asked him which way he had done it - he said he had given her two blows in her left side, with his elbow; that with the first blow, she said, "You have hurt me very much," and at the second, she said, "I am very bad, get up;" that he got up and struck a light, and got some vinegar, with which he tried to recover her, and used what means he could - but vinegar was the chief thing; he said they had been quarrelling a great deal; that it originated from jealousy, and he had struck her in her left side - he came to me to endeavour to restore her; when I got there, I found her with her head at the bottom of the bed, propped up with a pillow, and her feet hanging over the side of the bed; she was quite dead. I attempted to bleed her, and used other means - I endeavoured to introduce some hot spirits and water into her stomach - only two or three drops of blood came from her - there were some scratches on her nose, a grazed mark on the left collar bone, and the appearance of a blow on the left arm - those were the only external marks; I went again on the Saturday, by order of the Coroner, and opened the body that evening - Mr. Laisne, a surgeon, was with me - upon opening the belly there was nearly five pints of fluid and coagulated blood - I also found the sixth rib under the breast fractured, and the spleen ruptured - every other part of the body was quite sound - the blows she received caused her death; from the account he gave, in my judgment they were sufficient to occasion those appearances, and to occasion her death - in my opinion, she died from the internal hemorrhage, occasioned by the blows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was from his own lips you had the account of what had happened? A. Yes; it was all voluntarily - there was no external mark where the spleen was ruptured. He kissed his children affectionately, and was in the utmost agony - there was a strong smell of vinegar in the room - the external marks had nothing to do with her death; I have known them for twenty-one years; I never saw any thing unkind on his part - I occasionally attended them.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Grosvenor-row. I was at the prisoner's house on Friday evening, the 1st of June, and saw his wife - she was then dead - the moment I felt her hand, I expressed my opinion that she was dead - Mr. Turnbull was endeavouring to administer some warm spirits and water, and attempted to bleed her - I perceived some slight marks, but not sufficient to cause her death; the prisoner was below stairs when I first went in, and gave me a candle; I attended the Coroner's Inquest, and assisted Mr. Turnbull in opening the body; the cavity of the belly contained five pints of blood in a fluid and coagulated state - the sixth rib was fractured, and the spleen ruptured - in my opinion her death was caused by hemorrhage, from the rupture of the spleen; he stated in the course of Friday evening, that he had given her two violent blows in the side with his elbow, and expressed that they were blows given as if in an angry feeling or rage, with violence - he expressed that to convey the manner in which he might have done it; he said they had been quarrelling in the course of the day - that she knew he was of a jealous disposition, and ought not to have aggravated him; in my opinion the blows were sufficient to have occasioned the rupture and the hemorrhage; the rupture must have been from some violence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The blows he described could have been given with his elbow as they lay in bed? A.

            . I am a constable. On the night in question a gentleman fetched me from the watch-house, and pointed out this house - I knocked at the door, a woman opened it - I told her my business, and asked who was there; Mr. Laisne came down - he went up to the prisoner, who came down and showed himself to me, but said nothing; I went up-stairs - he seemed in a good deal of trouble; I told him it was my duty to take him into custody, but I did not wish to hurry him - he said he had struck her, but did not mean to kill her, he hoped I would wait a little while, and he would send for his brother, who came; and been treated him to take charge of his house and children, and some money which he had in his pocket; he then knelt down in the room where two children were in bed, kissed them, and said, "Good bye;" he entreated me not to put him in irons, and we went arm in arm to the watch-house; he made no resistance; he forced some conversation on me on the road - he said he did not mean to kill her - it was not a likely thing that he should, for there were 200l. coming to her in a short time, and it was not likely he should kill her before that at any rate, for that would make them all comfortable; he said he had struck her with his elbow, that she had dropped a word which very much displeased him, which was the cause of his striking her; he wished me not to put him into a cell alone, and I allowed him to sit up with me all night; he was agitated during the night, and frequently said, "Oh! my soul! Oh! my Nance!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He pronounced her name in great distress? A. Yes; he certainly appeared much distressed; and was very affectionate towards his children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I loved my wife, and if I had one fault, it was having too strong an affection for her - my whole soul was devoted to make her happy; I was never happy out of her company, and never spent an evening from her, except when business called me; had I contemplated murder, should I have fetched the sister to give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120013"/>evidence against me - it is contrary to nature, which dictates self-preservation; I should have quitted home instead of going for assistance - it was the furthest thing from my thoughts; I would have given my soul to have called her back to life. You will find by reference to the medical evidence there was not sufficient to cause death; therefore, reflect - weigh well - consider, and if any doubt arises, I trust you will give an unfortunate prisoner the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

Yes; he said they took a great deal of property from the Quaker's, and should have taken a good deal more, but they could not stop, as the dogs were there, and they were afraid the master, or somebody would come down; he said they had sold 13l. or 14l. worth of goods - I afterwards saw Young, he told me that him and King,

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you sleep last night? A. In the House of Correction - I have been there thirty-one days - I was there once before - a young man had taken a handkerchief; I was in a public-house with him, and was taken up as well as him. I know Mr. Dickenson of Twickenham; I was not a witness in a case of his, it was my brother. The property was given to me the morning after the robbery, as they told me; they told me it was committed the night before. I knew them before, but we were not intimate; I asked one person to buy the gown pieces, they said No; I told King I understood the property stolen was worth between 200l. and 300l.; he said it was not 20l.; I asked if he had committed it, and he said, Yes; he had been living about there, and doing nothing; I thought he could do nothing else - I told nobody of it till I was apprehended - I was afraid; it was my intention to tell if I was taken - I cannot say whether I should have told if I had not been taken. Tom cannot be found.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you been able to see Little Tom since they told you he was in the robbery? A. No; I have known the prisoners fourteen years, and have drank with them several times; they said there were some silk shawls and a great quantity of black silk, and some red twill and muslins among the goods; I asked how they got into the house, they said through the brickwork, and it was at near three o'clock in the morning; what made me ask if they were in the robbery was, because they had always plenty of money, and never did any work.</p>
               <p>Mr. J. ALLEY. Q. You did not see them frequently at public-houses? A. Yes; I have seen them full twenty times; they were always about the place; there was so much talk about them, every body wondered how they got so much money, and yet never worked; I had seen them with money two months before the robbery.</p>

The prosecutor's house was broken open on the 18th of May; I know that Little Tom was acquainted with the prisoners - they were always together; on the night before the robbery I saw King and Young go by my door about five or six o'clock - they were coming from the White Hart, public-house; I saw Little Tom immediately after, but he went up towards the common - I did not see them talking together - he lived on the common; the prisoners turned to the left, but both roads meet. Mr. Key's house is not in that direction - they were going towards Twickenham - William Stears was a particular acquaintance of theirs; I have made diligent search, but cannot find either him or Tom - I saw them all at Twickenham on the day of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Little Tom was not with the prisoners? A. He came along in about two minutes after them; I did not see them afterwards; they were a mile and a half from Mr. Key's - Stears' father was brought up about this, but he was only asked how he came by a bag.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say that Little Tom is a bad character? A. Yes - very bad; I have met the prisoners about before, but never so late as that; they were coming from their own house.</p>

On the 16th of June, 1826, I left my house about twelve o'clock at night, to go to Covent-garden market - the doors and windows were all fastened; I let myself out by a key, locked the door after me, and put the key into my pocket. About five o'clock in the morning a woman, who was in my employ, came to me, and informed me the house was broken open - I returned, and got home between ten and eleven. I found the street door, which I had fastened, broken open; it appeared to have been opened from within, the first floor window was broken, large enough to admit a person through. I do not know how they got to that window; there were two or three marks outside the door, as if a crow-bar had been applied to it. I missed a brown box-coat, two black coats, a blue and a brown one, a striped, a black silk, and a white waistcoat, two pairs of trousers, one dark mixed and the other a black, six or seven bottles of brandy, two or three bottles of home made wine, a black hat, two gold seals, a gold ring, key, three brooches, and four silver spoons - some of them were in drawers and some in a chest. I lost about 6l. in money; every thing was safe when I left home. I wore part of the clothes two days before - the value of the articles stated in the indictment is about 15l. I gave information at Bow-street that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has any of it been found? A. Part has been found at some pawnbrokers - the street door was broken open; the girl who fetched me is not here - the market is five miles from Fulham.</p>

            . I live in Fulham-fields, near Mr. Adam's; my husband's name is George. In June, 1826, about two o'clock one morning, I was near Mr. Adam's house - it was very moonlight, and there was light enough to see a person's face without the moon; I was going to Mr. Adam's, to see if his cart was gone to market; I am in the habit of going there at that time in the morning; I found the door ajar, and heard several people talking inside the house; I listened, and heard James Evans swearing dreadfully in the parlour. I heard the parlour door open, and then made my escape to the water-butt; I saw

I said to Evans, "Jem, tell me what it is o'clock;" he made no answer till he had passed me - he then used an improper word, and said, "Run, for she knows us;" I followed them at a distance, and hallooed after them; I saw them pull two bottles out of their pockets, and throw into Mr. Poynter's garden; one was found whole, and the other broken;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120015"/>Beal pulled out one bottle, and James Evans the other; I was examined twice at Bow-street, as Griffiths was not in custody at first.

            . I live at No. 12, Perkins-rents, Westminster. One Saturday morning in June, 1826; I do not know the day of the month; at half-past five o'clock I saw James Evans, the prisoner Griffiths, and Henry Woodger; they came to my house - I was in bed; my door was not fastened; they opened it, came in, and awoke me - they asked if I would have any thing to drink - I said I did not mind; they said I should have some brandy - they took a small glass off the mantel-piece, then took a bottle out of one of their coat pockets, and poured a glass full, but it was wine instead of brandy; they remained there about a quarter of an hour, and asked if I could get up and take breakfast with them - I got up, and went with them to No. 9, Perkins-rents; I lived at that time at No. 56, Old Pye-street - we breakfasted at No. 9, Perkins-rents; they asked me to take a walk with them: we went over the water; Evans asked if I would pledge a waistcoat for them - Griffiths was with us, but not close enough to hear what he said; I pawned it in the Borough, for 3s., I do not know the pawnbroker's name; Woodger asked me to pawn a coat - I pawned that at Sowerby's, in Cable-street, for 1l., I think; Griffiths did not hear him ask me to pawn it, he was behind a long way; it was a dark brown coat - he had it on over his own; the waistcoat was a striped kerseymere, with brass buttons. The prisoners went on while I went into the shops; I parted with them about five o'clock in the afternoon; we were together all that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have mentioned all the persons who were with you? A. Yes; Beal was there, but I received nothing from him; Woodger gave me nothing to pawn. This was above a year ago. I was examined before the Magistrate at Westminster; I was taken into custody. I am an unfortunate girl. I recollect it was in June, and near the end of the month I believe, but will not swear whether it was the beginning or end; they were in the habit of coming down the place where I lived; they never called at my lodging before; I was alone. The officer took me up a fortnight afterwards, and then I told this, as I could not swear falsely - I did not accuse them to save myself; I will not swear I had no fear for myself. I did not mention it till I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You accused them to save yourself? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Chip there? A. Not in my room; I saw him with the others that morning. I was not afraid of being prosecuted; I was afraid of being ill-used, as some people of Hammersmith said they would murder me if I said a word about it. I appeared against them because I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now it was to save yourself that you accused them? A. Yes, to save myself from being ill-used. The men from Hammersmith said if I said a word against them they would dash my brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you save yourself by accusing them? A. I have been threatened to be ill-used so often; I was obliged to accuse them when I was taken for it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you were taken for this robbery, did you not accuse them to get yourself out of a scrape? A. Certainly I did - if I said otherwise I should say false.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to accuse them? A. I was brought to appear against them; every thing I have said is true.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to ELIZABETH GOLDING. Q. Did not you tell Elizabeth Salter that you hid yourself in a hedge and point out the spot to her? A. I said I was at the corner of a hedge, by my own house, when they came by.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not tell her of the water-butt? A. I did not wish every body to know my secrets; it was of little consequence to tell her, as she is of no character whatever.</p>

On the 19th of June last I saw Beal with two more persons, in the Strand; I followed him up to Covent-garden-market, as I had received information of this robbery; I suspected them - I went up and said I suspected something was wrong, and should take him into custody; I said, "Don't you know Mr. Adam, of Fulham?" he said Yes; I put him into the watch-house, and searched him, but found nothing relating to the robbery; the next morning, as I was going from the watch-house to the office, I told him there were persons up against him - he said, were the girls against him, meaning, I suppose, the two women; I said, Yes, and a person named Golding as well; I said it was a long time since the robbery occurred, and perhaps Golding would not know him - he said Yes, she would be sure to know him; I did not either threaten or promise him anything; I said I wondered he had escaped so long - he said he had been to Brighton; I said he had better have continued there - he said he should have done so, but he could get no employ - he then said he knew nothing of the robbery. The pawnbrokers are not here, as the things were redeemed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the habit of examining prisoners? A. No; this was promiscuously, in the course of conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. ADAMS re-examined. The robbery was between the 16th and 17th of June. I have a coat on which I redeemed; here is a striped waistcoat with brass buttons, a pair of trousers, and a box coat - they were all taken from my house at the time in question - I can swear to them all - the waistcoat was new, and worth 10s., the trousers, 15s., the box-coat, 30s., and the one I have on is worth 30s., it had only been worn three times when I lost it - I got the box-coat from Matthews, a pawnbroker, in the Minories: the close coat from Annis, at Sparrow-corner - the trousers from Watts, of Smithfield, and the waistcoat from somebody in the Borough. I swear positively to them all.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE HAYES. I pawned this waistcoat in the Borough - I had it from Evans; I do not know the coat which Mr. Adam has on.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PARKER. I can swear to this box-coat - I pawned it in the Minories; Tom Evans gave it to me, and the coat Mr. Adams has on I pawned in Sparrow-corner; Evans also gave me that. The prisoners were in our company, drinking afterwards; and they had been together before Evans gave me the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were they from him when he gave you the coat? A. About one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE HAYES. When Evans gave me the waistcoat the prisoners were about fifty yards off; they had been drinking together before.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I live in Peter-street, Friars' Mount, Bethnal-green. On the 20th of June, about half-past 1 o'clock at noon, I saw the prisoner in Brick-lane, and watched him into Brown's-lane, where I secured him, with this clock under his arm; I asked him what it was - he said a clock; I asked where he was going with it - he said he could not tell me, but he would show me - I asked where he brought it from - he said from Mr. Matthews, of Dalston. I found two ladies' gowns in his trousers, they were wet, and I asked how he came by them - he then said he would tell me the truth - that he met a man at Dalston, who said he would give him 1s. to carry them to Spitalfields church, where he would meet him; he was about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's house. I have had the property ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go with him to Spitalfields church? A. No; he said if I would I should see the man there; I locked him up, and then went - he was about ten minutes walk from the church. I took him to the watch-house, which is about ten minutes walk, in White Lion-street, about a quarter of a mile from where I took him; the church might be about a quarter of a mile from the watch-house - it might be twenty minutes before I got to the church. I saw nobody waiting there; he was going in a direction from the church when I met him.</p>

On the 6th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was engaged in the counting-house, and heard a noise in the warehouse, the door was half open - I went in, and missed two pieces of stuff from the counter, which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before. I went into the street, and in a court adjoining I observed a boy with two pieces - I will not swear that it was the prisoner. I returned to fasten my warehouse, and then went in pursuit, but without effect. I returned to my street door, and in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner (who appeared to me to be the same boy) coming to the door, with a piece of stuff under his arm - I laid hold of him and took it from him. I gave him in charge; it is one of the pieces which had been taken from my warehouse - there are twenty-eight yards of it; it is worth 21s. He said he had picked up it - this was within a quarter of an hour of its being stolen.</p>

On the 11th of July I was in the warehouse, the door was ajar - I heard a noise, turned my head, and saw a hand just within the entrance of the door, but I could not see the person's face - the hand laid hold of a piece of holland, and took it out. I opened the door, and the man let the goods fall - I pursued, and merely lost sight of him for half a minute, as he turned the corner. I am sure I caught sight of the same man again - it was the prisoner; he was stopped in my sight - the holland is worth 21s. I saw him drop it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 5th of June I was dining in the parlour; my young master called me out, took me to the corner of Rolls-buildings, and pointed out the two prisoners; they turned a corner into White's-alley - I followed, and turned round; Coughlan was going up a place which is no thoroughfare - I collared him, and called Stop thief! after the other; I dragged him after me, and caught hold of Richards, who was about ten yards off - they were both close together before; I charged them with picking a pocket; they said they were innocent, that they were both looking for work, and were strangers to each other. They were running close together when I first saw them.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my parents, in Fetter-lane - they keep an oil and Italian warehouse. On the 5th of June I saw Mr. Giles at the corner of Rolls-buildings; the prisoners were close to him; I saw them draw a pocket-handkerchief out of his pocket - Coughlan was the one who drew it out; he put it into his breast pocket; I was four or five yards off; they turned down Rolls-buildings. I went into the parlour, and called out Pollett; I then went and told Mr. Giles what I had seen; I did not pursue; I afterwards saw them in Pollett's custody, and was quite sure of them - they were taken in four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RICHARDS. He said at first that I was not with Coughlan. Witness. No; I said there was a third one behind them.</p>

I was coming up Fetter-lane, and on turning down Rolls-buildings it came on very wet - I ran; a man came and pursued me; I stopped at a window to look at a bill, and he said I had picked a gentleman's pocket - I said I was innocent. They searched me three times, but could not find the handkerchief; I never saw the other prisoner before in my life.</p>
               <p>RICHARD's Defence. I heard a gentleman halloo Stop thief! I immediately stopped; he took Coughlan towards me, and said it was for picking a pocket.</p>

               <p>DANIEL DANIELS. I live in Britannia-Row, Hoxton, and am a <rs id="t18270712-37-viclabel218" type="occupation">paper-stainer</rs>

                  <interp inst="t18270712-37-crimeloc219" type="placeName" value="Smithfield"/>

I said I was going myself, and did not particularly want him that day. Mr. Davies came up; the prisoner got into the chaise - I told Mr. Davies he had better get into the chaise too, as I was younger than him, and could walk. I told the prisoner to ask 14l. for it, if he was there first, but not to sell it, for I was coming directly after him. I got to Smithfield about three o'clock - I had told the prisoner I would allow him 1s. in the pound on what it sold for. When I got to Smithfield I saw Davies first - we went to the prisoner, and placed him in Smithfield to show it; we went round the market, came back, and found him in the same place; he said nobody had bid him any money. I told him not to sell it - and Davies said "Don't sell it yourself; Mr. Daniels will soon be back and would like to sell it himself." Davies went home - I stood by the prisoner some time; then the prisoner's uncle came, whom I had known for sixteen years - he and I went round the market, leaving him in the same place, and when we came back the prisoner was gone; the last time I left him was about a quarter to six o'clock. I have known him fifteen or sixteen years; the horse and chaise were also gone. I did not see him again till the 19th of June - his uncle is employed in the same factory with me, and as the prisoner was out of work, he asked me to employ him to sell the horse; the uncle did not apply to me first. I told him myself that I wished tosell it. On the night of the 10th, he said the prisoner was out of work, and might he go to Smithfield with it. I said I should like to go myself; the uncle said, the business was so urgent I had better let him go - I asked if he thought it was safe to trust him, and I told the prisoner he might go; he had only said, that he could go. I told him not to sell it, but to bring me a customer; he took it to Smithfield on the 11th, about three o'clock. I went at six, and found him there - I went back with him, as it was not sold; and on the 18th we went again, as I have stated - his uncle is a man of property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I ask you, did you never give the prisoner authority to sell this horse? A. No; I never told any body that I gave him authority to sell it. I never told his uncle Bull so; I know Mr. Spencer, a cooper - I saw him the evening it was stolen, and told him the prisoner was gone away with it, but did not say I had given him leave to sell it - nor did I ever tell Dawes so, nor Mr. Gigg - I swear I never told any person that I had given him authority to sell it. I told them all that he had been to Smithfield to get me a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner come to you one evening and say, he had been offered 12l. for it, at Smithfield? A. That was on the 11th; I said if he knew where the person lived he might have strained another pound. I did not blame him for not taking the 12l. I never said to his uncle, when he did not come home, that I dare to say he had sold it.</p>

            . On the 18th of May I saw Daniels at his stable; he asked me to go to Smithfield with him - the prisoner came in; Daniels and he put the horse too; the prisoner got in and drove about one hundred yards - Daniels said, I had better ride, and I got in and rode with the prisoner. I got out at the pig-market, and said, "Mr. Daniels and I will be with you in a few minutes, you draw the horse and gig into Smithfield," which he did, and in five minutes Daniels came up - we went to the prisoner; Daniels said, "We are going to take a walk - if anybody comes, ask 14l., but don't sell it, for I shall be back in a few minutes;" I said, "No," do not sell it, for Daniels wishes to sell it himself - we came back, and he said nobody had been to look at it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Daniels a stranger to you? A. Not particularly; my brother married his sister. I never told the Magistrate that I was merely acquainted with him.</p>

            . I am a coach-maker. On the 19th of May, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner came to my factory, at Islington, with a plater, who works for me - he asked me if I would buy a yellow pony chaise. I appointed to meet him at seven o'clock at my house - he came; and I went with him to the Leaping-bar stables, in St. John-street. I saw the chaise, and told him it would not suit me - I went on the 23d, with a gentleman who wanted one, and left a note for him to come to me on the following morning, which he did, at twelve o'clock. I asked the lowest price of the chaise; he said he had been bid 50s. for it, and said he had a duplicate of some harness. I said I had three, which I had bought of a lodger, for 24s.; he said he would take them in exchange; I went to the pawnbrokers and redeemed the harness, which was pawned for 30s., and I bought the chaise for 50s. On the 28th the officer came, and I delivered him the chaise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Daniels ever tell you he had given him authority to sell the property? A. On the 30th of May I was at the Hugh Middleton public-house, he said he had given him permission to sell it, that if he did not, he should not think of giving him anything; but if he did, he was to have 1s. in the pound.</p>

            .

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever say so after the prisoner went away with it? A. No; one night when the prisoner said he had refused 12l. for it, Daniels said he was foolish in not taking the man's address, for he might have got a pound or two more.</p>

Bank note, a 10l. and a 1l. country notes, two sovereigns, and a watch in my pocket; I was awoke about a quarter-past five o'clock, by the prisoner kneeling at my bed side, with his hands drawing my breeches from under me - he had got part of them to the edge of the bed, but had not taken them completely from under me; he had got hold of them, and was pulling, when I seized him by his shirt - he had not got them completely from under me, for I was drawn with the breeches - I was still resting on some part of them - he had moved me with them.</p>

I said, "When they have all done I will take mine;" she then jumped up, went down stairs, and sang two songs to herself - she then ran up, and said, "If you please Thomas come down stairs for five minutes, for I want to speak to you;" she repeated this fifty or a hundred times - and at last, with a good deal of persuasion, I went down into the room; I saw her pull a pen-knife out of her bosom and open it - she seemed in a great passion, and I caught hold of her wrist, and took the knife from her - I shut it and gave it to Mrs. Poole. Mrs. Poole said, "See how the blood runs!" I did not know till then that I was cut - I then found I was wounded in my right hand; I did not take the knife from her till I found the blood running, and cannot say whether she meant to injure me or herself; she had said nothing to me - she said she was very sorry for it, that she did not mean it for me, but for herself - she had been jealous of me for some time. <rs id="t18270712-40-verdict231" type="verdictDescription">

            . Robinson gave me the key - I took it to the prisoner's father's house, in Ann's-court, Montague-street, Mile-end, and in a box, which the key opened, I found two pieces of handkerchiefs, quite new. The prosecutors are bankrupts, and I understand Mr. Teale is an assignee; there is nobody here to prove it.</p>

            . I took the cheque to Messrs. Harvey's, and received a 10l. and a 5l. Bank note, two sovereigns, and 10s., which I brought home, and put into the table-drawer. William Walters keeps the house, and lives there. The prisoner lodged on the same floor as us, and saw me put the notes away; we went out together that morning, by appointment, and when we got into Bunhill-row I had forgotten a small parcel, and, having my child with me, I asked the prisoner to go back for it, while I minded her little girl - this was between ten and eleven o'clock; she returned in ten minutes, and we went home together about five o'clock in the evening; I then expected to find the change of the notes in the drawer, as I had left them there for my husband to get change; I went to the drawer - none of the money was there, and I thought he had got it. When he came home, at eight o'clock, I found they were stolen. The prisoner had gone out about six o'clock - she returned about nine, and we said we had lost the notes - she only laughed at it; my husband got the street-keeper, but we did not like to give her in charge, and it rested till the 4th of May, when I saw the 10l. note, and knew it to be the same, by the number, which I got from Mr. Harvey. We could not find the prisoner for a month afterwards; she had left the house about a fortnight after the robbery; she had four examinations, and was then bailed - she has now surrendered.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the three prisoners and another crossing the fields - Hargreaves was about fifty yards before me; I was in the road: one of the female prisoners had the glass, tied in a table-cloth - the man who has escaped held what he had got before him, that I should not see it - I took the decanter from Wood, as she came through the hedge; I gave her in charge, and ran after the two men - Frayne secreted himself in a ditch- I pulled him out, and found two wine-glasses in his pocket; his finger bled very much, and in going along the woman asked how he had cut it - he made no reply, but in going back we found some glass broken, with the name of Hinton on it; we found three doors broken at the house, and by the side-board in the coffee-room we found several spots of blood on the floor; we were just below Kilburn gate when we saw them - they were walking; they were about a mile and a half from the house, but there is a nearer way, across the fields - it was quite daylight.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 24th of May, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I left my shop quite secure - it was locked and bolted. I returned about five minutes after nine o'clock next morning, and found an entrance had been made at the back of the shop, from the pastry-cook's next door; they had broken out a pannel. I missed the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them.) I saw them all again the day but one following, in the possession of Mr. Cope, the marshall, at the Mansion-house.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You locked your shop up carefully? A. Yes. I conceive considerable violence was necessary to break it open. I had not seen the prisoner about the premises. The robbery was in the night, between the 24th and 25th.</p>

            . I am a marshal of the City. On the 25th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house, in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch - I know it to be his house; it is in the City. I do not think the prosecutor's shop is in the City. The prisoner was not at home; I found in his house a box, which I produce - it contained the articles stated in the indictment; it was on the ground floor - there was a bed in the room. I took it to the Mansion-house. I knew before that the prisoner lived there - I did not see him till the 6th of July; I did not call at his house myself, but gave directions to the officers to look after him. Vann apprehended him. What passed at the Mansion-house was taken down in writing. Grant saw the property on the 26th of May, and claimed it all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That box is of considerable weight? A. Not very great - I should think a boy of eight or nine years old could carry it from Chancery-lane to Gravel-lane - the distance may be a mile and a quarter; or a mile and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120026"/>half; I should think the prisoner might carry it very easily, if it were five or six times the weight. I have not examined the place that was broken open. The prisoner has a son, named Ikey, who has absconded; I did not go to the prisoner's house myself after the 25th of May - he was not at home then; the box was locked when I took it. Ikey Solomon made his escape the very day that I found the property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had Ikey been in custody before he escaped? A. Some days, and I believe he was in custody till one or two o'clock on that day.</p>
               <p>JOHN VANN. I am an officer of Bow-street. I do not know the prisoner's house - I apprehended him on the evening of the 5th of July, in Surrey, near the Obelisk; I told him I took him on suspicion of felony, for some things which I believed were found in his house; he said, Oh! there was no occasion to apprehend him, for he was an old man; I knew he lived in Gravel-lane, but was never at his house; I told him I must take him into custody; he said, Oh! he could not carry such things, that they were brought there by his son; and on our way to the Compter he asked me where my warrant was to apprehend him - I told him I had no warrant, and had no occasion for any; he then said he would not go with me - I said if he did not I should call for assistance, and put him into a coach; when he found I was determined to take him he said, "I should have surrendered myself in two or three days."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was this? A. On the evening of the 5th of July, about a quarter-past seven o'clock - it was broad daylight. The Obelisk is a very public thoroughfare, about three quarters of a mile from London-bridge; when I got to the Borough-market he objected to go again - I met a brother officer, and asked him to assist me. I did not exactly know the identical house he lived in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear he was wanted? A. I was here last Session, and Mr. Cope gave directions to my conductor to apprehend him if he was to be found; he did not tell me to take him; I met him by mere accident. I did not ask him to treat me on the road; he appeared frightened, and trembled very much - he said, "I hope you will let me have something to drink" - I did so, and drank with him - he paid for it; I think it was a glass of porter we had.</p>
               <p>MR. GRANT. This box contains my property - I lost 10l. or 12l. worth more.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. COPE. Q. Is Vann the man you gave instructions to? A. No - I gave instructions to nearly all our men to look out for him; several of them knew where he lived; some of them went with me to his house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Cope to the prisoner's house; I went to the house two or three days afterwards, and found the door fastened - somebody called out that he was gone away; I went by the door several times, but did not go in - his wife was in the house afterwards. I did not see him from that time till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never went to the house except once? A. Not direct to the house; I do not know what day of the week it was, but am certain it was not on his Sabbath, for it was not the day after; which was the Sabbath, and it did not exceed four days from the time I found the property; I did not knock very loud at the door. I have seen his wife - she appears about seventy years old; the box is a light one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by not going to the house direct? A. I frequently went near the house to look for him, but did not go to it.</p>

            , (keeper of Newgate.) Ikey Solomon was in Newgate on the 25th of May - he was in custody all the night of the 24th, and for nearly three weeks before - he could not be in Chancery-lane at the time in question.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner is in a state of infirmity? A. Only by his own statement - he was put into the infirmary by direction of the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am upwards of seventy years old, and have worked hard to support my family. I never got a penny dishonestly in all my days - I have worked for every factory in London. I hate the very thoughts of a thief and of a receiver - it is very well known that I have brought several things forward concerning government. I can prove it by a solicitor, at Somerset House, and by several officers, who have known me upwards of forty years that I never robbed a man of a single farthing - I have been ill upwards of three years, and cannot get out of bed without my wife or daughter putting my stockings on - having had a hurt across my loins; and is it possible I could break open a house with violence? I do not know where the house is - I declare by my Maker, that I do not know that I was ever in the street - this Vann, when I saw him, said "Solomon, where are you going?" I said, to the Circus; he said, "Come, treat us, before you go in;" I gave him a glass of gin. I treated him twenty times in Whitechapel - he said, "Solomon, have you got any blunt in your pocket?" I was at large every day, and can point out twenty people who saw me daily about Bishopsgate-street and Whitechapel. I was in-doors till between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and when I came home I knew nothing about the box - it is hard I should be put here for things I am innocent of.</p>

            . I am a widow; the prisoner is my father - he is seventy years old; he is a very ailing man, seldom or never well. I have lived in his house for the last five years, and take care of my father and mother - she is seventy-three years old.</p>
               <p>Q. For the last five years, have you ever known him sleep out of his own house? A. Never in his life - he is never out after eleven o'clock; he slept at home the night before the 25th of May, the day my brother escaped. On that day, (the 25th,) between twelve and one o'clock, a lad brought this box to the house - it was locked; he said he left it for Isaac Solomon. I took it in - I then took it off the table, and put it on a table in the adjoining room. My father was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Now; could your father have been out from nine o'clock the night before your brother escaped, till three or four next morning, without your knowledge? A. No; he was never out after eleven o'clock, on my oath - he got up about nine or half-past. I do not know Chancery-lane, nor Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Temple-bar? A. I have passed there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120027"/>several times; we live in Gravel-lane. I was not at home when Mr. Cope came and took the box away.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was there a key left with the box? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you lived in London? A. I have never been out of London. I never heard of such a place as Chancery-lane; I will swear that; I have been through Temple-bar, but was never in Chancery-lane. I may have been through Temple-bar one hundred times or twenty times. I am seldom out; I go into no company - I had gone home with my work when the box was taken away. I do not know the boy who left it; I paid nothing for it - he said he was to leave it for Isaac Solomon; he mentioned his name; he said he was to leave it for Isaac Solomon. I do not think my father is able to walk at all, to tell you the truth - I cannot say that he walked to the Obelisk; I was at home when he went out in the morning, about ten o'clock; I do not know whether he had a coach - he did not return at all. I did not call a coach for him when he went out - he went out on foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had told you he should walk to the Obelisk, in St. George's Fields, should you not have said, "You are not able to do it?" A. He never asked me about it, if he had I should have told him to take a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I suppose, you were surprized to hear he was found on foot at the Obelisk? A. I cannot say about that - I went to the Mansion-house, when my father was examined. I was down-stairs ready to be called, if I was wanted; I told Mr. Humphreys, the attorney, at the Mansion-house, that the box was left for my brother - I told nobody else so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the box was left, had your brother been in Newgate? A. I do not know; for we were not friends with him. I knew he was there, but did not recollect when he was sent - he did not live at my father's, but in Bell-lane; that is not far from Gravel-lane, is not more than a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. As this box was left for your brother, whom you knew to be in Newgate, did you tell the boy to take it to Bell-lane? A. No; he left it there, and I thought I might take it in - he went out directly he put it down. I had no time to ask him a question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to stop? A. No; I took the box in, and said, "Very well." I put it into the adjoining room, on the table, that is my bed-room - my father never knew it was there; he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know it was in your room before he was taken up? A. Of course he knew when he came home, that it had been taken away; I told him so when he came home, about seven o'clock - he had gone out about ten o'clock that morning, and did not return till seven - I do not know whether he went in a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for a coach? A. How could I? when I was sitting at home, at work - I saw him go away; he did not have a coach from the door; I cannot say whether he took one any where else; I do not know where he went - he did not dine at home; perhaps he had business to do - he went to sales at times; he did not have a coach to go to the sales; but they were not far; I do my work at home. I was at home on Friday, as it is the Sabbath - the sales he attended were sometimes near home; nobody ever came to the house to enquire for my father.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the 25th of May did you first hear your brother had made his escape from the officers? A. I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never heard it from that time, till you attended at the Mansion-house? A. No; I never did hear it - I did not hear at what hour he escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not asked the hour - I ask, how long after the box had been left, did you hear your brother had escaped? A. I never heard it. I heard of his being taken up; the box was left between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Well; how many days or weeks after that, did you first hear your brother had escaped from the officers? A. I did not hear anything of it; I did not hear at what time it was; he escaped the day the box was left - I heard about two o'clock that day, that he had made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. You were told of it about two o'clock, on the day the box was left? A. Yes; I did not understand you at first - a person came and told me of it; he was a stranger. My father was not at home then; my mother was out at work - a stranger came to the door, and said he had escaped; the door is generally open - I did not ask him a single question, it frightened me in such a manner; he said my brother had escaped, and away he went. I did not open the box, for there was no key; it was no business of mine. I went home with my work between two and three o'clock, and left my mother at home. I know Vann by sight; I never saw him at our house - I never told anybody that the box had been left there, except Mr. Humphreys; it was not very heavy, nor yet very light - if the box had not been here, I could have told you the celour of it; my father is a glass engraver.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked about Vann; did any of the whole tribe of City officers come to your house, from the 25th of May till the 5th of July? A. Never; not one - my mother was out when the box was left; my brother's escape caused a great deal of talk. I dare say every body was acquainted with it - the box was locked; I put it on the table, locked as it was - my father generally works at home; there is a coach-stand in Whitechapel and in Bishopsgate-street - he never sent me for a coach. I told Mr. Humphreys what I have stated to-day; I was not examined at the Mansion-house - my brother Ikey was not on good terms with the family.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of taking in boxes and parcels for your brother? A. No; I never saw the box before. I do not know whose it is.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. COPE. Q. Were you at the Mansion-house when the prisoner was examined? A. Yes; no witnesses were examined for the prisoner. I did not hear Mr. Humphreys tell the Lord Mayor that he had a good defence - he might have said so without my hearing it. I found the box on a table in an inner-room; three females were in the house, but I did not see Nathan - the prisoner's wife was there. I was there about four o'clock; Chancery-lane is a very public place, I believe, during most of the night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the time you took the box till the prisoner was committed, did you ever hear from any body that it had been left for Ikey Solomon? A. Never.</p>

I went next door on an errand, about two o'clock; a person called me - I went, and found White in the shop; he asked how many gooseberries I sold for a halfpenny; I showed him a mug, and he said he ought to have a pint; I told him to go away, and he went - I had not seen the other prisoners; I missed my money directly; in a short time a boy gave me information; I saw Clarke over the way, and ran and collared him - I brought him into the shop; he said, "What are you going to do with me?" I said I should send for an officer; he said, "What for? I have met a little boy, and he gave me 3s. to return you;" and he gave me 3s. in copper; I then sent him about his business, and in about twenty minutes Welch came and asked why I had taken his money from the boy Clarke; I said it was not his; he used very bad expressions, and said he would have it out of me; I fetched an officer, and he was taken and while I was gone White was taken.</p>

I went away, and when I came back I saw White go into the shop, go behind the counter, and take the money out of the glass - Clarke and the other went away, leaving him in the shop- I saw no more of them; when Clarke brought back the money, I said to him, "Where is the boy who took it?" he said "I met him in Smithfield, and he gave it me to bring back; how much is it;" Mrs. Bustard said 3s.; he said, "No, half-a-crown;" she said it was 3s., and he gave her three shillings in copper, and I saw him with about 30s. in silver; shortly after that Welch came, and said, "I want the money you have taken from the boy;" I told her to give him into custody - he told me to hold my check, for I had nothing to do with it; I pushed them both into the shop while she fetched an officer; White was brought to the shop - I said, "Take him in, that is the boy who took the money;" I asked Clarke what he had done with the silver which he had - he said it was only buttons.</p>

I had not seen the prisoner before - I had not walked with her in Beech-street, nor had I been in Beech-street that night - it is at the end of Whitecross-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120029"/>street. I ran home as fast as I could, and told my master of it directly the door was opened; it is dangerous to run down an alley after thieves, or I should have pursued her. I saw Harrison next morning, and described her to him; she is a remarkable looking woman - her face came quite close to mine; I could see her plainly, and am certain of her; Harrison apprehended her about two hours after I gave him notice; it was a silver watch, with a ribbon and gold key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you deny walking with me in Beech-street, and going into Golden-lane, giving me 4d., and asking if that would satisfy me - I left you, and you had white trousers on? A. It is all false - I had not been in Beech-street, and have not got a pair of white trousers.</p>

            . I am an officer, and have been so two years. The prosecutor described the prisoner to me at half-past six o'clock on Monday morning - I immediately knew her, and where she lived; I went to her lodgings between seven and eight o'clock that morning - she got out of bed to open the door to me; she had been in bed with two men and her sister; she said she knew nothing about it - I said, "If you are not the woman I shall not detain you long;" the prosecutor saw her, and identified her immediately; she was only in her shift when she opened the door. I saw the prisoner make her mark to this statement (looking at the depositions) - here is the Magistrate's signature to it- (read.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in her Defence, says, when I met that gentleman in Beech-street we went up Golden-lane, and in Sun-alley the prosecutor pulled out 4d.; I asked him what it was for; he asked if it would not satisfy me; I told him No, I would go and get something to drink with it: he gave me the 4d., and we parted; I went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I was told I was not to be prosecuted.</p>

On the 6th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I went over the way about twenty or thirty yards, leaving my daughter Charlotte, who is four years old, in the shop - the door was open. My coat was up in the bed-room, the door of which was fastened with a catch, but not locked; I had been up there three quarters of an hour before - the catch was then fastened; there was nobody but the child in the house - I was absent about ten minutes, and as I returned I saw the prisoner come out of the shop door, with my coat on; I ran and overtook him about two doors off, and said, "You have got my coat on;" he made no answer, and I gave him in charge - he was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Have you a lodger named Summers? A. I think that is his name - he lodges there now. When I laid hold of the prisoner another man came across, and pulled the collar of the coat up for him - it was a great coat; I had not seen that man before; the prisoner seemed to be intoxicated, but he walked away very fast with my coat. The other man ran away as fast as he could. I knew him to be a reputed thief, and described him to the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any coat left in your room? A. None; it was put on over his own; he never said any body else gave him the coat - I have had it about twelve months - I would not take 20s. for it.</p>

            . I am one of the Presidents of the Inland-office. I was on duty on Saturday, the 10th of February; a letter addressed to the Isle of Man would be assorted to the Liverpool division, or to the Liverpool-road; I had the general superintendance of the whole office; the prisoner was employed that night as assistant at the Liverpool division; letters for the Isle of Man would pass through his hands - he would receive them; after being charged, it was his duty to place them in the box; he would arrive at the office a little before five o'clock, and remain there till the mails were all made up, which would be a little after eight; he had to assort letters into the different boxes on the road - he would be sorting letters first till twenty minutes after five o'clock, and begin sorting again at twenty minutes after six - he would put the unpaid letters into the different boxes - after the sorting was complete he would have to tell up the postage - he would be alone at the division several parts of the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you say he was alone at his division, you mean nobody assists him at his business? A. The division is against the wall - he is there at times by himself - there may be a hundred and fifty persons in the room; the nearest person to him would not be more than two yards off; three or four persons would be within two yards of him; there are two seats, where two Presidents sit - they have a view of the whole office when in their seats - but they have to go round the office and see that every body is at his post; the taxing-clerk sits about two yards from the prisoner, but their backs are to each other; the prisoner would have to fetch letters from the taxing-table to his own; it is impossible for me to say how many hands a letter may go through, but his is the last hand that they go to. When a letter first arrives, it is put to be faced - there are fifteen or twenty facers - they then go to the stamper; there are three stampers.</p>
               <p>Mr. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Is there any separation between the places in which one clerk and the other sits? A. There is a partition between each division.</p>

            . I am one of the City Marshals. On Monday, the 12th of February, I was sent for to the General Post-office, and directed to search the prisoner; I told him to take all his money out of his pockets, and out of his right-hand small-clothes pocket, he took the 5l. note produced; he said he took it from Mrs. Brooks, of Nelson-square, where he lodged; that he had a bill to pay for her, and had promised to make up the remainder of the money - he parted with the note very readily; this was between one and two o'clock - he was in custody when I first saw him. I did not part with him till between six and seven o'clock that evening, when I left him at the Compter. Mr. Peacock, the Post-office solicitor, Mr. Wood, and I, went with him in a coach to Nelson-square, to search his lodgings. Mr. Peacock stated to him, that the account he had given of the note was false, as Mrs. Brooks had denied that she ever gave it him; he then said, that he had not taken it from Mrs. Brooks, and he would not disclose to the solicitor from whom he had taken it.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL HURST re-examined. The bag should arrive at the office at twenty minutes after six.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in an exceeding long address to the Court, stated the case to rest entirely on presumptive evidence, and that it was by no means conclusive against him; that he had taken the note in question on the evening of the 10th of February, at a gambling-house, No. 6, King-street, St. James-square; and that the account he first gave of it arose from his reluctance to acknowledge his having been to a house of that description; that on arriving at the office on Monday morning he was informed Mr. Stow had sent repeated messages for him, and on his going to him he questioned him, and told him he should want to speak to him again; as such, if he had come by the note feloniously, he should certainly have destroyed it, which he had ample opportunity of doing before he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am employed in the Post-office. Mr. Stow is a President of the Inland-office. On the morning of the 12th of February, he inquired for the prisoner before he had arrived; when the prisoner came I told him Mr. Stow had sent for him three or four times - he immediately went to him; he returned and remained in the Accountant-general's office for an hour or more; there was a fire in the office - he was sent for again, and went to Mr. Stow; he certainly might have destroyed any papers if he had chosen.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Did you tell him what Mr. Stow wanted? A. I did not know; the prisoner was employed as an extra clerk; it is very likely the President may often want to speak to a clerk.</p>

I lived there in September, but not in the same house; on the 11th of September I was on my business in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, and in the way home from the last patient I called on, (which was in Pugh's-row, Elliott-street, Brick-lane) I arrived at <placeName id="t18270712-51-crimeloc293">Fleet-street-hill</placeName>

                        targets="t18270712-51-off289 t18270712-51-crimeloc293"/>, about half-past seven o'clock, when I got on the hill, I heard a number of footsteps behind me; one of the persons called out, "Now;" and immediately after there was a loud whistle. I was then surrounded by about twenty men and boys; several of them had sticks in their hands - my arms were tied behind me, and one of them, whom I believe to be the prisoner, called out, "If the b-r speaks knock his b-y brains out." I begged of them not to ill-treat me, and the man who held my right arm, said I should not be hurt - that man's name was Boyce; they were all close to me. Boyce was on my right, and rifled my right-hand pockets - from my right-hand trousers pocket was taken a case of surgical instruments, and two cases of lancets; from my right-hand waistcoat pocket, two or three keys, and a piece of ass's skin - from my left-hand trousers pocket, two sovereigns, three shillings, and a sixpence, and a pen-knife, with a broken point; and from my left-hand waistcoat pocket, a small velvet pin-cushion; they next untied my cravat and took that; the prisoner then came up to me, and took my hat off my head with both his hands, it was a fine starlight night. I cannot exactly say whether the moon was up; I am certain of the prisoner's person - he had a blue or dark coat on, with gilt or polished buttons and light trousers. I believe it was a blue coat; I am not able to speak to any other part of his dress. I saw West, the officer, that evening, and described the prisoner, and some of the others to him.</p>
               <p>Q. After having taken your cravat and hat, what next occurred? A. The prisoner called out, "Now give the b-r a rum one;" before my hat was taken Boyce had rubbed my trousers down, feeling for my watch; and when my hat and cravat were taken off Houghton, who was one of them, came up to me and unbuttoned the flap of my trousers, and Boyce cried out, "The b-r has got no toy." After that - they were about to run away I asked Boyce to give me my keys, as they were no service to him; he returned me one, saying, "You b-r, there is your key;" they ran away, and I after them, calling Stop thief! it was immediately after my hat was taken that the prisoner said, "Now give the b-r a rum one;" and Boyce said, "Don't hurt the poor b-r."</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the prisoner again, and say, on your oath, have you any doubt that the prisoner is the man who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120032"/>did the acts you have stated? A. I have no doubt whatever; I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How often have you been here before? A. In September and October Sessions; I indicted seven persons, Henry and James Boyce, Houghton, Hackman, Ore, Bishop, and Downes; I have seen Hackman and Ore since the trial - four in all have been acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear as positively to their identity? A. I did. I was out of the Court during part of their trial; I heard part of the defence made by the prisoners - several persons came up to prove that they were not on the spot at the time of the robbery. I have been on a trial at the Sheriff's Court, in Red Lion-square; I was tried at Clerkenwell, for assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty - but I did not conceive him to be on his duty; that was after the trials happened in this Court, I never said, "If any person came to take me up for a debt, that I would shoot them." I was found guilty of the assault and went into custody; I was brought up on the Saturday for judgment, and paid a fine of 1s., and the law expenses - my solicitor settled the expenses for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been on the day of the robbery? A. I had been attending my patients the whole of the day - I am certain of the prisoner. I did not say I believed he was the man, but that he was the man; I saw him just before he called out - I believe he is the person who first called out. Hackman, Bishop, Ore, and Downes were present at the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You state your arms were tied behind you, and one cried out, "Knock his b-y brains out;" have you always stated this to be so? A. I have; he also said, "If the b-r speaks, "I stated on the former trial that a man on my left-hand side used that expression - I did not name him. I did not swear that Boyce said that; nobody collected round till after I cried Stop thief! which was two or three minutes. I saw nobody come up till then, except the men who robbed me; but it is impossible for me to say that nobody did come. I was much alarmed at first, but Boyce promised I should not be hurt, and I looked about at them - some had sticks in their hands; I swear to the prisoner from his person, not from his dress - from his person and dress also. I believe he was examined four times at Worship-street - the first examination was Saturday fortnight, and the last on Monday last; he was committed on the third examination. I did not attend the first, being unwell; I was not able to produce sufficient evidence on the second, and was allowed till Saturday fortnight, on account of illness. I believe Garton was in the office; I do not recollect his being desired to leave the office. I never said I did not know the prisoner, or that I only believed him to be the man - I spoke positively to him in the first instance. I know Mr. Turner, who keeps the Rein Deer, public-house, on Bethnal-green - I do not recollect speaking to him that night, but I might; his house is a mile and a half or two miles from where I was robbed. I spoke to several people.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you a perfect recollection of the person of the prisoner? A. I have; I never entertained a doubt about him - the moment I saw West I told him I should know the person who took my hat, and described his person. I have always declared I should know the person who took my hat; Boyce and Houghton, were convicted - Boyce was executed.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bethnal-green. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th of June, at a place called Botany-bay. I had been looking for him ever since the robbery - I did not threaten or promise him in any way whatever. I said I apprehended him for a highway robbery, committed on Dr. Fuller - he said, "I wish I had given myself up at first - it would have been all over before now," and when we were waiting next door to the Police-office, before the examination, the same morning, I asked him what he had been doing with himself, as I had been after him to different places, full two hundred miles - he said he would be hanged sooner than come it - come it means impeaching against an associate - it is a term well known. On the evening the robbery was committed I saw the prosecutor about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, in the shop of the churchwarden, in Bethnal-green-road - he had no hat nor cravat; I went for assistance to the Bladebone public-house, which is about five doors off; there is a window in the passage, which shows the public house clock - I saw the clock, and it wanted about two minutes of a quarter to eight - that enables me to speak with certainly to the time I saw Mr. Fuller - he gave me information of the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Botany-bay by no other name? A. No; it is situated in Hare-street-fields; I do not know it as Granby's-row; I never looked up to see if it has any name - it may be a mile from Mr. Fuller's; I have stated accurately what the prisoner said; I have related all the conversation as near as I can recollect.</p>

On the 28th of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 4, Cock and Hoop-yard, Houndsditch, and found a box there containing the property stated in the indictment; when I entered the room the prisoner was sitting in the front-parlour, with the box before him - his hands were in it; he appeared to be counting the articles out; I asked him who they belonged to - he said they were his own, and he could show me a bill of parcels of them; I asked him to do so, but he said he was so confused that he could not find it then; no bill of parcels has ever been produced; I took him into custody with the articles; Mr. Reece saw them two or three days afterwards, and claimed them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How have you been sworn? A. On the Testament; I consider that oath not only binding on my conscience, but on my soul - I never doubted about a future state. I have a very large stock of smelling-bottles - they constitute a family; I know them by their features; here is a cut-bottle with a gilt top, which had been broken, and has been mended - it had been filled with salts before it was mended, and the smell still remains in it; my salts are of a peculiar compound - there is an article in them which nobody else puts, and by that I know the scent; here is another with the face of the Duke of Wellington on it - I made no mark on them, but I know them from their general appearance, and the salts that are in them; my young man purchased them from the manufacturer; I do not believe I have sold two of this sort; here is one filled with a sponge of a particular shape, and one with a tarnished silver top, which I can swear to, as well unto a man's countenance - it had got tarnished by the gas.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. They had got tarnished by the gas? A. Yes; they were kept near the gas, and became tarnished; one has a particular bruise on it, which I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not all plated or silver goods tarnish by being kept some time? A. Yes; we have had these three or four months; here is a bottle, with a peculiar smell, which I can swear to; I swear conscientiously, that no salts like these are kept any where else; they cannot be exactly like ours; the composition is our own; we have had this peculiar scent three or four months; we may have sold fifty bottles with it; we fill bottles when they are brought to us; these bottles are made by Gilbertson; his porter brings them to us; I have been to his house - he is an engraver and a chemical apparatus maker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you had many from Gilbertson with gilt tops? A. About half a dozen; here is one with a portrait of the Duke of Wellington - another with a bruise, which I can swear to; I believe them all to be ours.</p>

            , were examined on behalf of the prisoner, and deposed to their being in his company, at the Surry Theatre, on the 23d of June.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. My Lord, this robbery was on the 16th - this evidence has nothing to do with the case.</p>
               <p>PHILIP PHILLIPS. My Lord, I can prove where he was on the 16th, as well as on the 23d; I was asked about the 23d before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120034"/>Q. What have you to say about the 16th? A. On the 13th I received an order for goods, and on the 14th and 15th I was getting them ready; (I am a watch-maker, and occupy the first-floor at No. 4, Cock and Hoop-yard) on the 16th I was very poorly, and was taking salts, and stopped at home all day - and at that time the prisoner was very bad, and attended by Dr. Keith; he did not go out all day, for he was very ill - and on the 17th, which was Sunday, I left him to walk with my wife to Highburybarn; I got home about nine o'clock, and sat with him till ten, when I went up to supper - I returned and sat with him (which is not uncommon) till I went to rest. I have locked the street door myself every night for the last ten months, to preserve my property; I locked him in that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you told it was material to prove where he was on the 16th? A. I was not told to prove it at all; I knew there were two indictments against him; I was first given to understand this indictment was on the 23d, and afterwards on the 17th. Mr. Wooler told me it was on the 23d.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you it was on the 16th? A. He told me that last Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you then, when you were first examined, no to mention a word about the 16th? A. Because I was not asked. I recollect very well where he was on the 16th- my wife was with me, but she is not here. Dr. Keitch lives in Somerset-street, Goodman's-fields; I asked him to come here, but he said his profession would not allow it, he was so very busy; I did not call on him myself; I sent to him last week; I have not desired him since to come; my wife is very well: she knows as much about the prisoner being at home on the 16th as I do; I did not think it necessary to bring her - I do not know what was the matter with the prisoner - no doubt it was some internal complaint; he was at home also on the Sunday.</p>

            . I recollect Mr. Lyons being taken ill on the 15th, and he was ill the next day; I have boarded in his house for two years. I am sure he was not outside the door on the 16th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the house do you occupy? A. I boarded with Mr. Lyons, and live in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have an opportunity of seeing what business is carried on in his room? A. I am not in his room all day; I do not know what business is transacted there; I went under an operation at Guy's Hospital on the 19th of April, and since that have been in the habit of laying down two or three hours every day - I cannot say what happens when I am asleep. The officers awoke me up when they came. The prisoner occupies the second floor - I sleep on the ground floor, but in the day time lay down on his bed; he is down-stairs in the day time, for he also occupies the front room on the ground floor, and I have the back room ground floor at night also; I went to bed on the 16th, about eleven o'clock, after he had had retired to rest.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you let yourself in? A. Mr. Phillips always locks the door, and takes the key up with him; he left the house on the 23d, to go to the play. I was desired to come here to-day, but was not told to prove any thing about the 23d.</p>
               <p>MR. COPE re-examined. The house in question is in the City.</p>

            . I am a jobbing porter. On the 19th of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming up Cheapside with Girton, and saw the prisoners standing at a post at the end of Cheapside; they were strangers to me - I was on the opposite side of the way; another stood at another post; we saw them all join company, and watched them about three parts of the way down Newgate-street; they then met a carrier's cart - they all three turned back with it. I continued to watch them; the cart came down into Cheapide, and stopped a short time at the end of Milk-street - both the prisoners stopped with it; the other walked on the other side of the way; he had crossed some time before; I think I should know him again - they stood close by the cart; the third man stopped opposite to them: the cart then went on to Gracechurch-street - the prisoners followed it very close all the way, on the footpath. The third man still kept on the opposite side of the way, and was in Gracechurch-street with them; the carman left the cart in <placeName id="t18270712-55-crimeloc310">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

I did not see them again till the 9th of June, when they were in custody; I was positive of them both; I had them in sight nearly an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose you had no job that day? A. Yes, I had, but I had two or three hours to spare; I am only a jobbing porter; I live in White Hart-yard, Coleman-street. I was a minute or two looking for Girton, and when I turned back they were gone. I went across the street to look for him. I went to the carman when he came back, but alarmed nobody else - Girton is an officer, and I was walking with him - I have known him some years; I do not often walk out with him.</p>

The cart stopped nearly opposite Bell-yard - they stopped, and I told Henley to give a sharp eye on them while I went a little further down - I was on the same side as him; some carts and coaches came along, and I lost sight of the cart altogether; I might be a dozen yards from Henley; I saw him half an hour afterwards. I found the prisoners in custody on the 9th of June, and am certain of them - I should know the other man.</p>

I placed implicit confidence in him, and treated him like a brother. On Monday, the 25th of June, in consequence of information, I went and searched his house. Mr. Glover and two officers were with me; I there found a quantity of my property. I had never given him authority to take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MITCHELL. Q. Had you missed any of these things? A. I missed property at times, but had not the least suspicion of him, and when I have mentioned that things were missing, he has said, it was most likely I had sold it and forgotten it; he did piecework, but never took any thing home except a few wheels. I never allowed him to take any thing else home; he had no tools at home to finish any thing else. I have other workmen, but nobody but him attended in the shop. I thought him incapable of robbing me - I considered him as one of my family.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Elliott to the prisoner's house; I found all this property in his bed-room, on the second floor. I apprehended him before I went there; he asked what it was for, I told him his master had lost a considerable deal of property - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any articles of this sort, except what the prosecutor claimed? A. There were a few trifling things, which he said he would not swear to.</p>
               <p>MR. MITCHELL to MR. ELLIOTT. Q. What promise did you make to the prisoner's sister, before he wrote you this letter? A. I told her I did not wish to press the capital charge, as I thought he would be hung if I did; I do not know whether that was before or after he wrote the letter. I desired the attorney not to press the capital charge, as these articles must have been taken at different times.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 3d of June I received information, and found the lead was gone from the front of both houses - it had been fixed; I went round the brick-field with a person, and met Haggart, who gave me information; I found part of the lead in a ditch at the bottom of a garden. I received information, sent for an officer, and went in pursuit of five men; when I got to Bow common Lee, who lives on the common, sent for me into his house - he gave me information. I went over the bridge to Mile-end-road, and when I came within a hundred yards of Twig-folly-bridge I found two pieces of the lead, tied in a handkerchief, laying in a field, and one piece in a kind of apron; I gave it to Haggart, and went to Twig-folly-bridge, where some more lead was taken out of the water - I compared it with my house, and it fitted - it is worth 3l.; there was 184lbs. taken from one house, and 150lbs. from the other. I found the prisoner in custody the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MITCHELL. Q. Had you any mark on the lead? A. No, but it had been screwed to the house, and the screws soldered over; the holes corresponded.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On Sunday morning, the 3d of June, I went with Grundy to Bow-common, to Mile-end, and then to Twig-folly-bridge - I saw the prisoner standing there, with a bundle on his shoulder - I knew him before; another man was with him, whom I do not know; the prisoner threw his bundle down between Mile-end and Twig-folly-bridge; he had a waistcoat on, with sleeves; they both ran away - I left Grundy and pursued; I lost sight of the bundle in following another man, but I left Grundy standing by it - when it was opened it contained lead, which I saw applied to the building, and it exactly fitted - I did not take the prisoner myself. The lead in that bundle weighed about 40lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was water near the place? A. Yes; he could have thrown it into the water if he had carried it further. I heard a fortnight after he was taken, that the parish had offered a reward; and I said "If so, I had as much right to part of it as any body." I cannot say that the bundle is the same that the prisoner threw away.</p>

On the 13th of June, between two and four o'clock, the prisoner brought this parcel to the shop, directed to Mrs. Ustonson; he said there was half a crown to pay for it - I took it up stairs - my mistress sent half a crown down by the boy, who I saw delivered it to the prisoner; I afterwards went to Houndsditch, but could find no No. 14; I found a Mr. Johnson, an ironmonger, in Houndsditch, but his name was not John; we have not supplied him with any articles - the prisoner said he brought the parcel from the Edinburgh mail.</p>
               <p>The letters enclosed in the parcel were here read - one was addressed to Mrs. Ustonson, dated Edinburgh, the 12th of June, desiring various articles of fishing-tackle to be sent by Thursday night, to John Johnson, No. 14, Houndsditch, and was signed

               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, stated that in 1816 he had quarrelled with his wife, who had sworn the peace against him; he was at last compelled to leave his business and home to avoid her - that about six years after he wrote to the Magistrate, to know if she was living - and receiving no answer, concluded she was dead; he then married again; and having been separated seven years, he conceived he was not acting illegal - and that the prosecution was brought by Pocknell's brothers entirely, contrary to her desire.</p>
               <p>ANN POCKNELL. I married the prisoner - he did not tell me that he had been married, and had children. The prosecution is instituted by my desire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am prevented from having legal advice, having assigned all my property to my wife.</p>

The gig did not come back, and on Monday I heard there was a man before the Magistrate - I went, and found him there - he had a cheque in his pocket, for 14l.; I traced the drawer of the cheque to Cockspur-street, and there I found the gig. I certainly did not intend to sell it to him. I inquired at Hoxton, but no such person lived there.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman, and live at Highgate. Higgins came to my house and inquired for some camellias. I showed him a barrow-load, which had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120041"/>two or three hundred single ones and about fifty double ones. About eight o'clock in the morning, on the 31st of May, the prisoner brought them to my house, at Highgate; he first inquired for employ, and said he had come from Mr. Jones, of Wandsworth. I told him we did not want any hands - he then said, Mr. Jones told him to ask if I wanted any camellias, and that he had brought some with him - they were then brought into the yard in a barrow; another man was with him, who appeared intoxicated. I cannot say which brought them in. I looked at them, and asked the prisoner how they came in that state, as they were out of pots; it was a very hot morning, and there was nothing over them but a flannel jacket; they appeared more like laurel cuttings than anything else - the prisoner said Jones had an execution on his premises, and was glad to get them out any how. I asked how they got broken so, as some were literally smashed; he said the man who assisted him in wheeling them had fallen over them - I asked what Jones wished me to do; he said he wished me to send him 2l. for them. I said that was nothing like the value - he said, I could settle it with Jones when I saw him; I said, "Jones must come himself to me;" he said he could not, for he was ill in bed. I looked over the plants, and thought proper to detain them; I gave the prisoner 1l., and told him to call next morning; he begged hard for more, as Jones was much distressed - I gave him 5s. more; he asked for a pint of beer, which I gave - his name he said was Steel. I asked Jones' direction; he said, "No. 3, Church-lane, Wandsworth." I made inquiry, and Higgins came to me next morning - the prisoner also came next morning, and I detained him; I delivered him to an officer - another man was with him, who ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what a conservatory is? A. Yes; plants in a conservatory are turned out of pots; but in green or hot-houses they are in pots, and stand on frames generally.</p>

Coles came up, and said the sack was to come back - I gave it to him. We returned together, and Bishop said they were not paid for; we went back, and found them in the hampers on the donkey; the prisoner was gone.</p>

            , and have been so for thirty years, but have not been much in town; we have been hunting for the last sixteen years. On the 26th of May, about half-past five o'clock, or near six, I was in Holborn, near Fleet-market - the prisoner tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Ah! Mr. Gadsby - how long have you been from Nottinghamshire?" I said,"I have been here since Tuesday last, but I don't know you;" he said, "No, but you know a man who lives under the Duke of Portland, and has a large farm;" I said,"The Duke has several large farms;" we walked on together; he said, "The man I mean is a horse-dealer, and keeps a public-house;" I said, "Then it is Ben Smith;" he said, "Yes it is - he is my own cousin." I asked where he himself came from - he said from Lincolnshire; he asked when I was to return; we had a good deal of conversation; I told him I was to return next night, from the Angel, St. Martin's-le-grand, and had just taken my place; I asked where he lived in town - he said in John-street, Islington, and that he had only come that day; we talked about the country. He said he wondered I did not know him, for he was at his cousins five or six weeks back, and I had brought a message about a horse - I recollected that, but did not tell him so; we went on - he said, "You was not at Lincoln fair;" I said No - he said his cousin was there, and had a wrangle about a horse - I had heard about that; we walked on - he looked up, and said, "What place is this?" I said, "Holborn; you must be as strange as I am" - he then asked if I would go with him to a public-house while he wrote to his cousin, as there was a little difference between them, which might be settled by a letter, and they were both interested in it - he asked if I would carry the letter for him. He was dressed like a country farmer, and had corded breeches on; he had the same on at Bow-street, but had a fine pair of overalls over them then; I said I would not go into a public-house, but if he would call on me at the Duke of Portland's I would take the letter - I was then turning into Lincoln's Inn-fields, going home - he said his business lay at Islington, but as he was walking for recreation he would go with me a little way. When he got into Lincoln's Inn-fields he looked about, and said, "There are no carriages here - what place is it?" I said, "You are as big a stranger as I am;" we got into Queen-street - he said, "Here is a public-house, I'll treat you with a glass of any thing, if you will go in while I write the letter;" we went up into a parlour - he asked what I would take; I said only a little beer; he called for half beer and half ale; he pulled out his book, and said, "I want change for a sovereign," and said to me, "These are the things to go through life with - sovereigns and Bank of England notes are the things to keep - country notes will be run on, as they have been before." A man came in, who appeared to me to be muddled in liquor, and asked if a lady had been to inquire for him - we said No; he asked how long we had been there - we said only a few minutes, and he had better inquire of the landlord - he went, and came back; he then said he had got a great deal of money, and had 170l. a year left him; and was going to marry a clergyman's daughter, and she had a good deal; he threw his money on the table; I then said to the prisoner, "Come - here is no paper here, and I want to be going;" he said, "No, there is no accommodation here - we will go on;" we went on - the drunken man came out, and said he wanted to go to Wiltshire; I said, "I will show you where there is a coach, and will see that no harm comes of you;" the prisoner said, what a good thing it was that he had fallen into our hands. I then said I had to go to Wild-street; I went to a grocer's shop there, to buy some tea, and when I returned the prisoner stood at the top of Wild-street; he then said he would go into another public-house, in <placeName id="t18270712-84-crimeloc467">Long-acre</placeName>

The prisoner then shook a hat, with halfpence in it, gambled with the drunken man, and won a sovereign of him; I said that was not right - he said he did not mean to keep it, and gave it him again. About two glasses of brandy and water were drank; the drunken man then offered me money to take care of him; I had never seen him before; I did not like their going on, and said I would go- the prisoner said if I would give him my direction he would call on me, and then said he would meet me at the Angel next night, and go into the country with me, to see his cousin; I then took out my pocket-book, to get the case of a letter, to write my direction on; the drunken man took hold of the book, shook it, and said, "You have sovereigns there;" the prisoner then laid his hand on it, and said,"Here are notes as well as money" - I put my hand on it, and said, "Let my book alone;" I took it up, put it into my left side breast pocket, and said I would go; the drunken man then came again, and offered me money to let him go with me; the prisoner then took and shook the left breast of my coat, and said, "Take it, take it;" I said, "No; I will go directly." I took up my umbrella, and away I went - they both followed me down the stairs, and before I had got far along the street the prisoner came and said,"Mr. Gadsby, where is the man?" I said I did not know; he said, "I suppose he is forward, in the crowd;" I said,"You may go after him, for I won't" - he went. The three gentlemen said to me in the public-house, "What a good old gentleman you are to take care of that man." - When I got home to the Duke of Portland's I went to take out my pocket-book - it was gone, and this brown paper parcel was there - he must have taken my pocket-book out, and put this in instead of it, when he shook my coat - no man had laid hands on me but the prisoner. My pocketbook contained two 10l. and six 5l. Bank notes, fourteen sovereigns, and a 5l. Leicester note, payable in London. - The prisoner was taken next day, at the Black Horse public-house, in the Borough - he was then dressed quite like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How many public-houses had you been to that day? A. Only to the two I have mentioned; I had part of the brandy and water, and a little porter - I had dined at home - I drank nothing else; I left the second public-house about eight o'clock, or a quarter before; I missed my money about a quarter or twenty minutes past eight o'clock; he took hold of my coat with one hand - I did not see him put the other hand to me - I did not look at him particulary; he must have put his other hand into my pocket; I was about three yards from the other men; I was about a quarter of an hour in the house - I did not talk with the three men at all; I do not know what has become of the drunken man; I was in town about two years ago; I do not know how he learnt my name; I heard my sovereigns jingle when my book was on the table; when the prisoner was taken he had got some bright farthings - it was a sovereign he wanted changed; I did not go out of my way with him; I am still in his Lordship's service; when he took hold of my coat the table was not between us - I was at the end of it, and he was close to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner say that Ben Smith, who keeps the public-house, was his cousin? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Sunday, the 17th of June, about 4 o'clock in the morning, I was going off duty, and saw the two prisoners, with one Shirley, turn round a corner of Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea; Cook had three loaves; More had a bundle, and Shirley another parcel; I pursued - Cook threw down the loaves; More threw his bundle over into No. 1, Frankland's-row; I knew him before, and am certain of him; the bundle was like a large dish tied up - they separated. I pursued Shirley, and lost sight of the others; he threw his bundle over a high fence- that contained the four fowls; More's parcel was a leg and loin of lamb - the fowls were quite warm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you lose sight of More? A. Yes, for nearly half an hour - I then took him; I might be fifty yards from him when he threw it away - one Allen pursued them; Cook ran past me; I took another turning, and More came up to me. Cook gave himself up to a watchman.</p>

I was at the Cheshire Cheese public-house - this man came to me; we got intoxicated, and it being late we slept in the fields - we met Shirley in the morning, with a bundle, which he said was linen; as we went along he said, "There is the Bow-street officer - you had better run."</p>

            . I am Ely's brother-in-law. I went out, from her description, and found the prisoner in Newport-market; she said, "That is the woman;" the prisoner turned round, and said, "Did you speak to me;" I said Yes; and told her what my sister had said; she denied having seen her; I asked if she would go back with me; she said Yes; and when we had got a little way, she wanted to return to her friends; I saw in her hand a paper bag; I then told her it was of no use to deny it, as my sister had described her as having such a bag as that; she again wanted to go to her mother's in Covent-garden; I went part of the way, and then gave her into custody; I asked her again about the things - she said she was so agitated she could not tell if she had taken them, but she had not.</p>

Yes; it was about twenty minutes past one o'clock in the morning; I had left home with a friend at ten o'clock at night; I was not talking to any women, and had not seen the prisoner before; I went into a public-house - he came in after us - they refused to draw me liquor, because it was an improper hour, not because I was drunk; I never said I had dropped my money; I gave an alarm directly; he said my waistcoat was unbuttoned, and he would button it; I said, "No, I thank you;" he took hold of the bottom of my waistcoat, and took the money - only two buttons were undone; a female was near me, who asked a question, which I did not hear - and while I turned my head, he put his hand into my pocket; I seized him - he returned me the money, and ran away; the watchman came up and took him.</p>

            . I was pot-boy to Mr. Morrison. On the 22d of June, in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the pot-house, cleaning knives; I went towards the copper - he said to me, "What are you going about?" I said, "To boil and scower the pots;" he said I had better do it tomorrow; I said, "I shall do it to day;" he then said,"I have got a can of stout in the copper;" I asked where he got it; he said, "From the cellar;" I told my master, who told me to watch; I afterwards saw him sell five quarts of stout out of that can, to different people in the garden; he put the money into his pocket; I said, "You are carrying on a nice game;" he said "Yes; I mean to do more yet."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever quarrel with him? A. Never; he must have filled the can again, as it only holds four quarts; I went into the garden at eight o'clock at night, and saw him sell two pots out of it; I told my master, who saw him sell one pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never throw the slops into a can? A. No; it may be done by some people.</p>

On the 19th of June I saw the prisoner running in Frith-street; I inquired what was the matter - a lady said he had robbed a gentleman of his handkerchief - I took him, but found nothing on him; a gentleman named Robert Farquhar came to Marlborough-street office afterwards, and said he had been robbed of his handkerchief; the prisoner did not deny it, but begged him not to prosecute.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where was he in the crowd? A. He stood just on my left-hand - he stood very quiet for a minnute, then came and stood in front of me, with his back towards me, bent himself and pushed me into the road - I could not move or stir; I had an umbrella; and his back was towards me. He pushed me intentionally; there was no occasion for it; I felt my watch go at the moment he pushed against me, he then turned round - I caught hold of his tail as he crossed the road, and a waggon came by.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was looking at the band. I heard the prosecutor cry, "My watch!" he had hold of the prisoner's coat-tail. I ran up and collared him - he had a large handkerchief flying in his hand; I took him, but found nothing on him - he said he had lived many years with Mr. Solomon, about Petticoat-lane, and had been to Peerless-pool to bathe - we were some time at Worship-street; another witness there, stated that she had seen him take the watch and give it to another person - but she says she will not come here till the prosecutor pays her expences. I summoned her; she afterwards said it was only hearsay. The prosecutor said the prisoner had offered him 5s. a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You say in your deposition, "The prosecutor stated to me part of what he has now said, but did not mention the 5s. a week?" A. I said it because he had not said so the first time, he had stated it when I was examined - he mentioned it to me before he went in to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor about half-past nine o'clock - she asked me to go and have something to drink. I took him to the Half-moon, public-house, and had three glasses of rum; he said, "Take my watch and wind it up." I said, I did not like; he then took it from his fob, and put it into my hand; he and this witness came out with me. I had my shawl taken off my shoulders and was knocked down - the prosecutor was tipsy.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Henry Farmer on the 28th of June, in Holborn; I went with him to Birch, who keeps a marine-store shop, No. 15, Short's-gardens; I there found a number of books in sheets, which I produce; I took Sarah, his mother, in Great Wild-street; she said she had given a bag to take something to Birch's; H. Farmer said he had lost the sovereign, and spent 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he not say the books were safe? A. No - he said his mother would settle about them, and she said her son had lost the sovereigns; she did not tell me the books were placed at Birch's while she was moving. I found them in a chair, near the bed; he said, the second time, that the boy's mother left them there till he returned from breakfast; he did not say the boy was going to call for them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with one Campbell to Birch's - he said, "It is all made up - I will give you all the money I have;" he offered me thirty sovereigns not to take him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not that as a security for his appearance? A. He said, "I shall be locked up all night," but did not offer it as security, I am certain - Campbell is not here. The books had been found before.</p>
               <p>W. H. WRIGHT. I believe these to be the same books - they are twenty volumes of Don Juan, and ten of Kirk White's poems.</p>
               <p>HENRY FARMER's Defence. I did not mean to keep the books, but to send them the same day - I had lost the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>BIRCH's Defence. Mrs. Farmer sold me an old kettle; she afterwards brought this paper in her hands, and said would I let her leave it till the boy returned from breakfast - I put them in the chair, without looking at them. The officer came in a quarter of an hour, and took them - about nine o'clock at night the officers came, quite drunk, and said I must go to the watch-house; I said I would give them security till to-morrow; I offered them 10l. - they said that would not do, and I asked if 30l. would do- they said, "Let us see it;" I produced it - they clapped the handcuffs on; the boy was frightened, as he had lost two sovereigns.</p>

On Sunday, the 7th of July, I put two 5s. papers of halfpence on my breakfast-table, and about eleven o'clock, when she came to set the breakfast things, I missed one paper; I said nothing, but in the evening, after my house was closed, I heard a noise at my till; I went up, and missed 91/2d. from the till; I called her, and said I wanted to speak to her; she was pushing something down her bosom - I shook her stays, and 91/2d. fell from her; I sent her down stairs, and observed her move her gown; I went down and took from her petticoat this handkerchief; she wanted to go to the water-closet; I called her out in a few minutes, and found another handkerchief there.</p>

My fish-pond had been dragged, I think, between twelve and one o'clock on the morning of the 19th of May - I saw the marks of several feet round it, and the flowers were trodden down, and some of the young spawn was on the bank. I then went to an officer, and directed him to search for the parties - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he admitted to bail? A. Yes; he has now surrendered.</p>

On Friday night, the 18th of May, the prisoner was out - my husband went out about four o'clock in the morning, and at half-past six the prisoner came home - he knocked at the door; the landlord let him in - he had a watering-pot in his hand and asked him to see what beautiful fish he had got - I saw them afterwards; there was one large gold fish, full of spawn, and two small silver ones - he put them down by the water-butt; they were there at eleven o'clock in the morning, when I went out, and before twelve I was accused of stealing his fish.</p>

I went out- and a boy said the prisoner had picked up the money; I ran round the corner and seized him. I had seen him pick something up - he said he would not give it up; he was afterwards brought to my shop, and said he would give it up if she could swear she had dropped it - he said he would go to the Magistrate to decide it.</p>

On the 22d of June I was going to work in Finsbury-market - I saw Marcus with a lad about eighteen years old, and the prisoner walking at a distance, with four umbrellas - I saw the other leave Marcus and beckon to the prisoner, who ran off with him towards Long-alley - I was not aware that I should do right, or I could have taken them - I went on to one of my work-people, and as I returned I saw Marcus crying - I took him to Worship-street, and gave information.</p>

I said, "What business had you up the scaffold?" he said he was after no harm. I put my hand down, and felt a trowel in the waistband of his small-clothes. I gave him in charge - another trowel was found upon him. I had not seen him on the scaffold, but suspected him.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL HARRISON. I live with Mr. Hornylove, a trunk-maker, in the City-road. Last Sunday night, about half-past ten o'clock, I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18270712-167-crimeloc924">Gloucester-row, Hoxton</placeName>

Just as I turned round the row, the prisoner came behind, and snatched it out of my hand- he ran into Myrtle-street - I pursued, and called Stop thief! I lost sight of him in Cross-street, for about three minutes, but I saw him again, and he was taken - my bundle was picked up by the watchman. I am certain of his person; no one else was running.</p>

On the 6th of June I was in Oxford-street, about five o'clock in the evening, and was accosted by a man, who said he had some cheap gloves to sell. I went with him to a house in <placeName id="t18270712-169-crimeloc936">Robert-street</placeName>

I agreed with that man for two dozen pairs of gloves, at 10d. per pair - I had not seen the pirsoner then. The man said I should have them in the evening. He then gave me a piece of linen and a shawl, to keep as security - I gave him a sovereign, and he left the room; and the prisoner then entered the room, pushed by me, and took the goods from me. I told him I had paid for them - I was standing at the table, with them in my hand. He said I should not have them till I had paid more money; I said I had paid a sovereign, and would have them - he swore I should not, till he had more money, and I left the house to get an officer - I could find none, but gave information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the value of the goods? A. I cannot tell; the cloth was as thick as my arm; I did not go back to the house that evening - I passed by, to know the name of it, but spoke to no one, nor did I go into it, I swear that. I never saw the man who sold me the gloves, in the prisoner's company. I went to the house next day, and inquired of the landlord for the prisoner; two dozens of gloves were sent to my house after the prisoner was examined. I did not go back and see the prisoner at the house; I walked up the street, to see for an officer, and as I returned I think I saw the prisoner near the door, but I could not find an officer, and could not wait, as some friends were coming to dinner; I did not speak to him; it must have been between seven and eight o'clock when I passed the house - I had dined then, and had a friend with me; I did not go in - I did not like the looks of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say the parcel was his, and the man had no right to leave it with you? A. No. I would not give 1l. for the things; I only took them as security; it was a cotton shawl.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 15th of June, in Holborn - I said"'Richard, I want you - there is information that you committed a felony in Robert-street, respecting some gloves;" he denied it - I said I must secure him - he said, "Well, what would you advise me to do?" I said I could advise him nothing, and as we went along he said, "Do you think if the swell gets his money he will be satisfied?" I said, "No, I think he means to prosecute." I left him with Furzman, while I went into the City - when I returned he said, "Now, Buckeridge, as a man, what would you advise me to do?" I said I could advise nothing, and took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a licenced-hawker, and went out with a man who carries goods for me; I met my brother and a friend; we went to the Rodney's Head, in Robert-street, and left my bundle with the landlord; I sent my man to get some steaks - we dined, and about half-past four o'clock the prosecutor and another person came and went into the parlour; a man named Bond then came in, took up my goods, and carried them into the parlour, to this gentleman. The other person came into the tap-room, and said he hoped I should not be offended, but he had left a piece of linen and a shawl with the gentleman; they had cost me above 4l. - I said he had no business with my goods. I went into the parlour - my goods were on the table; I went to pack them up - the prosecutor said, "These goods are to go with me, as I have paid a sovereign for some gloves," and pointed to the man who had spoken to him in the street; I said he was a stranger, and unless he paid for them I would not let them go; he went away, returned at half-past five o'clock, and inquired if the person who was to sell him the gloves had returned- they said he had not, but he would be there - he then asked if I would give him the sovereign which he had paid; I said I had had no sovereign, and would give nothing - he went away, returned about six o'clock, and said again,"Will you give me the sovereign?" I said No - he then said if the gloves were not sent that evening, he would next morning see further about it; I heard no more till I was taken in charge. I knew the man who sold the gloves had been arrested, and sent to the Marshalsea - he said nothing about the bundle when he came back. I never said, would the swell take his money.</p>

            . I am a soda-water maker, and live in Camden-town. I was at the Rodney's Head about an hour, when the prisoner came in; I was in his company two or three hours, from four o'clock till half-past six or seven- I am certain he was there till half-past six.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did he not leave the house during all that time? A. No - he had a pipe - I was in the same room with him; he was not away above two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you known him? A. Twelve or fourteen years. I was a publican when I first knew him - he lives somewhere in the City. I met him by accident - I did not see the prosecutor there. I know Bond, a broker; I believe I have seen the prisoner in his company, but not lately - it is two or three months since I have seen Bond; I cannot say where it was, or when; I have drank with the prisoner at that house. Bond very likely might be there, but I do not recollect it. I never knew the prisoner by any other name - I never heard him called Bond.</p>

            . I met a young man about the 18th of June; he asked if I would go over to the Marshalsea prison; I went there, and saw Bond - he told me to call next day, and gave me a parcel of gloves and a note, which I took to No. 26, Bryanstone-square - I left them with the servant - they were gloves.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known Bond? A.

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and am a printer. I went to this house with my brother; as we went into the room he took his bundle from the lad, and asked the landlord to take care of it; I saw the prosecutor there that evening; he asked if the young man had returned, who he paid a sovereign to, for some gloves; a young man there said he need not fear, as he would be sure to send them. A young man said he had taken the liberty to leave some of my brother's goods; my brother went in a passion, and said he had no business to leave them - he went into the parlour, and got them. We remained there till about seven o'clock, and went away together.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Who is your master? A. Mr. Walden; he had sent me to Duke-street with a message, but it may hurt him to mention who I was to go to; I went out about half-past twelve o'clock, and went to Duke-street - I do not like to mention the business I went about. The prosecutor asked if that fellow had returned, who he had paid the sovereign to; I went into the house between 3 and 4 o'clock - my master lives about a mile and a half from the public-house; my brother was in the parlour for eight or ten minutes; I do not know the man who took his goods - he was quite a stranger; I have heard his name was Bond; Mr. Phillips came to the house twice that evening - whether he gave his address I cannot say; my brother was angry at his goods being taken- he was with me all the evening; I might see Bond come in, but I do not know him. I went to a house in King-street, Westminster, with my brother, about half-past eight o'clock, and remained till half-past ten - he had a bundle and a blue bag.</p>
               <p>JOHN AVANT. Bond has been a broker, in the upholdstery line, and dealt in drapery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. The goods were in my possession - I had my hand upon them.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On Sunday, the 1st of July, about half-past ten o'clock I and Parker were at Hornsey-lane-end, and saw the prisoner driving a cart, apparently loaded with hay, towards town; we stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said nothing but hay, which he was taking to his master, at the Sluice-house - I turned the hay up, and found a quantity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120063"/>of timber; I asked whose cart and horse it was; he said he did not know. There was no name on it - he said his master had bought the timber of Mr. Fox - I took him back to Fox - he then said he did not buy it there, that he got it at the Jolly Butchers public-house; the cart and horse turned out to belong to Faint, of the Sluice-house.</p>

I said, my watch and money - she said, "You had no watch." I looked about, but could not find it; I went and fetched the watchman up - she again denied it ten or twelve times, but after some time she drew it from her pocket, but she would not deliver up any money.</p>

               <p>SARAH PENND. I am the wife of William Pennd, and live at Hammersmith. On the 30th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was waiting about for my husband to come home - some man came by and pushed me down - I did not know him; I do not know whether he took my shawl off, or it fell off - I tried to keep it on my shoulders - I had hold of it, and slipped off the pavement, which made me let go.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you ever said, before a Magistrate, "The shawl was dragged from me?" A. I said the same as I do now; there was a crowd, and I could not find it; I never allowed any one to take it - I saw it again next day; I do not know the prisoner; I saw him in about half an hour, and thought he was the man, but was not positive; I went up and asked him for my shawl - he said he knew nothing of it; I thought he might be the man, and gave him in charge - a strange woman returned it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not swear at the office the very reverse of what you have to day? A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man who took your shawl accuse you of taking his money? A. No; he never spoke about any money; I did not swear to the prisoner at the office; I did not swear that I saw a man do it; I had spoken to no man before it was taken; I cannot say more than I have; I did not say it fell down, and I could not tell who took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not frequently been taken up on charge of robbery? A. No; I shall swear to nothing. I was married eighteen months ago, at the new church at Chelsea; my maiden name was Bury.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you persist in saying you are the man's wife? A. I shall say no more - I am married to him - I have not been in custody; I knew Swan, and was never in his custody, or any body else's in my life, for any thing at all; I have been taken up for being a little intoxicated, but never for theft.</p>

I put my watch and seals into my stocking, and put them in my hat, and we went to bed together; I awoke between four and five o'clock in the morning - my things were then safe; she was then gone down stairs - she came up, took them out of my hat, and was out with them in a moment. I have not recovered them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known her? A. Six or seven years; but I never was at her own home - another girl was in the room; they were both in the bed. I was not much in liquor - I had some beer there - I had not time to stop her, nor to cry out.</p>

On the 4th of June these articles were in the first floor front room, where I lodge - I caught the prisoner in the room at four o'clock in the morning. I do not know how he got in, but I was awoke; and a man who slept with me, was jostling with him - he was at the side of my box, my things were all turned upside down; he said if I would let him go he would make the things all right, which he had taken before. He had got into the house somehow, and broken a hole through the lath and plaster, and unbolted the door; he said he had taken two parcels before, and the watchman had taken one parcel from him. I went and found the watchman had got part of my property.</p>

I had put my trousers under the pillow; there had been another woman there, but she was not near the bed. I missed a handkerchief from under my head - I found two halfpence in my fob, which I am certain were not there when I went to sleep.

            . The prisoner was in Mr. Borsley's employ, in a confidential situation. I went to his lodging on the 6th of July, and found these articles; I can swear to some, by their being Mr. Borsley's cutting; and the mark is on the toe, which is usual: the prisoner worked in the house, and has not done journey-work for fifteen months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Can you tell when these articles were in your shop? A. We had no satin of this colour till within the last two months; we might have some nearly like it; he was at our shop from seven o'clock in the morning till nine at night; I swear to the colour of the silk; the foreman is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were such things as these laying about the shop? A. Yes; the prisoner did not work - his duty was to attend the shop, and give out work; his wife sometimes came to the shop.</p>

On the 30th of May I missed these salts from my room - the prisoner lodged there - I knew that he went into my room for the utensil. He went out about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning - the salts have not been found; no other person lodged there. I locked the stair foot door between nine and ten o'clock, when I had lighted him up stairs - I missed the salts between nine and ten in the morning; I had seen them about five on the evening before - the door had been kept locked.</p>

He sat down, and had a pot of beer; I drank with him; he asked me the time; I pulled out my watch, and told him. He said, "You seem to have a pretty good watch there, let me look at it". I did so - he said it was pretty, and put it into his pocket. I asked him for it; he said, "I wish you may get it," and soon afterwards he went out with it. I went to him next morning - he rerefused to go with me - I told him he had had my watch raffled for; he denied it. I had him taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How many other persons have you charged with stealing your watch? A. None. I never charged Talbot with stealing one, nor Pollock. I was at the Black Horse, that day, but charged nobody there with it, nor fetch an officer to take a man there. I found the prisoner at a public-house with Brooks, a hair-dresser - he staid there while I fetched the beadle to take him. I have never got my watch back. Two more were in his company, one is named Garvin - I swear I did not give him the watch to look at, out of my hand. I was sober; I did not see him go out; I did not know where he lived - I mentioned it to nobody that evening - I said I had lost it, but I forgot then that he had not returned it to me, but I recollected myself afterwards.</p>

I saw the prosecutor, Garvin, and another, drinking together - one of them said my clock was stopped - the prosecutor then pulled out his own watch, and said it wanted a quarter to twelve - the prisoner then pulled out his, and it wanted twenty minutes. The prisoner said,"Coachman, you have a nice watch there, let me look at it;" he took it, and sat about twenty minutes, with the two watches in his hand. Wiltshire then said, "You have my watch, I expect you to return it." The prisoner said, I wish you may get it;" and in about twenty minutes the prisoner and the other two went out; Wiltshire staid there. He said no more about the watch, and I suppose he had forgotten it - they were all sober.</p>

               <p>ARTHUR MEGGS. I live in Old Gravel-lane. On Tuesday morning, the 5th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of Bedford-square, Commercial-road; I had been at a Parochial dinner the day before, and was going home rather intoxicated, but knew what I was about; I met a man in crossing Whitechapel, and asked him to show me the nearest way into the Commercial-road; he took hold of me by the arm, and conducted me to the neighbourhood of <placeName id="t18270712-199-crimeloc1090">Bedford-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I am told that you were exceedingly intoxicated that night? A. I was not very drunk - I had been drinking a bottle or two of sherry, perhaps, but I had no porter; I had not been talking about the watch, and swinging it about.</p>

            . I am a ship-broker. I was in the neighbourhood of Bedford-square; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me - the prosecutor was running in the same direction - I took the prisoner; he was taken to the watch-house, and this watch was taken from his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the coat taken off his back? A. Yes - by Mr. Tedwick, a friend of mine - he is not here; it came off in the scuffle, and was carried about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour's walk; I believe my friend carried the coat the whole time; he might have given it to another person for a minute or two, as I lost sight of him - the prosecutor was not very drunk.</p>

Never; I often sold them brushes; the prisoner used to make pattern brushes; I do not know that he worked for himself; I once had a porter named Robert; I do not know his sirname - I dismissed him for spoiling some goods - the prisoner was never discharged, but he was not at work about the time the duplicate is dated.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23d of June I went into the public-house, next door to the prisoner's house; he came and asked if I wanted him; Mr. Kent gave him in charge - he was quite intoxicated; he wished me to make away with the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not so drunk that he did not know what he was about? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. KENT. I will swear to these clothes-brushes - some of them are not finished; the tooth-brushes are finished - I never sold them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the tooth-brushes of Mr. Goodlad, of Hatton-garden - some of the others were booked by Mr. Kent, to one of his men - the others I bought of Mr. Roberts in January.</p>
               <p>MR. KENT. I sold Roberts some brushes four, five, or six years ago, but we were not then in the habit of selling brushes of this description to working people - I do not know how long ago it was, as I do not sell them myself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you leave Mr. Kent? A. The latter end of January - I left of my own accord; I have had some thousands from him at different times; I have sold the prisoner some previous to January; I sold him at different times fifty or sixty within twelve months, of the very same pattern and make as these.</p>

On Wednesday last, the prisoners came to my house together - I knew Mary Bryant before; they said they were come to smash a young woman, who lodged with me, named Swail - my door was open - I followed them into my room, and told them to walk out, and not make a noise in my house. Mary said, "Don't push me;" and after some-time they went out. When they were gone I missed this cotton off the bed - Mary had sat down by the side of it. I went out and found them in Chapel-street, Edgeware-road - Mary had got my shawl on her neck; I gave charge of them. Mary Bryant had lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Do not you keep a bad house? A. I do not; Swail is a dress-maker. Mary Bryant brought persons home to my house, and therefore I got rid of her.</p>

On the 11th of July, I saw Ellen Bryant at the top of Charles-street, with this cotton in her lap, shewing it to a young woman; I heard her say"Here is some cotton, which I have been and collared;" she then ran away.

I had a duplicate of a watch in my fob pocket - my money was in my trousers pocket, and a penknife in my waistcoat pocket. I put my trousers under my head; I was awoke about five o'clock, by a knocking at the door, by the prisoner, another man, and a woman - they came into the room; as I told them to come in. I then said if they would withdraw I would dress myself; they said they wanted a man to go with them to Billingsgate, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120072"/>buy mackarel. I do not know what name they mentioned - I got up to put on my things, and said, "I think that woman has taken my stockings;" the prisoner said, "Look: perhaps they are in your hat;" (the girl was then gone down) he went up to my hat and gave it me - my stockings were there; he might have been near the hat - he asked if I had been robbed. I knew then that I had, but I said,"It is of no consequence;" as I did not wish to give them any information - we then all came down together, and I took notice of the house. I had missed my duplicate and money when I began to dress myself. I went on Monday morning early, to the pawnbroker's, and desired him to detain any one who came to take the watch out. The prisoner was afterwards taken, and my knife found in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Where had you been? A. Paying some men, and receiving money. I had drank some ale and gin, but was not drunk - I had the sovereign in my hand when I went into the house - the girl was gone when I awoke; my trousers were not on when the property was taken.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KING. I am shopman to Mr. Cotterel, a pawnbroker. On the 10th of June the prosecutor came to stop the duplicate of the watch, and about eight o'clock the prisoner came in with the duplicate. I asked where he got it - he said he bought it of a young man, whom he knew perfectly well. I asked if that was true - he then ran out; I followed him nearly half a mile, and brought him back.</p>

I left them safe, up stairs, on my premises, about half-past eight o'clock. I returned at half-past nine and saw a light on the table on the ground floor - I had left a lodger at home - it was his light - I missed the property. On the Monday I went with the officer to the Three Cranes, public-house, where the officer found some silk in the bar.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 5th of March I went to the Three Cranes public-house, Mile-end-road, which is kept by the prisoner - he and his wife were at dinner in the bar; I called him aside, and told him I had a warrant to search his house for stolen silk; he said he had no silk in the house, and I might search in welcome, but might he finish his dinner first - I said Yes; he went into the bar, but instead of finishing his dinner, whispered to his wife, and then said, "I am now at leisure to go any where with you; what part of the house will you go to first;" I said "Up-stairs, into your bed-room;" we went up - I found a chest of drawers locked; he said the key was down-stairs; he called for it - the servant handed it up, but I found no silk; I came to another chest of drawers which were locked; I asked for the key, and at that time he put a paper into my hand, which proved to be a 5l. note. I said, "I must look;" he then said, "You had better give me that back again;" we came down together - he called for the key of those drawers; I took the prosecutor up with me, and left the prisoner in charge of two other men below, but found nothing in the drawers; I came down, and sent the prisoner and two men to search the back premises - they staid some time - I went, and the prosecutor said, the prisoner was gone out at the gate, and the boy had let him out; I returned to the bar, and found a handkerchief, containing these silks, in a little side, dark place, like a child's bed- it laid on the bed-clothes; the prosecutor claimed it; the prisoner was never found till Thursday week, when he sent me a note, and came to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Of course you returned the 5l. note? A. No - I have kept it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not, on your finding the tobacco, on which duty had not been paid, that he offered the note? A. I found a quantity of tobacco; his wife said the silk had been left an hour before, by a short young man; she did not hear what I had said to the prisoner; he has one female and two male servants.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Were not two officers left below while you went up stairs? A. Yes - in the passage, to see that nobody went out</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner last Thursday at her lodging, at No. 17, Market-street, Shadwell - I was told she was not within; it was her who answered me - I called in Miss Newcome, who knew her, and I took her; she was washing, and had this net wet in her hands; I found all this property there, except the box.</p>
               <p>MISS NEWCOME. None of the property in the indictment is found, except the net; these other things are of no value - we give them away to poor people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I once found Mr. Newcome's purse, with eighty or a hundred sovereigns in it, and took it to him - these things are of no value - they were in my box when I left her house.</p>
               <p>THE REV. THOMAS NEWCOME. I have no recollection of her bringing me a purse with any money in, but it is not impossible; but I think there could not be so much in it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About three o'clock in the morning of the 8th of July, I saw the prisoner with the prosecutor, who was very much in liquor; I went down the street, and saw the prosecutor down on his back, and the prisoner kneeling on him; I saw him take the money out of his trousers pocket, and put it into his own waistcoat pocket - I saw him do it three different times; he then got up and ran towards me - I seized him- he tried hard to get from me, but I held him, and found the money in his pocket; there were two half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences, and 1s. 8d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received a sovereign from Mr. White, which I changed; I saw the prosecutor laying tipsy in the street, and the watchman poking him about with a stick; I assisted him up - he said he lived in Wild-street - I took him there, and he said he lived in Gate-street - I took him there, and again into Wild-street - he fell down; I thought I could leave him, when the watchman stopped me; the prosecutor was also taken to the watch-house; he said in the morning that he did not know what money he had.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SULLIVAN. I had received a sovereign, and changed it at the public-house. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it usual to throw money about your floor? A. It is impossible to prevent money falling sometimes - it is usual to bring me what money is found.</p>
               <p>Q. If you or your master are not there, would it not be proper to keep it till you came? A. No; for there are three cashiers - Colson is the principal one; I cannot say whether he was in the shop. It could not belong to customers, because it was in the desk-rail, on the floor; only the cashier sits in that desk - the prisoner sweeps it out in the morning; we have had no other prosecution of this kind - the bowl was under the desk. I believe the prisoner has been there four years; he has been searched once before - he said that he found the shilling under the desk; he has returned money before. I put it there to see whether he would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. You left it there to try how many temptations his honesty would resist? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Where was the bowl of farthings? A. About three-quarters of a yard from the floor, under the desk. I counted the farthings the last thing at night, and could not have dropped them.</p>

I was awoke about half-past ten; and in about a quarter of an hour missed these things - the ring was taken off my finger, and the ear-rings from my ears. I have not found them - I thought I heard my keys in the prisoner's pocket - they had been in my purse; a snuff-box was found on him, which I think is mine - I believe it was in my bosom, but forget - my keys were found down an area.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you heard them in his pocket? A. I think so - the prisoner and another man were in the house before I fell asleep - I believe one of them threw the keys down an area.</p>

Wilson was laying her head on the table; it was fair time, and thought she was tired; I awoke her - she went out, and I heard a violent screaming in George-street. I was fetched to the watch-house - I had not observed any ear-rings in her ears. I cannot say whether she was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that he had got into the prosecutrix's company on the Ilford coach - that she was much intoxicated, and throwing her things about, and conducting herself very indecently - that she gave him the snuff-box; and as he was helping her home, she complained of being robbed, when the other man ran away.</p>

I felt, and missed my handkerchief, knife, and comb, from my coat pockets - they were immediately produced, and I was certain of them all - they are not here. I examined them, and have no doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The handkerchief is not his; if he would look at it, he would see that it is darned, and burnt.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner and two others, and watched them some time - I saw the others hustling round Mr. Randall. I went up, and asked if he had been robbed; he said Yes - I did not see them take any thing from him - the prisoner was in their company - Cowley went up, and I apprehended all three. Cowley took the hat off the prisoner's head and found a handkerchief, which the prosecutor claimed. I took the prisoner to the Compter, and in his waistcoat pocket I found the knife and comb - he said nothing about the burn and darn in the handkerchief till after he had seen it.</p>

In the course of a minute or two a gentleman passed me, and said, "I think you have lost your handkerchief;" I felt, and it was gone. Immediately after the patrol came up, and said, "I have got your handkerchief, and the person who took it." I saw him with Mansfield, in custody.</p>

            . On the 8th of June I was going down Holborn-hill with a gentleman, and saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor - Mansfield made an attempt at the bottom of the hill, but the gentleman took his handkerchief out, and used it. I then went on the opposite side of the hill, and saw them go up to the prosecutor with another person - the other two covered Mansfield while he took the handkerchief out of the pocket, and ran down the hill with it - I pursued, and took him with it in his hand; and as we were taking him to the compter I saw Peaugh, and secured him. I knew them both before.</p>

            . I was with Keys, and saw the three prisoners walking behind the prosecutor; they made several attempts - we followed them, and concealed our red waistcoats as well as we could; just opposite Aldgate church Barnett went on, then turned, and met the prosecutor; the other two were just behind - they closed altogether, and I saw them hustle Mr. Elkin; I saw Moses put his coat up, and then put something into his own breast - we both ran across the road, and Moses dropped the pocket-book, which Keys took up, and secured him: I took Barnett, and called Stop thief! after Isaacs, who was taken in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it true that Barnett did not touch the prosecutor? A. I saw him touch him - he closed upon him; my brother officer was with me, but might not see it.</p>
               <p>ALFRED BENJAMIN ELKIN. I was near Aldgate church, and had a pocket-book in my left side pocket; I did not observe any of the prisoners near me. The officers produced my book; I did not know it was taken.</p>

On the 13th of July, about half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner came and asked to look at some goods; another young man attended to him - I was present - he showed him several articles and ear-rings among them; I saw him put some along side on the counter - his hat laid by the side, near them. I saw him take his handkerchief from his hat, put it over the goods on the counter, and put them into his hat - he then put it on his head; he then went to the end of the counter, and looked out three pairs of bracelets from a lot - he put them on the counter, took off his hat, and covered them with his handkerchief, put them on his head, and put it on again - I told master, who had such confidence him he would not believe it; he called him into the back warehouse, and said, "Jacobs, you have some goods which are not booked;" I said, "Where are the bracelets you had in your hat?" he said, "What bracelets? I have none." I took his hat off, and found three pairs of bracelets and three pairs of ear-rings in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. He has dealt some time with you? A. Yes; eight years, to my knowledge; he has not bought on credit since he failed; we considered him an excellent character - master was in the back warehouse; I never quarrelled with the prisoner, and never said so - I never disagreed with him.</p>

I am shopman to the prosecutors; the prisoner came and inquired for goods; I took out two papers of bracelets - he looked at some, but did not decide; he asked if we had any thing else; I showed him some chains, rings, and ear-rings; I said, "There is a small balance on the ledger, perhaps you will settle it now;" he said he would; and while I was gone for the ledger, I believe this took place.</p>

             I am in partnership with my father. I called the prisoner into the warehouse, and said,"Jacobs, you have got some goods not booked." He made no answer, but laughed. My man said, "I want those bracelets and ear-rings" - he took off his hat, and to my astonishment, turned the bracelets and ear-rings out - he begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was his handkerchief in his hat? A I believe so; it was a blue one - It is impossible they could have stuck to the handkerchief, they were too heavy - he is a singular man altogether. We have dealt with him to a large amount.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in very broken English, made a long defence; which, as far as could be understood, went to state that he had selected these goods; and, as he usually did, put them into his hat, intending to buy them; he also put in a written paper, stating that they were in his hat without his knowledge. He received a very good character.</p>
