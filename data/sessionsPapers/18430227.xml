I was in Paternoster<lb/>row, and saw the prisoner there—as I was passing along sbe forcibly laid hold of me—I got from her, and proceeded down London-house-yard, to go to St. Paul's Churchyard—she followed me, and about half-way down the yard she again laid hold of me—I got from her—she got before me, detained me a minute or two, and I felt her hand leave my left-side trowsers pocket—I felt my pocket immediately after, and my purse, containing a sovereign and a half<lb/>soveign, was gone—immediately I felt her hand leave my pocket she drew it underneath her clothes—I charged her with taking my money—she said she had not—I laid hold of both her hands—she got one hand loose, to show me that the money was not in her pocket—I then took hold of both her hands again, and asked her to give me the money up—she said she had not got it—a man and woman then came up who seemed in concert with her, and pushed against me—the man wanted to quarrel with me—I called for a policeman, who came up—I gave her in charge—I held her hands all the time, so that she had no communication with the other parties—I looked on the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did he stop with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had lunch with me, and he went away, I suppose, about half-past twelve o'clock—I saw him again about six, or a little after, when I had done cleansing my beer—I did not make any affidavit before a Judge in this cause, nor before a Commissioner—an affidavit was brought down to me—is Mr. Bailey, the Judge's clerk, here?—I do not know what he is—I was given to understand that he was a Judge's clerk—I believe he came out of Kent—I did not make any affidavit—(<hi rend="italic">looking at an affidavit</hi>)—this is my signature, but I made an objection to this—I said I would not swear positively, but to the best of my recollection, that Mr. Myers was in my sight during the whole of those hours—I have come from a place of refreshment now, and I have dined—I have had some beer—I am very partial to beer—I have had nothing stronger—I have seven in family, if I count them all—there were four at home on the 20th of July, Elizabeth, Lavinia, Emma, and Louisa, and my sister at times—I can<lb/>not</p>

               <p>say whether she was there on the 20th or not; no, she was not at home, she was out—she is in the habit of living and sleeping at my house at times—I cannot swear whether she was staying with me on the 20th of July—if I said yes, I might he wrong; and if I said no, I might be the same situated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There are four of your daughters, are there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, three of my daughters, and my niece, as I suppose—my sister might be there in the day, but night I cannot swear for—she frequently leaves at night, and goes to a friend in High-street, Deptford—I cannot tell what time she was there—I do not keep an account of every day she is there—I cannot say whether she was there on the 20th of July—I did not have tea with Mr. Myers—my daughter made tea for him, as she represents—I did not see him have tea—I came in at five o'clock, and went out about twenty or twenty-five minutes past five—I had been to attend to what it was my duty to do as under brewer—I was in soon after six—it generally takes me about forty minutes to cleanse my beer—I found Myers in the kitchen—there was only me and my daughters at home, two daughters, besides me, and two were out—sometimes they are out for a week—they were not staying at the house then—only two daughters were at home at that time, and a niece—the others were out—there were three altogether at home, two were out—I have only three daughters—I cannot say which were at home—two were out, and my sister, she was out—two daugh<lb/>ters and my niece were at home—my sister was out, and one of my daughters, I know that—I am not quite sure, but to the best of my recollection, I can<lb/>not say positively—they are so frequently out it is impossible for me to say positively—they take a turn over the same as other people do, a <hi rend="italic">vacation</hi>, the same as you gentlemen do—only one of them is here to-day, the eldest, who supplied Mr. Myers with his tea—there was only one called for, I believe—Mr. Myers slept along with me that night, in the same bed, and it was not the first or the last time—that was the first time he slept at my house, but we have slept together in other places—it is out of my power to tell you how many times he has slept with me since, it is so frequently—since we slept to<lb/>gether we are so loving that we cannot part—he has slept with me since—I cannot tell how many times, not twenty times—I would not pretend to say how many times—I have known him about eight years—I never slept with him before that night—if I recollect right, it was a very wet night—it thun<lb/>dered and lightened <hi rend="italic">materially</hi>, and I said, "Myers, you bad better stop along with me"—if you recollect, you will find it was a tremendous night—we slept together merely for love, or fatigue, I do not know which, just what you please to put it down—I have slept with him several times since, when he has been on business at Woolwich and different places, when he has had to meet some gentlemen of the College with different materials, and he has said, "I shan't go to London to-night"—I have frequently slept with other men—I have tra<lb/>velled a good deal, but not latterly—when Mr. Myers has called at my house, and wished for a night's residence, or any of his family, it has always been found for them—I have four beds in my house—neither of them were unoccu<lb/>pied on the night in question—two of my daughters slept in one bed, another in another bed, and me and Myers in a third bed—there was no fourth bed—there were two beds on one bedstead—there were three bedsteads and four beds, two bedsteads with a bed on each, and one bedstead having two beds on it—if my room was large enough I could have had two bedsteads, but it is not—I have no lodgers—I know a Mrs. Letton—she never lodged with me—she never slept in my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you objected to swear to this affidavit at first, was it altered in consequence of your objection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I expected that Mr. Bailey, according to my wish, would have altered it—he did not—I told him I could not swear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270019"/>
               <p>to it, neither would I swear that Mr. Myers was at my house the whole of the time it specified—Mr. Bailey said, "Well, to the best of your recollec<lb/>tion and knowledge"—I said, "Will that do?"—he said, "Yes," (is he in Court? he can't deny it,) and on that condition, never seeing one before, I signed it—he said that was the way most people swore—it was a thing I never had in my handbefore, and I was never before a Magistrate before—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's affidavit being ready stated that he saw Myers between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 20th, and that he remained in his company the re<lb/>mainder of that day</hi>)—that was the part I objected to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you or not, when you signed it, understand that the alteration had been made that you required? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I expected it would be made by Mr. Bailey—I understood when I swore to it that the alteration would be made, or else I would have struck it out altogether myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give the same explanation on the for<lb/>mer trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not the opportunity, for you put me down by saying that me and Mr. Myers committed an unnatural crime, and it cut my feelings, so I did not do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am forty years of age, and am the wife of Thomas Magness. I fill the situation of upper bar-maid at the Auction Mart hotel—I was there for eleven months before this happened—it is an hotel behind the Auction-mart in Bartholomew-lane, and communicates with it—the lower part of the hotel is called the tap, and that part is under my ma<lb/>nagement—Mr. Baker is the keeper of the hotel—the prisoner was potman at the tap—he had been there five months—I noticed that his behaviour was very cross on the Sunday previous to the 12th of Dec.—he has attempted to kiss me, and I rebuked him for it—I have heard that he is twenty-one years old—he went by the name of John in the establishment—the housemaid is called Ann—on the evening of the 12th of Dec she complained, in his presence, that she and John had been locked in the cellar—I took no notice of it—it was afterwards mentioned to me that John and her had been in the bed-room together—in consequence of that, about a quarter to nine o'clock, when the prisoner came into the tap, I told him he had better be minding his work than playing—he said he had not been playing—I said it was false, he had—I said he had better be clearing his tables, that I had been clearing them all day, and he had better be clearing them himself—that was part of his duty—I told him he was in the cellar just now, referring to what I have mentioned—he said it was not his fault—he did not say he locked the door—somebody locked him in I believe—when I scolded him, he seemed very surly and sul<lb/>len—he cleared the tables, and after that he sat down on one of the tables—there were customers there, and he waited on them—the sulky or sullen ap<lb/>pearance continued—I had occasion to go past where he was sitting, and he said something to me—I did not hear what it was—I felt offended—I thought he was jeering me, and I called him a forward vagabond—later in the evening, he came to the bar for some porter, which he took out to a customer—when I spoke to him I scolded him about his work, and he said, "Go to heaven with</p>

               <p>you"—he was not long gone with the beer—I saw him come back—nothing more passed after that till Ann called him—she said, "Mrs. Baker wants you"—it was about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock—he left the tap in consequence of that and remained away till about eleven o'clock, which is the time we usually begin to prepare to shut up—it was his duty to shut up the shutters—I desired him to be called for that purpose—Sarah, another servant, called him—I did not hear him answer—he did not come—I rang for him—I did not hear him make any answer to the bell, and at half-past eleven, as he did not come, I proceeded to shut up the shutters myself—I did not fasten the door, as there was still some customers in the house—I came in again and attended to them—I returned to the bar—the customers did not stop long—they only came to the bar and had what they wanted—there are two gates outside the house—I proceeded to lock them at about a quarter to twelve—there are steps and a sort of iron railing—the whole is below the level of the street, down in a sort of area—I was fastening the right hand gate first, inside, intending to come back—I had gone up the steps to get to it—a young man, a customer, who had been in the house, seeing me come up the steps, came and asked what I was doing—I could not find the right key, and he helped me—I had never fastened the gate before—he was not on the outside—he had been having some<lb/>thing to drink—he did not go outside—another door is left open till twelve, and when he did go he went out that way—while I was fastening the right hand gate, at the top of the steps, the prisoner came half-way up the steps, as if to help me fasten the gate—I told him I did not want him—I said I had done the rest part of the work and I could do that—he said, "Go to hell with you," went down the steps, and stopped at the bottom—after I had closed the gate I came down, and the customer who had helped me came down with me—we passed the prisoner, standing at the bottom of the steps, and went into the tap, leaving him there—I served the customer with liquor—while he was drinking it I observed the prisoner come in—he said nothing—he passed through the tap and went in a direction that would take him to his bed-room, which is on the same floor as the tap, right facing it, at the left hand side of the building, about the middle of it—there is a door going out of the tap—the bed-room is not behind the bar—as you stand at the bar you can see his bed-room—it is on the other side of the building, a very little distance from the bar, just across the passage—there is the mart door about the middle of the passage, at the back of his bed-room—it was not my duty to fasten that door, it was his duty, but I went to do it—I took the key with me and a light in my hand—when I got into the passage, to fasten that door, I observed the prisoner towards the right, sitting on a pair of steps which were there—I went down the passage, in a direction from where he was sitting, leaving him behind me—as I went along I heard something behind me, and felt both his hands behind me, one on each shoulder—he did not say anything—I pushed him from me, and said, "Be quiet, sir, or I will call Mrs. Baker"—I proceeded to put the key in the door to fasten it—I was quite separated from him at that time—I heard something click, and just as I was in the act of turning the key I felt myself shot—I heard a report, as of the dis<lb/>charge of fire-arms—I heard the click as I was putting the key in the door—it was followed by the report instantly—I fell—I did not lose my senses at first, I fell on the ground immediately, it knocked me down—my falling with the candle in my hand put it out, and the place was in darkness—before I lost my senses I heard him say, "Woman, what have I done?"—after I laid there two or three minutes I got up—it was after I became insensible, immediately after he said, "Woman, what have I done?" and he fell down near me—I had said no<lb/>thing thing myself before he used that phrase, nor at any time before I lost my senses—before I became insensible, I felt something trickling in my hand—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270025"/>
               <p>was afterwards found that it was blood—upon that I became insensible for a minute or two, and then I got up—I do not recollect rising, but I found myself on my feet again—I left the prisoner on the ground, I think—I went to the tap—I believe I tried to open the door to get into the street, but could not—I forgot I had locked it—when I turned round from the door I met the prisoner—there was a gas-light there, which reflects inside, and gave me an opportunity of seeing his person—I put my hand to my side, and said, "What have you done?"—he stood firmly fixed before me, with his right arm up, with a knife in it—he said, "Now I'll finish you"—there was blood on the knife—I put my hands together, and said, "For God's sake spare me," and rushed past him, screaming "Murder"—when I left that spot I was again in darkness—I did not fall during my progress—I scrambled along the wall, and eventually succeeded in getting up to my bed-room, which is along the passage and across the yard, in the upper part of the same build<lb/>ing—the prisoner followed me—as I was going along he said, "For God's sake stop, and I will not hurt you"—I think those were the exact words, or "Come to me, and I will not hurt you"—he said it more than once—that was while I was going along the passage—it was all dark there—I got into my bed-room—he came up after me—I hid myself by the side of the bed, and heard him say, "Where is she?"—the room was in darkness—he was in the bed-room at that time—soon after that the house was alarmed, a medical man was sent for, the police came in, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

I had a bag containing half-crowns, shillings, and six<lb/>pences—I cannot say how many of each—I put the bag into a drawer in my room—I locked it, and took the key in my pocket about ten o'clock in the morning—the money was then safe—my husband asked me for the key at twelve, and soon after I found the bag and money was gone—I immediately went into the kitchen, and asked the prisoner, who was our servant, if she knew anything of it—she said she did not—next morning, Sunday, I got up, and called her as usual, and when she went down stairs I followed her, unknown to her, and watched over the kitchen stairs—I saw her take a light, and go into the yard, then return to the kitchen—I listened for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, till I heard a clink of money in the kitchen where she was—I then went down, and asked her what she was doing, what she</p>

               <p>had there—I looked into the sink, and found some papers, which I am cer<lb/>tain were what some of the money had been wrapped in—she was at the sink—I looked into the grate, and discovered a black bag, which she had taken out of the kitchen drawer—I had seen her open the drawer, and take something out, which I supposed was the bag—I afterwards found the original bag which the money had been in, in the sink—I had not left the kitchen when I found it—I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in that bag, and all the rest was in the black bag in the fire-place—that was my little girl's school bag.</p>

I am the son of Joseph Taplin, a farmer, and Natt was in our employ—in consequence of missing a lot of clover-hay, I tied some up on the 14th of Feb., in a particular mode—I have examined the clover-hay now pro<lb/>duced, and it is my father's—I can swear to it from some wooden marks which were found in it—I sent Natt to London with some mangel-wursel on the 14th of Feb.—he would have to pass the house where Dodd was—he was allowed to take half a truss of this hay for his horses, but no more—there is about a sack full produced—that is about one-third of a truss.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information, in consequence of which I watched Mr. Taplin's cart—on Tuesday, the 14th of Feb., I saw the cart come up, about six o'clock in the morning—it stopped close by the Swan, at Notting-hill—Dodd, with Natt's assistance, took a bag, or sack of corn off the cart—Dodd then took a truss of hay from the cart and took it to the stable—Natt and he had some conversation at the time—I watched the cart back again from town, about twelve o'clock, and Dodd then brought a similar sack out again, and put some more corn in front of the horses, but no more hay—I am sure the horses had none of the hay either in going or returning—I was close by—it appeared a whole truss—I have not weighed it since—it was tied up similar to a truss when I saw it in the morning—I afterwards apprehended Natt—I was in plain clothes—I told him what it was for—he said the horses had eaten all the hay, with the exception of what was in the cart—I afterwards apprehended Dodd, searched the loft, and found the truss of hay there—part of it was put in the rack—I fouud one of these marks in the rack, and two in the truss—he said the truss of hay had been there ever since he was at the place, which was above a month.</p>

               <p>I found in the manger—I took possession of all I could find—I should say there was about a large armful in the manger—I was set to watch—I found no hay at all in the cart—there was some in a sack, under the cart, when it went to town in the morning, and by the appearance of it there was about the same quantity in the sack when it returned from town—it was then in the projecting part of the front of the cart—it was a sack loosely full—Dodd would have the opportunity of knowing whether the horses eat any of the hay—he had the key of the stable at the time I went there and found the hay, and he unlocked it—Natt did not take the horses and put them in the stable, they were fed at a crib in front of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Litton—we live at No. 81, Church-street, in the hamlet of Mile-end New-town—I occupy the lower room—the landlord does not live in the house—the lodgers have separate rooms—I take in mangling. On Friday night, the 17th of Feb., I fastened down the window of my room, which looks into the back yard—there is a cellar under my room, which has an entrance into the street, and another into the yard—the lodgers have the use of it—on leaving my room I locked the door, and took the key with me, at two o'clock, and went up to the first floor to Mrs. Napper, and remained with her about an hour—I came down, and found the room door fast, as I had left it—I opened it with the key, and saw the room in great confusion, the back window and back door open—I had left it shut—I called Mrs. Napper down—when I got into the room I saw two boys run out of the cellar—Sullivan I can swear was one of them, but cannot swear to the other—they ran under the fence into the next yard, and into the pas<lb/>sage of the next house—I went to the door, and saw them run across the road—a policeman ran after them—Sullivan was afterwards brought in by a policeman—I missed the water-pipe and tap from the wash-house, which is in the cellar—I missed from my room a scarf, some halfpence, towels, shirts, and pinafores and other things—my back door opens into the wash-house—the policeman and Mrs. Napper searched the cellar under my room, from which the boys had run, and found a bag of things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an office-porter. On Friday, the 20th of Jan., about five minutes before four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the neigh<lb/>bourhood of Charing-cross, and heard a report of fire-arms—on looking round, I saw a gentleman staggering, with his left band on his left loin, pointing to the prisoner, who was about three paces behind him when I first saw him—he drew back a pace or two, put his right hand into his left breast, and drew a pistol, placed the barrel in his left hand, cocked it, and turned round to the same gentleman that I saw reeling, and was taking his aim at him—instantly the officer, Silver, sprang on him, pinioned his arms, struck him on the right arm, and in the scuffle the pistol was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in Charles-street, Hay market. I was acquainted with Mr. Edward Drummond from his infancy—I was sent for on the 20th of Jan., in the afternoon, down to Charing-cross, and found him in the private room of Mr. Drummond's banking-house—he had been wounded at that time—he said he had been shot in the back—I satisfied myself that he had been wounded, but did not examine the wound—I recommended his removal to his own house, in Grosvenor-street, as soon as convenient—Mr. Drummond ordered his carriage, and I went with him in it—Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Bransby Cooper, and myself, attended him—the ball was extracted within an hour after he was shot, by Mr. Guthrie—he died on the Wednesday morning following.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am a surgeon. On the 20th of Jan. I was called to attend Mr. Edward Drummond—I saw him at five o'clock in the evening—Miss Drummond came in a carriage to my door, and took me to the house—Mr. Bransby Cooper was there at the time—he had examined the wound before I arrived, and as I had perfect reliance on his anatomical and surgical knowledge, I did not proceed to examine it in the way he had done, but we both together examined a little further, and, on ascertaining the man<lb/>ner he was wounded, we at once turned to the spot where we thought it likely the ball would be, whether it had gone round or through his body, and there we found it almost in a moment—the wound being behind, the ball was nearly corresponding in front—it laid within half an inch, Mr. Drummond being very fat—the ball was extracted from the front, with a common lancet, not in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270051"/>
               <p>usual way—I continued to attend him down to the time of his death—the examination after death was made in a great measure under my direction—his death was occasioned by the wound—the nature of the wound was such, that I believe it utterly impossible a person could recover from—the ball had gone through the body directly, but not quite straight—it had wounded the diaphragm, which wound never heals—it always remains an open wound—in my judgment, it was certainly a mortal wound—I have never seen such a wound recover from a pistol or musket ball—a man might recover from such a wound from a spear, lance, or sword.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police. I went to the police<lb/>station, Gardner's-lane, on Friday, the 20th of Jan.—I got there about twenty minutes past four o'clock—I saw the prisoner—I had no conversation with him at that time—I had a conversation with him that afternoon—I was in charge of the station from about five till eleven—I visited the prisoner about four or five times in the course of the evening—when I first entered the cell, I gave him a caution to say nothing to me that might pass be<lb/>tween us to criminate himself, as it would he used in evidence against him—he then said either on that occasion, or a subsequent caution, for I cautioned him two or three times in the course of the evening—he said I acted very fairly towards him, that fair-play was the English character—I then asked him where he came from—he said, from Glasgow—he had been from there about three months—he remained seven days in Liverpool, then came up to London, and there remained up to that time—he said he was in business for himself as a turner, at Glasgow, and gave that business up, and was going into another line, but was prevented—I then said he had a good share of money—he said he had, that he wrought hard for it, that he generally did the work of three ordinary men, daily—I told him I had been in Glasgow three or four months before that, that I brought up a prisoner named Ellis, from there, who was charged for the Staffordshire riots—I said I forgot the name of the vessel I went over in from Liverpool, but thought it was the <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi>—he said it must have been the <hi rend="italic">Princess Royal</hi>—I then recol<lb/>lected that that roust have been the name of the vessel—I asked him if he knew a Mr. Richardson, who was superintendent of the Gorbals police—he said he did not, intimately, bat that he was accounted a more clever man than Miller, alluding to another superintendent—I asked him if that was the vessel he came over in—he said no, it was the "<hi rend="italic">Fire King</hi>"—I asked him if there was a railway from Glasgow to Edinburgh—he said there was, as well as I recol<lb/>lect—he said they were thirty or thirty-four miles asunder, and told me the fares of the different classes, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd—I think he said 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the 2nd class fare, as well as I can recollect—one thing I forgot before the Magistrate, which I will mention here—I told him, as I was going to Glas<lb/>gow, I went on shore at Greenock—I went by railway from Greenock to Glasgow, that I went through Paisley, and described the situation of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the 2nd Dragoon Guards. I was about Whitehall and the neighbourhood some days before the 20th of Jan.—I first saw the prisoner there between ten and twelve days, I should say, before this occurrence—I saw him loitering about Downing-street and the Privy Council steps, and the Home Office, backwards and forwards, loitering against the palings, standing about, and walking—sometimes he crossed the road, and went to the entrance of the Duke of Buccleugh's, in Privy-gardens, pass Sir Robert Peel's house, and come on again by the chapel at Whitehall, and return to the same place—I cannot say whether I had seen him do that more than once in one day, but I have seen him do it on two or three occasions—I asked him to enlist—I will not say three times—twice I did—he declined, and said he had no intention of enlisting or joining the army—he said he was merely waiting to see a gentleman.</p>

I have been stationed at Whitehall and Downing-street since Dec. last—I have noticed the prisoner about there since the 3rd or 4th of Jan. up to the 19th very frequently, except on Sundays—I have generally seen him near the corner of Downing-street standing on the steps of the Council-office door, or walking in Whitehall, and sometimes in Downing-street—on Wednesday, the 18th of Jan., I went on the steps, and said to him, "Some of the gentlemen inside have been speaking to me about your standing on the steps; they don't appear to like your standing here"—he said, "Tell them it is a notion I have taken"—I said, "If you are waiting for any one you had better wait on the pavement, as they don't appear to like your standing on these steps unless they know your business"—he said, "You can tell them their property is quite safe"—on the same day I spoke to him again, not on the steps, but at the corner of Downing-street—he came and asked me if I would take a glass of ale—I declined it—he then asked me if I would take gin—that I also declined, and left him for that day—I saw him again on the following day, about a quarter to five o'clock in the afternoon, at the corner of Downing-street—he then asked me if I would have something to drink now—I said, "No, thank you"—he said, "Why won't you?"—I said, "If any of our people see me I shall get into trouble"—I then parted from him, and did not see him again till I saw him at the police-station next day.</p>

I was secretary to the Glasgow Mechanics' Institution—I know the prisoner—I have known him since the spring of 1840—I have been in the habit of seeing him at the Glasgow Mechanics' Institution—he attended the lectures there in several classes—he had been in the habit of at<lb/>tending the institution several years—he attended the anatomy class on one occasion—I was in the habit of speaking to him—I knew him quite well in the spring of 1840—there was an attempt made by the persons attending to get the rules of the Institution altered—I took part in it, and the prisoner also—there were several individuals who were parties to getting up a memorial to alter the constitution, and he joined about a dozen, who took a more promi<lb/>nent part in getting up the memorial—he was one of them and I was one myself—the memorial was afterwards got up and signed—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I see my own name here and the prisoner's also—his is fifth—I partly drew it up myself, but many took part in it, eight or nine—I think he was one of them, but I am not quite sure—there was a meeting, and this is a report of the meeting—it was moved at a meeting of the parties, what we call the subsidiary classes, and the prisoner was at the meeting, if I recollect—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the memorial</hi>)—I see he moved the last resolution, which was "That the following gentlemen be appointed a committee to draw up the memorial, and, embodying the resolutions, agreed to," and he was one of the committee appointed—he seconded the resolution—I was a member of that committee—I think he attended it, but I am not quite sure—it was in the</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A hair-dresser—I live in Clyde-street—I never once thought of anything at all being wrong about him—I swear that—I did not pay particular attention to see whether there was or not—I never thought or suspected anything of the kind—I know Wilson, the baker, in Clyde-street—I am well acquainted with Mrs. Patterson—I never said to her at any time that it would be a pleasant thing to come here as a witness—I do not know how the attorney for the prosecu<lb/>tion found me out—I cannot imagine—the captain of the Anderston police came to me—I cannot say exactly when or what month it was—I do not think it is two months ago—I am sure it was before Christmas—I cannot be positive—I think it was about two months ago—it was after the death of Mr. Drummond—Christmas was before the death of Mr. Drummoad—the captain asked me if I knew anything about the prisoner—I said I knew him quite well—he said, "Perhaps you will have something to say on that, how did you know him?"—I said by lodging at Mrs. Patterson's, that I saw him there, and conversed with him, and that was the only way I knew him—I was in the habit of seeing Mrs. Patterson—on account of her husband being away I went frequently up there—I cannot say any more that the captain said to me then—at our next conversation he gave me a note, and said I was to call on Mr. Loman, a writer, in Glasgow, what is called an attorney here, who wished to see me—I cannot recollect how soon that was after the first conversation—my recollection is always clear—I dine regularly about two o'clock—I have never offered myself as a witness to anybody else—on my oath I never told Mrs. Patterson that I was desirous of coming for<lb/>ward</p>

               <p>on the part of the prisoner, or words to that effect—I never talked to Wilson, the baker, in Clyde-street, on the subject of coming for the prisoner—I never said such a thing in my life as that M'Naughten was a <hi rend="italic">daft</hi> man—I deny it—I have been to Mrs. Patterson's since he has been in custody—I only just went up to see her one night after dinner and <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> with her about him, and to hear what she had to say about it—she <hi rend="italic">described backward and forwards of it</hi>, and said she wondered that I thought he was right, for she said that I had said he was wrong at one time—I denied ever having said so—she said that I did say so—I said, "I never did, when did I say so?"—she said, "You said it one night, and that you were ready to go the Procurator Fis<lb/>cal's office with me if I liked"—I denied all that—she said I was tipsy at the time I said that—I have dined to-day at the Pitt's Head over the way—I have had no spirits—I had a tumbler of ale—I have had more than one tum<lb/>bler—I had a tumbler before dinner, and a pot of porter—all I have had to drink to-day has been a share of a pint of porter, one with the cold air taken off, and a tumbler of ale at dinner, I should say two—I swear that is all the drink I have had to-day, both before and after dinner—I told you just now I had a pint of ale between two—I mean to represent myself as being perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>not in the habit of seeing him very frequently after he went into business for him<lb/>self—after he separated from our shop I did not see him so much as formerly—I met him frequently—after he began for himself, I thought his conduct was a little more distant towards me—he was very seldom in the habit of speak<lb/>ing to me or recognising me when he met me in the street, at first he did, after-wards he became more distant towards me—I met him in several places about two years ago—I understand he went to lodge with Mrs. Patterson—I never saw him there—I heard of his leaving business—I met him frequently in the street after that—he frequently passed me without speaking—I cannot say what reason he had, I had given him no cause for that—I remember his coming to my house full two years ago, it might be two years and a month or so, I cannot say to a few days—he said he wished to speak to me by myself—I went into a room with him—he said he wished me to speak to some of the official gentlemen in the city of Glasgow, to put a stop to a persecution raised against him—he mentioned the name of Mr. Sheriff Allison in par<lb/>ticular—I asked him who were the parties that were persecuting him—he told me it was some of the gentlemen connected with the conservative parties in Glasgow, and Mr. Sheriff Allison knew all about it—I told him I was very sorry to hear his statement, and assured him there was no such persecution existing within the kingdom as far as I knew—he shook his head, and said there certainly was a system of persecution existing against him—I again wished him to banish that from his mind as quite a groundless affair, wholly without any foundation whatever—he said I knew about it likewise—I said, "Sir, I am very sorry to inform you I know nothing of the kind, I know nothing of any persecution by any individual at all," that was the express language which passed between us—seeing his mind was so much in that way I rather dropped the subject, and talked on some other subject at that time—he talked about some other subjects rationally enough—he was rational enough off that subject, on any other subject—after talking some time on other sub<lb/>jects, he desired me to use my endeavours to get him into a counting-house in town or in London—before this time he had not given me any description of his days or nights, not at the first visit—I asked him if he was perfectly away from his other business—he said he had given it up—I said it would be necessary for him before he applied for a situation in a counting-house, to go to some respectable teacher to learn a regular course of arithmetic and book-keeping, and better writing, and then I would see what could be done after that—he agreed to my proposition—we parted upon that the first time—a week or two, or a short time after that, he called on me a second time and asked me if I had made any endeavours to stop the persecution against him—I said I certainly thought that in parting the last time he had been to school, and had banished that idea altogether from his mind—he said it was useless of him to attempt any system of improvement, as he was fol<lb/>lowed constantly by spies night and day—I asked him what were those spies, could he point out to me who they were—he said it was useless for him to point them out, he saw them following him every time he turned round—I asked him what they did to him, did they speak to him?—he said they did not, but they laughed in his face frequently, when he turned round, shook their heads at him, raised their arm and shook their fist in his face likewise, and frequently those of them who had sticks would shake their sticks in his face likewise—he likewise mentioned a man who had a few, perhaps a dozen straws in his hand, and whenever he looked round he saw this individual shaking a few straws in his face—I asked him if I was going out with him, he could point out any of these spies to me—"Oh, no," said he, "if they saw you with me they would not follow me at all, it is only when I am alone they follow me"—I asked him, "What did the man do that had the straws?"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270069"/>
               <p>if he understood what he meant by the straws—he said, "It probably meant that I was to be reduced to a state of beggary by these straws"—I said to him, "Probably that man was a little out of his mind that you saw with the straw, if you really saw him"—he concluded this description for a time, by insisting on my calling on Sheriff Bell, as he knew also about the persecution—he asked me if I knew Sheriff Bell—I said I knew the gentleman by seeing him fre<lb/>quently; I never had spoken to him, but I knew him quite well—"Well," said he, "will you call on Sheriff Bell, and speak to him about it, and desire him to put a stop to it immediately?"—I asked him what he wished me to say to Sheriff Bell—he said that I knew the best way myself how to call on him, I knew better than himself what to say about it—I said I really did not know what to say about it, the thing, the system, had no existence in the world, and if such a system did exist it would be against other individuals as well as himself—I again assured him that nothing of that kind did exist against any individual, and expressed my sorrow at hearing him give such a statement—after assuring him of this, we began on another subject—he did not describe his state at all—he could not, possibly—he only always insisted that these spies were following him—I had a good deal of difficulty to divert his mind from it—we then adverted to another subject, and he again spoke rationally enough, for perhaps half an hour, on some other subject—after that we parted for the night—this was the second interview—I saw him again the third time, perhaps in three or four weeks, I cannot say to a week, about that—he asked me if I had applied to Sheriff Bell, to stop the persecution, and these spies following him—I said I had not—he asked why I did not speak to him—I said it was useless to speak to Sheriff Bell about a system which had no earthly existence—I asked if any person wrote any letters to him, or threatened him, or even dared to injure him in the least degree—he said no, they had not—I asked him if he had ever received any letters containing threatening language to him, which might be the cause of this delusion of mind—he said no, he had never received any letters to that effect—he again asked me if I knew Mr. Salmon, the procurator-fiscal in Glasgow—I said I did, I saw the gentleman every other day passing—he wished me to apply to him, if I did not think proper to apply to Mr. Bell, to stop the persecution, as he also knew about it—I said, if he could describe to me any one thing of a tangible nature, or point out any individual whatever, I would certainly call on any one of those gentlemen, if he would point out who it was that was annoying him—he said he could not point out any individual, he could not point them out—I asked him, when he looked round and saw these spies fol<lb/>lowing him, could he describe what dress they had on—frequently he said they had top-coats on, large coats, wrapped up—I asked him again if ever he saw any of them at any time, and could he recognise them—he said no—I told him my reason for asking him that was, if he could point out any individual, I would immediately find means to prevent it, if he could point out any indi<lb/>vidual that annoyed him—he said he could not identify any individual—he said that he could not rest night or day, in consequence of being annoyed by these spies—"When I come out of a morning,"he said, "they follow me, and they follow me the whole day, till I return in the evening again; they are constantly following me"—I do not recollect any thing more that passed at that time—we spoke a great deal after that on another subject, and we parted as calm as usual, as we had done on former occasions—a considerable time elapsed before I saw him again, it might be several months after—he called again at my house—I met him at one time on a country road to Glasgow—we were stopping out of town, on account of the health of one of our children—we had an hour's conversation, the same as usual, he still insisting that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270070"/>
               <p>spies were following him—perhaps this might be the fourth or fifth inter<lb/>view—the interviews on the same subject were frequent for a year and a half—he was always alone, nobody was with him—I have not seen him in com<lb/>pany with any person, I suppose for two years—he told me at that time he had used every endeavour in his power to get quit of these spies, but it was all perfectly in vain—he told me he had left the city of Glasgow to endeavour to avoid them; that he went to England to avoid them, and even to France, to escape from the persecution; that he had no sooner landed in France than he saw the spies following him there, and it was perfectly useless for him to go anywhere else; he had just returned to his native country again; he had been again attempting to evade the persecution, and he had called on me again to apply to the authorities to put a stop to them—I rather think he had called at my house in my absence, but he would find the house locked np—we were living in the country—he repeated his request to me to call on these gentlemen—I reasoned with him about the folly of entertaining ideas of that kind again, and persuaded him to banish these things from his mind—I insisted again and, again that he should put himself to school, and I would endeavour all in my power to get him a situation when he had been at school some time—after reasoning with him on the subject, I considered that it had been in a great degree effaced from his mind—on other subjects he appeared quite rational, like other people—I think I had one or two more interviews with him of the same description—he still wished me to call on the same people, and complained of the spies following him—I did not know that he left for England in September—he did not let me know of that—I saw nothing more of him until I heard that he was in custody—I think it was about the latter end of August that I saw him last—the conversation that passed between us then was just the same as usual—I had not seen any of these official gentle<lb/>men—I did not think it necessary—I thought the thing would by-and-by be banished from his mind altogether—his mind was cool and rational on every other subject.</p>

SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand that Aug. was the last time you saw your son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I recollect—I did not learn from him then that he was going to London—I did not know where he was living at that time—he did not tell me—I learned afterwards that he had lived at Mrs. Patterson's—after he left my house, and set up in business for himself I was not on terms of intimacy or friendship with him, very little—he left my house a considerable time before he began business for himself, when he was a journeyman—he did not leave in consequence of a quarrel with me—I believe the reason he left, as far as I know, was, we had been in the habit of shutting up our house two or three months in the year, and taking the younger children thirty or forty miles into the country, we found it inconve<lb/>nient to keep him in the house alone—we left the shop altogether; and after one of those occasions of coming back, the young man had been and got a lodging for himself—he did not leave in consequence of any quarrel with me—we con<lb/>tinued on terms of in timacy after he left—he still worked in my shop a consi<lb/>derable time after he left the house—I cannot say where he was living at that time—I had no quarrel with him when he set up in business for himself—he seemed a little dissatisfied in consequence of not getting a share in my small business—he asked me to give him a share, and I refused—it was in conse<lb/>quence of that that he left—at least that is my conviction, I know of no other cause—I was not on speaking terms with him, but very seldom indeed, for a long time—I frequently passed him in the street without speaking—I know, from his former habits, that he was very industrious, and a hard-working lad; and, us far as that, I thought he was prospering very well—I knew where his</p>

               <p>shop was at that time, where he was working—I do not think I was ever at the shop, at least for a number of years—I never was at his lodging—we were not on terms at that time—I think I first spoke to him five or six years after he set up for himself, as far as I recollect, when he called on me after giving up business for himself—I think that was the first occasion of our speaking together—I did not know of his giving up business until a short time after he had done so—party politics sometimes run high at Glasgow—I rather think Mr. Bell belongs to the Conservative party—when I had these conversations with my son, it was always my impression that his mind was disturbed—I did lot consult any medical man, or give information to any of the authorities of Glasgow, because at that very period trouble in my family occupied me a good deal—I had five or six of my family lying ill of scarlet fever—they were the junior branches of my family; and finding him under these rational feelings I thought it unnecessary, as I thought it would certainly get away from his mind altogether—that was my impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was your family afflicted, as you say? A. Just at the very time be first called on me—all along.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was your reason for not taking any steps? A.

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at No. 22, Centre-street, Tradestown, near Glasgow. I know the prisoner—I first became acquainted with him in 1834—the last time I saw him was in July last—when I first knew him in 1834, I was a fellow lodger with him at Mrs. Dagleish's, in Gorbal's-close, by Glasgow—we slept in the same bed till May, 1835, from about the 1st of April, 1834—during that period he used to get up frequently in the night, and walk about the room saying unconnected sentences, "by Jove," and "my God"—they were not stid in a loud tone, but loud enough for me to hear—that has occurred while he was walking in the room—they were uttered in rather a grave manner—he would occasionally be out of bed an hour, walking up and down in this way—he did not dress himself, or put anything on—he then returned to bed—this occurred from time to time during the whole period I was his fellow lodger—he appeared to be kind and mild, and of a sensitive disposition—perhaps in walking he would not allow a bird's nest to be harried—I have known that happen in my presence—I have known him carry out crumbs of bread for the purpose of feeding birds</p>

               <p>when he went out walking—he seemed particularly fond of children—he fre<lb/>quently went out to Cathcart to see children there—Cathcart is two or three miles from where we lived—I accompanied him several times at his request—Mr. Smith is the minister of Cathcart—there were two children under his care, who were in the habit of playing in the garden—it was to see those children play, that I accompanied him on several occasions—he merely knew them by seeing them there in the garden—he told me that his object in taking me to see them was to witness their innocence—when I saw him in July last, it was on the banks of the Clyde—I walked out with him a short way—I noticed on that occasion that he did not look me so fair in the face as usual—I mean when he looked up, he immediately put down his head again, if 1 looked at him—on meeting my gaze he dropped his eyes to the ground—I noticed that particularly—he was not so connected in his conversation as formerly—he did not about that time complain to me about any pain that he had—on a former occasion he complained of pain in the breast—he only did so once—he would laugh occasionally without any cause, and cry without any apparent cause, but not loud—not shedding tears, but moaning, making a noise—he never to my knowledge attended public meetings, or took part in politics—I never heard him express any extravagant political opinion—about a month before July last, I saw him in my own office—he told me he had been to the House of Commons, that he had heard O'Connell, Sir Robert Peel, and Lord John Russell speak—he said Sir Robert Peel had arrived at that which Byron had said of him, of being something in the State, and that he was a great orator, that O'Connell was a great declaimer, but Lord John Russell was inferior to either of them—he did not say anything on that occasion in the least disrespectful of Sir Robert Peel—I have told you all he said on the subject.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house at Glasgow, at one time, for about seven months—he first came in June, 1835—I had another lodger, named William M'Ock<lb/>ingdale—when the prisoner first came to lodge with me, M'Ockingdale slept in the same bed with him—M'Ockingdale complained to me that the prisoner was restless at night, and he left the lodging in less than a week, I believe for that reason—I myself slept in the same bed with the prisoner on one or two occasions—I was disturbed by him by his wrapping the whole of the</p>

               <p>clothes round him during the night, and a great motion with his arms and feet—he did not get out of bed, to my knowledge—his sleep appeared to be very sound, but he was very much disturbed while he was sleeping, kicking about with his feet, and knocking about with his arms—during the whole time he lodged with me he had no acquaintance or friend as a visitor—his manner was very strange, he scarcely spoke but when spoken to, and when he spoke, his reply was quick—he always looked down when the eye caught his, and before he asked for anything, he appeared very much confused; when he did ask, he did it very quickly, and was quite relieved when he had asked—he used to leave my house and go to his workshop, I think, about seven, and returned to breakfast about nine—he staid at breakfast for an hour, then went away, and returned at two to dinner—after dinner he went away again, and returned about seven in the evening—he very frequently went to work after that—he constantly read while having his meals in my house—we usu<lb/>ally went to bed at a little past ten—he generally remained up after we were gone to bed—I can scarcely say how late he sat up—we have heard him up till between twelve and one—I have known him to be out of bed at that time—he was always reading when he went to bed—I gave him notice to leave—I had several reasons for doing so, his strangeness of manners, his unso<lb/>ciablenesss, as well at the family fire-side, and his infidel principles—I had family worship in my house every Sunday morning, and every Sunday night—I did not have family worship exactly every day, but frequently, but he was always out of the way when we had it, only on sabbaths—he was at work on the other days—he always attended family worship on sabbaths, re<lb/>gularly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean, then, by his infidel principles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the books he was reading were infidel books—I got a lodging for him—he was very unwilling to leave my lodging—I do not know where he went to live after that—he never called on me after he left my lodging—one morning, about a month before he left, when be came in to breakfast, he appeared quite irritated and confused—he said, "Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, I have a question to ask you," speaking to me and my wife at the same time, in a very abrupt way, and angry—I said, "What is it, Mr. M'Naughten?"—he said, "Has anybody been saying anything to you against me?"—I an<lb/>swered, "No"—he said, "I have reason to suspect so"—he took his break<lb/>fast, and no more passed that morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell you what was the reason of his going? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he was going to seek a commission in the army—he told me that before he went, and after—he did not tell me anything that had happened to him in France when he returned—I aked why he did not stop in London or France when he got there—he said he could not stop there, he could have got plenty of berths, but he could not stop; he was haunted by devils—I asked him what sort of devils they were—he said they were men from Glasgow—at the time he was telling me this, he appeared to look very indifferent, not very well—he ap<lb/>peared to be very angry with me when I asked him—we at different times had conversations on the subject of his being haunted by devils—I told him I thought he was going wrong in his mind—he got angry, and said that I knew nothing about it—he repeatedly told me about his being haunted by devils, and I wished him to go out of the house, to go away, because I was afraid of him—when I expressed that wish, he said he would go away in a little time, as soon as possible—that was all he said when I mentioned for him to go and look for a situation for himself—I wanted him out of the house, and he told me he would go away as soon as possible—it was when I spoke to him about getting a situation that he spoke about the devils—he said be could get plenty of situations, but he was haunted by devils in every corner that he went into—I have many a time spoken to him with a view of inducing him to get a situation, and sometimes he gave me that answer, and sometimes not—he has very often given me that answer—on one occasion I found some pistols in his room; that was, I think, a few days before he went away, which was in Sept.—I said to him, "In the name of God, what are you doing with pistols there?"—he said he was going to shoot birds with them—I did not see the pistols after that.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew him for six months before you observed this change, during that time what had been his conduct and demeanor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I noticed his eyes going wrong at different times—he was a very quiet man—he left me in Sept. the last time—he took nothing with him but what was on his back—he told me that he was going, on the morning that he went—I do not recollect how he had been the day before, but the day he went he was very <hi rend="italic">raised-</hi> looking, excited, and wild—his eyes looked wild and <hi rend="italic">frightsome-like</hi>, like they used to be—before he went I asked him, if he was going to London, to take the trouble to go to the East India House, and inquire after the <hi rend="italic">Argyle</hi> steamer—he said he would go—he appeared to be strange-looking then—my husband is employed on board a steamer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the sheriffs of the county of Lanark, and reside at Glasgow—the prisoner very much resembles a person who called on me about nine or ten months ago—I cannot swear that he is the person—I have a strong impression that he is the same person—I cannot say that I am satisfied he is the same person, I think he is—he came to my office and stated that he was persecuted as he considered, and could get no redress—I asked him the nature of the persecution—he made a confused rambling statement in answer, the drift of which appeared to be, that he thought some persons had conceived an ill-will to him—that he considered himself, and I am not quite sure whether he said his property, in danger—I told him if he had a complaint of a criminal nature to make against any one, he should go to the Procurator Fiscal for the county, and if it was of a civil nature he should consult a man of business—he said he did not think that would do any good, and went away, apparently rather dissatisfied—about a fortnight after, the same person called again, one forenoon, and repeated some-what in the same way as formerly, that he still was subject to the persecution of which he complained—I asked if he had been to the Procurator Fiscal, or had consulted with a man of business—he either said that he had not, or that he had, and they refused to interfere—I then stated to him that if they would not interfere, if he would not take my advice of going to them, I could do nothing for him at that time—he then went away, after perhaps making one or two other observations of a somewhat confused description, which I did not pay much attention to—I think he was not very satisfied.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270079"/>
               <p>did not know what to do—I told him I believed he was mistaken, that I did not think any one followed him, or that any political party annoyed him; that if he was annoyed in any way he ought to complain to the captain of the po<lb/>lice, who would protect him—that formed the principal subject of our first interview—I think he said he thought that nothing would satisfy his persecu<lb/>tors but his life—when I doubted the truth of his suppositions, he said he was quite certain of the fact; that many persons said to him that he was mis<lb/>taken, that he was under a wrong impression, but he did not believe any thing wrong with him; he was perfectly in good health, of a sound state of mind, and that he was quite certain what he had stated was quite right—I consi<lb/>dered that what he stated to me was his positive belief—I was impressed with the firmness of his convictions, right or wrong—I at length got rid of him—about eight days afterwards he called a second time—his representations on that occasion were much the same as on the first—he spoke generally of being annoyed, in the same way as before; that he could get no change; that he could get no rest at night; and he wished very much that I would interfere on his behalf, and free him from his persecutors—I recommended him to go to the sheriff and make his complaint; and I was quite sure, if he was so annoyed, that he would be protected by the authorities of the place—my object in doing so was to satisfy him, and to get rid of him, as I was convinced he was under a delusion—I perceived that what I said did not remove it—I came to London, I think, about the end of April—a few weeks after I arrived in London I received a letter from the prisoner—I think I destroyed that letter at the time I received it—I have not got it now—the letter, I think, contained three pages of writing, full of the same complaints as he had made to me personally—to the best of my belief, it stated that he had been followed in the way he had personally represented to me—it was to the same effect that I have stated—I do not remember particularly the expressions in the letter—I read it hastily over—I saw that it was to the same purport that I state, and I immediately answered it, and destroyed the letter—this is the answer I sent to him—that was quite the result of my own conviction, from what had passed between us, and what he had written to me—I believed that at that time he was labouring under a delusion of the mind, and that there was no ground or reason whatever for his entertaining the fears which he expressed and wrote to me about.</p>

I cannot understand it at all"—he said, "Even when I retire to my bed in my lodging, I scarcely get into my bed till I see them in my bed-room"—I said it was an extraordinary thing, I could not conceive what it was or how it was; and it being eleven o'clock, on Saturday night, I said I would inquire into it, and I would know if there was anything in it—he said he would be obliged to me if I would do so, apologizing at the same time for the trouble he had given me, and asked when he should call back—I said, "Call back at any time"—he said, "When shall I call back?"—I said, "Next week"—he said, "Will you say the day?"—I said, "Very well"—he said, "Will Tuesday do?"—I said, "Very well, Tuesday"—he showed great anxiety on the subject—he was very calm when he came in, but at the time he left he was agitated from head to foot—as he spoke on he got the more agitated—his manner was such that it excited some of my family, who were in an adjoining room, who said, when he went out, "Surely that man is <hi rend="italic">daft</hi>"—he came again on the Tuesday morning, about ten o'clock—I then entered into a discussion with him, and said, "Really there must be some mistake here;" I could not understand what they had to do with him, and I asked him what he had ever done to the Catholics to cause them thus to annoy him—he said he could not tell himself, he only wished they would tell him what they wanted with him; he was quite ready to do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270082"/>
               <p>anything they wished, if they would only tell him what it was—he still per<lb/>sisted in the fact of being thus annoyed—I said, "For my part, I cannot see it; give me some reason for it; the Church of Rome is an immense body; I need not tell you its constitution, and I should like to know how an humble individual such as you are in Glasgow, can be an object for such an establish<lb/>ment to persecute in the manner they are doing"—after reasoning for some time, he said that all I had said he would not contradict; that it was a theory, but he had the facts before his eyes, which this theory could not overturn; they were facts which he saw before his eyes—seeing that I could not be con<lb/>vinced that such was the case, he then said, "But there are other parties that are annoying me"—I said, "What are they?"—he said, "Oh, I think some of your police are at the bottom of it"—I said, "That is something we shall be able to get at; let us hear something about it, that is something we shall be able to inquire into"—I then asked him what sort of appearance they had—he said, just the same sort of appearance, the same sort of individuals that he saw, and he believed it was the same sort of concern, they were all in one plot—seeing that I was rather doubtful of his communication, he pressed it with greater earnestness, and said, if I knew what he suffered, he was sure I should not take his calling on me a trouble—when I got him pleased, he went away, with my promising to inquire into it—I saw him again in the course of two days—I did not intend to inquire, because I considered it nonsense; but I said, in excuse to him, that I had forgotten to make the inquiry—he again apo<lb/>logized for the trouble he gave me, saying that no doubt my time was very much occupied, but at the same time repeating what he had done before, the great suffering he was subject to, in excuse for his troubling me—I pro<lb/>mised to speak to Miller, the superintendent of the police—he left me, and came back again in the course of two or three days—of course I never in<lb/>tended to speak to Miller—I told him I had seen Miller, that he said it was all nonsense, and I was convinced there was nothing in it—he said that Miller was a bad one, he saw it in his face, and that he was deceiving both him and me—I said that Mr. Miller had a very peculiar duty to discharge, that people might form such an opinion of him, but I believed he was telling me the truth—he then said it was hard, the way he was annoyed, and re<lb/>peated what he had said before regarding the Jesuits, that if they would only tell him what it was they wanted with him, he would do it, and still pressed his complaints—I told him if he would go away, and never mind them, I would look into it myself—I did not advise him to leave the place, but just to go away for the time, and pay no attention, as if nothing was going on, and I would try to find it out myself—I said that just to pacify him—he went away, came back again in two or three days, and complained that the people who were persecuting him, were just as bad as ever—I said, "How is that, do you see them?"—he said, "Yes, I see them"—I said, "How do you see them?"—"Oh," said he, "when I look about me"—"Look about you," I said, "why you have spoiled the plan I was adopting"—he said the appearances he saw were similar to those under the first per<lb/>secution that he spoke of by the Catholics.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say they were similar, or did he describe them in similar terms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he said they were persecuting him as before, without de<lb/>scribing them at all—I did not ask him any description of them—he said that there was no change—he said that the Tories were the party that joined with the Catholics, that he had no rest, that he could get no sleep night nor day, that his sufferings were intolerable, and that they would throw him into a consumption—I told him that he had spoiled the scheme I had laid, and seemed very much disappointed—he begged pardon, and said I had not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270083"/>
               <p>given him the proper directions to follow out the scheme, or he certainly would have done it, that he would have given anything to get his object obtained, and were it possible yet to do it, he would do as I told him—I told him that he was neither to look to the one side or the other, that he was if possible not to see them by any means; that they might not see that he ob<lb/>served them—he said he would do so—I did not see him after that for three or four months—he then came, and said that they were worse than ever—on the first interview I had told him that he should get out of the way, and get away from the place—he said that he had done so, that he had been to Bou<lb/>logne, and he said, "You have been there"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You recollect the wooden box that is on the Quay for the custom-house officers"—I said, "Yes"—he said he had scarcely got the length of the box, till he saw them, or one of them, peeping past the corner on the Quay—I said, "Did you go on to Paris?"—he said no, it was no use his going any further spending his money, when he could get no relief—he did not tell me where he had been on that occasion—he said that they were worse than ever—I then recommended him to go into the country, work and amuse himself, and divert his mind from the thing, for I thought it was nonsense—he said it was no use his going to the country, because they would follow him—I saw him many times after this—this was after he had been away three or four months—I cannot say whether he looked worse when he came back—I do not recol<lb/>lect that he did—he was always perfectly quiet when he came in, but by the time he left he always got more excited, and I saw he was worse in that respect, and more violent in his language—the last time I saw him was I think about Aug. last—he then made the same complaints to me—I had a great many interviews of the same nature—he asked my advice as to where he should go to work, and the manner in which he should leave the place to give the spies as it were the <hi rend="italic">slip</hi>—the last time I saw him this appeared to be stronger on his mind than ever, and his manner was more excited—I had a great many interviews, all of that same nature, consulting me how he could leave—I called on his father at this period, and told him what I had observed—that was I dare say two or three months before Aug.</p>

                  </hi>. M.D. I have had considerable expe<lb/>rience in the treatment of lunatics for thirty years, I have devoted myself entirely to that branch of the profession—I was called on by the friends of the prisoner to visit him after he was confined in gaol—Sir Alexander Mor<lb/>rison, and Mr. M'Clewer went with me, on the part of his friends—Dr. Bright, and Dr. Sutherland, jun. visited him at the same time on the part of the Crown—I was given to understand we were not permitted to see him except in the presence of the other two—we all in turns asked him various questions—I made notes immediately afterwards, and have those notes, but I can tell you the substance without looking at those notes—it was on the 18th of Feb.—he commenced by stating that he was persecuted by a system, by a crew at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool, London, and Boulogne—that they pursued or followed him wherever he went, that he had no peace—he said it would kill him—that it was a grinding of the mind—I asked him if he had taken any medical advice—he said physicians would be of no use—that tons of drugs could not benefit him—that in Glasgow he had observed people in the street speaking of him—they said, "That is the man," that he was considered a murderer, and the worst of characters—that everything was done to associate his name with the direst crimes—that he was tossed like a cork on the sea, that wherever he went, whether in town or country, or by the sea shore, he was perpetually watched, and followed—that at Edin<lb/>burgh he had seen a man on horseback watching him—that another person there nodded, and said, "That is he," that he applied to the authorities at Glasgow for protection and relief—that his complaints were sneered at and scouted, and Sheriff Bell might have stopped the system if he would, and if he had had a pistol he would have shot Sheriff Bell dead on the spot as he sat in the Court-house—that Mr. Salmon the Procurator Fiscal, Mr. Allison, and Sir Robert Peel might have stopped the system if they would—that on coming out of the Court-house, he saw a man scowling at him with a bundle of straw under his arm—that he knew well enough what that meant, that everything was done by signs—that he had been said to be under a delusion, and the straw imported that he should lie on straw in an asylum—that in the steam-boat, on his way from Glasgow to Liverpool, he had been watched and eyed, and examined closely by persons coming near him—that they had fol<lb/>lowed him to Boulogne on two occasions—that they would not allow him to learn French—that they wanted to murder him—that he was afraid of going out after dark for fear of assassination—that individuals were made to appear before him like those he had seen in Glasgow—he mentioned having applied to Mr. Johnstone, the member for Kilmarnock, for relief, for protection, and that he had been told by Mr. Johnstone that he was under a delusion, and he was satisfied that he was under no delusion—that he had seen paragraphs in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper with allusions pointed at him—that he had seen things in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Herald</hi>, beastly and atrocious, insinuating things un<lb/>true, and insufferable—that he had on one or two occasions found something pernicious in his food—that he had endeavoured to study anatomy in order</p>

               <p>to get peace, and could not find it—that be imagined the person at whom he fired at Charing-cross to be one of the crew—one of the system destroying his health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say "the person," do you mean that be used the expres<lb/>sion, or did you put any name to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not put a name to him—I think I called him "the person"—I cannot recollect the form of the question I put to him—I have no doubt I must have asked him who he conceived the person to be at Charing-cross—he said he was one of the system, one of the crew destroying his health—that when he saw this person, every feeling and every suffering he had endured for months and years rose up in his mind at once, and that he thought he should obtain peace by shooting him—all the medical gentlemen were present at this conversation, and beard what was said—I believe Dr. Bright and Dr. Sutherland were here yester<lb/>day—I do not know whether they were here all day—they were in Court—Dr. Sutherland is here now—I believe I am able to discriminate between a case where a man is labouring under delusion, and where a man feigns delusion—I am quite satisfied that the prisoner entertained the delusions he was giving utterance to—I have not the slightest shadow of a doubt on the subject—if I had heard nothing of his past history, nor the evidence given to-day, my examination in the prison would certainly have led me to the conclusion that he was insane—coupling that with the history of the two last years of his life, I have not the remotest doubt of his insanity—I am quite satisfied of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe, judging from all the evidence, and your own inves<lb/>tigation, and inquiry of his state of mind, that the delusion in his mind operated to the extent of depriving him of all self-control? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—it was the crowning act of his delusion—it was the climax of the whole matter, the carrying out of that precise idea which had been haunting him for years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it now an established principle in the pathology of insanity that there may exist a partial delusion sufficient to overcome a man's moral sense and self-control, and render him irresponsible for his actions, exciting a partial insanity only, although the rest of the faculties of the mind may re<lb/>main in all their ordinary state of operation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is quite recognised—the distinction between monomania and general mania is quite recognised—I apprehend that monomania can exist distinct from general mania—it can sometimes unquestionably exist to the extent of overcoming a man's self<lb/>control—I have no doubt that this partial insanity may exist, and the faculty that it affects may be impaired and destroyed, and yet the monomaniac exhibit all the appearance of sanity, in all other respects—the acutest reasoners on many points, good arithmeticians, good artists, and good architects—I have known great ability on those points, co-exist with disease in others—I have heard the evidence on the part of the prosecution as to his pecuniary transactions, and heard the letter read which answered the advertisement—that does not at all impair my conviction as to his insanity—I have known many lunatics keep accounts with great accuracy—persons affected on one point, where their intelligence is clear on others—it is quite manifest that such persons carry out their designs, with great ingenuity and contrivance; and afterwards, when they have done the act, they are very frequently alive to the consequences of it—they have shown great cunning in endeavouring to escape from the consequences—I have observed it every day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Dr. Bright or Dr. Sutherland put any questions to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They did not—I under<lb/>stood they were there for the purpose of being present at our examination, and it was intended they should not ask any questions; at the same time I believe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270086"/>
               <p>I mentioned to them both, that I should be happy to receive any suggestions—I think I have known that arrangement before in such cases—I have attended myself in this court—never when the prisoner has been examined in prison—I attended Oxford alone—nobody was with me—I never attended any prisoner here or anywhere else that I remember in presence of any other physician—I attended on the part of the Crown, but was not present when he was examined by other physicians—all the examination of the prisoner that took place was by myself, Sir Alexander Morrison, and Mr. M'Clewer—Dr. Bright, and Dr. Sutherland, were in the room the whole time while I put the questions; and on the last occasion two other physicians from Glasgow, Dr. Hutchinson and Dr. Crawford—they attended at the request of the prisoner's friends—they put questions to him; indeed they almost exclusively put questions on that occa<lb/>sion—they were only there once with us—the same gentleman attended them on behalf of the Crown—the statement I have given was in answer to ques<lb/>tions—I have not put down any of the questions—when he said the person he had fired at was one of the crew, I think the question I had asked him was if he knew who he fired at, or one of the other gentlemen asked him that—I think one of the gentlemen asked him whether he considered he had fired at Sir Robert Peel—he hesitated about that, and at length he said he was not sure whether it was Sir Robert Peel or not—I do not think I put any question to him to ascertain if he knew who the person was he had fired at; but certainly in my presence it was asked him if he knew, and it was asked him more than once—he hesitated and paused, and at last stated, to the best of my recollection, that he did not know whether it was Sir Robert Peel or not—he did not say, to the best of my memory, that he should not have fired if he had not believed it was Sir Robert Peel—I have no note of that sort—I wrote my notes when I got home—the greater part of it the same evening, and the rest the next day (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I wrote what you will find on the second sheet in the room; that is, I wrote it in pencil in the room, and copied it afterwards—that is the last examination which you have in your right hand—I am not certain whether there is any thing in that about the person fired at; there is in one of them—I think it is at the close of the first—I do not remember his saying that be should not have fired if he had not thought it was Sir Robert Peel—I do not think he said that—he said the person at whom he fired scowled at him gave a scowling look as he passed him, and all his feelings rushed into his mind at once—all he had suffered for years, and he thought it would give him peace if he shot him, and he thought him one of the system—that was in answer to questions put—I did not say, "Did you think it would give you peace of mind if you had fired at him?"—I certainly avoided all leading questions—I should have said, "Do you know at whom you fired?"—I do not think I put the question at all myself—I think it was, "Did you know at whom you were firing?" and he stated he believed it was one of the system that was destroying his health—that was not at the same time that he hesitated, and said he did not know whether it was Sir Robert Peel—he said that in reply to another question—there was a good deal of repetition—perhaps it was difficult to avoid it; and the gentle<lb/>men who came from Scotland put the same questions, not knowing what we had asked before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you are capable of distinguishing a delusion of mind by questioning the party, that you can satisfy yourself, by going into a cell where a prisoner is, whether his mind is diseased at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I can, without knowing his previous history—in a great many instances I can, by ascertaining what is passing in his mind—I might mention a fact, in connexion with what you are asking—a few months</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270087"/>
               <p>ago, in this very prison, I was called on to give an opinion respecting a prisoner who was convicted, and who was to be hung in two or three days—I saw him, with Mr. Lawrence and Mr. M'Murdo—I was to say whether I thought he was assuming insanity or not, and I came to the con<lb/>clusion, feeling my responsibility very much, that he was assuming, in which we all concurred; and, to my great satisfaction, before he was hung the man fully confessed that it was altogether assumed—I think I can ascertain whe<lb/>ther a man is really labouring under delusion, by merely questioning him, by questioning him sufficiently—there are often appearances about the body—I did not feel the prisoner's pulse, and I purposely abstained, because I all along wished he should not know I was a physician—I believe he did not know any of us were physicians—I thought there was a very wild expression about his eyes, a peculiar expression, but I do not lay much stress on that, and a dilated pupil—I do not in all instances assume, that a party is telling me truly what is passing in his own mind—I believe the prisoner was honest in his answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to gay, that you considered the prisoner insane, to be labouring under delusion, do you form that opinion from what he told you himself, of his going to France and to Glasgow to avoid persecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he gave me ample instances—I form my conclusions from that, coupled with depositions which I had seen—but I think, without those depositions, there was ample means, from my personal observation—I consider, that a person under morbid delusion is of unsound mind—if I am satisfied that any patient labours under delusion, I should certainly consider him of un<lb/>sound mind—I believe the prisoner is unquestionably of unsound mind, be<lb/>cause he was labouring under a morbid delusion respecting this persecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider insanity may exist without the morbid delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think imbecility may exist in various minor forms—I think insanity involves delusion generally—there are certainly various shades of it, and the effect it produces on the mind—I think a person may be of unsound mind, and yet be capable of conducting many affairs of life, pecuniary affairs in his own business, and yet betray some decided delusion, when my judgment would make him of unsound mind without that being detected—not per<lb/>haps all the duties of life, but many duties, especially the lighter ones—it may sometimes exist, and still a moral perception remain in the party—it is very common—there may be delusion of mind, and still a person have all his moral perceptions—a person may have a morbid delusion, and yet still know that thieving is a crime, or that murder is a crime, but his antecedent delusions lead to one particular offence or another—I consider this the crown<lb/>ing act of his delusion—it all tallies—it he had stolen a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, I should not have been able to ascertain at all, how that was connected with his ante<lb/>cedent delusion—I think that delusion of this nature carries a man quite away—I mean, that his mind was so absorbed in the contemplation of this fancied persecution, that he did not distinguish between right and wrong—I think a person may be labouring under morbid delusion, and still have the moral perception of right and wrong, in a great many respects—"monomania" is not of very modern discovery, but it has been more discussed of late years—I believe the very term "monomania" is a recent term—the fact that a person may be diseased in the mind on one point, is not a modern discovery, perhaps, but it has been more discussed and considered latterly than it used to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There are some recent theories on the subject of insanity, are there not? have you ever read the works of Monsieur Marcs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never have—I have frequently heard the terra "moral insauity"—I have heard of an in<lb/>sanity which irresistibly compels persons to commit particular crimes, and of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270088"/>
               <p>an irresistible propensity to thieve—Monsieur Marcs has written a book on the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Making a nice definition of insanity, which he calls "moral mania?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand what is intended by moral insanity, a perversion of the passions—it is sometimes called "pathomania."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that partial unsoundness of mind may exist without affecting the moral perception? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For instance, if a man fancies that he has got a pair of glass legs, and will not put them to the ground on that account, there is nothing in that which will affect the moral perception; but suppose the nature of the delusion be to excite the fierce and angry passions of human nature, is the morbid de<lb/>lusion then calculated to affect the moral perception? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—look<lb/>ing at the whole of this case, I have not the slightest doubt that the moral perception of the prisoner was affected and impaired when he did this act.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I saw the prisoner, with Dr. Monroe, in the presence of Dr. Bright and Dr. Sutherland—I have been in Court the whole of the time that the evidence has been given for the prosecution, and defence—I was present during the whole of the examination to which the prisoner was subjected in Newgate—from that examination I came to a conclusion as to the state of the prisoner's mind—from what I have heard in the Court yester<lb/>day and to-day, my conclusion is the same now as it was then—I have heard the evidence given by Dr. Monroe—I concur with him in the conclusions to to which he has come—I believe that at the time the prisoner did the act with which he is charged, he was of insane mind—in my judgment, the nature of his insanity is a morbid delusion on the subject of persecution, as has been explained by Dr. Monroe—I believe that those delusions acted on his mind so as to deprive him of the exercise of all restraint against the act to which it impelled him—I do not speak with the slightest doubt on the subject—what has passed in Court, particularly the evidence adduced on the part of the defence, has confirmed my original impressions—I have had nearly half a century's experience in the treatment of persons labouring under different descriptions of insanity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and practise in London; I have been practising as a medical man for thirty years; I live in Harley-street. I accompanied Dr. Monroe and Sir Alexander Morrison to Newgate on four occasions, and was present at part of the examination of the prisoner, which has been detailed—I am decidedly of opinion that the impressions stated to exist in his mind were really felt by him—I have not the slightest doubt of it—I consider that he is labouring under delusions—I have heard the evidence which has been given to-day—looking at the whole history of the case, I am of opinion that the act committed at Charing-cross flowed from those delusions, that it was within the province of his hallucination—from the whole history of the case, and from my examination of him, I consi<lb/>der that in the commission of the act, he was not under the ordinary restraint by which persons in general are bound in their conduct; his moral liberty was destroyed.</p>

                  </hi>., M.D. I am physician to the Royal Lunatic Asylum at Glasgow—I have been connected with the institution, first as superintendent, then as assistant physician, then as physician four years—during that time I have seen above a thousand lunatics, and treated them—I visited the prisoner on Thursday last, in the prison, in conjunction with the other medical gentlemen—I examined him by means of questions put to him—I found that he was labouring under morbid delusion of the mind—I was perfectly satisfied that those delusions were really felt by him—in my opinion those delusions were quite sufficient to account for the act with which he now stands charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Connecting that act with those delusions, are you of opinion that at the time the man committed the act, he was capable of exercising self-control, and of resisting the impulse to which he yielded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was perfectly incapable of exercising control in any matter connected with the delusion—I am de<lb/>cidedly of opinion that the act flowed immediately out of that delusion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to say that these delusions prevented him from having any control over himself; what did you mean to represent by your answer to my friend? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That any act which flowed from his delusions was an irresistible one—the impulse was so strong that nothing short of a physical impossibility, would prevent him from performing any act which his delusion might impel him to do—the act which I understand to be referred to here, is what occurred at Charing-cross—I heard that these delusions had been formed in his mind for some time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean then by saying that he could not restrain any act that flowed from the delusion, do you mean that he would have gone out into the street at Glasgow, and shot anybody that he met? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have occurred at Glasgow, the same as in London, had the disease reached the same point—I think the whole history of the case as given in evidence to-day shows that the disease had gradually increased—from what I have heard to-day I suppose that he was insane at Glasgow eighteen months ago—I take it from the time of his calling on the Commissioner of police—I think he was insane at that time—I do not think that he would at that time have been capable of resisting any impulse that flowed from his delusion—speaking in connexion with this delusion, had the same morbid notion struck him then, of doing a certain act, he would have been impelled to do it—I think that eighteen months ago he was incapable of resisting any impulse that flowed from his delusion, and as far as the evidence shows, I think that has con<lb/>tinued up to this time—I knew that he had shot a man at the time I saw him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270090"/>
               <p>—if I had heard nothing more than the evidence of Mr. Wilson to-day, I should have had no hesitation in certifying that he was a dangerous lunatic—I consider him to have been so for the last eighteen months, from the date that he went to Mr. Wilson, and from that time to the present—I have heard nothing to-day to make me think otherwise—I think that it arose from a morbid delusion on his mind, that persons were persecuting him—that is a symptom of insanity which we see frequently.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Guy's Hospital—I never saw the prisoner before yesterday—I have been in Court during the whole trial—from the facts which have been deposed to, I should refer the actions and declara<lb/>tions of the prisoner which have been stated, to a state of delusion which I think exempts him from responsibility—I am unquestionably of opinion from what I have heard stated, that the fatal act with which he is charged, was the result of the delusion under which he has been so long labouring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think a person labouring under a delusion of this kind, and acting as the prisoner did at Charing-cross, would be under the ordinary control by which persons in general are restrained from the commission of crime? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think him in that particular point to have lost the control of his mind.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270091"/>
               <p>that principle to be recognised entirely by the profession, both medical and legal—what I mean is that if the delusion impels him to any particular act, the commission of that act is placed beyond his moral control—it is possible that a person may be under a morbid delusion that by the death of another he shall obtain a large estate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you suppose if that person killed the other, that it would necessarily show it was beyond his control? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think a case of that kind, where another motive could be ascertained to have existed, would require more clear investi<lb/>gation; but here such a motive appears to be entirely absent—in this case my judgment is formed very mainly indeed on the absence of a motive, but not entirely—if I was aware of the existence of any other motive I should then receive the evidence with more suspicion, and it would certainly affect my judgment as to the want of control.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I watched a house, No. 3, Allington-street, Pimlico—about one o'clock in the day I saw the prisoner come out of that house—I followed him to the shop of Mrs. Emmet, on Holborn-hill, a jeweller and silversmith—I looked through the window outside, and saw him produce a parcel, apparently containing spoons—I went into the shop—I said nothing, but stood behind him—I saw him point to the back of the spoons he held in his hand, and heard him say, "'J. J. A.,' as you did the last"—he left the spoons there with the shopman, and went out—I followed and stopped him, I said, "Whose spoons are those you have left in that shop?"—he said, "Mine"—I desired him to go back to the shop with me—he did so—I was in plain clothes—I told him I was a policeman, and suspected the spoons had been stolen from the Junior United Service Club—he said, "When?"—I said, "I cannot answer that question"—I said, "I believe you were there yesterday"—he said, "I was, and am a member of that club; I have had the spoons in my possession four years, and have taken the initials out to have my own put on"—I went back to the shop, and obtained the four spoons, which I produce—I took him to the station, searched him, and found two keys and a card-case, and went</p>

In consequence of infor<lb/>mation, I directed Goff to watch this house—on Wednesday, the 15th of Feb., I saw the prisoner at the station—I asked him his name and address—he said his name was Ashley, and he lived at No. 11, Stock bridge-terrace, Pimlico—I had seen him come out of a house in Allington-street, about 100 yards from there—he said, "This is a mistake; I received the spoons from Mr. Rawnson, a tailor, living at No. 11, Stockbridge-terrace, about three weeks ago"—I said, "Am I to understand you reside there now?"—he said, "Yes"—I went with Goff to No. 3, Allington-street, and saw the things found, and found the fork myself—it appears to have been filed—I found three files in the chest of drawers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, after giving him notice to leave your service, take him into your service again, and yourself retain out of his wages the amount of his defalcations from week to week? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> think I lent him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told him to deduct so much out of his salary, to charge a lesser sum instead of a larger sum—I think at the end of the previous year there was a small balance, and he had a little more money given to him to set him right, and it was to meet that, according to my recollection, that the diminution of his salary was to take place; and I have done the same thing with the prisoner—I did not, after giving French notice to quit, take him on again, and make an ar<lb/>rangement with him that his deficiencies should be deducted out of his salary, week by week—there was a deduction made from his wages, not for a mal<lb/>appropriation—I think there was a balance in my favour, and to meet that balance, he was to charge a smaller salary—the disbursements did not equal the sum in his hands—it frequently happens that a person keeping books loses money, by omitting to put all the entries down—I know a person named Thomas David Lloyd.</p>

On the 11th of Feb., about five o'clock, Bourne came to my surgery—his face was covered with blood—I found two wounds on the left cheek, the lower one immediately over the cheek-bone, from three-quarters to an inch long, nearly an inch deep, proceeding down to<lb/>wards the mouth—it was a clean cut wound—the other was immediately under the eye, about an inch from the other—the lower one soon got well—the upper one was contused and ragged, and evidently produced by a blunter in<lb/>strument than the other—it could not be from the finger-nails—there was no danger from either, but considerable inflammation round the eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and live in Queen-street, Cheapside. I have been to the house the prisoner was in possession of, and endeavoured to get possession—I first went the day after we had paid for the houses, or the next day, and was much surprised to find her in the house, as I under<lb/>stood from the vendor that she had left, as the attorney gave me a new key to the house—I opened the door, and found her there—she said she could not get a place to go to, and begged I would allow her to stop a little longer—I said, under the circumstances, she having a family, she might stop a week, if she would promise to go out that day week—she said, "Certainly, I will"—at the end of the week I found her still there—she begged for another week, and at the end of that week she was still there—I said it was very wrong, I must really put her out into the street—she said I dare not do that, the house was hers yet as much as Mr. Passenger's, and she should not go out at all—I did not propose any terms for rent—on the 3rd of Feb. I went to take posses<lb/>sion—she had come to me a week or two before my calling on her, and said she should not go—I said if she did not I should certainly come and put her goods and family into the street, it was a great pity she had been so advised and did not go—I went on the 3rd of Feb.—she was not at home—I went in with two or three men, one man at first, and saw her eldest daughter—while there she came in, she went into a violent passion, and said what right had I there—I said I had come to put her out, and put her out I should—she said she would murder me, if she was hung for it—she took a knife out, and came towards me, but her daughter prevented her doing anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bosher's-court, Oxford-street—my father keeps a china and glass shop. On the evening of the 28th of Feb., I was in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner and two others at Mr. Davies's shop, which is nineteen doors from my father's—the prisoner had hold of a pair of trowsers, which were on a rail inside the door, he pulled them down from the end of the rail outside the door—he saw me, and they all walked away towards Ann-street—I crossed over the road, and watched them—they came opposite Mr. Davies's shop again—one of the men not in custody then had the trowsers, putting them under his coat—I did not see them taken—they had just come away from the door—the prisoner was with the man at the time—they went as far as Ann-street, crossed over the road, down Charles-street, all three together, and there the other one handed them to the pri<lb/>soner, who folded them up, and carried them in his hand—they went round the right hand of Soho-square, down Carlisle-street, into Deane-street—the prisoner went down Ann's-court, and the other two lost him—one of them called out "Boo"—he came back, and they all three went through St. Ann's-court together—I followed them, and when they got into Wardour-street, the prisoner went into a pawnbroker's—the other two stood outside, on the curb—the prisoner came out of the shop in five or ten minutes, and they all went into a public-house—I afterwards saw a policeman, told him, and afterwards saw them in Wardour-street, pointed them out to the policeman, and he took the prisoner into custody—the other two ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher in the employ of Mr. Cramp, of High-street, next door to Mr. Pattrick—on Tuesday evening, the 24th of Jan., I saw two casks at Mr. Pattrick's door—I saw a truck—I did not see it brought up to the curb-stone—I saw it when it was there—I saw two men endea<lb/>vouring to get the cask of lead into the truck—they could not, it appeared too</p>

               <p>heavy—I saw them try a second time—I then went up to them and said, "Do you want a lift?"—neither answered—we were in the act of lifting it on, and the hat of the man at the handle of the truck fell off and went in the kennel—he took it up and put it on his head—he never shook the wet or dirt off—he was anxious to get the lead on—we at last succeeded in getting the lead into the truck, and very unkind they were, they never spoke afterwards—I noticed the person whose hat fell off—the prisoner is the man—he had the handle of the truck—to the best of my belief he is the person—he was under my observation some time, and there was plenty of light—we have two very large lights burning—they drew the truck away, one at the handle, and the other pushing behind.</p>

I live at No. 5, Forston-street, Ashley-terrace, City-road—my brother was a coal-merchant, but is now on his way to the West Indies—he sailed this day fortnight—I manage his affairs—the prisoner was a customer of his—he owed my brother for a ton and a-half of coals—I remem<lb/>ber his calling to pay that account perfectly well, on the 24th of Jan., about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening—the account was two guineas—he paid it—he stopped, I should say, about an hour, or perhaps rather better—I entered the payment among my accounts in the ledger, which I have here—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—this is the entry.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Lamb, in March, 1842, a ton of coals, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," was posted on the 4th or 5th of March—at the time of posting the index, Lone's account was omitted, and that accounts for the long credit given for the coals, nearly thirteen months.</p>

On Saturday, the 25th of Feb., between eight and nine o'clock, I was going up stairs, and observed a man in the second floor front room, standing up in an arm-chair—the room-door was open, and the room was in a state of disorder—I saw some clothes scattered up at the further end of the room, by the wardrobe—the man was standing on the chair round the corner of the room—thinking it was the boy that used to clean our knives and go errands, I said, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, what a fool you are to frighten me"—he turned round, and said, "It is only me, ma'am, it is only me, ma'am"—I turned round and held a candle-shade up, which I had in my hand, and saw it was the prisoner—he rushed by me—I followed him down to the drawing-room, calling out, "Master! thieves!"—he made a kind of stop—I went to catch hold of him—he struck at me with his fist, and rushed down to the passage-door—I went to catch hold of him again—he kicked me, and rushed out of the house—I opened the door, and rushed out—my master came directly, but he was out of the house before my master could open the door—he was brought back by a constable in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I am sure he is the person that was in the room—I could see his features by the light I had—our street-door is kept open till between eight and nine o'clock, we then close it—there is a passage-door a little further in, that is the door the prisoner ran out at—it was shut about a quarter of an hour before, when I took some coals into the parlour, for the parlour-door is close to it, and I should have seen if it had been open—I can swear it was shut—it shuts with a latch-lock, which catches—I had not been in the bed-room since five—it was then in order, and every thing in its place—there were no clothes on the floor, they were in a drawer against the window—these clothes now produced are my master's and mistress's—this gown, pair of trowsers, and stays, were in the arm-chair at five, where I saw the prisoner standing.</p>

                  </hi>. I was coachman to John Long, Esq., of Maxwell Hall, near Winchester. On the 2nd of March I came to town by the Southampton Railway—on leaving the railway, the prisoner came up and spoke to me—I cannot say that I had ever seen him before, but I think I had—he said he had come half-way by the railway—we went into a public-house, and had a pint of half-and-half before we came to Waterloo-bridge—I was going to Pall<lb/>mall, and he walked with me, as I did not know the nearest way—before we came to Waterloo-bridge, another person joined him—we went to some other public-houses, and at last to the Swan, in Hungerford-market—we got there about three o'clock, and went into the parlour—I then put my hand into my purse, and took out a sovereign, to get it changed, to bind a bet with the pri<lb/>soner—I put it on the table—he pulled out two imitations of sovereigns from his pocket—I saw them in his hand, and one of them is here now—the pri<lb/>soner had proposed tossing for grog—he and the other man tossed for three glasses of grog—they had a sixpenny-worth of rum and water each, and I had sixpenny-worth of gin and water—the prisoner paid for it—he offered me several bets—at the last bet he said be would take three crowns to one that I should lose the toss—I said, "Done," pulled out my sovereign, and placed it on the table—he said he would cover my sovereign to bind the bet—he placed down an imitation of a sovereign, and took my good sovereign up—I detected him doing it, and said he had changed the sovereign, for my sovereign had no George and dragon—he directly opened his hand, and said, "Well, then, take this," offering me another sort of sovereign—I, thinking it was a good one, took it up—the other man and the prisoner then placed the money in a hat—as the other said he would make the same bet as I was mak<lb/>ing, the other man pulled out what appeared to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and placed it in his own hat—the prisoner placed an imitation sovereign in the hat, on one side, and a note on the other—I went to place the sovereign which he had given me in the hat—I will not swear whether it went out of my hand or not, but I immediately picked it out, on observing the other piece of coin and the note in the hat—I took them out, went to look at the number of the note, and they snatched it out of my hand—I immediately ran out, and asked Dawson if it was a good sovereign—he said not—I held the prisoner, who scuffled with me, and he was detained in custody—I found myself in possession of a bad sovereign for a good one, which I had when I went there—the other man got away.</p>

I paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the pri<lb/>soner, for the purpose of delaying my husband's departure—I paid him ten sovereigns on the 3rd of Dec, which I had received from my brother at Bir<lb/>mingham—I paid that to the prisoner to take to the office of Captain Murray, and it was to be returned in the event of its not serving for my husband's dis<lb/>charge—the prisoner did not tell me whether it would be sufficient for that purpose—I parted with it on the understanding that if it was not sufficient it was to be returned—I gave it to the prisoner in a public-house in Bateman's-buildings (I think it is the Mitre), and required him to bring me a receipt for it—he afterwards brought this receipt to me in the public-house, and told me he had paid the money to Captain Murray.</p>

I am staying at Fromont-lodge, Friern, Barnet, in care of the premises belonging to Sir William Johnson—I had occasion to go into the brewhouse about five o'clock in the afternoon, on the 11th of Feb.—I saw the prisoner on the top of the brewhouse, cutting the lead with some instru<lb/>ment which I cannot properly describe—I saw him distinctly from an opening in the tiles—I then went out at the back door, he went on the other side and leaped down into the stable-yard—I followed round after him, and found him in the stable—I asked him about a pheasant—he said he had not seen it—I then took him round, and accused him of this lead, and he begged my pardon twice—a part of the lead, about 3lbs., was removed, and some was gone—the prisoner was employed on the premises as a weekly servant—he had no business in the brewhouse; but he made an excuse afterwards that he got up to clean down the water-spout—I said that was not the truth, for his tools were all put fast for the night—I had never desired him to clean it—the lead remains partly cut now.</p>

I received infor<lb/>mation, and missed a bag and some hessian—this is the bag and the hessian—the mark is on it—it comes to us in this state—this is a foreign bag, and this is mine also—I found the bag and hessian about four o'clock the same afternoon, in the officer's hands—if it had been taken from my place between one and two o'clock, it could not have been taken without Burke's know<lb/>ledge, if he had done his duty—they were in the same part of my shop, but were separate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Benjamin Smith and Son. On Friday, the 3rd of Feb., I went to dinner at a little past one o'clock, which is the time the men leave the warehouse for dinner—I then left eighteen sacks of canary-seed safe—I returned at a quarter past two—I directly saw some of the canary-seed was gone, I missed twelve sacks of it, and found twelve empty sacks there—the shoot goes out into Trigg-lane, and I found some marks of the seed in Trigg-lane, under the bottom of the shoot, where a small quantity of the seed had been spilt, and laid on the stones—there is a crane attached to the premises—a person could climb up that crane, and get in or out of the warehouse, and get to the loop-hole very easily—the loop-hole is large enough for a man to get in—I know Castle—he had no business at my masters that day, and had no right to be near this hopper—he had worked at Mr. Rathbone's, who is the proprietor of the wharf, but not at my master's.</p>

In consequence of what Mr. Hurcomb told me I took the horse and cart on Friday, the 3rd of Feb., to Trigg-lane—I got there about one o'clock—I waited a few minutes, and the prisoner Morris beckoned me—when I got up to him he told me to back under the shoot of Mr. Smith, in Trigg-lane—when I got under the shoot I saw some sacks thrown into the cart from somewhere above—they were then filled with canary-seed—Morris ordered me to load, and he assisted me—there were twelve sacks, and when they were filled, he told me to go towards Smithfield—I did so—some one came to me in Cheapside, and went with me—I saw Morris afterwards at the Horse and Groom yard in St John-street—I got there about three o'clock—I saw Clements there—I told Clements I must take the hoops off my cart, as I could not get under the gateway without—I do not remember that he said anything to that, but he told me to put the sacks into the stable, and I put them there.</p>

He had some goods placed outside his shop on the 9th of Feb.—I saw the two prisoners come to the shop—they looked at some silk handkerchiefs, and after looking at them some time, they went and looked at some cotton ones which were close by on the left—they then commenced turning up the silk ones—Hill pulled one of the pieces off the shutter, and it fell down on the ground—I saw her take it in her hand, and challenged her with doing it—she said she was very sorry she did not wish to injure the goods—she then bought a cotton handkerchief, and both went in together to pay for it—when they came out she said she had been in and bought one and paid for it—a person then came up and asked the price of some flannel which I told them—I then turned round and saw Reid with a quantity of silk handkerchiefs in her pos<lb/>session—I ran and took them from her hand—she had got about two yards from the shop with them—they were under her cloak—these are them—she was walking off with them—I caught them before they dropped from her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Turkey-street, Enfield. On the 4th of Feb. I was removing goods from one house to the Dairy Arms, in Turkey-street—I employed the prisoner to assist me—I stood a pot or two of porter, as he did not charge me any money—Taylor and Ellis were there—I was busy getting my things away, because I was stinted to time—the pri<lb/>soner's wife had some beer—I had received from Joseph Jessop, of Waltham Abbey, a cheque for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had five sovereigns and a half—I took the box out of my pocket, and put it into my apron when I got to my new house, but I found I had a sixpence, and did not open the box—the prisoner took it out of my lap to look at—I said, "Take care of that box, it is a favourite box of mine"—I never saw it again—Mrs. Taylor was gone for a pot of porter—the box was worth about half-a-crown.</p>

               <p>Johns who lodged there, but at that time he did not know his name—I left them there, and communicated with Mr. Swift, jun., and between four and five in the afternoon he accompanied me to this same place—we went into the same shed—we found the wooden box containing the tin box, and the tin plates—Mr. Swift, jun., examined the plates, and pointed out the marks to me—he identified them—I placed them in the same situation, and again left them—on Tuesday evening, the 31st of Jan., for some reason of my own, I went again, Wardrop was then in custody on another charge—I then ex<lb/>amined it with Mr. Swift—I found the wooden box containing the tin box that had been full was then empty, and no tin plates, but there were a few tin rivets and some solder, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in half-crowns, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, which I had seen previous to that, in the box—there were no half-crowns before—this is the tin box—on the 31st, Wardrop was taken into custody with twenty tin plates round his person, slung by a handkerchief attached to a loop—they were curved as they are now—in this state they travel more readily round the body—he said he lodged in Radnor-street, St. Luke's—I showed him the boxes, and asked whose they were—he said, "They are mine"—I then pointed to the tin box, and asked whose that was—he said, "Mine"—it was opened, and I said, "The tin plates are gone"—he paused for a moment, and said, "Yes"—I then said, "What is this?" pointing to a little parcel which I found wrapped up as it is now—he said, "Money"—I asked how much—he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I again said, "The tin plates are removed"—he said, "Yes, but I did not remove them"—the tin plates I saw on the 28th were much larger than those I produce—I took him away, and as I was going, I said, "That money was not there a day or two ago"—he said, "No, I put it there last night"—I took him to the station—he wished to see Mr. Swift the elder, who was in company with me—he begged he would not transport him, and he would tell him where the tin plates had been removed to—Mr. Swift said, on no consideration would he hold him out any promise in the present state of the case—Wardrop then said they were taken to a place in Brick-lane, Spitalfields; that the did not know the party, or the number, but if he was allowed he would point us out the house—in consequence of that offer, I and Mr. Swift went—Wardrop said he stood on the opposite side, and saw the person go in with the tin plates, and come out without them—he said they were removed by him and another party from No. 44, Radnor-street—I went with him and the two Mr. Swifts to Brick-lane; a house belonging to two men named Jarman was pointed out to me—I afterwards took them, because I found six large tin plates identified by Mr. Swift in their possession—I be<lb/>lieve I had seen those same tin plates in the box a day or two previous—Jarmans occupied the whole of the house, and are tin plate workers—on Wardrop's crossing Shoreditch, he called Mr. Swift again, and begged to say he would tell him all, if he would not transport him—before I found the plates in Jarman's house, I put some questions to Jarmau as to their hav<lb/>ing any plates there—he denied having any, or having purchased any lately—there were a number of plates there—I said I wanted the tin that was brought in last night—I took the plates and produced them before the Magis<lb/>trate—I had some considerable conversation with Jarman—I was ordered by the Magistrate to give the plates up—I gave them up on the last examination—they are not here to-day—on the 1st of Feb., between one and two o'clock in the morning, I went with Mr. Swift, his son, and another constable, to a private house in Shepherdess-walk, City-road—I knocked at the door, which Fay opened—he was pointed out to me by Mr. Swift, jun.—I said, "I be<lb/>long to the police, you must consider yourself in custody for some plates</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Johns' apprentice, and live with him in Radnor-street. I know Wardrop—he lived there, and I know Fay by sight—I have seen him several times at my master's house—he came for Wardrop—the last time I saw him was Monday evening, the 30th of Jan.—I saw both prisoners together in the water-closet, by the side of the shed, about half-past eight that evening—I saw them go into the yard with a lighted candle—they staid in the yard ten minutes—they went into the water-closet—Wardrop came out, and brought the light with him from the water-closet, and went into the shed—when he got into the shed, he uncovered the wooden box, took out the tin box, unlocked it, took out the tin plates that were in that box, and then took out the tin plates that were in the wooden box that the tin box stood upon—after locking the tin box, he placed it back again, and covered it up as it was before, with the lid of the wooden box and a carpet—he brought the tin plates across the yard to Fay, who was waiting in the water-closet to receive them—when he took them to the water-closet, I heard Wardrop say, "Don't make such a noise, Bill, counting them"—I heard them rattle as though they were counting them; shortly after Fay came out of the water-closet with the tin plates—Wardrop went up stairs with the light, and Fay went along the passage into the street, down Radnor-street, towards Bath-street, in a direction that would lead to Brick-lane—Wardrop came down stairs again, and followed after Fay—they joined company, and went away in the direction leading to Brick-lane.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say they joined company—did you keep them in your eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was standing on the pavement—the first time I saw Fay was about a month before the 30th of Jan.—I do not think I had ever seen him previous to that month—I have seen him two or three times when he came to Mr. Johns to see Wardrop—I did not open the door to him—I have been in the passage and at the shop-door when he has come to ask for Wardrop—I do not remember hearing him ask for Wardrop until the 30th of Jan.—I was in the shop that evening at the time I first heard Fay come to the door—I could not see the yard or water-closet from the shop—I went to the back parlour, and will swear I could see into the water-closet—the door is nearly opposite to the parlour window—at one time the door of the water-closet was open, at another time partly open, at another time quite shut—I could not see the whole of the interior of the water-closet—it was quite a dark night—the door was open when the prisoners went in—I saw no one else there—I had helped to clean the parlour windows a month before—the direction leading to Brick-lane is a general thoroughfare to the eastern part of London—Fay had a black hat on, and a short fustian jacket of a lightish colour, his trowsers were of a darker colour—the parlour window is three yards and a half from the water-closet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Richard Swift—he is in part<lb/>nership in the tin plate business with Alfred Fowler, in St. John-street—Mr. Johns gave us information, in consequence of which I went with Brannan, on the 28th of Jan., to 44, Radnor-street—I found in the shed in the yard a wooden box, the tin box, and the plates underneath—the plates belonged to my father and Mr. Fowler—I identified them, and pointed out some marks on them to the officer, and told him they had passed through a roller; the effect of that would be to curve them, and they would be convenient to make articles, and to fit the body, if any one took them away—they appeared to have been straightened before they were put there—I can state, on my oath, that they were the property of my father and Mr. Fowler—there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money in the tin box—I opened it, though it was locked—the platet in that box were my father's and his partner's—I saw it again on the 31st—there were then 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in half-crowns in it, and a piece of solder—I went with the officer to a house in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, kept by Jarman and Son, who are tin-plate workers (we supply tin-plate workers largely) I went into Jar<lb/>mans', followed by an officer—some questions were put to them about the tins, and they denied having purchased any—some plates were found, and my father pointed out six plates on their bench in the workshop as his—I am sure they were my father's and his partner's; and they were the same I had seen before in the box—I should say that on the 28th there were one hun<lb/>dred and fifty plates belonging to my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Plough-court, Fetter-lane. About one o'clock, on the 10th of Feb., the prisoner came to me, and I went out with her—I had four half-crowns, four shillings, and a handkerchief—she said she was badly off, and almost starved, and begged me to give her something to drink, which I did—when I came out she and I stood in the street together, and when I came home she followed me home, and asked for something to eat—I went up stairs, got her some tea and meat—she staid till four o'clock—I said I was going on an errand—I locked the door, and came down—she came down, and walked with me, and in going home she asked me to lend her some money—I said I could not, but I would give her some more to drink—I did so—after I parted with her, at the corner of the court, I went home, and went to sleep—at half-past eight o'clock next morning I had not a farthing to go to market with—I know I had the money when I went in-doors—I went and asked her for my money—she said she had not had it, or seen me since half-past eight.</p>

On the 10th of Feb. he was sent with my cart and horse with some fat to Elborough's, a tallow<lb/>melter, in South Audley-street—he had no authority to dispose of it to any one else—I saw him start between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

About ten minutes to five o'clock on the evening of the 10th of Feb., I saw Stevens coming up Piccadilly with Mr. Jeffery's cart, alone—he turned round Park-lane, then stopped the horse, and took Watson up into the cart—Watson had an empty bag—Stevens then drove up Park-lane, turned down Hertford-street, and stopped about four minutes—they then took some fat out of the cart, and put it into Watson's bag, and went a little way, then Watson got out, and Stevens handed him a bag of fat on the shafts of the cart, and Watson came down towards Hertford-street—I followed, and gave him in charge of a policeman—I went with him to the station—I then came with a, policeman down to Mr. Jeffery's, and took Stevens.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Fox-street, Limehouse, and deal in potatoes. Linge was in my service to sell potatoes, but was never to sell on credit without my special consent—I had missed potatoes for a long time—I ap<lb/>pointed Sarah Tabraham to watch on the morning of the 9th of Feb., and I also went to my neighbour's house opposite to watch—while there I saw Donovan go to the shop—she and Linge went to the potato-bin—she took hold of one end of her apron which she had on her person, and Linge took hold of the other end of it, and though the scales were immediately before them, and it was Linge's duty to weigh them, they put them into her apron without—when she got as far as the curb-stone immediately opposite my shop I stopped her, and taxed her with stealing them, in the presence of Linge—Donovan said she had not stolen them—I asked what quantity she had got—she said she did not know, but she had given him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked Linge what quantity he had sold her—he said twopenny worth—I sent for a policeman,</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the case-wine warehouse, No. 4, London Docks. I was occupying a box on the floor, No. 10, which is the second floor of the warehouse—there is an entrance into the warehouse by a staircase—between that staircase and the box which I occupy there is a pile of spirits, which prevents my seeing any persons passing up the staircase—there is a staircase leading to No. 11, and a person on that staircase could see a person on the staircase leading to No. 9—there is a trap-door through No. 10, from which goods are let down to No. 9, and from that out of a loop-hole—on the 7th of Feb., between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came to me at my warehouse—he handed me orders for five cases of wine—they were such orders as authorised me to deliver them to him—the smallest of those cases contained-three dozen, and the largest six dozen—I had known the prisoner many years—he was in the habit of coming with orders, and he knew the mode of business—the proper way of delivering those cases was down the trap-door, and through, the loop-hole—when he delivered the orders to me, I told him to make haste down, he should have them directly—one of those cases was in No. 10, and four were in the upper floor—in order to get out of No. 10, the prisoner had to go round those cases of brandy which were piled up—Watkins was at that time going up the stairs of No. 11 floor—he called out to me, and in consequence of that, I sent Smith round—the prisoner, in going out, would have to pass the cases of brandy, and the case now in question was one that was in that pilr—Watkind went after the prisoner—Smith went after him, and I followef—ehen I got down I found the prisoner standing by this case of brandy, directly under the tail of his cart—Watkins and Smith had got to him beforr—I heard the prisoner say he believed he had got the wrong case—I said I thought he had—he was then taken into custody</p>

               <p>—the case he took was not at all similar, in shape or size to the cases of wine which he was to take—the smallest of them was thirty-three inches, and the case he took was only eighteen inches—this case of brandy had never been let through the loop-hole.</p>

On the 7th of February I was called by Mr. Evans to load for the prisoner—I came down from No. 11 to No. 10—while I was coming down I saw the prisoner standing at the end of the gangway, at the foot of the stairs that lead to No. 11—I passed on to Mr. Evans, and Watkins came along directly after—in consequence of what Watkins said I was sent to where the cart was loading—I found the prisoner standing at the tail of his cart, unfolding a tarpaulin in the bottom of the cart—the case of brandy stood at his feet, under the tail of the cart—I looked at the case; he turned round, and said to me, "I think I have made a mistake; I want No. 8, this is not it"—he took a paper from his pocket—this little case could have been got conveniently into the curt, under the tarpaulin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper of the London Docks—on the 30th of Jan., a little before four o'clock, I was directed by Clements to go into the box near the west gate, to take charge of the prisoner; I saw him there, and I saw some dust of indigo on the desk—I asked what he was stopped with; was it with the indigo; he said, "Yes"—I said, "How much; a pound?" the prisoner said, "No; four or five"—I said I was very sorry; it was a bad job—he said he should be taken to the police, and he had no business to have done it—he wanted to go in and see Mr. Chandler, the superintendent; I said I must not let him out of the box till Mr. Clements returned—Mr. Cle<lb/>ments returned in about twenty minutes, and told him be would have to go before a Magistrate—when Mr. Clements was gone, the prisoner said be ought to be treated the same as the rest—he said Gale was stopped some time ago</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 91.) I saw the prisoner about four o'clock in the morning on the 17th of Feb. in Grove-end-road, St. John's-wood, going towards the Eyre Arms tavern. He turned and came back—he had this lead tied in this handkerchief under his arm—I asked what he had got; he said, "Nothing particular"—I said, "You have slates, have you not?"—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "You have either lead or copper with it"—he said, "Lead, man, lead," and that he was going to take it to Mr. Ponsford's, in Grosvenor-square—he then said he fetched it from there last night, and took it to his lodging in Henry-street, Portland-town—I then took him to the station, and found in the bundle these eight pieces of lead—when put together they form one piece—it weighs 29lbs.—I went to an unfinished house at the back of the Eyre-arms, and found some lead gone—Mr. Brown was there, and identified this lead.</p>

I went to the house and found the policeman there—I looked over the house and missed this piece of lead from the water-closet—it had not been fixed—I saw it there the day before—I know it because I had had both the edges of it planed.</p>

I was on board on the 4th of Feb.—I was going as a passenger—I remember the prisoner's being in the cabin in the evening—I saw Captain Smith count his money—the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing that—I saw the Captain put it away—he had his tea, and went on deck—after he was gone up, the prisoner put away the tea things—while doing so he went near the cupboard—he opened the door, which prevented my seeing into the berth, and went into the sleeping berth—I could not see the drawer in which the register-box was kept, but I beard it opened—he came out again directly, and went right out of the cabin—just before this he asked me to go into the mate's bed—I told him it was too soon—he asked me to go on deck, and see the cargo stowed in the hold, but I declined it—in five minutes after he left the cabin the captain missed his money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the vice of Messrs. Allen and Smith, who live in Friday-street, Cheapside. On the 21st of Jan. I was ordered to conceal myself—Amos Hayton was at the entry-desk in the counting-house at that time—Rawlings, who is a porter in the house, was directed to remain in the warehouse while the others were gone to dinner, and not to leave—he was left in charge of the warehouse—I concealed myself behind the counting-house—about half-past two o'clock I watched Rawlings, and saw him go into the linen-room, to a box in which some lawns were—I bad counted the pieces of lawn in that box about five minutes before, and found forty-nine pieces—I saw him put his band on the goods—his back was towards me—he instantly left, and walked behind some boxes which were standing in front of the warehouse—I then came forward from my hiding-place, and asked what he was doing there—he said he was looking for a sheet of paper—I immediately went to the box, counted the pieces, and found three pieces were missing—in the meantime Rawlings walked forwards, and Hayton told me he was gone out—I went in, search of him, and could not find him—in about an hour he returned—Mr. Allen called him into the counting-house, and afterwards gave him into custody—no one had any pos<lb/>siblity of getting to the box between the time of my finding forty-nine pieces of lawn and counting them again, and finding only forty-six, except Rawlings—there are three pieces of lawn here now—I am able to say that this is one of the forty-nine pieces which I saw in the box before I saw Rawlings go to it—I know it by the "No. 591" on it—the marks have been removed from the other two pieces—I had observed this number on them before—here are several other pieces of the same lot, and the same manufacture, but there is no mark or number to enable me to detect them—they contain about six yards and a half in each, and are wrapped in green.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with John Smith—we are woollen and Manchester warehousemen, and live in King-street, Cheapside. Coward was our porter—on the 6th of Oct., he was desired to take two trusses of silk and wollen which were to be returned to Mr. Norton—they were called waist<lb/>coatings, and I believe Coward went away as though to take them—I do not remember his returning—I should think about five or six days afterwards, I questioned him about this parcel delivery book—I asked him how it was the two trusses had not gone back—he said they had—I said, "It appears they have not, and beside that there is only one in your entry for them"—I had asked for the book when I heard the trusses had not gone back—this figure which is now a 2 in this book was then a 1, and the word "One" is written un<lb/>der it as being received by Pickford—the prisoner said, "I tied the two trusses together"—that satisfied me that it might be so, and that they had been taken as one by Pickford—on the 8th of Feb., the officer showed me these goods which are here—I than looked at Coward's book again, and found the figure I had been altered to a 2, but the word "One, Pickford and Company," re<lb/>mained—I have examined these two pieces of waistcoating which are here, and they correspond in pattern and quality with the goods I expected to re<lb/>ceive from Mr. Norton—I do not know whether the trusses had been opened or not, but I received the invoice, and I said, "Let them go bank"—these are precisely the description of goods which I had ordered, and which I desired might go back—they amounted to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—Coward had access to the warehouse—his wife and him slept there.</p>

               <p>the stable, and go towards his own house—Tinsworth came from the stable, fetched a pail of water from the pump, and took it into the stable to Blunt, who was looking after his horses—about ten the same morning I saw Blunt come from the stable with something in a sack, and take it across the yard—I did not see where he put it—there was a cart of turnips standing there, be<lb/>longing to Mr. Bonnett—about one o'clock I went to that cart—I saw part of a sack in the cart—I opened it, looked in, and there was some meat in it—I then went and told Mr. Bonnett—there is more than one stable in the yard—Blunt came from a large brick stable—the same into which Little had taken the pail.</p>

On Monday morning, the 12th of Feb., I received information—I went to a place called Cat's-lane, and found this sheep-skin with the head attached—I examined it—I showed it to the drover—he said it was the skin of the sheep he had lost—I carried it to Mr. Webb'a stable—I then went to a field belonging to Mr. Webb—I had seen some sheep driven into that field the night before by Ringe the drover—I discovered footmarks of three per<lb/>sons leading over three or four fields to where I found a sheep had been slaughtered, in a field adjoining Cat's-lane—I compared the marks in the field with some boots which I got from the prisoner Tintworth's feet, and they corresponded—I also saw a mark of a knee, where a person had been kneel<lb/>ing, between where the sheep was taken from, and where it was slaughtered—I was with Tebenham when he compared these marks with a pair of breeches found at Tinsworth's lodgings, and they corresponded—I have kept the boots, and produce them to-day—the left boot was the one I examined most particularly—here are peculiar nails which made the impression in the earth, three nails in the heel, and the tip projects out a little—it correspond<lb/>ed in every respect with the mark in the field—I afterwards traced the same footmarks from the place where the sheep had been slaughtered towards the back of the White Horse-yard—I afterwards received information from Bon<lb/>nett, and found the sack and meat in his cart—I apprehended Little, and he was discharged—I found a knife on Tinsworth, with blood on the handle where the blade shuts—it had been apparently fresh cleaned when I found it—the blood was inside where the blade closes.</p>

(meaning down stairs) "or from up stairs"—I told him, "From out of the still-room, (meaning down stairs)—he said he came down stairs, and not up stairs, I am sure of that—he was making his way up stairs when I went in—I went over the house after he was in charge of the police—I did not find anything—I did not observe any sign of paper-staining or paper-manufacturing—all the rooms were empty but the still-room, the coining-room, and the back kitchen—there were seven rooms-five were totally unfurnished—the still-room it on the ground floor, under the front parlour—that was one of the furnished rooms—the front par<lb/>lour was furnished—that would make three rooms furnished, the front parlour, another room, and the coining-room—there was a bed and bedstead, a box or two, and a chair, in the coining-room; also, a bed in the back parlour, and one in the front parlour—there were but two beds in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a supervisor in the Excise. On the 10th of Feb. I accompanied the other witnesses to No. 61, Prince's-street—I guarded the front door, to see that no one came out, while the other parties made their entrance—I went in after them, and found Martin in custody of Rice and my son—they took him to the front parlour—I left him in custody of my son and the police, and proceeded after Rice, up stairs to the room, where I found the implements of coining—these are the articles, which I produce—this silver watch was lying in the centre, with two heaps of base coin, on the mantel-piece—the moulds were quite hot—I could not hold them in my hand at first—there were two impressions in one mould, and one in another—I produce a file, a knife, and a pipkin—when I left the room up stairs, I proceeded down stairs the under-ground kitchen or cellar, where I found Tucker, and the private still going on—I there found a quantity of spirits—I examined some ashes that were lying in the still-room, and found one of the base shillings un<lb/>finished, which I produce—this shilling was not kept apart from the others—they were all put together—it was rough in the edges—I also found some pieces of cuttings, or parings of metal, lying in the ashes—I did not take any notice of them—I left them there—they had a bright appearance, as if not long cut off—they had been melted—they had been pared off the shillings, I have no doubt—I asked Tucker how long he had been in the house—he said between three and four months—I asked him if the man Martin had been there the same time he had—he said they both came together—I then asked if he knew any thing about the coining going on up stairs—he said no, the business was carried on up stairs by the other man, Martin, and he did not know what he was doing there—I said it was impossible for the business to be carried on</p>

               <p>up stairs without his knowledge—he said he did not know what he was doing—I then asked him if they were not partners—he replied, they were—I asked him about the shilling I found in the ashes—he seemed rather confused at the first moment, and stated after, they might be brought down in the ashes, a Martin used to bring his ashes down into that room—I do not believe he saw me rake it out—the front parlour had a few chairs in it, and a table—I found some papers in a cupboard, such as receipts for hats, which I did not remove—I also produce a receipt from the landlord, which I found in an ornament on the mantel-piece, in the front parlour—I went over the house—I did not see any thing of paper-staining or hanging going on—not the least—there was one bed in the coining-room, and there were two or three beds on one bedstead in the room below—the distance between the still-room and the coining-room is perhaps about ten yards.</p>

This platterd of Paris mould is intended for casting two counterfeit shillings at one time—it has the impression of both sides of a shilling on it—it is in a condition to work—here are two counterfeit shillings which appear to have been cast in it—these appear in the state in which they first came out of the mould, with the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> attached—the plaster of Paris and these moulds are of the same kind of material—this is another mould for casting shillings—it has a shilling cast in it—it has never been removed till this moment—this tin band is for the purpose of forming the mould—it appears to have been so used—there is plaster of Paris now in it—here are twenty-eight counterfeit shillings which appear to have been cast in the mould which now has the shilling in it—there is white metal in this pipkin, of a similar description to the counterfeit coin—it appears to have been in a fused state—these white metal spoons are corre<lb/>sponding metal to that in the pipkin and the counterfeit coin—they are known as Britannia metal—the crucible appears to have been used for the purpose of fluxing metal—it has a portion of metal of a similar description in it now—the files would be used for the purpose of removing any superfluous metal from the edge of the coin after first cast—they appear to have white metal in the teeth—here are some more clippings of white metal of a similar description—they appear to have been taken from the edges of the counterfeit coin after first cast—such particles would attach to the coin cast in these moulds, and must be removed by scissors, a knife, or file—these appear to be of that de<lb/>scription—here is a knife and files—there appears to be every thing neces<lb/>sary for coining—here are also five shillings cast in the double mould—they are different from the twenty-eight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Camden-street, Newington. On the morning of the 11th of Feb., about seven o'clock, my journeyman left me—he had given me no notice—I went with the officer, on the 11th of Feb., to Camplin's house, which is next to mine—the officer knocked at the door—Camplin refused to let him in—he said, if she did not open it, he would break it open—she then opened the door, and said, "O my God, what shall I do?" and she offered me a sovereign to say nothing further about it—I found there twelve 2lb. loaves on a bed, partly covered over—I have every reason to believe they were mine—I had directed some one to watch my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-man to Thomas Ballance, who keeps the Red Lion, Ratcliffe-highway. On the 12th of Feb. I went with a party to Croydon, in a one-horse phaeton, and on our return to Tulse-hill, I was upset, and considerably injured—Miss Shepherd was with me, and Mr. and Mrs. Renton—I was taken into a stable—before I was taken in there the prisoner had come up—he said he was a particular friend of mine, and he gave his card—I could hear what he said, but I was unable to make an answer—a <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> was procured, and I was taken home—I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and two Spanish coins—I had a ring on my finger—I missed that ring—I had a black dress-coat and two silk handkerchiefs—I missed some money and my handkerchiefs—I got information, and went to No. 2, New<lb/>ington-causeway—we knocked for an hour and a half, and got admittance at last, through the prisoner's brother, Douglass—he knocked at the door, and the prisoner opened it—I told the prisoner I had come to remunerate him for his trouble, and to ask him if he could give me any account of the articles missing, as I had lost a black dress coat, two handkerchiefs, a ring off my finger, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and some silver—when I mentioned the ring, he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "Did you not see it on my finger?"—he said, "No"—I asked if he saw any one take it off—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you not take it off yourself?"—he said, did I mean to throw a slur on his character?—I told the officer to speak to him—he asked him two or three times over, and at last he produced the ring from his waistcoat-pocket—it was mine—we also found my two silk-hand<lb/>kerchiefs and the foreign coin—I had a foreign coin similar to this, and this ring I know to be mine.</p>
