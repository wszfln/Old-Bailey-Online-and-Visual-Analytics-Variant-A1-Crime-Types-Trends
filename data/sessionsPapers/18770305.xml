                  </hi>. I am at present staying at the Ship Hotel, Halliford—I am possessed of considerable property in the counties of Wex-ford, Tipperary, and Waterford—I came to reside in England in 1871, and have lived here since then—in the year 1875 I made the acquaintance of the late Sir Edward Cunningham—I resided at Clunn's Hotel, I think from April 30th, 1875, I till the end of June—I had to pay a large sum of money on certain bills of exchange for Sir Edward Cunningham—I think I left Clunn's Hotel on 10th October, and returned to it on 8th November—Sir Edward Cunningham was living there at that time; he occupied a bed-room next to mine—I was on very friendly terms with him at that time—in November he introduced me to the two defendants—I don't know the date—he introduced them as wine merchants—after that introduction they were in the habit of coming early in the morning to my room—they came at different hours, generally about 10 o'clock—at that time I was in bed—they would remain an hour, perhaps—while they were there they would drink champagne cup—about six or eight champagne cups used to be ordered up in the morning, and hot pickle sandwiches—they had no other drink that I remember—I drank with them—I paid for it—I do not remember the 24th November—I remember their coming to my bed-room on the morning of a dinner with Mr. Hollingshead—they came at the usual hour, about 10 o'clock—they had sandwiches and champagne cup on that occasion—I don't think I had a luncheon party that day—I remember a suggestion being made by one of the defendants, I can't remember which, Owing to a fire at the sessions House, no sitting was held in the Old Court this Session.</p>

               <p>about a dinner at Clunn's—I ordered the dinner in their presence, the best that could be got, and drink unlimited—I don't think there were any other persons dining there besides the defendants—I think Mr. Hoofe dined there, I am not certain—there was a good deal of wine drank at that dinner—before the dinner I think Sir Edward Cunningham suggested turtle soup—no reason was given for that, except that as Mr. Hollingshead dined they wanted the best to be put on the table—before the 25th Wetherall, I believe, asked me to go to Spam to buy horses, not knowing an) thing of the wine trade—that was said in my bed-room one morning when the drink was going on—after the dinner on the 24th I remember going to Evans'—I was drunk when I went there—the defendants went with me—we had more drink there; I cannot give any account of what I drank there—I don't know whether I have since paid the bill for the drink—after I left Evans' I think I went to Clunn's—I am unable to state which of the defendants went with me—I have not the slightest idea how I got to bed or at what hour—I can't tell whether the defendants and Cunningham came to my room next morning, most likely, I suppose so—I suppose we had the usual champagne cup; that took place every morning that they came—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in signed 25th November—I signed it in bed. (<hi rend="italic">This purported to be an agreement between the witness and the defendants, by which in consideration of Wetherall's relinquishing to the witness a portion of the wine business recently carried on by him and Cottam, at</hi> 10, <hi rend="italic">Burleigh Street, Mr. Doyle was to advance</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be used for the purposes of the said business or otherwise; the four partners to share equally in the profits or losses, and to take on themselves the liabilities of the late firm</hi>.) I never saw the contents of that document till now; oh, yes, I beg pardon, I saw it before the Magistrate—in conse<lb/>quence of something I heard I went to my solicitor, Mr. Mitton—before I went to him I knew that I had signed that document entering into a part<lb/>nership with Wetherall, De Chastelaine, and Cunningham, in the wine business; I don't know the date when I first knew it, it was before I went to my solicitor; I was advised to go to him by a friend, Mr. Flores, on the 25th, the morning after the dinner—I suppose this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the docu<lb/>ment I signed; I have not the slightest recollection of signing it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "December 7th, Clunn's Hotel. Dear Wetherall, I have not as yet received your letter, but Cunningham has explained the contents.

I had a servant John Elwood, attending upon me at that time—I saw my solicitor from time to time, and on 6th December, I attended with him at counsel's chambers, for the purpose of having a consultation—I was unable to see counsel; I don't remember where I went to afterwards—I don't remember whether I went to the Criterion, or whether I went back to Clunn's after I had been to counsel's chambers—I do not remember what happened next morning—I do not remember Cunningham and De Chastelaine coming to my room that morning; they always came there, I don't remember whether they came first and Wetherall afterwards—I remember a letter being dictated to me, I think by Wetherall or De Chastelaine; I can't remember which—I remember writing a letter; I remember it to a certain extent—I think Sir Edward Cun<lb/>ningham may have dictated it tome; I think De Chastelaine and Wetherall were with, him at the tune—I don't <hi rend="italic">know</hi> whether they all came together</p>

               <p>that morning, or whether two came first, and the other subsequently, I remember subsequently to that my solicitor sending me away from Clunn's into the country; I don't know the date—I don't remember putting a date to this letter—I don't remember whether I was asked by anybody to put a date to it—before I went out of town I remember going to De Chastelaine's place; that was either in North Street or Bury Street—at one place I played the piano, and at the other place I drank; I don't remember what place it was—there had been conversation from time to time about my going to Spain and buying horses—I don't know when I first became acquainted with the fact that I had signed a partnership in the wine business.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Doyle and have been so since May, 1876—I came with him to Clunn's Hotel about 8th November, and remained there till 7th December—during the time I have been in his service he was almost always drinking, with the exception of a week or two when we were away—he had suffered from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> three times since I have been with him—he always had half a pint of brandy put by his bedside at night—I first saw Sir Edward Cunningham about the beginning of November; he was then staying at the hotel, he occupied the room next to Mr. Doyle, he was constantly in Mr. Doyle's society, he came every morning to his bed-room and had a brandy and soda—the two defendants were introduced to Mr. Doyle about 10th or 12th November—I did not see the introduction, but I saw them at the hotel in Mr. Doyle's room—Mr. De Chastelaine used to come almost every day—Mr. Wetherall did not come so often—Mr. De C Chastelaine used to come about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning—Sir Edward Cunningham used to come the first thing every morning while Mr. Doyle was in bed, and he always used to have brandy and soda or whiskey and milk, and champagne cups afterwards—they had five or six quart champagne cups as a rule—Mr. Doyle joined with them in drinking—I never heard anything about the wine business—I heard Sir Edward Cunningham say that Mr. Doyle was going to Spain with him to buy horses—he said that to Mr. Doyle in my presence, and he said it was a very good thing for him, because he was delicate, and it was a nice warm climate—on 24th November I remember the defendants being in the bed-room in the early morning as usual—they had brandies and sodas and five or six champagne cups as usual—I heard that there was to be a dinner—Sir Edward Cunningham, Mr. De Chastelaine, and Mr. Doyle spoke about it—I heard them say that they must have a very good dinner, because it was important, and I also heard Mr. Doyle say that it made a difference of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him having a good dinner; he did not say why—the three defendants and two other gentlemen were there to luncheon that day, they had some champagne and burgundy at lunch—I remember the dinner that evening—I think there was only one other guest besides the defendants—I waited at dinner—I think they had several bottles of champagne go up—I saw Mr. Doyle before he left the hotel after dinner; he was drunk—I saw them go into Evans', Sir Edward Cunningham, Mr. Doyle, and Mr. De Chastelaine; that was all, I think, who went—Mr. Wetherall did not go with them into Evans'—I saw them when they left 'Evans', at 12.30—Sir Edward came in with Mr. Doyle, he had hold of Mr. Doyle's arm, and Mr. De Chastelaine came in just after them—they had some more drink and sat up till between 3 and I o'clock—I then took Mr. Doyle to bed—I always followed him to bed; "he was very drink, more so than usual—I did not undress him, he would not let me—I took hold of his coat and shoved him on to the bed, and took hold of his legs and threw him backwards into the bed—he dosed off for a little time, he woke up about an hour after and wanted a brandy and soda—I would not give him one at first and he said "Let us have a split old man," and I let him have a split—I then undressed him and put him into bed—next morning Sir Edward Cunningham came into the bed-room early, between 8 and 9 o'clock; he said he was awfully thirsty and wanted a brandy and soda, and I gave him one—all this drink was put down to Mr. Doyle's account—Sir Edward</p>

I am a solicitor, of 2, Gray's Inn Square—I have acted as solicitor for Mr. Doyle since 1871—I am the solicitor con<lb/>ducting this prosecution—on 2nd December Mr. Doyle's servant came to me—in consequence of what he said to me I went and saw Mr. Doyle at Clunn's hotel—I had some conversation with him, in consequence of which, on the following Monday, the 4th, I wrote this letter to Mr. Wetherall. <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—My client, Mr. Doyle, informs me that he has placed his signa<lb/>ture to a document in your possession, of the purport of which he appears to be in perfect ignorance. Will you furnish me with copy, in order that I my approve it on Mr. Doyle's behalf?") I received no reply to that—I wrote again stating that as Mr. Doyle was not in a state to sign any such document I must insist on its being given up or I should take the most sum<lb/>mary measures to bring him and others to justice—I then received this answer. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 6th December</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">from Wetherall, and stated that he had positive evidence of Mr. Doyle's approval of what he had done, and (that on receiving a note from him he would place the document</hi> in <hi rend="italic">question before him, for inspection</hi>.) I received that letter on the morning of the 8th on the morning of the 6th I got this paper with a billhead from Mr. Flora, he sent it to me and said he had found it in the hotel—I only know Wetherall's handwriting by the letters I received; this is in the same hand-writing as the letters. (<hi rend="italic">Head;</hi> "5th December, 1876. Wetherall, Doyle, &amp;Co., wine merchants, &amp;c, 10, Burleigh Street, Strand, We have received the enclosed letter from Mr. Doyle's solicitor. What is the meaning of it? It seems to me very sharp. Please show it to Doyle and ask him to see me on the matter").' On the morning of the 6th I went to 10, Burleigh Street, strand—I found there a sort of vault, or cellar, and two small offices—the name of Cottam, Wetherall, &amp; Co. was on the door post—on first entering there was a small office, there was a large desk in the centre of the room, I id not notice anything else; there was very little furniture indeed—you passed through a green baize door into another office; there were three desks there, a sofa, and a few chairs, cigar boxes, and a bottle or two of wine—here were some bottles of brandy on the table, and I think a bottle of sherry—I did not notice any claret—I saw no clerks there—I saw De Chas<lb/>telaine, he came out of the inner office—I told him that I wanted to look at the agreement that I understood Mr. Doyle had signed—he said he was not able to let me have it, it was in the possession of Mr. Wetherall, and Mr. Wetherall was out—I told him that if any use was made of any document</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187703050010"/>
               <p>that had been signed by Mr. Doyle it would be made a very serious matter of, and I cautioned him against allowing any use whatever to be made of anything that Mr. Doyle had anything to do with, that Mr. Doyle was a man that I considered incapable of entering into any engagement whatever—he expressed his surprise, he said he was not aware that was the case, and a copy of the agreement should be sent to me by that day's post, I was to have it that afternoon, it did not come, and on the morning of the 8th I called again at Burleigh Street about 10.40—I found nobody in the offices, they were locked up—I saw that the name on the door had been changed to Wetherall, Doyle,&amp; Co.—I went there again about 4 o'clock that after<lb/>noon—I then found Mr. De Chastelaine there; there was nobody else there then—I had a long conversation with him, it was merely a reiteration of what I had said before, that Mr. Doyle was a man incapable of entering into an agreement and I must insist upon having the document and have it destroyed at once—I asked Mr. De Chastelaine whether Mr. Doyle's credit had been in any way pledged in connection with the business—he said "Yes," they had entered into certain arrangements which would make it very diffi<lb/>cult, and so on—I told him it was a very serious matter, that I was in full possession of all the facts in connection with their having got his signature to the agreement, and I urged upon him considerably that he should hand over to me the document at once in order to prevent any further unplea<lb/>santness—he said that it was simply impossible to do so, that Mr. Wetherall would be there that afternoon and he would talk to him on the subject—I said I must have it before I left, so I took a seat and remained till Mr. Wetherall came, which was about 5.30—I reiterated to him what I had said to De Chastelaine and said that I must see the agreement at once—he said he wound fetch for me from his solicitor, Mr. Shires—he went out, came back, and said that Mr. Shires was out—I said I would wait till he returned—I waited, and after a time Mr. Wetherall went out again and returned and handed me the agreement; I took a copy of it; this is the agreement; I think it was stamped at that time—I told Mr. Wetherall it was a matter in which it would be impossible for me to allow any time to elapse, that the thing must be destroyed at once, and I must also have a guarantee that Mr. Doyle's credit had not been in any way pledged, because I did not consider that he was a person fit to enter into an agreement—on that morning, find<lb/>ing that the offices were locked up and that the cellar was open, I went down into the cellar and took the opportunity of making an investigation—I found a small boy there, between eight and twelve years of age—I saw three casks, I don't know whether they were full or not, a number of dozen bottles of racked wine, they looked like claret bottles, perhaps forty dozen—the bottles looked clean, they did not look like old port, or anything of that sort I have on many occasions written for Mr. Doyle's bill at Clunn's, I have not been able to get it—I saw Mr. Doyle before the 24th or 25th November—his state duaing the last two or three years has never been very satisfactory, it is very difficult to get him when he is not more or less under the influence of intoxication.</p>

I should certainly say there was not 120 dozen sherry in the cellar, the bins were not racked very high—I am not prepared to say they were not double racked—the first communication that was made to me in reference to this document was on 2nd December, that was not by the servant coming to me—I had not seen Mr. Flores prior to that—I saw him at Clunn's Hotel, on 2nd December—I received a letter</p>

               <p>from Mr. Wetherall, after my visit there—at that interview Mr. Wetherall said "Well, but is your client insane"—I don't think I said "I am not I prepared to say that"—what I more likely said was "I am not prepared to I jay that, but I don't think he is of a condition to sign a document"—this is I the letter, it' is dated the 8th. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I have called to-day at Clunn's to see Mr. Doyle, but I hear he left yesterday in company of a person named Flores, and has not since returned, can you oblige me by letting me I know who Flores is, and the present address of Mr. Doyle.") I did not give him the address, or answer the letter at all—Mr. Doyle has not been put I under restraint—Mr. Wetherall said at the interview that if he was advised by his solicitor to tear up the document he would do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I asked him to tear it up there and then—he said "No, I will be advised by my solicitor, that Mr. De Chastelaine and Sir Edward Cunningham said they had entered into arrangements, and the money must I be paid"—Mr. Doyle left London, on the evening of the 7th for Halliford—I did not communicate to anybody where he was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were not several other carriage searchers—the prisoner was doing another man's duty that day—he joined the company's service last December—I do not know that he has been eighteen or twenty years in the Army—Vine Street siding is a place where trains are put for the purpose of washing—it is a large place, open to the air—the place where the gold was discovered is about a mile and a quarter from Aldgate Station.</p>

On the afternoon of 13th, February I received information of this robbery, and went with Sergeant Webb to Aldgate Station—we saw the prisoner—I said that I was a detec<lb/>tire officer, and had come to make enquiries respecting a bag of gold which had been left in a carriage arriving at Aldgate at 2.48—he said "I was at dinner-at that time, and I know nothing about that train"—I said "You hare been seen to leave the station once or twice"—he said "I can swear I left the station only once, and that was to have some beer with some of my mates"—next morning I saw him at Aldgate at 11 o'clock—we had to send for him from Vine Street, where he was working—he came to Aldgate, and I said "I find that you bought a pair of boots at 3.30 yesterday in the Whitechapel Road, and you were seen drinking with some people in the evening"—he said "I did not buy a pair of boots, and I went straight home"—I said "You bought the boots at Barnes', in Whitechapel Road, and paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—he considered for some time, and I repeated my question—he—said "I did buy the boots, and I will tell you the truth, gentlemen. I had a 100 rupee note; I sold it to a strange man, a Jew, in Petticoat Lane for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he made several contradictory statements, and at last he said "If you will let me go at large I shall be able to find something out for you by to-night at 6 o'clock"—I asked him why he thought so—he said that he had seen a porter named Williamson searching the carriages where this bag of gold was supposed to be left, and instead of his getting out of the carriage on to the platform, he got out on to the line, and he thought the bag might be hid in some part of the station—Sergeant Webb and Sergeant Godsden searched under the platform, and while they were gone the prisoner said "You had better let me go at large and I will guarantee that you have the bag of gold brought here by 6 o'clock to-night"—I, said "I cannot do that, but I will go anywhere with you"—he said "That won't do, because people may see me and think that I have <hi rend="italic">rounded</hi>"—Webb then returned with Godsden, and I then said to the prisoner "Can't you point out to me where this bag of gold is likely to be hid?"—he said "Well, about 5.30 last evening I saw three men standing in the Vine Street siding, near the Farringdon Street station, they were dividing something between them; I think if you go there and search it may be buried there"—I then went with Mr. Rainey to Vine Street siding, where we searched about the line, and at last came to some earth which had recently been turned over—I got a shovel, turned up the earth, and about a foot from the surface found this bag turned inside out, which I afterwards found contained five small bags, each containing 200 sovereigns—one bag had gone—I went back to Aldgate, where the prisoner was detained, and showed him the bag; he said "I am glad you have found the bag, my mind is much easier"—he was then told that he would be charged with being concerned in stealing it—he made no answer, and we took him to the station—Mr. Power identified the bags.</p>

Tuesday and let me know, about 3 p.m. Yours respectfully, Charles Wells.") On the same day I went to Clark's lodgings, 18, Prince's Street, Kingsland—she lived there with her husband—I found in a drawer in her room this piece of cloth, seventeen pieces of velvet, a box of buttons, and fourteen duplicates, only one of which related to this charge—the cloth was given up at the police-Court—next day I went to Wykeham's, at the Coach and Horses, Bartholomew Close, three or four doors from where he was employed as potman—I told him I was a police officer, and asked him if he had heard of the robbery at Mr. Jaques'—he said "Yes"—I said that I understood he had been receiving some pieces of cloth—he said "Yes, I have a bag here in my pot-house which it was brought in, and I parried it home to my lodgings"—I said "Do you mind my seeing your lodging?"—he said "I will go with you," and we went to 9, Long Lane, Smithfield—I searched his room, and in a coat hanging on the door I found this piece of velvet and five small pieces of cloth—I said "How do you account for them?"—he said "These are some pieces which Charles, the porter, brought home and gave to me"—I found in his box eighteen duplicates relating to the cloth.</p>

He asked me to go in with them as he had an aversion to do so, and I pawned two or three of the articles for him. He asked me to keep the tickets for him. I had not the slightest idea that the stuff was stolen, or I should have been frightened to take them to the same pawn-shop two or three times.

Alley Jones, who agreed to purchase the Basingstoke Canal for</hi> 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be paid by Sophia Frampton</hi>, 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">by Thomas Alley Jones, and</hi> 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">by the prisoner, who was to have a third-share of the profits in consideration of his services, each party paying a third of the expenses for repairs and working of the canal, and to receive a third of the profits, or a third of the purchase-money if sold</hi>.) The prisoner's father, who is a solicitor, was present—the prisoner produced his father's cheque for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purchase of his share—on 2nd December I signed another agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was similar to that of the 1st December, adding, should either of the parties die, the survivors should have the option of purchasing his or her share, and that balance-sheets should be prepared half-yearly</hi>.) On the 24th November, 1875, the prisoner told me he had sold the canal to Mr. Brady, of Austin Friars, for 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that Mr: Brady was going to form a company, taking 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself and we were to have 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, that Mr. Brady had paid' to the London and Westminster Bank 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to guarantee the carrying out of the contract, and as I had not paid all my 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he asked me for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a deposit on the guarantee—I had not the money—he said it would only be wanted for a few days—I gave him a bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The bill was dated 24th November</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on the London and Westminster Bank, signed by Sophia frampton and endorsed J.

Belying upon his statements I gave him the bill to place as a deposit with the manager of the bank—I was to pay it off by instalments, and I paid four instalments of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, and Mr. Edgar changed the prisoner's cheques for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and' 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the other 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I gave to the prisoner to pay into the bank on the 24th December, 1875, as he said it must be paid that day or we should lose our purchase, and it would be a great pity as the manager of the bank had introduced Mr. Brady to the transaction—afterwards Mr. Edgar spoke to me about the two cheques, and in result I paid him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as part of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had advanced—in April, 1873, the prisoner came to me and said he wanted to finish the works of the tunnel—I then enquired about Mr. Brady and the prisoner made some vague answer, said it was sot quite settled, but he must have—the money to finish the tunnel, and asked if I would become responsible with, his father and his brother-in-law</p>

               <p>for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to—which I objected—the loan was to be obtained from the British Mutual Investment Company, of, Ludgate Hill Circus—he said his father had deposited deeds with this company as a guarantee that he had made over his own furniture and carriages to them, and that I ran not the least risk, it was merely a matter of form—I believed what he said and signed a promissory note which Mr. Martin has—I have been called upon to pay upon this document, and the prisoner has without my consent deposited deeds of mine relating to some property in Chancery—I was also sued in the Court of Bankruptcy and was obliged to liquidate—in September, 1875, the prisoner, owing me 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. independently of the Basingstoke Canal property, came to me and told me that a Mr. Potter would lend 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on some costs, but he had to release some copyhold property from the Copy-hold Commissioners for which he had to pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I would advance that sum the prisoner would be able to pay it me back, and also the 200l, towards the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as his clerk was present and confirmed his statement I went with the prisoner to the Bank of England and paid in 184<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6d—he had the remainder in cash in sums of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—relying upon his representations I gave him those sums.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This agreement was dated 18th September</hi> 1874, <hi rend="italic">between the same parties and Charles Doims, and was an agreement to purchase the canal for</hi> 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and to pay</hi> 1,200. <hi rend="italic">deposit</hi>.) I never had a copy of that document delivered to me—I never heard Douris' name men<lb/>tioned, and I do not believe that is my signature, though it looks like my writing—the prisoner kept back the chief agreement, which I ought to have had—I asked the prisoner what the blank piece of paper was that I signed—he said it was a bill for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him he had had 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had only borrowed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I felt unhappy about this bill, and he was told if he did not return it I would advertise him in every paper in London as it was a fraud and forgery—the bill was returned a few days after, it having been out of my possession for some months, and I told his father I would advertise him—I was told it was deposited with a man that sold seed, for 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure the bill was not all drawn except the date and my name, it was a blank piece of paper—this did not happen in July, 1874, as the transactions did not begin till November—the agreement for the</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated 8th December</hi>, 1875.) The prisoner did not state what the canal would realise annually, he would never give me parti<lb/>culars; I was always asking him; I did not expect 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from it; I should, have been satisfied with 10,000?., and I was not to receive that at once—that is my signature to that agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement was dated 22nd December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and recited the agreements of 1st and 2nd December, and stated the terms upon which Mrs. Frampton, having given up her interest, should re-enter the partnership. It was signed by T. A. Jones, J. A. Jones, and Sophia Frampton</hi>.) The prisoner told me he was solicitor for Mr. Potter in conducting the opposition to the Hampstead Small-pox Hospital—he did not say his costs were over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Hudson sued me on a bill—I explained the matter to him, and afterwards employed him as my solicitor; I cannot state the time—he is not my solicitor now—I next went to" Mr. Emmett, a solicitor, about the bankruptcy, and he made an appointment to see the prisoner, which the prisoner never kept, and I was obliged to com<lb/>mence criminal proceedings, as the prisoner would not do right.</p>

               <p>were not more than a minute before they came back—they were parted—a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that was with us began singing a song; they had got friendly again—John Cole sat on a form crying with passion—we left the Earl of Devon about 8.30, and went to the Moor's Arms—Whale was rather fresh; he knew what he was doing; they were all about alike—Stunt was with us all the while—we were <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> at the Moor's Arms—a dispute arose between Whale and Fluence about Fluence's wife—Whale happened to touch her, and Fluence said "Don't touch her Bill, that is ray wife, what I bought and paid for; if you do I will put a bit of steel into you"—I did not see anything in his hand then—he picked up a quart pot, and Whale tried to get hold of one also—he said "I can get a quart pot as well as you"—the barmaid swept them all off the bar—a constable then came and turned us all out—we then went to the Cotton Arms about 9.45—Fluence began rowing with Whale again about his wife, and said he would put a bit of steel into him if he pulled out a knife—at the Moor's Arms I had taken Whale's part, and said he was in the right, Whale asked me if I had a knife; I said I did not carry one—he then went to Hares and said "Lend me a knife, <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>"—Hares said "What do you want it for?—he said "To cut my nails"—John Cole came up to Whale and said "You are a nice fighting man to want to use knives"—Whale said "I should think so when he wants to use one to me"—then John Cole challenged him to fight, and then a scuffle began between them—I believe Whale was not a prize-fighter, he used to use sparring-rooms—a few blows passed, and the landlord ejected them all—I went out with the rest, and when I got outside I saw John Cole and Whale fighting—blows were being struck by one another—William and Henry Cole took their brother's part; they stepped in between him and Whale—I did not hear them say anything—they were all fighting together then, three upon one—Gregory, who is called <hi rend="italic">Buster</hi>, and who had been with us all the time, said "I can't see three upon one," and he took part in the fight in favour of Whale, and Stunt took Cole's part—they were all fighting together—I then saw Whale in the road sparring with one man by himself, I don't know who it was, and two or three were fighting together by the side of the public-house; <hi rend="italic">Buster</hi> was one of them—it was not dark, there was light from the public-house—I was holding Whale's coat and hat, and I kept pretty close to him—I then saw John Cole come up with a brick and hit Whale in the head with it—he threw it at him—he was about 5 or 6 yards from him—he came pretty close to him, about as far as I am from the Judge—the brick must have struck him on the eye, and he fell—me and Edwards picked him up and carried him to the wall, and put him on his legs, and held him there—he never spoke—blood was running down his face; it was covered with blood—I did not see where the brick came from—there are buildings going on opposite the public-house—it is a good wide road—Whale was insensible, he could not stand—while we had him up against the wall Stunt came up with a brick in his hand and said "Where is he 1 he has hit me, he shall never hit nobody eke. Stand out of the way or else I will <hi rend="italic">bash</hi> you"—Edward said "Don't hit him no more, I think he is dead now; if you want to hit any<lb/>body hit me. You shan't hit him no more"—Stunt said "Stand out of the way <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi>, or else you will get it"—with that we both stood away, and Whale fell to the ground, and while he was on the ground Stunt kicked him in the head, I can't say in what part—they then all left us, and we took Whale in a cab to the hospital.</p>

Stunt had been with us the whole afternoon, the same as the rest—he tried to prevent Whale and John Cole fighting at first—outside the Cotton Arms I did not see him till he took part in the fight—I did not see him try to prevent anyone fighting; if I said so just now I made a mistake; I did not hear William or Henry Cole say to Whale "You are too much for him, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—I don't remember saying so before the Magistrate—I did not see them try to hold John Cole back from figh<lb/>ting—I was intimate with them all; I was more with Whale than with the others—I believe he was very good with his fists—<hi rend="italic">Buster</hi> is a pretty decent hand with his fists, he attends sparrings as well as Whale; I don't know that any of the others do—I did not see whether Stunt had got a cut under his eye when he came up to Whale, it was rather dark on that side, we were a long way from the public-house—we were dragging him away to the other side—I did not hear him say "The cowardly fellow has hit me foul when I was not looking"—he said "Where is the big coward that hit me, he shall never hit nobody else"—what he said was "He has hit me"—I don't think he said "The big coward"—I don't know whether he did or not, he" might—I don't know how Whale got separated from the rest—I took no part in the fighting—I did not see Cole retreating, and Whale following him up—I think I was the soberest of the party, I was quite sober, and I think Stunt was about the same as I was, about twelve of us had been drinking together all the afternoon—I am not a very great drinker, I only drank now and then, it was only beer, I did not have any spirits—I joined them about 5 o'clock, and from 5 to 10 o'clock we were in public-houses.</p>

               <p>of the petrous portion of the temporal bone—the inflammation was more intense at those points, but there was inflammation in all parts of the brain—matter had formed between the membranes of the brain, and between the brain and its covering; more on the left side—there were two separate formations of matter—a blow might cause the injury behind the left ear—the heart was slightly enlarged, and the kidneys slightly contracted, the rest of the organs were healthy—the blow that might hare caused the injury behind the left ear might also have caused the fracture of the tem<lb/>poral orbit—I have no judgment about whether it was so caused or no—the cause of death was the inflammation of the covering of the brain—I am not able to say whether that was caused by the blow behind the ear, or whether by the injury over the eye—it was caused by one or the other or both—if one blow was given I should say a kick would intensify the inflan<lb/>nation; either of the injuries was sufficient to cause death; if one injury was inflicted a second would accelerate death.</p>

On Monday night, 5th February, about 7 o'clock, I was on duty outside the Folly Theatre, in King William Street—there was a crowd of seventy or 100 persons—the deceased and his wife were standing in the road at the edge of the crowd—a dog-cart driven by the prisoner came from the Strand, going westward, on its wrong side—a Hansom cab was standing on the opposite side—the dog-cart was going about 6 or 7 miles an hour—the deceased was knocked down by the off wheel of the dog-cart—he fell backwards in the street—the wheel struck him on the body—the dog-cart drove away—I ran after it 80 or 100 yards—I called to the prisoner—he looked round, but took no notice—I ran by the side of the horse and took hold of the reins and stopped him—there were two others riding with him—I told him I wanted their names and addresses—they all refused to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> them—I said they had knocked a man down opposite the theatre—they said they were not aware that they had knocked any one down—they told the driver to drive away and take no-notice—I took them back to the hospital—I then got their addresses—I arrested the prisoner next morning in King's Road, Chelsea—I told him he would be charged with causing the death of Joseph Thomas Deeley—he said he was not aware when I spoke to him last night that he had knocked any one down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 5, Feather's Court, Drury Lane—about 9.30 on the morning of 22nd January, I was standing with my barrow at an oil shop, at the corner of Cumberland Street and Goodge. Street, there is a butcher's shop at the opposite corner, and there was a butcher's cart standing opposite a pork butcher's, three houses above the butchers, the horses' head was towards Tottenham Court Road, and directly opposite that cart there was a little perambulator, or three wheeled track close against the kerb—the butcher's cart was not close to the kerb—there—was another costermonger's barrow between it and the kerb—I saw a four wheeled cab dtiven by the deceased coming from the Middlesex Hospital, towards Tottenham Court Road, he was driving very slow, a jig-jog pace—I also saw a cart driven by the prisoner coming in the opposite direction—he was not driving hard, and he was not driving very slowly, there were some window sashes in the cart standing upright, it was about five or six houses from the butcher's cart, and he went a little bit too far out to get past the butcher's cart, and he hit up against the fore wheel of the-old man's cab and pitched the old man out—I went and picked him up, put him in his cab and took him to the Middlesex Hospital—the pony in the prisoner's cart started with the force of the blow and threw the prisoner and his brother out—a man named Turner stopped the pony close against the cab.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The butcher's cart was standing outside the barrow and overlapping it; anyone coming from Tottenham Court Road, would have to pass between the butcher's cart and the cab—the prisoner was on his right side before he got to the cart, he then went more out into the centre of the road to pass the cart—I did not see the deceased rise up in his seat as if to look round, he fell close against the kerb; I should say his head rested not above 2 or 3 inches from it—at the time the cab was struck it was about 3 feet 6 inches from the kerb—I think there was room for the prisoner to have passed, or he might have pulled up.</p>

I am a gasfitter of Lonsdale Road, Notting Hill, I was in Goodge Street, within 3 yards of the baker's shop on the left, going from Middlesex Hospital, I saw the deceased's cab going in the direction of Tottenham Court Road at a reasonable pace for a cab—I saw the prisoner's dirt coming from Tottenham Court Road—he was driving fast—he got in collision with the cab, tilted over the wheel, and turned at right angles with the cab—he was in the middle of the road when I first saw him—the cab was about 3 feet from the kerb—there was plenty of room for the prisoner to pass—he had no reason to pull out towards the cab, he was trespassing on the other half of the road—it was 5 feet 7 inches from the gutter to the line of the road; I measured it directly after the collision; he had that distance to spare—in my opinion he could have avoided the accident, but I fancy the glare of the sashes fogged him, and he pulled the Wrong rein.</p>

Burton" on this paper in pencil (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and gave it to me—I did not receive any letter, nor did I see the prisoner again in the shop—on the next day I was fetched to the San Francisco Bank, by Hatcher, and saw the prisoner there, and said that he was the man—I said later on that I should know him better with his hat on—I afterwards saw him with his bat on and seemed to know him better.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting secretary to the London and San Francisco Bank, 22, Old Broad Street—the prisoner was a junior clerk-in their service—it was part of his duty to receive letters and keep the bill and postage stamp account—if any letters were re-addressed it was his duty to re-address them—about 15th November, Dr. Andree called at the bank and gave me certain directions—about 5th December I received from San Francisco a list of drafts, among which was one in favour of Dr. Andree for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 29th January as I was leaving the office I received this letter addressed "To the manager of the Bank," which I believe to be in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "44, Munster Street, Regent's Park, 29th January, 1871. Dear Sir,—The enclosed cheque I received from Dr. Andree about 'three weeks ago, but I have not been able to get the money for it; and as I am an invalid and have no friends in London I send it to you and hope you will kindly pay it as soon as possible, as I am in need of money. I do not know how you can send the money unless it is by P. 0. 0., and hat will cause expense, so please deduct it from the amount, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I hope you will pardon me for troubling you so, but being an invalid I am unable to go any distance. A. Burton. P.S.—Osnaburgh Street post-office is the nearest one to me.") This is the draft: "13th November, 1876. San Francisco. Please pay Adolph Andree or order (duplicate cheque being unpaid) 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and charge the amount to the London and San Francisco Bank, Limited. J. W. Minter, manager. A. Findwich, accountant,"—this is the same kind of paper which is used at the bank, but it has been cut down—it is not used there cut down—on the following morning the letter and cheque were placed before the manager and I gave 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Hatcher—the prisoner was not an invalid at that time—he was under notice to quit at the end of March—I produce a certificate of the incor<lb/>poration of the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had been there about three years—it is required that the clerks shall go to San Francisco if required—the prisoner was required to go there and declined—no fault was found with him and he was given three weeks to find something else—he has said to me on one or two occasions that Hatcher was hard upon him—I do not know that complaints followed on the prisoner accidentally meeting Hatcher in</p>

I will take you correct"—I said "Be aware young man where you are taking me".—he said "I am taking you correct; this way"—I said "No, you ought to take me that way, or that way"—he said "I am cutting a mile or so off," and he took me down some sort of road which he said was a short cut—he then tried to get the earrings out of my ears, but he found they were fastened and let them be, and then he put one arm round my neck and the other on my throat—I said "I am done now," and struck him twice in the face—he threw me down—I hallooed manfully and he said "Oh, you old sow, can't you hallo?"—I got up and he <hi rend="italic">downed</hi> me again in a, place where there is all brickwork and a wall, and ran away—a gentleman then came to me and I did not see the prisoner again till he was at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, of 9, Queen's Terrace—I examined Meek and found a small angular wound of the shape of the letter L between the seventh dorsal vertebrae and the lower part of the blade bone, about 2 1/2 inches from the spine; it was composed of two incisions, each about an inch deep—there was no danger from the wound itself, because it struck against the bone; if it had penetrated the chest it would have been very serious.</p>

Batley&amp; Watts, Whitecross Street—I said—'Have you an invoice with it"—he "said "No"—I asked Tarrant if he had ordered the chlorodine—he said "Yes, about a week ago; I ordered it of one of Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">This certified the marriage of William Gibson, legally divorced to Ellen Brazier, spinster, at the wesleyan Chapel, Dorset Gardens, Brighton, on 9th February</hi>, 1863.) I have seen the prisoner several times since—I saw him last about two and a half years ago—I have been in Ireland since, but I saw him on an average monthly from 1863 to 1871, and had conversations with him about his wife, he wanted me to go and ask her to meet him, but I was afraid to do so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not find out that he was married till six months ago—this letter is in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and staled:</hi> "I am convinced that our marriage was illegal, although I know you considered you were perfectly free to marry again, therefore I have no ill feeling towards you.") He locked me in a room and made me write that—I said "Why do you wish me to write that letter"—he said "This woman is a very dangerous woman, and she may bring a charge against me for marrying her while I was drunk"—I do not know who the dangerous woman was—I also wrote "I shall never trouble you; trusting you will not interfere in case I think proper to marry again"—I say in the face of that letter that I did not know he was married—I have not seen him to speak to within the last six months, but I saw him twice in Oxford Street with the woman he was living with—I once wrote to him to meet me when I wanted to arrest him, but I did not write to him from time to time to meet me.</p>

I first knew for certain that he was married, last September, after I left Bath—I heard a rumour of it two years ago, but he said that it was a lie, and called me a fool, and said that the woman I spoke of was already married, a married woman who he had lived with, and that it was impossible for him to be married to her—I was satisfied with that; but about six months ago I saw his wife—I believe he has married somebody else, at Norwich, in 1875, since I left him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I told Mr. Webb that Mr. Dawson's daughter and family had come into 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. I was engaged to Mr. Dawson's daughter in 1849, and before our marriage he called me into his private room and said that he should divide his freehold property between his three daughters. Afterwards, in consequence of becoming security for over 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I became bankrupt, which caused my father-in-law to be very antagonistic to me, but I did not know that he had altered his will I admit saying that my family would have 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and so I expected. At the time I saw Wells I was manager of an association in Queen Victoria Street. I had formed various companies, such as the Inns of Court Hotel, Holborn, the Bedford Hotel, Brighton, and others, and it is my invariable practice when I meet with assistance from any gentleman, to present him with a piece of plate, and I required this plate for that purpose. I had invented a ship's screw, and went down to Birmingham to sell the patent, but was taken ill there, and prevented from doing so. I was also engaged in Dr. Hale's chlorate of potassium, a patent medicine, for which I was voted 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the expenses of the company, and though I admit being made bankrupt, I was in a position to pay 205. in the pound, and I never incurred a single debt without having the full intention of paying it, and I never defrauded a person of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my life. I totally deny having a female in my house, and defy Mr. Webb to prove it; it is the greatest lie ever stated.</p>

I am an able-bodied seaman—on 9th February, I came into port in the Packwan, and went to lodge at the prisoner's boarding-house, near the West India Docks—on 13th February, the prisoner took me in his cart with my shipmates to the Mercantile Marine Office, to be paid off—18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>?. was due to me, and I received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw Ashton paid at the same time—I got into the cart and went back to the boarding-house before dinner—a tailor named Much was there to whom I owed some money, and I paid him with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—there was no interchange of notes between me and my shipmates—I owed the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him the same 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I had received at the office, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that was for a pair of shoes—Ashton, Walker, and O'Neal were present, and I saw Walker give the prisoner a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this was just before dinner—the prisoner did not give me the change, and as we went down to dinner I said "Don't forget the change of that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note Mr. Robinson"—he made no answer—I asked him several times after dinner, and he said "No my boy, you are mistaken, you never gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at all"—I said "Yes, I did," but he denied it altogether—my shipmates told me to turn out my pockets to show him that I had not got the note—I told the prisoner that if he looked over his money he would find that he had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too much—he said "No, I shan't take the trouble, for you did not give me any"—I went out with Ashton, and in the evening I borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—from the prisoner—he said "Don't forget to pay me that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back"—I</p>

               <p>said "You pay me my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not sleep there that night, but I went there in the morning and asked the prisoner again for the note—he said that I did not give it to him, and he gave me a piece of paper with two numbers of notes, and said "Those are the two notes I have got, go to the shipping office and see if they are yours"—I have not got the paper, I showed it at the shipping office and received information of the number of my note, and as the prisoner had said that I might have given my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Much, I called on Much and showed him the paper—I then went with policeman 16 <hi rend="italic">HR</hi> to the prisoner's house, but he was not in, Ashton was with me all the time—I afterwards saw the prisoner again, and he said that I had not given it to him—I said "Well, I shall have to go home," that was to Hull—he said that I owed him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and refused to let me have my bag of clothes unless I paid it—I said "Let me have my bag, and I won't say anything about it"—he said "If you don't be off and say no more about that note I will give you in charge for defamation of character"—I went to Hull and met Davis and came back to London with him and attended before a Magistrate, and claimed my bag, and the prisoner was ordered into custody on a charge of stealing the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to him, owing him some money, and asked for my bag of clothes, and I said that I would not say anything about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> when he said he would not let me have them till I paid him, I threatened him about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I had no money when I was dis<lb/>charged—when I got to Hull I went to the Institution there, and made a complaint to Mr. Davis that the prisoner had stopped my bag of clothes, and asked him to write for them—I also mentioned the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the first day that I saw Mr. Davis—Mr. Davis afterwards told me that he had telegraphed to the prisoner and had written, but he did not tell me what he had written—I do not remember his saying that he had communicated with the prisoner, who refused to give my clothes up till I sent the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Hull—it was not after that that I mentioned about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Mr. Davis said that he wrote about that too—he is here—Ashton and I had one glass of drink when we came out of the shipping office—Walker and I were never together—I may have had a glass on the Sunday, but I was not drinking a good deal, nor on the Monday—I was not the worse for drink—it was about 1.30 when I gave the prisoner this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—that is the fact—I did not pay him more than that—I did not pay him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or anybody <hi rend="italic">else</hi>—I paid Much 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some odd pence—I had borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the prisoner, and he said that I owed him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not borrow 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of his wife; not after I <hi rend="italic">squared up</hi>—I paid his wife 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., of course it is down in the book—that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was down in the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was not my look-out if it was not—I must have paid that 55. to the man—I swear that I did—his wife had never lent me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never received any money from the wife—the account was in a book, not on a piece of paper—I did not see it—I did not borrow 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. twice—I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s:</hi> twice on the day I landed, and after the closing of the account I borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him—I believe I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him on Sunday after<lb/>noon, the 11th, but I cannot exactly swear it—I afterwards borrowed <hi rend="italic">Is</hi>. of him—I did not borrow three separate 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him on the 11th—I cannot swear that this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book, it is like it—all I borrowed of him on Sunday was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., not 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not ask him how the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was owing to him when I paid it to him, but it was for what money I borrowed and my board—I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for some boots,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187703050075"/>
               <p>and I never got the change—after dinner on the 13th I told a good many people that I had given the prisoner a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, not that I had lost one—did not say "I have lost a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, have you seen it, Mr. Robinson?" nor "Have you had it?"—he knew that he had it, for I gave it to him—Me did not say that the numbers on the paper he gave me were the notes that Much and Tucker had received, but of those he had—I do not know Tucker, an oilshop keeper—I never thought of giving the piece of paper to the people at the shipping office—I asked for the numbers of the notes I was paid off with—Walker was not with me after the note was lost—he went borne at night—he did not tell me that he had a note from Robinson which he had changed at Much, the tailor's—I told Robinson that if he would let me have my clothes I would not say anything about the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, because I had no money or friends in London—I did not tell him I had been to the shipping office and to the police—he never mentioned the a, he only mentioned the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I borrowed of him, and I said "You know I cannot pay you that, you have not given me the change out of my note"—I told you before that he said that I owed him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "I will not let you have the clothes till you have paid the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you borrowed of me paid the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you borrowed of the mistress"—I told the Magistrate that I paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is right, I have made a mistake to-day—I paid nobody in the house but Robinson and the tailor—I made a present of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a person out of the house, and I gave the girl Lizzie 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some coffee—I gave her 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I borrowed of the prisoner after I gave him the note, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I borrowed of my mate—when I borrowed the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him he said "Mind you pay me back"—I said "Yes, when you pay me my 9J. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I shall be able to"—that was not the same night, but the night after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I asked him for the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Tuesday night, and I wanted my clothes on Wednesday night—I had not paid him any money before I paid him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not go about with Walker at all, Ashton was my companion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a native of Germany—I have been ten years in Bermuda—I have lately come to London and reside with my wife at 4, Ladbroke Grove, Notting Hill—I became acquainted with the prisoner shortly before 11th November, he was then living at 4, Lime Grove, Shep<lb/>herd's Bush—he made a proposal to me with reference to the discount of bills of exchange—the first was a bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we were to go halves; we were each to provide half the discount and share the profit—I provided 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and afterwards got it back from him—on the evening of 14th November he was at ray house; my wife was present—he proposed to dis<lb/>count a bill of 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of one Horton; each of us were to pay half and get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each interest—I had not heard of the name of Frank Bouts at that time—on 15th November this letter was brought to me with an envelope and letter enclosed—to the best of my belief it is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a letter, signed Frank Bouts, asking for the money by</hi> 11 <hi rend="italic">o'clock; the prisoner in his letter requesting Mr. Sauer to forward by the bearer (the pri<lb/>soner's daughter</hi>) 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 55., <hi rend="italic">the half for the discount of the bill</hi>.) The letter enclosed a bill of exchange for 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 14th November, at two months, drawn by the prisoner on Mr. F. Bouts, wine merchant, Holloway, accepted by Frank Bouts, payable at the London and County Bank—in consequence of that I handed to Miss Trevelli 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—subsequent to that, whilst the bill was current I lent the prisoner 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he wrote and gave me this I 0 U—I also received from him these eight letters which, to the best of my belief, are his writing—I kept possession of the bill until two days before 17th January, when it was due, when I gave it to the prisoner in my wife's presence; he said he wanted to get it cashed—on the evening of the 17th he came and said that when he went into the City to call on the man for</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 25th January, and stated that his Idler to Scarborough had been returned, as Mrs. Bouts could not be found</hi>.) When the bill was returned to me the words "No orders, refer to acceptor" were on it—after that I employed Mr. York, my solicitor, and a summons was obtained at the Hammersmith police-court—I appeared there and my wife and I gave evidence; the prisoner was remanded from the 10th February to the 17th—on 15th February I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had made over his furniture to the witness, which he hoped thortly to redeem and pay all that fie owed</hi>.) I did not take possession of the furniture, but in consequence, of that I attended before Mr. Bridge on 17th February and refused to be bound over, and my wife also, and we were locked up—I afterwards consented, and was liberated.</p>

I belong to the schooner Topsy lying in Harrison's Wharf—on 8th February, about 12.10 p.m. I was in company with the prisoners—we had just come out of the Old George, and Nayler put her foot out and I fell over it—I then felt her take my money 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was loose in my trowsers pocket, most of it in silver—I told her that she had my money—she said she had not—Leary came up and I saw them part my money between them—I gave the three in charge, and going along Slater took some money out of Leary's hand as the policeman was dragging her along, and Slater dropped half a crown and a florin—Slater said "That is all the money I have got, say no more about it."</p>

I had charge of the prosecution of the prisoner Cohen, at the Worship Street police court, when he was charged with receiving a piano—on the 4th November I went to 4, Minories, which had the appearance of a boot and shoe shop—Cohen was then in custody—I saw a man minding the warehouse I searched the premises and found some bicycles, steam gauges, musical instruments, saddlery, gimlets, cash boxes, frying pans, tin ware, copying presses, gum brushes, an anvil, sewing machines, four sets of harness, three pianos, and some augurs—one piano was at the back, packed in a case, which I opened and found some steam gauges and an invoice, with a list of the contents—I afterwards went to the premises with other officers, named Dedicoat, Finnis, Thompson, and Cliff, some of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187703050082"/>
               <p>the goods were afterwards removed by their owners, and some by the police—on the 8th I saw Cohen there, who was then on bail—his daughter said "This is an inspector"—he turned and asked me my business—I said I had come to take the invoices and the goods—he said "You will take nothing away. Mr. Besley ad vises that you have acted illegally in taking the pianos away, and if I had been there I should not have allowed it"—Francis' name was not then mentioned in Cohen's presence—on seeing the daughter on a former occasion, I said I would withdraw the men if she would produce the invoices for goods purchased, and she did so—on November 10th I went to 18, John Street, Minories; the name, "J. W." Francis&amp; Co." was on the door—there was an outer and an inner office—on searching I found some iron and copper ware and some papers, which are not evidence—I afterwards went to 12, Wells Street, Cripplegate, and saw the woman Trayford through the wicket in the office; her head only was visible—I asked if Gardner was in—she said "No," and enquired my business—I told her I was sent there by a person upon an account, and "I suppose he has a warehouse here"—she said "Yes"—the name Gardner was on a zinc plate on the outer door, and the word "Factory" on another door—on the 15th I went again with constable Thomas and saw Trayford, who said Gardner was not in, but would be shortly; he had not been there that morning—I watched the premises till 12 o'clock, and then left constable Waller and another officer there and went away—when I came back Gardner was detained by Waller—Waller said to Gardner "Here's the Inspector," and we went in the office—while there, Gardner said "What is it all about, come with me this way" and he took me into a little office—I told him he was charged with conspiring with Francis, to obtain goods; he said "Francis has money to pay for all the goods he has; he has 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>'—I asked how long he had known Francis—he said two years or more—said "Are you sure?"—he said "Let me see, I won't be certain"—he crossed the room, took up a book and appeared to refer to it, and said "I think it will be about fifteen months"—I afterwards examined the book and found all the leaves had been torn out—he was then taken to the station and charged—I went again, Trayford was still there, having been left with other officers—Laurie came in, and said "Good evening," and asked if Gardner was at home—Trayford said "No"—he asked if Gardner was expected that evening—she said she did not know—Laurie then said he would sit down and wait—three other officers were present, Holt, Waller and Thomas—after a while I said to Laurie "What is your business with Mr. Gardner?"—he said "Oh, nothing, I have just called to see him as a friend"—I said "Then you are in the habit of calling on him"—he said "I was here last night and we had a glass together"—I told him we were officers, and should require him to account for his presence on the premises—he said "I will satisfy you very soon," and he took from his pocket a number of memoranda—he said "I am a commission agent and travel for Crowther&amp; Son, soap boilers"—I examined the memo<lb/>randa, they were addressed to him by Crowther&amp; Son, one was a complaint of the customers Laurie was introducing to them—it was getting dark and we obtained a candle; I was sitting opposite Laurie who dropped a piece of paper from his pocket-book, which he held in his hand; I asked him what he was doing—he said "Ob, nothing, it is a piece of paper I picked up from the ground"—I took it from him, Laurie said "It is only an advertisement</p>

               <p>relating to starch"—afterwards he said he had not seen Gardiner for some<lb/>time, and it was only lately he had discovered where he was—I said "Then you knew him at Commercial Street?"—he said "Yes"—I said "He was trading as Anderson then"—he said "Yes, but people trade under all manner of names"—I asked him if "he knew Francis?"—he said yes, he gave him an order for soap, but knowing what kind of a man he was, he did not deal with him—I told him that he would be taken into custody and charged with conspiring with Gardiner—I have the pocket-book, Francis' name appears in it—Laurie said he had been in business with a man named Wood, but the partnership was dissolved, and he had now no fixed place of business—when I mentioned the charge, Laurie said "I think you are rather premature," and Trayford said "John, a' rent you sorry you came in"—Laurie made no reply; I then told Trayford that she likewise would be taken into custody on the same charge—one of them, I think Trayford, gave me the address 6, New Street, City Road, and I found the keys of that address in a bag which Trayford had at Gardiner's house—I went there on the following day, and found a number of papers relating to Gardiner's transactions, some in the name of Wright, some Anderson, and some Gar<lb/>diner—I have given up the papers to Mr. Wontner, among them was an invoice for brandy delivered by Storey&amp; Co., at Well Street—a label was pasted on the door accounting for Gardiner's absence—at New Street, I found these documents marked "Bo" and "Bp," they relate to the brandy from Storey&amp; Co., 46, East Cheap, agents for a company in Paris, to James Anderson &amp;Co., 73, Commercial Street, one amounting to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the other has the same heading, and amounts to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at John Street, I found Br and Bs, By, and Bz, the two last with the name of Johnson on them and addressed to Francis—I also found at New Street Ca, Cb, and Cc, they relate to starch, "Cd" is the paper Laurie dropped—on 6th December, I went with Waller to Capland Street, Lisson Grove, the house occupied by the prisoner Parker—nobody resided on the premises and the key was left at the landlord's house opposite—the name Parker&amp; Son was painted over the door, the windows were browned 3 feet high, and above the colour a few bandboxes and caps were visible—there was no appearance of business being done—I went there first on the 5th, and watched from 3.30 till 8 o'clock, the shop was closed all that time—next day about 6 o'clock, Parker entered by a side door, re<lb/>mained about a minute and then left with a bandbox, Waller watched at one end of the street and I the other—afterwards Waller came up with Parker and said This is Parker"—Parker denied at first, but he now admits that he is the man—he opened the door and we went in—I showed Parker the paper marked Bn, which is a memo<lb/>randum headed "James Parker and Sons, wholesale and retail hatters," at the end there is "Please note removal from 3, Capland Street, Lisson Grove, established 1859;" it is addressed to Messrs. Barman and Son, Huntingdon, and states that Messrs. Francis and Co. were customers of theirs, and they considered them safe for a reasonable amount, their account with them being 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and they had always found them prompt in payment—it also stated "We are making up our Christmas stock of son-westers and water-proofs, and shall be glad to receive samples of same"—I showed him this document and he said "Yes that is my writing, Francis and I had some dealings, and I gave him that reference"—I then produced the printed paper marked Bn, which is a memorandum from Buxton, Abbott, and Co., mer<lb/>chants</p>

In reply, we have to say Messrs. Francis and Co. have for some time done business with us satisfactorily, having always been prompt in keeping faith, and we do not hesitate in saying you are safe in doing business with them, certainly to the extent you name. Yours faithfully, Buxton, Abbott, and Co."—Parker said "That is my writing, but I wrote it as the clerk of Buxton and Co.—I then searched the premises and found a number of crates with paper outside so as to make them appear to be packed full, but they were empty—I also found a large number of empty hat boxes and about three dozen hats—Parker was taken to the station and charged—he refused his address, stating he did not wish to compromise his son—on December 15th I went with Detective Holt to 16, Water Lane, Eastcheap—there were several offices, and on the third floor the name Jackson and Co. was painted on the glass on the door of an office—I entered and saw Jackson—I said "Are you Jackson?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You obtained some soap from from Messrs. Crowther and Sons"—he said "Yes," they have put in an execution and that is all done with"—I said "You are reference for Buxton, Abbott, and Co."—he said "No, I know people who have used my name, but without my authority," and that he never gave them a reference—I told him he would be taken into custody and charged with conspiring to obtain soap—he said "Very well"—I then examined the papers lying about—a man named Mootham then came in and said "Good morning" to Jackson, and sat down—I asked him his business with Jackson—he said he merely called as a friend—I said "Then we can dispense with you"—he stood up and was about to leave when Jackson said "There is a letter-book of yours there, you may as well take it with you," and produced this book—I said I should search it, and did so—it is a letter-book of Mellor, Green, and Co., and I found some papers relating to trans-actions with that firm—I asked Mootham if he belonged to that firm—he said "No, and there is nothing in the office belonging to me but a shirt, that is not my book"—Jackson then said "I want him to take it to a friend to whom it belongs"—I took Mootham into custody—Batson then came in and said "Good morning" to Jackson and walked into the office—I asked him his name and business—he said "Batson; I sometimes sell goods for Jackson on commission"—I said "Do you know Taylor, a shirt dresser, Old Street Road 1"—he said "Yes,"—I said "Do you trade as Batson and Co, Iron Bridge Wharf, and Buxton, Abbott, and Co., Hop Exchange"—he said "No"—I then showed him some letter paper, headed Mellor, Green and Co., and' asked if he knew them—he said "No"—I said I felt satisfied he was Buxton, and took him into custody for conspiring with Francis to obtain goods from Pinson and Evans, of Wolverhampton—I do not remember whether he replied—I left Holt in charge and went away for assistance—on returning I noticed some torn up papers in the grate, and Batson was standing with his back to the fire—I said "You have been tearing up these papers while I was away"—he said "No, I have not"—I then examined his books and found some paper correspondiug with the pieces—this marked Dg is from Oliver Lodge to Jackson and Co., asking for the address of Francis and Co., formerly of 18, John Street, Minories—Dq is addressed to Francis&amp; Co., asking for the payment of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also found the papers marked Dr to Dz; Dx and Dy are pawn tickets, I one in the name of Mellor, Green, and Co., and the other of John Oates—</p>

               <p>Dx is pledged with John Eltham, Bishopsgate Street, and Dy with John A. Russell, Fore Street—Dz is a writ against Jackson by one Carver—I also found Ea to Ef 5; two are pass-books, one of Jackson and Co. with the Aldgate Branch of the City Bank, in which appear the names of Batson, and Mootham, the other was that of R. Jackson, with the London Provident I Bank, and contained the names of Laurie, Hudson, Jackson, Prendergast—I I know Parker's handwriting—Eq is in the same hand—Dw is a printed label from W. Chapel's Botany Works, Botany House, Ashton-under-Lyne—I on the evening of the day Jackson was apprehended I went to Bow Lane I police-station with Butters, the office-keeper of Gracechurch Street, and saw Jackson and Batson in the cells—Butters identified Jackson as the man who I had taken offices as J. D. Mellor, and Batson as the man who called himself Green—Jackson said nothing—Batson said "Mind, I did not tell you that I I did not know them," meaning Mellor, Green and Co., "but that I had no I business with them"—I said "You denied all knowledge of them"—in consequence of something I found amongst the papers at Water Lane, I went to Ord's house in 2, Queen Elizabeth Street, Tooley Street, on the 22nd December—I saw a woman—I asked if Mr. Ord was at home—the woman said "No," and enquired my business—I asked if Ord would be in during the day—she said he might be; and I said I would call again, and I went I again with Waller—Waller called, and I waited near, and in consequence of what he said when he returned I went to the house with Waller and Holt—I saw the prisoner Moore—I passed into the work-room, and asked, in Moore's presence, if Ord was in; the woman said "No"—I said I would I call in the morning—I asked Moore if he was Ord—he said "No; my name is Moore"—I said "Are you connected with the business?"—he said "No"—I asked him his business there, and his address—he said he lived at Shakespeare House, Forest Hill, and that he had merely stopped there the night previously, and that he had been minding the house in the place of Mrs. Ord—I said we would go to his house—he said "Nobody lives there now, the place is closed"—I asked him again if he was connected with Ord—he said "I sometimes assist him in his business"—the woman then said "What is your business with Mr. Ord?" and, pointing to the doer, "No admittance is marked on the door, and you have no business to be here"—I said "I have called on behalf of a man named Lodge, who sold goods to a man named Francis in the Minories. Mr. Ord was reference for Francis, and as Mr. Lodge had received no payment he looks to Mr. Ord for payment"—she said "Could not Mr. Lodge have written?"—I said "He has done so already"—she said "Well Mr. Ord is not here"—I then said "We will wait till he does come"—the prisoner Ord then came down-stairs and said "What is all this about? come with me, and let us not have any bother about it," and he took me into his office—Moore went in also—I said "You gave a reference to a man named Francis, by means of which he obtained goods from Oliver Lodge"—he said "Yes, I think I did, Francis had some business with me, and he now is indebted to me to the amount of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You are also a reference for obtaining goods from McDonald and Co., of Birmingham"—he said "I do not remember that I was"—I then shewed him the reference in favour of A. R. Welham, and asked him if it was in his handwriting—he said "No"—I then said "Is it Moore's, the name resembles his?"—he considered for a time, and then said "1 don't think it is"—I then handed it to Moore, and said "Is it yours?"—Moore looked at it a short time and said "No; it is not"—I then told</p>

               <p>Ord that he would be apprehended on the charge of conspiring with Francis to obtain goods from Oliver Lodge, and also from McDonald—I then pro<lb/>ceeded to examine the papers, and found some envelopes addressed to W. Moore, 17, Wells Street; I also found the day-book produced, which is lettered Hg, and shows transactions between Holmes and Co. and Francis and Co. with Ord—I also found on Moore the list of articles marked Ho and Ho 1 to 3, which consists of pieces of paper—I know Fenn, the carrier—he employs four men, named Driscoll, O'Brian, Relton, and Robinson—in consequence of what I heard from one of them, I went, on 6th of January, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, to 9 and 10, Wellington Road, Holloway—one is a private house, and the other is an office and a warehouse—I entered the premises and saw a man who said he was Burden—I asked him if he knew Francis, who had an office in the Minories—he said "Yes, he was introduced to me by a friend of mine, a respectable man"—I said. "What is your friend's name?"—he said "Gentles; he was at one time in my employment as traveller"—I said "Do you know where "he can be found now?"—he said "No, I have not seen him for some time"—I said "You had some trans<lb/>actions with Francis?"—he said "Yes, I bought some borax"—I said "Anything else?"—he said "No, nothing that I can remember now"—I said "Perhaps if you refer to your books you will be able to see"—he said "I have no entry of anything I purchased from him"—afterwards he said "Let me see, Francis told me that he was removing from his premises in John Street, and he wanted to leave some goods somewhere till he could find another place; he left them with me and I afterwards lent him 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them"—on asking what they were, he said some shovels and some things in cases that he had not opened and which were over his stables—I asked him if he had any document showing that transaction, and he said he did not think he had or that he could not find it, I am not positive which—I then said "I know a number of goods have been delivered to you, have not you got any receipts and papers relating to them?"—he searched his desk and handed me the paper Ja—it is all manuscript and says "18, John Street, Minories, City. Messrs. Burden and Son. Received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of goods delivered"—then there is a list—I took up one of his printed memoranda which was lying on the desk; it is this: "J. W. Burden and Son, dealers and oilmen, 9 and 10, Wellington Street, Holloway"—having seen bicycles mentioned in the list spoken to I said "Surely bicycles do not come under grocer's sundries"—he said "I would buy anything"—at my request he then produced the two other invoices marked Ja 2 and Ja 3, and two others were found further down on the file—they all relate to purchases from Francis and Gentles—I then asked if he had the goods in his possession which were doposited on the loan—he said "I have sold the bicycles"—he had made no entry of the sale and could not give the name of the buyer, but he thought his name was Meyer—he said Francis told him if he did not get the money he might sell some of the goods—I said "You have seen the account about Francis in the papers; how is it you did not let the police know these goods were in your possession?"—he said yes, but he did not think it was any part of his business—he said he did not know where Francis or Gentles was—I found the pass-book produced at Burden's. (<hi rend="italic">This contained an entry on</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st November, "Francis</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>") I pointed out the date of the entry and reminded Burden that a report of Francis'</p>

               <p>case appeared a week before—I also noticed more than a dozen taps on the mantel-piece marked DMD, and asked him about them—he said "I think I bought them of Gentles"—I then went to the stables in Victoria Street, and found under a quantity of hay, forty-eight bundles of coal shovels, and six cases, five of them being closed and one partly open—I afterwards found them to contain waterproof composition—on seeing the boxes at first I remarked to Holt in the prisoner Warren's presence "Perhaps some of old Jones' composition is here," and Burden said none was there—there were cards on the boxes and I asked to look at one, and I did look—"Yes," he said, "Francis advertised this composition in the 'Grocer'"—I said "I thought you told me you did not know the contents of the cases'?"—I do not remember his reply—I went to some other stables and found several gross of brass screws in opened packages and four gross of toy pails, and in a case not then opened I found a patent screw making machine with the name "J. Shine," and an address in Paris on it—Mr. Shine had previously written to me that he had lost one—the invoice Ja relates to the toy pails—I had previously remarked it was strange he should lend money on cases if he did not know the contents, and he replied "I thought there was enough for my money in them"—at the office of Buxton, Abbott, and Co. I found several cards—one has on it "E. Kemp and Co., 3, Adelaide Place, London Bridge," another "Jackson and Co., Holloway Road," another "Frederick Ransom, of Ransom's Bank," and others—Mr. Shine identified his screw machine in my presence, and Mr. Jones, of Gloucester, has identified his composition.</p>

I am the daughter of the prisoner Cohen—I have kept his books for some time—I also drew cheques, but he signed them—I recollect the detectives coming, the first occasion was on the 3rd November, when Waller called, and said he came from Mr. Cohen, and I was to shew him the pianos, packed ready for shipment—my father was then in custody—I shewed him the pianos; they were outside the office door—one was open, one was packed ready for shipment to Australia, where my married sister lives; she has been married three years—my brother-in-law is an outfitter there—my father has been in the habit of shipping goods to him of every description, such as iron ware, jewellery, pianos, harness, brushes, sewing machines, &amp;c.—goods are frequently packed in piano cases, and a list is put with them—after Waller had gone, Detective Banks came and examined the book for some hours; he made extracts—there are entries to Francis and Co.; we have bought goods of him—on the 4th, O'Callaghan and four or five other detectives came—O'Callaghan asked for invoices of goods bought out of our line; my father deals largely In leather—I told our servant Christopher Ebrecht, to bring the invoices, and he handed each lot of goods as the inspector asked me when they came in, and I told him—I shewed him all those produced on that occasion, and O'Callaghan traced them in the books—they also examined all the shelves; they were re about three hours—they left a constable in possession on the night of 3rd—I first saw Francis come to our warehouse in September, he pre<lb/>sented a card, and said he was a shipper—coy father was present—he said bad heard my father was a shipper, and father said he was—then he he had some goods to sell, which he thought it would be worth father's le to buy—my father said he would buy them if suitable—I did not w then that Francis had ever been convicted; he looked like a gentle<lb/>man—the entry of the 1st of September related to sewing machines, for much I drew a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in favour of Mr. Francis, on his bank, took a receipt from him—there is an invoice for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 29th</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright at Hannibal Road, Stepney—I have been there five years, and have known Cohen between five and six years—I remember his speaking to me about bicycles some time in the autumn of last year—he told me he had got one for a sample in his place, would I come and value them?—there were three of them—then he called for me, and brought me up in his cart—there was one in a case—he asked me the value, and said the other two were like them—I told him that, considering the bad season was coming on, the three were not worth more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should not like to give more than that for them—according to my judgment that was a fair price for them, considering the time of year, and that he had to get rid of them as best he could—he asked me if I thought they would do in Australia—I told him I thought they would—I know he has</p>

               <p>for some time been shipping goods to Australia—I knew a man named Aarons, he lived opposite my gateway for about twelve months—I recollect Cohen coming to me about harness—he asked me if I knew anybody likely to buy it—I suggested Aarons—he never tried to sell it to me—that was some time in September I think—I had not heard of the trial of Aarons, Francis, and Solomons, or that Aarons had been convicted.</p>

I am an auctioneer, and have been in business eighteen years—I have known Cohen longer than that, and have had dealings with Mm in miscellaneous articles, principally boots and shoes and leather—we have a variety of articles for sale—he has bought large quantities of goods at our sales and privately, between 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, for the last six or seven years—since I have known him his character has always been that of a respectable man—he frequently owed us 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sometimes 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but always paid his accounts regularly.</p>

I am the wife of Jules Gautier, and live at 62, Cannon Row—on 1st November last, I advertised, in the "Daily Tele<lb/>graph," a piano for sale, made by Collard &amp; Co.—between 1 and 2 o'clock on that day a gentleman called, and my husband went to the door—the gentleman asked to see the piano, and my husband said "Will you attend to this gentleman for me"—I went into the warehouse and shewed him the piano—he said "That won't suit me"—he looked over the stock and elected one of our own make—the price was 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I ultimately accepted 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he tried the piano and as a friend of mine called who is a nice player he tried it—the gentleman said that he had bought many in his time—he aid he was in the provision line, and he would send for it—I asked him whether he would leave a deposit—he said "No, there is no occasion, I will send for it about 3 o'clock with a cheque"—I asked for his card—he said that he had none, I gave him a pen and ink, and he wrote "Harris, 47, london Wall"—just before 4 o'clock a cart came with "Harris and Co." on it in large letters—a man and a lad came in and handed me an envelope with this cheque inside for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am the son of Mr. and Mrs. Gautier, pianoforte makers, and am seventeen years old—I was at dinner on this day, and came and saw Harris bargaining with my mother—I was there again about 4 lock and helped to put the piano in the van—two men came for it and there was a third on the bridge who was looking over towards our house very suspiciously, in a manner which attracted my attention—the two men went away with the van, and the third was at the bottom of Great College street—I followed the van as far as the College Arms, it stopped there, the two men went inside, and four men came out' one of whom was the one I saw on the bridge, and another was the one who purchased the piano—they all four got into the van and went through Pancras Road, Pentonville and, Old Street, Hackney Road, Lomax Street, and down Bethnal Green Road, I went into the Devonshire Arms public-house in Devonshire Street—I remained outside—they all four came out, got into the van and drove back</p>

               <p>one wanted to go one way and one another—one said "Straight on," and they both kept on the same way—I followed them, overtook them, and said to Harris "You are the man who bought a piano in Camden Road yesterday"—he said "No, I am not"—I said "Oh, yes, you are"—he said "Oh, no, my boy, you are mistaken"—I said "No, I am not"—he said "I have got no time to speak to you," and away he went—I did not then know whether the cheque was good or not, so I took no steps to stop them—I was afraid that the piano would be removed, so I went back and remained till the police removed it in the evening—I am quite certain that the man who came up to the door and nudged the other man was Harris.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—on 2nd November, a little before 8 o'clock, I was passing his house on my own business, and saw him in communication with the man who turns out to be Mr. Gautier, and a boy—I heard my brother say "Mr. Gautier, if you don't take that piano out of the place I shall put it on the sideboard, and I shall go to the police first"—my brother went to the police-station, and they referred us to Arbour Square, where he made a communication to the police, and the inspector gave directions to send a detective to my brother's house—we then went back, but the man had not been, and we went to Charrington's brewery, at the corner of St. Peter's and Mile End Roads—that is five minutes' walk from my brother's house, where a person who said he was a detective sent from Arbour Square, tapped my brother on the shoulder and asked him about it—from the time we left Arbour Square to the time he was tapped on the shoulder, my brother did not speak to anyone else, except going in to a man named Abrahams, and then we went together to the Minories.</p>

I will assist your father all I can in making enquiries who brought it here"—Cohen also said "Have you seen the men?" and young Gautier said "Yes, I saw them both this morning at our house"—he said "Why did not you stop them? why did not you catch hold of them and give them in custody?"—he said "How could I old two men?"—Cohen said "Why did not you hold one of them?"—he said "I could not,"—another constable, named Dorset, was present and heard the conversation.</p>

I am an accountant of 52, Victoria Street—I was appointed receiver in Holmes' liquidation, and on 19th November I went to Shakespeare House, Forest Hill, and found Holmes and Moore there—I showed my appointment, which was dated 17th, and claimed to take possession—Holmes said that what was on the premises did not belong to him, as he had sold everything to Moore, who was called forward, and produced an agreement purporting to sell the stock-in-trade—I told them I was not satisfied and should remain in possession, and that Moore must substantiate his claim—Holmes said I should not remain, I insisted, he threatened me with two knives; I stepped back to the front door, or I believe I should have been stabbed—I was turned out—I left a man to watch the premises, but I never went there after—there was a meeting on 2nd December of persons he owed money to, and he filed this list of creditors. (<hi rend="italic">Among these' were Mr. Ord, of</hi> 9, <hi rend="italic">Queen Elizabeth Street, and Mr. Wauthier, of 152, Upper Thames Street</hi>.) These documents produced were found at Shakespeare House by a man I left there. (<hi rend="italic">These were a letter from Wauthier to Moore and Holmes, enclosing two letters, one of which was from Moore to Holmes, which stated:</hi> "We gave you a first-class reference.") This letter, Hr 23 is in in Holme's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "You can apply to J. Ord and Co., whitelead and colour merchants, of (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>) and Mr. Wauthier, of 152, (<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>) who will, no doubt, satisfy you as to our respectability, We bank at the London and Provincial Bank, Limited.") In the first statement the debts are about 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in the second, they are, I think, 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the assets I have realised on the stock-in-trade are 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a few shillings, and the furniture 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

The debtors appointed me receiver, and Mr. Ord and one of the creditors, I think Mr. Duncan, Holmes' solicitor, signed for the appointment, and this is a memorandum signed by creditors requesting that I should be appointed—a Mr. Baker introduced the business to me; I did not allow him a commission, he came to my office with Holmes and one of them asked me to accept it; Baker was showing Holmes how to file his petition—he did not say that Holmes had offered him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pass him through—Baker and I did nut appoint ourselves—I never saw or heard of a petition filed by Ord against Holmes, or a counter affidavit denying the statements made by Holmes, and I have constant access to the proceedings—Holmes riled a petition in liquidation which he had to sign, I never put my name on it—I have not got possession of all Holmes' books, papers, and invoices; I had some books, but they gave me no assistance—I did not find that he had bought goods for cash and paid cash for them; I have not had the opportunity of knowing—when he was questioned before the comis<lb/>sioners he said he had fallen into difficulties in consequence of his wife and children being ill—there is no ill-feeling between us, I never quarrelled with him—he said that he took 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fur his business from Moore, because Moore had offered to give him a larger price than other persons, and he handed to the chairman on request, two bills for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found some small benzoline</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper at 152, Upper Thames Street—on 1st July a man named Wauthier came and took one room in the basement—he represented himself as a manufacturer of fancy brushes—I gave him notice, and he left a few days after Christmas without paying the rent—I do not consider that any business was carried on there—it was a blind to deceive people, I consider—I could find, him somewhere at Peckham Rye—he referred to some one in the Hop Exchange; Buxton, Abbott, and Co., I believe, was the name, and to some one in the Minories—I cannot remember whether it was Jackson or Francis—when he had been there a week or ten days I found a piece of paper on the floor which gave me a suspicion, and I found out that he had been turned out of another place because he had not paid his rent—I have often seen Moore there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. It was immediately after seeing Moore and the woman together, on my third call, that I saw Ord—the reference to Welham I got from Mr. Ledger—I have never seen Ord write—I did not notice any name on the premises—I am aware that a Mr. Clift, a respectable sadler, in Birmingham, gave a reference for Francis and Co.—it was the habit of Francis and Co. to pay a certain sum on account of goods ordered—that was the mode of operation, to acquire confidence; that was why Mr. Clift gave the reference, he afterwards withdrew it—Ord told me that he had had business transactions with Francis and Co. for some time past as evidenced by his books, and that they were then indebted to him—I found these papers in the office, some on files and some lying about—I did not find any on Ord's person that I remember—there are none in Ord's handwriting except the references—he made no objection to the inspection of his books—there were some barrels in the shop—I don't know what they contained.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WYLD</hi>. When I showed Parker the paper marked Br, he said "I wrote that as the clerk of Buxton, Abbott, and Co."—he said that as he went to the station, not in his house—I only found hats there, not coal; the name of "Parker and Sons, hatters," was over the door—there was a case of whiskey that had not been paid for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POCOCK</hi>. I found four documents on Batson relating to his connection with Hudson, they are from a firm of accountants, as to a meeting of creditors, and a statement of Hudson's affairs—there was also a blank acceptance of Hudson and Co.—I have not found anything that I believe to be in Batson's handwriting, but I don't know his writing—he gave his address, Argyll Street; I went there and found he lived there occasionally—these letters were addressed there—he either said he knew nothing of Mellor, Green, and Co., or had no connection with them—he did not mention Jackson's name—Butters described Batson before he went to Bow Lane, and when he saw him he identified him as Green—Prendergast was not the man I thought was Mills, Mills was discharged—I have not got here to-day the pieces of blue paper found on Batson; I produced them the first day, there was some writing on them, I could not see what it was—I don't think there was a fire in the grate—I found 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Batson.</p>

Mootham told me he had acted as—clerk to Jackson for a fortnight, and before that he had known him some time—I apprehended him on the 15th—he gave his correct name and address, he said he had called in to see Jackson as a friend, I understood—I will not swear that he used the word friend; what I understood was that he had not called on business—this book, containing entries of Mellor, Green, and Co., was under what appeared to be a desk—it was quite possible or a person to be in the office and not see it; I did not see it till my attention was called to it—I think the writing in it is Jackson's—I have not seen Mootham write—he said he knew nothing about the book—jackson said it belonged to a friend, and he wanted Mootham to take it to him—Moothan said he bad nothing in the office belonging to him except a shirt—I arrested him without a warrant, I told him it was on a charge of conspiracy—I only found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—on Jackson I found 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the address Tower Street on one of the cards found on Mootham was written by me—he told me that he had carried on business there some time before as Mootham and Co.—the signature "John Mootham," on the paper Dn, I do not think is his—I found a sampling card on him granted by the Broker's association—I have not produced it, I did not think it material—I have not made any inquiries that will enable me to say that he has been employed several respectable firms in legitimate business—I have no previous knowledge of anything against him—I searched his lodgings and found a few cards of Law Brothers—he has been in prison three months.</p>

In the beginning of December I went with O'Callaghan to Catherine Street, Lisson Grove—I had been there the night previous and seen Parker go into the side entrance of his shop—I waited till he came out with a hat-box in his hand—he went into a public-house, and I left him there—next morning I was there again, watching—he came to the corner of Catherine Street, looked towards where O'Callaghan was standing, came away again, went to the other corner, looked again, and came away again—I then spoke to him, and said "Mr. Parker, I believe?"—he said "No, that is not my name, "&amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Repeating his former evidence</hi>.) On 16th December, I went to 2, Jackson Road, Hot loway, and apprehended a person named Mills, who was carrying on business there in the name of J.

I accompanied O'Callaghan to Jackson's premises in Water Lane on 15th December—the account he has given is correct—I brought Law up yesterday from South Shields—he was searched by Inspector Pattison, who handed me these memoranda—two of them are cards of "Law Brothers, Coal Merchants and Factors, Acorn.

Jackson paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and as 1 could not supply him with the coal I then returned the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back; I believe him to be an honest man"—he also said "I knew Mootham; he used to fetch my letters from 110, Cannon Street, and forward those letters on to Portsmouth, he was not allowed to open them"—I told him that he was in custody—he said "I am very sorry for he is a nice young man and well connected"—I spoke about the names of the others who were in custody, but he said he knew none of the others only Jackson and Mootham—I found on him this letter addressed Mr. G.

               <p>to work all my life for it"—the week after that I saw him, having a paper in my hand with an account of the deficiencies—I said that since I saw him before I had, been investigating the accounts and I had discovered where some of the deficiencies had gone to—he said "Where is it?"—I! said "It Is in Toogood's account," and I enumerated the different items, and as I read each he said "Yes," and seemed to assent, except on some items, to which he took exception, and I found that those items were in<lb/>correct—he assented to those two items, 371<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which were included in the list—I asked him for an explanation—he said "Well, I have had the money, but as there is a God in Heaven, I do not know what I have done with it," and he said that he would pay it—I said "Will you do so at once?"—he said "No, but I will repay it"—he was given in custody—on the way to the station he said "Do you remember the remark I made, that if you found out anything I would make it right?"—I said "Yes"—he said "If you will not go on with the prosecution I will pay you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum till it is all paid back. I can work and you know that I can work, and I will show you a statement showing that I can repay it"—I said "How can you possibly repay us the amount you have taken, 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the least"—he said "I don't care if it is six, I will pay you if you do not prosecute, but if you do you will not get anything."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He entered the service in 1868 I think, as traveller, and was made manager in 1871—he occasionally had to travel in the country and abroad—about twenty-five persons altogether were employed at the London branch—the firm is composed of Mr. Edwin Butterworth and myself—about 1873 and 1874 we purposed to shut up the London business for eighteen months, owing to the loss on which we were trading in London, and a board was actually prepared, saying that the premises we to let—I do not know whether it was put up—we did not instruct the prisoner to buy nothing during that time, we probably told him to sell only that which he had in stock—this is our original letter of 24th July, 1873. (this <hi rend="italic">was addressed to the "prisoner, stating that there was a deficiency</hi> of 2,670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that until the matter was unravelled he was not to buy anything</hi>.) I took no stock between then and June, 1876—there are great losses of goods of this description if kept long, and the turn over is, on an average 40 tons a week—there is a loss owing to what is called waste, but not a great loss—our instructions to the prisoner were to enter the goods at the weights invoiced—short weight would be debited in another book, or else he entered the net weight—the fair average loss on high grain rags is 1 1/2 per cent., and on low grain rags, probably 3 per cent.—that is the loss on the premises—rags shipped from abroad sometimes vary in weight, and sometimes they come out exact—a quantity of rubbish is found among rags, so valueless that it is not worth carting away—the prisoner gave us fourteen days notice to leave—I had not heard before I came to London that he was going into partnership with Mr. Carrington, a rag merchant, but I heard it subsequently—he left on 14th December, saying that he would return on the 16'th, which he did, and he was written to to come to the office on the 21st—he suggested that his brother-in-law should go through the accounts see if anything was owing between him and us, and if so he said that would work all his life to pay us, and would pay us 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was not 200 per cent.—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about discounting two drafts, refers to bills of exchange—I have never seen cheques sent to Manchester,</p>

               <p>bearing on them "Central Bank of London," as being the bank they had passed through—our bankers in Manchester keep our cancelled cheques we never see them—Smith Paynes are the London agents of our Manchester bank—the prisoner would take any open cheque to the bank on which it is drawn, and they would pay it—we deduct for waste every six months in the balancing—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) shows it. (<hi rend="italic">This contained an entry</hi> "Loss in weight 41 tons; cash, 318<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., January 1st, 1876.") The stock taking is in the prisoner's writing—the deduction for waste is in my writing—I was not present when the stock was taken, but I came up a few days afterwards—bills of exchange were sent to the prisoner, with instructions to send them to certain discount houses and pay the proceeds to our bankers—they amounted to 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not at one time.</p>

Mr. Ashford was employed by our firm in London—the idea of closing the London branch had been abandoned in 1874—I am able to say from his writing in the books, and from the letter we had from the prisoner, that he was in London when he received these two cheques—it was his duty, if Toogood corrected the weights, to make entries of it in the books—this notice to produce was sent to me from London to Manchester last Friday, but I had left before it arrived—the cheques for the last eight years are not in our custody—the prisoner would get private letters from us in 1874, 1875, and 1876—there are no letters that I know of from us to Mankey in London subsequently to August, 1863, about closing the London branch—the deficiency in weight excludes the 40 tons of waste—he gires credit for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one is the result in weight, and the other in money—at the time he proposed that his brother-in-law should go into the accounts, we had not got these documents from Toogood.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Great Suffolk Street, Borough—I have been a rag merchant on a smaller scale than the prosecutors for fourteen years—I have had transactions with them, through the prisoner, and have received cheques from him in reference to goods supplied to Butterworth—he paid me with his own cheques on the Central Bank of London, which I have presented and they have been paid—I have also had cheques from Manchester—I have once or twice paid cheques to Butterworth for goods purchased of them, and I have no doubt I paid them to Mankey—this legun in the beginning of 1874, and ended about March, 1876—I have mown Mankey about nine years, and always looked upon him as very lonest and straightforward, it was my intention to go into partnership with imon January 1st, this year, and the negotiations had commenced—I bold have no objection to carry it through from this time—I have had fourteen years' experience in weighing rags—I think I have kept some three ears—I kept 30 tons for three months, and the bags lost weight from 7 lbs. 16 lbs. a bag—there are thirteen bags to a ton—last autumn I sent out different quality, and they lost 8 lbs. or 9 lbs. a bag—there is no other is except from evaporation, but in sorting there is always something to row away—I sort as well as sell—these were seconds, they were woollen if rags have been packed damp abroad you have always to chop them to pieces, which makes them heavy when packed and lighter when opened, because the moisture is out of them—I weigh the very best, and guess at others.</p>
