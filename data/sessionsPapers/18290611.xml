               <p>EMMA HERBERT. I am single, and live in Wardour-street. On the 11th of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon I had been out a very long walk, and was taken very ill; I sat down on a stone in Compton-street; I had been walking all day, seeking a situation as a servant - I sat down, and put my hand to my forehead; the prisoner came up, and said, "You have been drinking; " I said I had not, but was unwell: I never saw her in my life before - she asked me to go with her and have a cup of tea; I refused, but she pressed me - I got up and followed her to <placeName id="t18290611-1-crimeloc4">No. 29, Rupert-street</placeName>

I found my shawl in pawn at the top of Compton-street, early the next morning; I informed a constable, who went with me to the house in Rupert-street, and took the prisoner - I am quite sure she is the person. I am a native of Wales, but have been in London thirteen or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did we have any thing to drink together? A. I did not drink with her at all, nor go to any public-house with her.</p>
               <p>PETER TATE. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Princes-street, Soho. This shawl was pawned with me for 5s. in the name of Jones, on the 12th of May, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, by the prisoner; I did not ask where she got it, as she had pawned things before - she mentioned no name but Jones.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was rather in liquor, and met this woman who was drunk, and a mob was round her; she complained to me of being ill, having knocked her head against a post - she said she dare not go home in that state, and if I took her home and gave her a cup of tea, she would pawn her shawl to pay for it; she gave me the shawl in the passage to pawn, but I said, "Let us put the kettle on first;" as we went up stairs my husband came home, and found us drunk - he threw us both down stairs- she told me she would come and breakfast with me after my husband was gone in the morning, instead of which she brought an officer.</p>

On the night of the 17th of April, about nine o'clock, he asked me if I had seen any letters - I said No; he asked me if I had washed the plate- I told him I had; he asked if that was all, taking the plate up in his hand; I cannot exactly say what it was - it was but little; there were silver spoons and forks - he left the kitchen, and I heard the street door shut very hard, in a few minutes after; I went into the pantry, in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, to make the prisoner's bed, and found the pantry all in confusion, as if it had been much robbed - I found the cupboard and drawers all thrown wide open, and the plated articles scattered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110004"/>on different shelves in the closet; I saw the prisoner's box pulled out in the pantry with a Scotch plaid thrown carelessly over it - I went from there to the street door; I found the street door open, but the middle door shut too - I came down stairs, and went part of the way to the kitchen, and called Nunn, my fellow servant; we went up, and told Lady Beechey - Mr. Jackson, her son-in-law, came to the house immediately, and Captain Beechey followed him in a few minutes; there is no key-hole outside the street door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it your duty to wash the plate? A. Yes, and the prisoner's to put it away; he is generally engaged in the pantry: Sir William dines at six o'clock - the plate I washed had been used at dinner; some time before he came and asked for the plate, I went into the pantry to look for dirty plates - he was then in his knife-house, and appeared to be-cleaning knives; he could see me in the pantry - this was after dinner; the things are brought down about seven o'clock - the pantry is open to all the servants, but I believe the prisoner locks it when he goes out; I was in the pantry between seven and eight o'clock - every thing appeared as usual then; it was about nine o'clock when he left the house: all the silver articles were selected from the plated ones - there was no ring or knock at the door after he left; the door shuts with a spring.</p>

             - we and the prisoner were the only servants. On the 17th of April, in consequence of something Memory said, I went into the pantry, and found all the drawers and cupboards open, and his box in the middle of the floor, that was about a quarter-past nine o'clock - the prisoner went out about nine; all the things were strewed about the room - I went and alarmed Lady Beechey; Mr. Jackson and Captain 
               <persName id="t18290611-2-person128">Beechey</persName>
             came to the house soon after - when Mr. Jackson came into the parlour, he had his watch in his hand, and said it was then twenty minutes past nine o'clock; the prisoner had left the house between nine and that time: I observed a handsome damask table-cloth on the table by the door in the pantry, unfolded, and another in the press: there was no key-hole to the street door - it cannot be opened outside; I saw the doors and windows below stairs after missing the property, they were all fast - it was not possible for any one to come in from below stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner lived with Sir William? A. Nearly four months; I know he had a letter to deliver to Mr. Bell, in Oxford-street, and another in Long-acre, and I know he did deliver them; I was at needle-work in the kitchen from the time he went out till the plate was missed - I heard the street door creak about six minutes after the prisoner left; I had heard it shut, as I thought, when he left; the cook went up a minute or two after the door creaked, and found it open - the prisoner was absent an hour and twenty-five minutes - he seemed a little confused when he came in, but not particularly so; I believe every thing taken was silver, except two butterladles.</p>

            . I am son of Sir William Beechey. I received information, and went to my father's house - I got there at twenty-five minutes past nine o'clock; Mr. Jackson, my brother-in-law, got there before me - the house is in Harley-street; I went into the pantry and found the drawers pulled out - the prisoner's box pulled out in the centre of the room, and his clothes were out of it; Mr. Jackson was looking over the cupboard where the plate was kept - we had some plated wine-coolers, I found them in the cupboard; I should not think a person could tell they were plated without examining them - they were at the back of the cupboard; any person looking into the cupboard could not avoid seeing them - I knew pretty well what plate my father had.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person in the space of six minutes separate the plated articles from the silver? A. I should think not, nor in three times that time; I found a pen-knife in the prisoner's box - I saw the prisoner after he came home; he appeared very much confused when Schofield spoke to him - we took him down to the pantry; he was asked if his clothes were gone - he looked towards his box in the middle of the room, and said they were gone; he was asked if he had any thing else in his box - he said he had five sovereigns, and that they were gone too; the box was about eight or ten feet from him - he could not tell whether the sovereigns were gone or not, without looking into it, and did not examine the box before he said they were gone; he took up a plated fork out of the tray, where he said he had left the plate - he was told to look into the tray where the plate had been left, and asked if it was all gone; he took up the fork without examining the other plated things, and said all the plate was gone - he looked into the tray, took up a fork, put it down again, and said it was all gone; I should not have known the silver from the plated articles without a strict examination: there were some papers, two or three small books, and a pen-knife left in the prisoner's box - he was asked what the sovereigns were in, and he said they were wrapped in a piece of sugar paper; he examined the box after he said they were gone, and was asked where he had left the sovereigns - he described the particular part of the box in which he had left them; after he said they were gone somebody in the room asked how he knew that without examining the box - I do not recollect that he gave any answer, but he went to his box, put aside some of the papers, and said they were gone, but even then he did not examine sufficient to ascertain it, in my opinion; Mr. Jackson showed him a penknife, and asked him how that penknife came on the landing-place or near the door - the prisoner said, "You did not find it there;" Mr. Jackson asked him how he knew that - the prisoner said, "Because you took it out of my box;" Mr. Jackson said, "How do you know that?" he replied, "Because I saw you;" I saw Mr Jackson find the penknife myself - the prisoner was not there then; he was asked if he had shut the street door after him when he left at nine o'clock, and said he did, and tried it; I observed that the pantry windows were shut and barred, and the area door shut - nobody could come in from below stairs: there was not less than 40l. worth of silver articles - the plated articles, to purchase them, were worth 20l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are your father or Mr. Jackson here? A. No; a silver skewer and wine-strainer were left behind - Lady Beechey missed no plated articles but two butter-ladles; a person could not tell that the wine-coolers were not silver, without examining them.</p>
               <p>Q. All the answers given by the prisoner were to questions put by Mr. Jackson? A. Yes; he found the penknife in the prisoner's box - he did not say he had found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110005"/>it elsewhere, but asked how it came there; that inferred that it had been found up stairs - he is a solicitor: the prisoner, in answer to several questions, was rather impudent, and Mr. Jackson said, "You need not answer unless you like;" he denied all knowledge of the plate - he came home at twenty-five minutes past ten o'clock - it might be an hour before he was taken to the watch-house; his box had evidently been rausacked - it was not turned over on its side; he might see that a greater part of his clothes were gone, but I should think could not see to the bottom of his box - he said the sovereigns were on some of his clothes, but I should think he could not know whether the money was gone; he might have seen that some of his clothes were gone - there might have been a waistcoat or some small things which he could not see: considerable search has been made for the plate, but without success; the pantry window looks into the area, but the shutters were closed and barred: he said he had received the sovereigns from Lady Beechey, which is true.</p>

            's; I concealed myself behind the door, when the prisoner returned, and the moment the door was open, he said to Nunn, who let him in, "For why was the door bolted?" (meaning the street door) she made no answer, unless she spoke very low; I then came forward, and said to her, "Go forward with him, and let him remain with the gentlemen below;" I then watched him down - I particularly remarked that he was very much agitated, and seemed very much alarmed; I had not at that time taken him into custody, or told him I was an officer - Nunn took him down below; I overtook them at the foot of the stairs, and on entering the pantry the prisoner said,"What is the matter?" I said the plate was missing, and he was suspected of taking it, and leaving the street door open when he went out - he said he had shut the door, and tried it after him; I asked where he had been since he went out - he told me I might ask Lady Beechey, for she knew; I then told him I was an officer, it was my duty to ask those questions, and he might do as he pleased about answering - he paused for some moments, and at last said he had been out with three letters, which Lady Beechey had given him, that the clock struck nine as he went through the hall to go out - he then said he had taken one letter to Bell's, the chemist, in Oxford-street, and another to a chemist in Long-acre, and then he came straight home- then he corrected himself, and said he had been with another letter to George-street, Montague-square, and then returned home, and then remarked "It is only half-past ten o'clock," which was correct by Mr. Jackson's watch; I asked him where he had left the plate - he pointed to a large press cupboard behind the door in the pantry, gave me a key from his pocket, and said he had locked it up in that cupboard, which cupboard was then open - I examined the cupboard directly; there was no appearance of its having been forced - he gave me an inventory of the plate, which I produce; the plate and plated articles are distinguished in the inventory; he said the inventory was correct - I asked what part of the cupboard he had left the silver things in, as the cupboard was in such a confused state; he at that time was very much confused, and could give me no answer: I asked him where he had put the spoons he had fetched from the kitchen a short time before he went out - he pointed to a tray where there were about eight plated forks, and said he had put them among them; I then took up the plated forks - he said they were all plated; I said they were so well plated that I should not have known them from silver: I afterwards searched him, in consequence of Sir William Beechey coming in and giving him in charge, and found two sovereigns and two shillings on him; he afterwards stated, in answer to some questions from a gentleman, that he had lost five sovereigns out of his box - he had not at that time examined the box; he was about three yards from it at that time - I could not have discovered what was in the box without examining it - I told him so; he was very much confused, and said, "Oh, it was wrapped up in some sugar-paper," and then he went to look - it was a middling sized box. I examined the plated articles which were left behind - there was a great quantity in the cupboard; I found those articles correct with the inventory, as far as I compared them - I was present next day with the inventory, when Lady Beechey looked over the articles, and they corresponded; he said Lady Beechey paid him the five sovereigns - I asked him if the two sovereigns were part of the five she had paid him; he said, "What is that to you?" and he would not answer another question. I examined the street door - there was no key-hole at which a skeleton-key could be introduced; I examined the back of the house - there was no where that a thief could get in; I asked him particularly if he had fastened the house up before he went out - he said he had fastened up every place: I should think it would take a stranger an hour to open all the drawers, pack up the things, and take them away, from the confused state the pantry was in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long might he be under examination? A. I should think half an hour; Mr. Jackson was alone with him about ten minutes; I did not particularly attend when Lady Beechey compared the plated articles with the inventory. The prisoner was excessively insolent to the gentlemen in the house, and would not answer - he said, "I have no business to answer; I will not answer," and so on; I consider that insolent - I was absent about the house a good deal, and did not hear all he said; I think he said his money was at the bottom of the box, but I cannot say - he said something was at the bottom of his box, I know; I found all he said was true, except saying he had no relations.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If he had shut the door after him, and tried it, was there any possible way to open it without breaking it open? A. None.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did he produce the inventory? A. When I asked him what plate he had under his care, he produced the inventory from a drawer.</p>

             re-examined. I found the cupboard open - I cannot say it was forced open; there was no bolt to it, and a little thing put into the key-hole would have pulled it open - the bolt of the lock was out, as if it had been locked; there are two folding doors, and no bolt to either of them - the first was only pushed too, and the other locked; I pushed the bolt of the lock back myself -I was in the pantry about half an hour before he went out; I saw nothing in confusion then.</p>

On the night of the 21st of December, I know the house was safe - I missed a quantity of calico, stockings, bacon, cheese, tobacco and pork; some tobacco had been taken out of the jars, and some unpacked; there might be 30s. worth of copper- I know there was a two-penny piece which had been in the back part of the till for three years; it was safe with every thing else the night the robbery was committed - we had taken the silver out of the till that night; I missed some handkerchiefs - there were two of a particular nature, which I saw afterwards; I came down first in the morning, and found a hole made through the brick work under the window, and a hole cut by a sharp instrument in the wood work at the end of the shop window, large enough for a man to get through.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How soon did you see any of the property? A. I saw the two-penny piece two or three months after.</p>

            . I am a constable of Twickenham, about six miles from West Drayton. In consequence of information from a man named Fisher, I went to a house at Whitton, the beginning of April, with a search warrant; I knew the prisoner lived in that house, for I have seen him going in and out there - I have known him these four years; he was in custody at this time - I have not seen him go in there above twice since December; I found there this copper coin - here are two two-penny pieces among it; I found them in his box, where his clothes were - I took the clothes to Bow-street, and he claimed them; I showed the two-penny piece to the prosecutrix - I went to search for other property, and found one handkerchief at a pawnbrokers, at Brentford, and redeemed it; Dalby produced this handkerchief in my presence at Hampton, where she lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see him go into this house last? A. In April, about two days before he was taken, I think - his wife and family were there when I went; King, Kite, and another, who were tried at Kingston, have been executed - I cannot say whether the prisoner was a witness on their trial.</p>

In the latter part of December I lived at Twickenham; I knew a man named Kite - I have seen the prisoner twice; I was present at a division of some property - I think it was on the 7th of December. On the 20th, Kite shewed me some property - Young was not present then; I never saw him after the 20th till he was in custody - not at Kite's house; I only know about the prisoner from what Kite said - Kite said he was one of the party.</p>

The prisoner, about seven or eight weeks ago, came to buy a cap; she said she was a washerwoman, and should be obliged to me to have her when I wanted one, and I could have a number of respectable references - one place which she mentioned she had been at eleven years; I went to this place, Reily's pork shop, Whitecross-street, and asked if Hankin washed for them - they said they did not know her, she had not referred me there, but mentioned that place which was the only one I remember; I afterwards went to her house and left word for her to come to my house - she came that afternoon; I believe it was the 20th of May - I agreed for her to wash for me; she was to come to me on Thursday morning, which she did, and washed in the kitchen which Mrs. Powell and I have between us - she staid till half-past ten o'clock at night, and on the Friday afternoon about three, I missed some lace, and on looking at the book, I found it was forty-five yards; I had put it into the lace box myself when I was clearing the shop-window at night - it was in my part of the shop: I had seen it during the Thursday, and recollect wrapping one piece of it up on the Thursday night about ten o'clock; it was then in the box - I took it out of the window, wrapped it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110007"/>up, and put it into the lace-box; I missed only two pieces at first, but when I came to recollect, about an hour after, I missed another, which I had also seen on the Thursday evening, but do not recollect wrapping it up - it was about the middle of the window; on the Sunday I missed from a drawer in my bed-room, three stockings which I had seen on Friday on a line at the top part of the house - I went up stairs and missed seven black silk stockings which I saw myself in a box on Thursday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the prisoner was up stairs with me; I am not certain they were all there - I missed thirteen pairs of my sister's stockings; the prisoner had every thing to wash that was dirty; she said to me on the Thursday morning, "You are so badly off for drying here, if you will allow me, I will take your flannels home to-dry, as they will dry better;" I said "Very well," and she did take them house - I did not give her leave to take any thing else; she went home about half-past ten o'clock on Thursday night, and about ten or five minutes after she took the things she had washed into the shop, and put them behind the counter - she asked my leave to put them there, saying, she thought it would be the best place for them; I was then in the shop and the servant also - I saw nobody else there; I believe we all came out of the shop together - at that time the things were put into a tub behind the counter, and I wished the prisoner to put some cold water over them - I was not in the shop when she did it; I heard the water poured over them - that was after we all three came out of the shop; I was in Mrs. Powell's room - there was nobody else to do it but her; I had told her while she was washing to take the things to any part of the house she liked to dry them; I told her to take some on the leads - she went into different parts of the house; my bed-room was not locked - she came on Friday night to bring home the flannels she had dried; I found them quite correct, and told her we had lost some lace; she said "Ma'am, I hope you don't think it is me;" I said "Oh no, I am sure I don't," nor did I- she went away; McCray, an officer, came to the house on the Friday night, and searched my sister's bed-room and Mrs. Powell's room; the prisoner came next day to iron - I saw her about ten o'clock; she persuaded me to have every body I had in my house searched, which had been done on the Friday night; there were lodgers in the house at that time. On Sunday I went to Worship-street - McCray and Lock went with me to the prisoner's house; I got there nearly at dusk - she keeps two rooms; she said they were hers, and in the first box we came to, in the back room, I found three or four pairs of stockings and two or three night caps, and in another, an old pair of white stockings, near the bed foot, on the floor, and in or near a box, an old black silk handkerchief, in the drawers in the front room, with a man's night cap, the lace is worth about 5l. at the wholesale price; it belongs to my husband - I found a card in my bed-room cut to pieces.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What is the value of the property found? A. Not much; the stockings cost me 2s. 6d. a pair - she offered to be searched herself when the lace was missed, and said I was too easy by half, she never saw such an easy woman - she said the stockings were not mine; the shop was shut when I put the lace away - she was going home at all hours on Saturday, but was there till twelve o'clock at night; she said she wondered at our coming on Sunday to search, and taking her by surprise - and when the stockings were found, she said she meant to bring them home on Monday when she came for a blanket, but I never intended to give her one to wash - I should not have prosecuted her for the stockings, but my girls were afraid they should be suspected, and I was persuaded.</p>

             - I never saw the contents; I leave the foreman to shut our warehouse up when I leave, and the keys are brought to my house. On the morning of the 7th of March, at nine o'clock, I found the premises had been broken into, and the property gone: the warehouse is in the parish of Allhallows, Barking - the windows have all iron bars to them; persons outside cannot look into the windows unless they get within the gates - I found the fronts of several boxes ripped down, and several articles taken away; the locks of the premises were all broken open - we found one silver candlestick left behind, and several plated articles; the warehouse which was broken open is at the back part of the premises - we let part of the front warehouses- the windows were perfect outside, but the interior was all dilapidated; the counting-house was broken open, the deaks and iron safe broken open, and money gone - there was a bag put up to prevent the party being seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were several boxes opened, or one taken away? A. No boxes were taken away, but the contents were - one was entirely stripped, and the other partly; no outer door was broken that I could discover.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WILLIAMS. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Colebatch. On the 6th of March I locked up the warehouse, and delivered the keys to the clerk; I left the premises quite safe - I went again about nine o'clock in the morning; Mr. Colebatch was there - I found the outer wicket secure, but the inner wicket open; the two doors of the salt warehouse were also open - I found a door on the staircase had been forced open by some instrument; I went up stairs, saw another box forced open, and things scattered about the floor - it was principally linen; five boxes had been forced open.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the morning of the 7th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Paul-street, Finsbury, and saw the prisoner - he nodded at me, and I saw Haydon behind him, carrying a basket, about a yard and a half off; I was on the opposite side, crossed over, and questioned him -I found the basket contained plate; I then looked for the prisoner, but could not find him that day - I took Haydon into custody; he was detained till the following Monday, when I met the prisoner in Leonard-street, about eleven o'clock - I was going down by the Tabernacle, and all at once saw a person turn round and run a contrary way, but I was not it was him then - I saw the person run into a shop; I went to the shop, but could not see him - I went to the stairs which lead to the bake-house, and hallooed Joe come up (meaning the prisoner) and he came from the cellar where they bake; I said "If you go quietly I won't handcuff you," he said he would go quietly, and I took him to Guildhall - he was going to say something; I said, "Mind what you say to me," and nothing passed - I have had the plate ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He knew you? A. Yes, and nodded - I followed the porter two or three yards, and then looked for the prisoner, before I stopped the porter, and he was gone in a moment; he could not have got out of my sight if he had walked - I went to look for him, but did not go to his house; I met him on the Monday, nearly on the same spot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had a complaint in his bowels which obliged him to go down there? A. Certainly not - I believe the baker's wife was in the shop.</p>

            . I am an officer; I was with Herdsfield in Paul-street, and met the prisoner, and a porter behind him a few steps, with a large basket - Herdsfield crossed over the road, lifted up something, and called me over; I am certain the prisoner is the man who was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search the prisoner? A. I saw him searched, and 40l. odd found on him.</p>
               <p>JOHN HAYDON. I am a porter, and generally ply at Spitalfields-market. I was there on the 7th of March, when the prisoner applied to me between ten and eleven o'clock; he asked if I wanted a job I said Yes - he said"Then carry these," and gave me a parcel wrapped up in a great coat - he put it into my basket himself; the officer took it from me in Paul-street - it is the same parcel; he went before me into Lamb-street, across Spital-square, up Primrose-street - we came at last into Paul-street, and I was taken into custody; the prisoner had ran away then - I had seen him not a minute before; he went away when the officer spoke to him - he had continued with me up to that time; the parcel the officer took from me was exactly the same as he gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where do you live? A. In York-street, Shoreditch. I never saw the prisoner before; I never said I doubted his being the man, nor that there were so many faces alike, I did not like to swear to him - I said he was the man; I did not express a doubt of him, but swore positively to him; I have seen Herdsfield here - he has never called on me, nor have I had any conversation with him about swearing to the prisoner; he was about six yards before me, and saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you follow any other person but him from the market, till you were stopped? A. None.</p>
               <p>THE REVEREND EDWARD OSBORNE. I had left some plate in the care of the prosecutors, secured in a box, above a year ago; I have since seen, out of the box, some of the plate - that was before the Magistrate; I knew it to be part of what I left in their care - (examining the property) this is part of it; there is still some missing - the value of this is considerably above 100l.: I saw the box after the robbery - it was the same box as contained the plate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent - it is all prejudice against me: Haydon strongly denied my being the person before the Magistrate, and said there were so many alike he could not tell: Herdsfield called at my house, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110009"/>told I was gone out to see the paper; he came out, and saw me, and says I ran into the shop. Had I not forty-eight hours to escape if I had been guilty? it is nothing but a conspiracy.</p>

               <p>JAMES GOWING. I am servant to Mr. Nias. On Thursday night I brought the chaise into Brunswick-square, about half-past eleven o'clock; the coat and cloak were on the driving seat - after some time I got out, and went towards the horse's head for a few minutes, and when I came back they were gone - I had only been away a few minutes; it was a very dark night: I saw nobody near the chaise.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I am an officer. On Friday, the 10th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning. I observed the prisoners and another person pass the corner of the Old Bailey, into Newgate-street - Jones had this cloak wrapped up under his arm, tied by a bit of string; Williams had a dark coat on his back - I followed them up Newgate-street (the other one left them at the corner) - I laid hold of them, and took them up a passage; I asked Jones where he got the cloak - he said he picked it up in Holborn the night before, about half-past ten o'clock, wrapped in a sheet of paper - I asked Williams where he got the coat, and he said he bought it of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, for 22s.; I asked him when - he said he did not know when: I asked him if any body saw him buy it, and Jones replied that he saw him buy it about three weeks ago - I then took them in custody, and on the Monday or Tuesday saw Mr. Nias, who claimed them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAMS' Defence. I went to Jones' lodging on Friday morning; I asked him to go with me to the Borough, and as we went along I asked him to carry the cloak - I was in bed at the time of the robbery.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) Having arrived at Southend from a voyage, on my way to town, I accidentally met with a young person, who stated himself to be a baker, and perceiving from his dialect that he was a countryman of my own, I was glad to embrace his services; he then introduced me to the prosecutor, Drysdale, who keeps the Caledonian Inn, Beer-yard, Drury-lane: I agreed to take my refreshment at a certain sum, and to take the same in the bar, with himself and family, during my stay; in the course of the day, Drysdale induced me to play with him at bagatelle; I was surprised at his having a board, and made some remark upon the subject, to which he replied he did not care for any person, as his spirit merchant was a Magistrate, and knew that the board was in his house, but that he had raised fifty pounds and purchased spirits of him, since which time he never took any notice of any thing that was done in his house, whether card playing, of which a great deal took place during the time I was there, and that since he had him on his side, being his licensing Magistrate, he did not care for all the others. In the evening he asked me for 6s. 9d., which he stated I owed him - being rather fresh, I said I would call by and by and settle with him, as I had not so much about me, but was going to see a friend, and I should call and pay him; on the next morning imagining he had not acted altogether fairly towards me, I was determined I would not pay him, as I did not consider I owned him any thing, and two days after I left his house, and where I had removed to he knew from the young man who had taken me to his house, having myself told him; he, finding all claims fruitless, and considering I might mention his allowing gambling in his house, took the advantage of seeing my handkerchief in my hand - he said it was his, and immediately looked at the corners to see if there was any mark, and which handkerchief I assure you, I purchased in Guernsey, together with six others which all being separate patterns, made the piece of seven - if the prosecutor knew the handkerchief to be his, what necessity was there for him to examine the corners for a mark? upon his first examination he said he could not swear to it, but upon the second examination, he then found as by a miracle, he could swear to it. Had I stolen his handkerchief I should not have taken it out openly to his face before him, but have disposed of it.</p>

I said, "For some iron they have taken from here this morning; do you know any thing about it?" he said, No; I said, "You must know it was taken from this place; you must have seen it go, it is a small place;" he then said,"Why I saw it go, and Smale told me Mr. Wiggins allowed it to him as a perquisite;" I asked if Mr. Wiggins had told him that; he said, No, it was only what he had heard from Smale; there was 7 cwt. of iron in the cart: part of it was nails; they were at the top, and the large pieces of iron at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time in the morning was this? A. About six o'clock - there were several men at work on the wharf, but not at that place; I do not know whether the prisoners were employed by Mr. Wiggins at that time - there was a piece of oak in the cart, which I believe was to blind me - they had no business with it; I did not see Smith do any thing; I did not see Knight do any thing, but he told me it was a perquisite - Smith afterwards said he would attend at the Police-office; it was mostly old iron - there were some new pieces.</p>

            . I went with Fogg - I staid and watched the cart; it was standing with the tail on the ground, and the shafts upwards; there was no horse in it- Smale was at work at the other end of the wharf, not far from the cart; Smith was at work at a little distance -I saw Knight bring something heavy, and put into the cart; Smale could see what Knight was doing while he was loading the cart - while he was doing it, Smale went into the shop, and came out again; he gave a look into the cart as he went by, and went to his work again - I then saw him put his head to Smith, as if he was speaking to him, but I could not hear what was said; I then saw Smith come and undo the prop of the cart; he tried to pull it down, but could not - he went into the shop, got a hammer, and went to his work again; I went to the other side of the wharf, and saw a truck drawn in by a brown horse; I watched, and saw the horse taken and put into the cart, but I could not see by whom; the cart was then drawn out - I kept close behind; Knight was in the cart, and Smale led the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was no horse in the cart at the time you saw something put into it? A. No; I thought it was iron by the sound; I did not know Knight before -I could see it was a very heavy substance that he put into the cart.</p>

            , and myself; the cart and the iron were ours - I believe there is about 7 cwt. of it; I had seen some of it in the shop on the Monday - Smale and Smith were wheelers, and Knight was a farrier, employed by my brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever said you would take every means in your power to prosecute Knight and transport him, but you cared nothing about the others? A. No, I did not; I have said I heard the officer had information that the iron was to be stolen - I can swear to part of this iron; this piece is part of an axle-tree of a cart; I broke up fifty of them, and cannot find one - many pieces of bolts were on my premises, and I have not seen them since; here is one piece I can swear to; I never allow pieces of iron to the men to get beer - I never heard of such a thing in the trade; some of these pieces may have been on the premises twelve months, and some not two days; they were up in a corner.</p>

I live at Watlington, and follow the plough; I have known White ever since I can remember any thing; I saw him at Watlington on the night of the 14th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, in Cushion-street, opposite Mr. Ives' - I did not speak to him, but I am sure it was him: there were two men with him whom I did not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you speak to him? A. No: he almost touched me as he passed - it was a moonlight night, but there was no gas-light; he was no acquaintance of mine - I had seen him before, and spoken to him, but did not on that night; I heard of the loss of these fowls soon after, but I did not tell Mr. Wiggins, or any body else of it nor go before any Magistrate; I was found at a public-house on Whit-Monday - I was quite sober; I am sure it was the night of the 14th, because my master had ordered me to get up that night to draw into Reading: I told this story when they came to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often in the course of your life had you seen White? A.Almost every day when he was at Watlington.</p>

Warren said, "It is mine, and there are four guinea fowls in it:" they were looked at - they were then dead: I said to Warren, "Who did you get them from?" he said, "That person in the parlour," and pointed out White, and said he gave 8s. or 9s. for them; White denied it - we did not take the fowls away that night, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110014"/>next morning I went with Buckle to the Benbow - Warren had left the bag there, and Buckle took it; the prisoners were taken, and conveyed to Worship-street, with a man named Pettit: as they were going along, I heard White say to Pettit, "If he can keep his tongue, it will be all right enough;" he was alluding to Warren, who was walking first with the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the prisoners that first night? A. No; I left them and the fowls there that night - they knew I was an officer; I heard that there were some pheasants lost as well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You say there was a quarrel? A.There had been a quarrel, and the inspector of the watch called me in; they were tipsy - the bag was there the next morning; White said if he would keep his tongue it would be all right - he pointed to Warren, but did not mention his name.</p>
               <p>- I am inspector of the watch. I went to the house, and found the bag, which the landlord gave to Warren when he asked for it; White came out of the parlour, and said, "That is my bag," and he took it from him; I opened the bag, and took out one or two fowls, and left them there.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I went and got the bag, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I then took Warren, and told him I apprehended the fowls were stolen - he said, "I thought so too;" I asked who he bought them of: he said of a man named White, who would be there presently - White then came, and I took him; I wrote down to the constable of Watlington, and kept the fowls as long as I could - I then cut off the heads, pinions, and legs; the heads were offensive, and I could not keep them - these are the legs and pinions; one of the feet has a nail off one of the toes - this is it; I took it off one of the dark fowls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Where did you find Mr. Wall? A. At his residence in Fleet-market; I believe it was after the first examination - I did not take the plough-boy; he was subpoened here - I did not go on the night before; I heard of it in the morning, and followed Warren and Pettit into the Benbow: White came in in a quarter of an hour; I had not heard of 50l. being offered for some pheasants till the second examination.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did hear of the reward? A. I heard there was a reward of 20l. for any burglary in that parish, and an extra 5l. from a gentleman who had lost some pheasants.</p>
               <p>MRS. WIGGINS. I believe they are the legs of my fowls - I never had the lame fowl in my hand while it was alive, but I will swear that was the leg of it; I have seen it many times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say two were light, and two were dark? A. Yes; light guinea fowls are rather singular.</p>
               <p>WHITE'S Defence. I had the fowls delivered to me from a coach-office in Fleet-market. I asked where they came from, but they did not give me any information on that subject.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker, and live at No. 15, Willow-walk. Kerman came on the 3d of May, and asked me to buy some second-hand harness; I had never seen him before - he took me with him to Sandy's-row, Widegate-alley; as we went along, he said "This harness is on the cross;" I suppose he meant that it was stolen; I said, "Never mind that, as I travel the country, it won't matter;" I saw some harness, part of which belonged to the prosecutor - he wanted 5l. for it; I agreed to give him 3l.; he asked me when it would suit me to fetch it; I said in the course of a couple of hours, as I was going to Smithfield - he said, "As I have nothing to do, I will go with you," and that I had better bring some bags for it; I said No, I would bring my horse and cart - he went to Smithfield with me; I could not get rid of him; at last I said the person I expected to see was not there; he then left me, and came to me again two or three times, and said if I had not got all the money, I could leave part of it - Mr. Wall afterwards came and asked me if I had a harness to sell; I said I knew of one; I at length got this harness from Goodear's house, in Dorset-street - the person down stairs said he lodged there; Kerman had shown it me twice; I am sure this is the harness which he offered to sell me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did not you go to the prisoner's house, and ask him if he had any harness to sell? A. No; I was never charged with any thing - I deal in all sorts of harness, and sometimes in horses - I do not keep a marine store shop; I am a general dealer - when Kerman said it was on the cross, I said, "Never mind," in order to find the property: I do not know a person named Godwin nor Watson - I did not go with Kerman to Godwin or Watson; the first lot of harness was at Sandy's-row, where Kerman lived; the other was at Dorset-street, where they said Dick Goodear lived, but I did not see him there.</p>

            . I live in Spitalfields. I have a stable in the Tenter-ground; it was broken open on the 2d of April, between eight and ten o'clock - I had not been there that day till about half-past ten at night, when the watchman sent to me; I went down, found the door open, and missed my harness; I saw it again on the 4th of May, at the watch-house - I went that night to the corner of Dorset-street; I saw a cart there, and two men in it, but I do not know who they were; I followed the cart - I had not known Kerman before.</p>

            . This is the harness I went to see on the 3d of April; when Kerman came to me, he said it was on the cross; I had not known him before - I went and looked at the harness, and thought I knew part of it, but I could not swear to it - Mr. Wall came to me, and when he said Chapman had lost a harness, I told him of it; I did not intend to have it, but merely went to see it, that I might know what to say if any body came to me - when Kerman came to me at Smithfield, I said I could not find the man I expected; he called on me several times afterwards, and on the 4th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, Mr. Wall came, and asked if I had a set of harness; after some talk he said, "To tell you the truth, we have lost some:" I said, "When did you lose it?" he said, "On Good Friday;" I said I would do my best to get it - I never saw the prisoners together; it was I and Kerman who were in the cart - I went to buy Mr. Wall's harness, and Kerman said I should not have it without the money; I went and told Wall, who gave me a 5l. note, which I went and gave Kerman, and in that way we got the harness from Goodear's house - I had not inquired whose the harness was before Mr. Wall came to me, but I left word with my wife that if any body came about harness, I could give information.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 21st of April, and offered me a sample of some grain tin and safflower, and said he had some cochineal - I was to meet him about eleven o'clock and got a sample of it; I went to him at twelve - he said he could not get a sample; I was to see him again at three - he then said he had not the goods, but was to have them next day, and if I called at one o'clock I should see them; I went next day - he was not there - I showed the sample he had left me to Mr. Barnes.</p>

On the 28th of April, about half-past ten o'clock, I was going from Covent-garden to my home, and as I went along Little Pulteney-street, I met the prisoner with a bag of books - I suspected they did not belong to him; I felt the bottom of the bag, and found they were books - I asked him where he was going with them at that time of night; he said he was going to the Bull or the Bell, in Holborn - the waggon went off early in the morning, and that he had brought them from Regent-street; I went on to the corner of Dean-street, and there I saw a watchman - I said, "This young man says he has stationery in this bag, I want to convince myself that it is so;" he put down the bag, and I found ten of my books in it, which I had seen in my warehouse a day or two before; I went to my warehouse, and missed them- they are Journals of the Houses of Lords and Commons; the warehouse was locked up, and had been opened with some key - I have had lads to sleep there.</p>

On the 26th of September I got three notes from the Bank of England - my husband sent me for them, but I do not know what they were, as I cannot read nor write; I gave them to my husband. On the 9th of April I was in the shop, about half-past eleven o'clock in the day, and two men came in - I cannot say that the prisoner was one - they were both alike in features; I did not know one from the other - I bought some sweatmeats of them; one of the men, but I cannot say which, had been at my shop the week before - on the 9th they came together, when I bought the box of goods of them, one came first, and then went and fetched the other: the box of sweat-meats was brought from a cart by one of them - I was to pay 5l. 7s. 6d. for it; 3d. was taken off by the gentleman who took the money - I cannot say whether the men were dressed alike; I had never seen them before - one of them called the week before; I sent to my husband for the key of his box - it was brought; I unlocked the box, and took out two notes, but I do not know what they were - I do not know any difference between a 1l. note and a 50l. note; I gave one of the notes to the men, who said it was right - that was all I gave him, except the 7s. 6d.; he put the note into his pocket: I swear I do not recollect any thing particular in his manner of doing it - they went away together, and I saw no more of them; the box of sweatmeats was left, and the box was to be called for on the following Saturday, but they did not come.</p>

I had a 50l. note, which my wife brought from the Bank of England last September; I had seen it about the middle of April, two or three days before the sweetmeats were brought - it had not always been locked up: it was in a box, of which I sometimes had the key, and sometimes not; when I am out I give my wife the key - I do not know that she had had it that week, I think not - I have got no part of the money since; I was before the Magistrate: I did tell him that it was in a box, of which I kept the key. When I came back on the day the sweetmeats were brought, the note was gone; I think the key had not been out of my possession after I saw the note safe - I have some lodgers in the house, who go into that room the same as myself.</p>

On the 30th of April Smith gave me information; I went to my shed, and found all the screws had been taken out of my cart; one wheel, the axletree, and the springs were removed from it, but were not taken off the premises; the cart stood upright - I saw the prisoner, and asked how he came to take these things off my cart, he said he was employed by a person, but he would not tell me who - this was about nine or ten o'clock in the morning; the cart was standing near the Three Colts public-house, in Dog-row.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SMITH. I am a silk dyer. I saw the prisoner about half-past four o'clock in the morning, at work with Mr. Comwell's cart, under the shed; I got on my clothes, went down, and took him - he had this hammer in his hand. which I told him to drop, and he did; one wheel was off, and the other partly off the cart; he said if I knew his troubles I should not interfere with him - I had seen the cart between six and seven o'clock at night; it was then perfect, and lying down on the shafts.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was employed to take the springs from the cart, by a man who represented himself to be the prosecutor's brother.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SMITH. He did not tell me the man employed him, but he said the man lived near Three Colt-lane, and that he hopped as he walked, one leg being shorter than the other; we have made every inquiry for such a person, but cannot find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave the best description I could of the man who employed me; I have done my best endeavours to bring him forward.</p>

            . On the morning of the 14th I heard a noise at the door; I went out, and saw the prisoner with a check apron in his hand carrying it off - there was another young man with him; I saw them untie the bundle, and put in our bell, which had been safe at eleven o'clock the night before - both the men ran away; I followed the prisoner, and took him- the other got away; the apron was picked up by Clark- our bell was in with the rest; this is the spring of our bell, and matches it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far was I from the gate when you first came out? A. About one hundred yards - you had the apron in your hands; there was a person with you, and he put the bell into the apron.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLARK. I saw the bundle of bells in this check apron by the side of the road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young man asked me to carry the bundle; the witness came out - I went away, and left the bundle there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence) written.) I was taken up for robbing my master of sundry articles of wearing-apparel, and some silver spoons; they have got down in my indictment that I had robbed them of some china and glasses; I know nothing about the under-mentioned articles: the purse I picked up in the dusthole when first I went to live there; I went up-stairs to my mistress, as she sat in the back-parlour, and told her I had picked it out of the dust-hole; she said that it was one that Master George had been playing with, and that it was of no value; I put it into my pocket. The first week that I went there I had a great deal of cleaning, and in the coal-hole I found a great many broken glasses, likewise in the beer-cellar a quantity of broken glasses, which I suppose the servant that lived there before had broken, and put them there; she told me to clean underneath the stairs, for there were some childrens shoes, and boots of my master's. I then found some more broken glass, and likewise china; I said to my mistress,"There is a great many broken pieces," which she saw; she said if she kept her other servant much longer, she would be the ruin of her, as she was such a careless servant. I asked her for an inventory of the glasses and china, but she put me off from day to day. I went to the mangling-woman, and told her what I had done to my master; she told me never to mind, not to go back, and she sent part of the articles which I robbed my master of: if it had not been for her, I should have gone back and delivered myself up to my master. My husband has abandoned me, and that was the occasion of my going to service. I have worked hard for my bread.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Kensington. On Thursday morning, the 14th of May, about four o'clock, I was on duty - and in Addison-row, at ten minutes past four, as I was leaving duty, and going towards the Uxbridge-road, I saw a woman lying on her face in the horse-road, her face rested on the edge of the footpath - I went over to the body, and when I moved it she felt quite cold and stiff; I turned her on one side to perceive her face, and saw she had been wounded in her left side - her clothes were not the least disordered - there was not the least appearance of a scuffle having taken place; she had on a dark cotton printed gown, a white bonnet, and white kid gloves; the one for the left hand was on, and a half-crown in the glove in her hand - the other glove was off, and clasped in her right hand; I went and told Mr. Parkin, the surgeon; I had not passed that place in the course of the night - it was beyond my beat; I heard no noise or alarm in the course of the night.</p>
               <p>HENRY PARKIN. I am a surgeon, and live in St. Mary Abbott's-terrace. On the 14th of May Davis called me up at about four o'clock in the morning - I saw the body of the young woman lying on the road quite dead; she had a wound in her side - I did not remove her clothes or examine her further till the constable came; I then found merely a wound in her side, which must have been inflicted by something like a knife, but rather large - I have since seen a knife which is capable of inflicting such a wound as to the size, but I do not think it probable that that was the knife - it was a flat wound; that knife corresponded in size with the wound; I had her removed to the public-house, and placed a constable there to prevent her being touched - I afterwards examined the wound more particularly - it was four or five inches deep; it passed between the ribs through the lower part of the heart, and penetrated through the left lobe of the liver - it is a wound which I should conceive would cause instant death; I perceived no other marks of violence on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Any cutting instrument would make such a wound? A.Certainly; I think the knife produced had not done it, as the cut in the liver was done with a very sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was it such a wound as might have been inflicted by the person herself? A. I should think not; it would produce instant death, and prevent her making any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110022"/>cry; she was found in the position in which she appeared to have fallen; her glove was in her hand and nothing disturbed; had she thrown an instrument away, she must have thrown the glove at the same time - and she had not struggled at all.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PRICE. I knew the deceased, she used to go by the name of Mary Ann Brown, but I am certain her name was Mary Ann Waite - she was an unfortunate girl; I had known her about three months - I lived with her for that time; she had lost her right eye, it was quite closed; I knew the prisoner for about five or six weeks before her death - the first time I saw him was when I met him one evening, accidentally, with the deceased at the Camden Arms public-house; I have seen him with her about four times.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing about this pin (producing it)? A. Yes; I saw that pin taken from him by the deceased about a fortnight before her death - he was intoxicated, and she took it from his neckerchief; I saw them together after that - I went out with her on the evening of the 13th of May; she had the pin then in her cap - she took it out with the intention of showing it to Birmingham; I walked with her to between Knightsbridge-barracks and the Halfway-house - I parted with her at the Halfway-house about ten o'clock, and did not see her again till after she was a corpse, at the Holland Arms public-house; I first heard of it about ten o'clock next day, and again between twelve and one; I then went to the Holland Arms, I saw nobody but the officers showing the body; I saw the prisoner before Mr. Sketchley - he was asked if he knew a person named Mary Ann Waite, otherwise Mary Ann Brown, or

             Smith; he hesitatingly said, "No, he did not;" he was also asked if he knew the person who had lost her right eye, went by the name of Mary Ann; he hesitatingly said No, again; I was standing before him at this time - the body was not there; I said, "Thomas, don't hesitate, this is a serious circumstance, poor Mary Ann is murdered, she is no more - speak the truth;" he then said,"I recollect her;" this was about three o'clock - I know they were intimate, he knew her extremely well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When you saw the body the pin was still in her cap the same as when she left home? A. Yes; I first saw the body about two o'clock; I believe the Magistrate sent for him. because I spoke of her going to deliver the pin to him; Mr. Sketchley questioned him. as if he suspected he could give some account of her that night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENNETT. I am the watch-house-keeper of Kensington. I was sent by Mr. Sketchley to Kensingtonbarracks on Thursday, the 14th; I first went and saw the prisoner in the stable saddling his master's horses, and said to him, "Thomas, the gentleman wishes to speak to you at the workhouse;" this was about three o'clock in the afternoon; he said, "It is impossible for me to go now, for I can't leave my master's horse;" I said, "You had better go Thomas;" and kept asking him several times to go - and he said, "Not only that, when master is gone, I am obliged to be at some Club-house in St. James'," which he mentioned - I said, "You had better go down, very possibly if you don't it will cause further trouble;" he said it was an impossibility, and he could not; I said, "You say you won't go?" he said, "I can't go, it is impossible;" I was about turning to leave the stable, his back was to me - he looked round, and said, "What do they want with me?" I said, "I don't know; but I believe it is for you to satisfy them where you were last night;" he said, "I know nothing about the murder whatever;" I had not mentioned any murder to him - nothing more passed; I returned to Mr. Sketchley, and in consequence of directions from him I went to fetch the prisoner down to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The murder had excited attention in the neighourhood, and every body knew it? A. Yes, and that it was committed the night before; the town was all in alarm - I went to him again in about ten minutes, and he was brought down to the barracks by order of his master, Lieutenant Ives - the barracks are three or four hundred yards from the work-house.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JOWITT. I am a foot patrol on the Hammersmith road. I saw the deceased after she was dead; I had known her before by seeing her walking the road as a girl of the town, but I do not interfere with them: I saw her about two o'clock on the morning of the 14th, near the Broadway, Hammersmith, in company with a young man, who appeared to be a gentleman's servant, as he had a round had on, with a cockade in it, and what appeared to me to be a short light drab coat, cut round; I did not observe the rest of his dress; as they passed me, the woman either pushed or struck him, and said, "Do you mean to serve me so?" the man was about five feet three or four inches high; he seemed much shorter than myself; I am five feet nine - I returned, and looked at them as they walked on towards town, but did not follow them; they did not appear to be quarrelling - they walked arm-in-arm. In consequence of a report from the Home Secretary's office, I went next morning to Kensington; I saw the body of the deceased; I then saw the prisoner at the barracks; he had a cap on; I said if he was dressed in that cap the preceding night, he was not the person - after being taken before the Magistrate, he was asked if he ever wore a round hat with a cockade in it; I am not positive whether he said he never wore one, or that he had not got one, but I think it was he never wore one; I was then directed to go with him and Bennett to his room at the barracks, to see if there was a hat with a cockade in it - he said there was a hat of that kind; it was then fetched; I believe two were brought - he put one of then on and on seeing him in it, I thought he resembled the man I had seen more than he did before, but I am unable to swear he was the man - there was no watchman in Addison-row but a patrol - I had passed the corner of the road about four o'clock in the morning, and spoke to Davis as I went by; I know where the body was found; I did not go up far enough to have seen it if it had been there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q.The prisoner is five feet eight inches, it must have been a shorter man than him? A. I thought he could not exceed five feet four, but cannot say positively - he appeared to me shorter than the prisoner does, but it was night. I have known innocent people tell a falsehood when accused of crime.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say when he put the hat on, he was more like the man; that is, a man in a hat is like a man who wore a hat? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHICHESTER REYNOLDS. My father is an attorney. On Sunday morning, the 17th of May, I found a knife forty-four yards from where the body was found, in Addison-row, and on the opposite side of the way; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110023"/>was about three-quarters of an inch stuck into the earth -I knocked my stick against it, and found it; I produce it in exactly the same state as I found it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEE. I am a prisoner in the New Prison, Clerkenwell, charged with felony; I was taken there on Easter Tuesday; I have been in custody several times on charges of misdemeauors and felony: I was there when the prisoner came in; he was brought into the infirmary on Friday evening, between five and six o'clock I think; he was brought up stairs - the turnkey showed him the bed he was to sleep in; we were smoking, and asked him to take a pipe of tobacco, which he did - a prisoner asked him what he was there for, and I immediately told him not to answer any questions; nothing further was asked him then - we talked on different things that evening, and next morning I had some conversation with him; I was cleaning the yard; and after we had been to chapel, he walked up and down the yard, and I walked with him: I said, "This is a terrible piece of business that you are here for;" he said, Yes, it was; I said, "You have left a pen knife in the lodge, I understand;" he said "Yes, I did;" I said, "There looks as if there were stains of blood on the knife, is it so?" he said, "No, it is rust on the pen-knife, which I tried to rub off, but could not - it has been on some time;" I said, "Then she was not murdered with a pen-knife?" "No, (said he), she was not;" I did not say any thing further then, but talked about what I was there for: I afterwards said, "How is it this young woman had a half-crown found in her glove when she was murdered?" he said he knew that, but he gave her no money, so help him God! that night; I said,"How do you account for having the breast-pin found in her cap?" he said, "I am not going to own it, and do not think any body can prove it is mine;" I do not think any more conversation took place that morning: after this I made a communication to the Governor of the prison: we were walking in the yard again; I said to him, "It is a most surprising thing about this murder, about this girl being found; what time did you leave her that night?" he did not reply to that question; I said, "How do you account for getting over the barrack-wall?" he said, "O, I am in the habit of getting over the barrack-wall at all hours in the night;" I think I put the question to him again about the pen-knife, and said, "Was it done with a bayonet? for I understand, (said I,) she was stabbed to the heart;" "No, (said he), it was not; and what it was done with I do not think it very likely they will find;" a great deal more conversation passed about one thing and another - he often told me he hoped what he had told me I should never state again; I believe that was all that passed at that time; but on Monday morning, about one o'clock, he started up in his bed, and said, "By Jesus, Mary, I have done it; where am I?" I then said, "Birmingham, what is the matter?" he said, "Oh! I am only dreaming," or some words to that effect: my bed is nearly opposite his, and I was ordered to pay particular attention to him: I asked how long he had known the girl; he said he had known her at Hounslow, and had known her some time. On Saturday there was a talk about clubbing for a newspaper; he said he would not be one; but we joined, and had a paper between us - I was present after chapel; the prisoner was lying on the bed; Arundel came running up with the paper, and said, "Birmingham, here is your case in the paper, I will read it to you;" the turnkey came up - the prisoner got off the bed, and sat on a seat, and I said, "His countenance seems very much altered since the paper has come in;" and while it was being read, there was an observation in it about his being a good singer, and using a public-house at twelve o'clock at night; I said to him, "Why you told me you was not there at twelve o'clock at night;" he replied, "You know nothing about it - don't you interfere:" we conversed again together before he went to be examined (he expected to go up between eleven and twelve, but did not go up till one), and he said he hoped the saddle would not be put upon the wrong horse, and hoped what he had told me would not go any further; we then talked about different persuasions of religion; and he was saying if he was in Ireland, for 2s. 6d. a man could have absolution - that was all that passed, to the best of my recollection.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Why, you treated him like a guilty man, and asked him how it happened? A. I asked him how it happened; I have no interest in it one way or the other - I told him not to say any thing before the persons in the room; I talked to him about our own affairs, and this conversation came up- I said there seemed to be stains of blood on the knife; I forgot to state that he said, "If I had done the murder with a knife, I should not have been such a fool as to have left it at the lodge;" I never went by any other name than Lee - I was circumsized by the name of Woolf, which is William in English; my wife's maiden name was Gable: when I came from India I took a shop, and put her name over the door - I was never committed by that name to my knowledge, nor ever known by the name of Thompson or Leach; I recollect about Mosely Woolf being tried for a conspiracy - I was committed in October, 1816, by the name of Lee, alias Gable, alias Thompson, and was acquitted at this bar; it was for stealing twenty-nine yards of sarsnet - there was no evidence against me; I was also committed for burglary, but no bill was found for that - the prosecutor was my brother-in-law; I was committed by Mr. Alderman Smith, when he was Lord Mayor, for obtaining goods by false pretences, that was when I employed you - I was acquitted; I have been sworn on the New Testament - I have always attended church and chapel since I have been married; I conceive if I call God to witness the truth, one oath is as binding as another: this affidavit (looking at it) is my writing; it is signed Lee - it is an information against a man having stolen stamps in his possession; an application was made to me by

             of Hatton-garden about it, and I swore to the best of my belief about it - the house was never searched, I believe. I was tried at Hicks'-hall for getting some tea and sugar in the name of Lee, an officer, but I gave my own name and address - I had twelve months imprisonment for it, through false swearing.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ARUNDEL. I come from the New Prison, Clerkenwell, and was there at the time the prisoner was, on Sunday morning, the 17th, he was lying on the bed, when the newspaper was brought in - having it in my hand, I offered to read the article respecting the Kensington murder; he seemed not at all willing, but rather rejected it - I began to read, and after reading a few lines<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110024"/>a stranger entered the room; Birmingham at that moment became alarmed - he immediately got from where he was lying, and seated himself on a form near the fire-place; about the fifteenth line of the article the woman's name was mentioned, and as I read Mary

            . I am a private in the 15th regiment, and know the prisoner very well. I saw him between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock on the night this murder happened - I was centinal that night; he was coming out of his master's room - he went up into the guard-room; when he came out of his master's room he asked me where he could get a light - he got one; when he had put the light in his master's room he went up stairs as if to go to bed - his room turns to the right; (I staid on guard from eleven o'clock till one;) I saw him pull his hat and jacket off - I saw him through the window as if going to bed; I went on guard again at five in the morning - Duckworth relieved me at one o'clock; I saw the prisoner next morning coming down stairs, about a quarter or twenty minutes to six, as if he had just risen from bed - he went into the stable; during the time I was on guard it is not probable that he could come down, and go out without my seeing him.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did he go into his master's room after asking you where he could get a light? A. Yes - he took a light in there; his bed-room is one story high -I stood on the ground, but could see into his window; I saw-him take off his hat, it had a cockade in it - he had a fustian jacket; the barrack wall is low - any body can get over it; the part of the wall he could get over was not in my sight.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what hour did you let me in? A.Half-past twelve; you remained in the hall about two minutes - no other person came in: there was no knock at the door after I went down stairs - the noise was your going out and opening the door; I brought the clock back into the hall - I did not swear I saw the butler take it from you ten yards from the door; I swore you brought it back yourself, and laid it on the hall table.</p>

Last Tuesday week I saw her after seven o'clock in the evening, at the corner of Norfolk-street - I was on the opposite side of the way; she called me, and said she was going to buy a pair of shoes - she bought a second-hand pair, and then asked me to mind her child and bundle for five minutes, while she went to Windmill-street; I kept the child and bundle upwards of two hours - it was a large bundle; she did not come to me, and I went to her lodging and left the child - I kept the bundle; I afterwards gave it to Yarrow's daughter.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of May, in Seymour-place, Marylebone; I said, "Let me look at that hat" - he gave it me of his head; I asked where he got the hat from - he said he bought it at Hall and Johnson's, Edgware-road; I said, "Then you must go with me to Johnson and Hall's" - we went, and saw Mr. Hall in the shop; I asked if he knew that hat - he said Yes; he took it in his hand, and said he thought he had served him with such a hat - Mr. Johnson then came into the shop, and Hall said, "Do you know any thing of this hat?" he said, "No, we have not got such a hat in the shop, nor have we had for some time" - Johnson then measured it, tried it in Hall's presence, and then said they had not got such a hat in their shop; he measured it with his rule, and with other hats - Hall said he thought it was one of theirs at first, but on looking at it he found it was not; I told the prisoner I must take him up - I asked him how he came to pull the lining out of the hat; he said he chewed tobacco, and used to put the quid into the hat, which dirtied the lining - I shewed it to the prosecutor on the 23d; he looked at it, put it on his head, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HALL. I live in the Edgware-road, and am a tailor and salesman, in partnership with Johnson. The prisoner dealt at our shop more than once or twice; on the 22d of May Argust brought him to my shop, and produced a hat - when I first looked at it, he being a customer, I thought he had bought it of me; when I saw it was of consequence, having looked at it more particularly, I was certain I never sold the hat, and that it never was in our shop - I am certain I never had one of that shape; I never sold him a hat, to my recollection - Mr. Okey, of London-wall, is the only manufacturer we buy of, and he has not got a block of that size; it was never in our shop</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not say I bought it of you? A. I did at first, but said if I looked at it I could tell better; you asked if it was not one of ours when you took it off, and I believe I said Yes - you asked if you had not bought it seven or eight weeks ago; I said,"You never bought it of us."</p>

               <p>JOHN WORMAN. This is my hat - I lost it on the 15th of May, with other things; Argust produced it to me on the 22d, I think - I have found nothing else; I bought it of Mr. Burton, at Edgware, eight or nine days before - I had only worn it twice; I bought it to go to my brother's funeral - I was very particular in fitting it, and here are several marks on it inside, by which I know it; the man brought me six or seven before I could get one to fit me - it had a lining in it when it was taken away, and was drawn with a piece of blue ribbon; it is my hat - there had been a band round it, and the band was found in the field.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the hat of Johnson and Hall for 7s. about nine weeks before.</p>
               <p>MR. OKEY. I can find no manufacturer's mark on it- these hats are made in Lancashire and Cheshire, and not in town; I should charge 5s. for it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HALL. I moved to a new shop last Michaelmas, and particularly remarked we had not such a hat in the shop then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. You took her up on suspicion of having a new pair of stays? A. Yes, and other things, as I knew she had no money; I swear to the pencil-case because it is the same as the others; there are quantities of that pattern made - one pair of the gold ear-rings are an old fashioned pattern which you will not find in London.</p>

            . I am the wife of Lyon Samuel. The prisoner lived five or six weeks with us; when she came the first time to us she was very badly clothed - she bought herself several new things; I missed a sovereign on Sunday - I asked how she came by her new stays; she said they were not new; I said, "Now, Susan, have you taken some of my things to get the money to buy these things?" we asked what she had taken - she put her hands into her pocket and pulled out a pencil-case, a pair of scissars, and two or three pairs of silver buttons; I think the buttons were in her pocket, but am not positive - the officer searched her box, which was open - she was present; he found two pairs of ear-rings, a seal, two pairs of cotton stockings, and two pieces of gold - the stockings are both marked B. and were mine; I have eight more pairs like them - my husband bought them ready marked; I do not know whether there were any stockings of her own in the box; I know them by being a particular kind - they have been worn, and are not worth 3s. 6d. - they were fine and not much worn; a key was found in her box which fitted four of my drawers - it would not open her box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any mark on the pencil? A. No; but we have five more like it; I had never worn the stockings - my husband bought a lot second-hand - and I had looked them over and seen them three or four times.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LIGHTFOOT. I am a constable. I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge; Samuel charged her with robbing him - saying he had seen her with several new things, which caused his suspicion; he handed over to me a pencil-case and a pair of scissars - I searched the prisoner's pockets, and found two small bits of gold, a few pieces of cornelian, a pair of blue snaps, a small ring, and two or three beads; I found her box open, and in it this purse, with two pairs of ear-rings, a seal and ring, and three pairs of sleeve-buttons - they were all in the purse; I also found two pairs of stockings - I do not recollect seeing any more stockings there; she said she meant to give the things back again - I found 9s. 2d. in money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Samuel sent me out for a newspaper the day before, and while I was gone she and her mother searched my box; they said nothing to me, but when I came home, I found all the things out of my box: mistress seeing me with new stays, asked me where I got them - I said it was not her money that bought them; she afterwards said I had stolen a sovereign, and sent for an officer - they took off the stays, saying it was not my money that bought them, and I should not have the pleasure of wearing them.</p>
               <p>MRS. SAMUEL. I did not search her box in her absence; the stays were taken off her back - they are at my house; she could have put them on again if she liked - her box is still at my house; her mother was to send for it, but has not - her sister called for it once when I was out; I have not looked at her box since she left, and do not know whether the stays are there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 22d of May, a little before twelve o'clock, I was in Basinghall-street, near the Bankrupt Court, which is about one hundred yards from Mr. Price's - I saw the two prisoners walking together; I am quite sure of their persons, but I did not see them speak - it appeared to me that they were in company; I watched them - they went down Basinghall-street some distance, towards London-wall, and then returned together - I saw them together just by Church-passage, which is right opposite Mr. Price's; I then went and stood in a door-way for a minute or two, then looked out at the door, and only saw Pike, who was walking backwards and forwards, a short distance, opposite the prosecutors' door; I then got just into the doorway again, looked out immediately again, and saw Smith with this cloth on his shoulder, in the middle of the road, about three or four yards from Mr. Price's door; he went up Church-passage - I then walked up towards Pike, who was standing opposite Mr. Price's house, looking towards the door; I saw a person who I knew, and said, "Just lay hold of him;" he then ran away - he must have heard me tell the person to lay hold of him; I then went up Churchpassage and laid hold of Smith with the cloth on his shoulder - I saw Pike again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; the person I desired to take him, brought him to the Justice-room where I had taken Smith - I am certain he is the person I had seen walking up and down; Mr. Price was sent for, and claimed the cloth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner PIKE. He said at the office, that he and Mr. White had been watching us all the morning.</p>
               <p>Witness. I had seen them for an hour, or an hour and a half together, but missed them part of the time.</p>
               <p>MR. PRICE. This is our cloth - this is the paper it was in when taken; I know it by my own writing on the end of the paper, and here is the manufacturer's mark on it - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PRICE, JUN. I am not in partnership with my father - I attend to his business; the length of the piece is marked in my hand-writing, "Nineteen yards" - I have not the least doubt of its being my father's, and on the paper is the figure 3, in my writing.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence (written). - I now stand charged with an offence I am as innocent of as a child unborn. I will endeavour to state the particulars as clearly as possible. About eleven o'clock I got leave from my master to take a walk, having nothing to do - I was to be at home by dinner-time. I went out, and wishing to see the new London-bridge, I went; and as I returned I stopped to look at a picture-shop. I remained there about five minutes; a respectable youth came up, and asked which way I was going - I said towards Long-lane. He then asked me to carry the parcel in question: not suspecting any thing wrong, I agreed to carry it, and he was to give me 1s. when I got to the end of Smithfield with it. I went up Church-passage, and was alarmed by the officer laying hold of me - I immediately told him how I got it; he said the less I said about it the better - he took me to Guildhall, and sent for a person who swore to the property. I hope you will consider it is a very serious case, as it affects my life.</p>
               <p>PIKE's Defence. I was looking after a situation, and called at the prosecutors' to inquire for one; I came out, went as far as the pump to get some water, heard a cry of Stop thief, and ran with other people; the officer said lay hold of him, and I was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY to HERDSFIELD. Q. At what time did you first see them together - was it some time before? A. I had seen them together before it happened, but I had left them for an hour; I saw them together about ten o'clock, coming up Wood-street, with a boy, and followed them into Cheapside, Watling-street, Friday-street, and down the back streets, in company with each other - I then lost them, and went to Guildhall, and as I came into Basinghall-street saw them go by the Bankrupt Court; I followed them below the White Bear public-house, and then they returned.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PRICE. Q. At what time did Pike come into the warehouse? A. Near twelve o'clock - it might be half-past eleven.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Smith a good character.</p>

The prisoner was brought to my office by Bishop - I desired him to take the bag out of the craft; it had been recently plundered, and mended with tar twine; I asked what he had done with the sugar from this little bag - he said, seeing the officer observe him, he had thrown it overboard; I then asked why he threw his needle-case overboard - he gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did I not tell you I found this bag cut open, and I picked up the sugar? A. I asked where he got the sugar he threw overboard - he said he picked it up near the bag, in the craft.</p>

On the Sunday evening I went and took a sculler to the West India Docks - I saw this craft made fast to a barge, loaded with bricks; I went on board and staid till one o'clock in the morning - I went and sat down in the brick barge cabin, and staid there till a little after four; I then went on board this craft again- I lifted up the tarpauling, and found the bag had been cut and some sugar scattered about; I did sew up the bag again with a needle and tar twine, which I always keep in my pocket to stop holes - I did take up about a - lb., and shake it over the boat's side; that is what I told the officer.</p>

On the 28th of April I went into the Star and Crown public-house, at Westminster, about half-past ten o'clock - the prisoners were there, murmuring one with another; McDougall said they should be too late for duty - I immediately said,"Don't let that get you into trouble, the first coach that comes by the door press it, and I will pay for it;" a coach came up, and we all got into it - I did it with a view of taking them to the barracks, and preventing them from getting into trouble; McDougall ordered the coach to stop at the Queen's Head public-house, where we all got out - they said they would not go into the barracks without a pot of beer; we had a pot of beer and a glass of gin and water - I had paid for the coach: I then laid down half a crown to pay the waiter; McDougall took up the half-crown, and went out with the waiter - I did not think he meant to take it away, and called out,"Come, my man. bring the half-crown back!" he made no answer - Whiting said, "Your half-crown is all right;" I was very heavy and sleepy, and sat down on the settle and fell asleep - I had five half-crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence in my pocket; I had a watch, seal and key, a guard to it, and a gilt brooch in my pocket - when I awoke the landlord said, "What has become of your watch?" I felt and it was gone, and so was my money and brooch; I was quite sober, but I had been up the whole night at work at shoemaking - I am sure the money was in my trousers pocket, the watch in my fob, and the guard round my neck; I went to the barracks, and told the serjeant: I saw McDougall in the ranks, and accused him of having my property - this was two or three hours after I lost it.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH GUILTY. I am a serjeant in the 3d Regiment of Foot Guards. The witness came to me about five o'clock in the evening and stated what he has to-day - he appeared to me then as if he had been drinking, but from what I have seen of him since I believe it to be his manner; he pointed McDougall out in the ranks, and said he had robbed him of half a crown, which he could swear to - the serjeant ordered him into the guard-room, and I found upon him 2s. 3 1/2d; I asked who had been in company with him - he said Whiting; about ten o'clock at night Whiting returned to the guard-room - I found on him four or five penny pieces,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110032"/>and two or three small pieces of glass, which appeared to be the glass of a watch; I said, "What have you done with the watch?" he said, "I had no watch" - the next morning he was taken before Captain Phipps, and said, "I know where the watch is, but I have not got it;" the adjutant said he would send a non-commissioned officer to get it, but he said he would send for it himself; I said again in the evening, "If you have the watch, why not give it up?" he then gave it me, and said, "Here it is, I have had it some time."</p>
               <p>JAMES SELBY. I am an officer, and have the watch.</p>
               <p>WHITING'S Defence. When we got into the coach he pulled his watch out, gave it into my hand, and said, "I have not money enough to keep up the spree, we will pawn this watch" - he said so a dozen times, but I would not have it; a soldier, named Barnett, gave it to me at six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FAULKES. There is no truth in this - the waiter saw it safe in my pocket; this is my watch.</p>

            . I keep the White Lion public-house, James-street. On the morning of the 17th, which I think was on Wednesday or Thursday, the prisoner came and asked for change for a sovereign, which I gave him; he opened a paper, and there were three sovereigns in it- I gave him change for one, and he asked me to take care of the other two; I took them, and gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>MARY ELLIOTT. I keep the house where these men lodged. On the Saturday before the prosecutor lost his money, the prisoner paid me 1s., and owed me 8s. 6d.; about a month before that I know he had been in constant work, and had had a guinea a week, but at this time I know he had not much money, for he borrowed the shilling of Thomas.</p>

            . About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 19th of May, I was at the corner of Davies-street; Bramston said that girl had got stolen property, and told me to take her - I found it was a cann of oil; I took her down to Mr. Smethurst's with it, and the foreman ordered the men all up, the prisoner was one - we asked him how he came by it; he said it was a little oil he had taken for his own use, he did not think there was so much.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was said to him before he said this? A. The foreman asked how he came by it - he said he was sent with four gallons of oil to Square Thomas', and he took this little oil out; the foreman said he had better say how he came by it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DOUGLAS. I am foreman to Mr. James Smethurst; the prisoner was his porter for about a month. I measured the oil, and asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said he took it out of the cann at Mr. Thomas'; there had been such oil as this sent there - I believe this to be Mr. Smethurst's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Except from what he said you cannot tell that that was Mr. Smethurst's? A. Certainly not; it is sperm oil - I did not say it would be better or worse for him to tell the truth; the last witness must have misunderstood me.</p>

            . I live in Doughty-street; the prisoner was in my service. On the morning of the 14th of April I gave all my servants notice to quit, and had all their trunks searched: the articles enumerated were in the prisoner's trunk, and some others - he had been about eleven months with me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALL. I am an officer. I found these things in the prisoner's trunk when I searched it; he was present- I asked if he had any thing in it, but what belonged to him; he said No, nothing but his own things - I said,"What do you say to these things?" he made no answer.</p>

               <p>GEORGE AVELING. He never accounted to me for any of these sums; I sent to Mr. Harrison, and found that he had been paid - I then sent for a constable - and the prisoner said, before the constable and myself, that he had spent the money.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH COLE. I am a constable.

               <p>MORRIS NICHOLAS. I am beadle of St. Giles'. I went with Cole; we found this pair of gloves - Nowland identified them; I searched Connor, and found this handkerchief tied round her thigh.</p>
               <p>JOHN NOWLAND. These handkerchiefs are both mine, and are what I lost; this gold pin is mine, I have had it these four years - these gloves are mine, and this key to the best of my opinion; I know nothing of the black handkerchief - I lost some black thread.</p>

               <p>COOKE's Defence. I met Griffen and Connor in Hatton-garden, and they asked me to give them something to drink - I was going to do it, and the officer took me -Griffen gave me the black handkerchief.</p>
               <p>GRIFFEN's Defence. I met Connor, and she lent me the red handkerchief, the pin was stuck at the corner of it - she said it belonged to the person she was sleeping with; I was tucking it down my bosom.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH NEWELL. Mr. Maddock is a lodger of mine. On the 14th of April I was in the front attic, and opened the door on account of the smoke; I saw Maddock's room door open, which it never is, except he or I go in there - I spoke, supposing Maddock was there; he made no answer; I called again, and then the prisoner appeared, and said he was down stairs - I said, "Is he?" she said Yes - she returned into the room again, and came out in two or three minutes with a large bundle; I clapped my hands together, and said, "Good God!" she said, "You will not stop me?" I said I would; I went to take hold of her, but she was too powerful for me, threw down the bundle, and got down stairs - I called out, and she was stopped; there were two sheets and two old quilts of mine- the other property belonged to Maddock, it all came out of his room.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MADDOCK. I lodge at that house. I went out at eight o'clock in the morning, turned the key twice, and hung it up on the door-post; these trousers and other articles are mine - I knew nothing of the prisoner till I saw her at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out on the 15th of April to fetch in some linen for a laundress - on going through Covent-garden I met a woman who had lived as a neighbour of mine; I asked what she was waiting for - she said for a woman named Lewis, who was going to get some things away, as her landlord was very spiteful against her for having a little drink; she asked me if I would go and fetch them - I refused; she went with me part of the way, and then sent me up stairs at this house, and told me to fetch the bundle off the bed, which I did; the prosecutrix said she would stop me - I said the woman I fetched them for was down stairs; I got from her, but a neighbour in the house stopped me, and asked for the description of the woman - I gave it her, but they sent for an officer.</p>

            . I let a ready-furnished lodging to the prisoner for about four months; he left without giving notice - he owed me 1l. 5s.: I missed this property from his room, and have never got it since; he has a wife, I believe; they lived together, and went away together - they took the key, and left the room locked; I did not see him again till the 17th of April.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KING. I apprehended the prisoner, in contest with the prosecutor, for which he was tried yesterday, on another indictment; I took him to the watch-house.</p>

             - we live in Broad-street-buildings, Finsbury. On the 18th of March I saw the prisoner at our house - he asked me to let him have some ear-rings to show a customer; when our traveller came home I sent some by him, telling him to bring back the money or the earrings - the prisoner had worked for us: he said the customer lived at the bottom of the street or place where he lived: he said they were to be under 22s. a pair - I sent six pairs; I think it was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon when I sent them - here is one pair with my marks on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you see them again, before the Magistrate? A. About six weeks afterwards.</p>

            . On the 18th of March Mrs. Levyson told me to take some ear-rings to the prisoner's house, in Europa-place, St. Luke's; I took them, and saw the prisoner, who told me he had got to show them to a lady at the west-end of the town - he wished me to leave them till the next day, when I was to have them or the money for those that were sold: I went the next day, and he said he had not got an answer from the parties - I went the next day, and he made a similar excuse; I called on the Saturday, and then he said his wife was going to have a party on the Sunday, and I should have them on the Monday - I went then, and they had left the premises; I never saw him again till he was taken: I was examined at the office on the 25th of April - I did not see the prisoner before that; I believe three pairs of ear-rings were produced - I left six pairs, and never got any back: one pair I can speak to - these are them.</p>

Three times - I think it was on a Thursday, the 18th of March, that I left them; I gave him a memorandum of the prices, not a bill of parcels, for I wrote "On approbation" - if a thing is left on approbation it is not a bill of parcels; if his customers had approved of any of them they were sold, but the money was to be paid for them - he said he had not had an answer; I have no copy of the note I gave him - it is my duty to make an entry of the things I sell, but when on approbation I put "Approbation" on the bill, and in the book likewise; I believe the officer has the bill, which was left with the prisoner - when he had removed I made inquiry of several persons in the neighbourhood, but could not find where he was; I did not receive a card of his residence till after he was taken up - upon my oath I never saw this card; he never told me a word about his going to remove - this is the paper which I delivered to the prisoner when I left the ear-rings; I did receive a gilt chain from the prisoner on the 18th of March - not a, gold one; I sold it, and should have given him the money if he had not absconded - I was advised not to pay by the officer, till this matter was settled; that was on the day he was taken; he said, "I have a chain, if you can sell it for me," but there was no specific time to pay the money - I should have paid if I could have found him; there was a small pin besides - I sold the pin to one of my customers, and the chain at a shop; I do not know the person's name, upon my oath - I sold it where I never sold an article before; I am allowed to do a little on commission - I sold them about a fortnight afterwards; I made a minute of them, but my book is not here - I was not desired not to part with them for less than 12s.; I was to give the prisoner 6s. for them - I do not know of the prosecutor having been summoned by the prisoner; he might not tell me of every transaction - this transaction of the chain and pin was the only one I ever had with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the price you got for the chain and pin? A. I sold the two for 7s. 6d. - I was to give him 6s.; the value of the ear-rings was between 5l. and 6l. - I did not see a person named Davis at the prisoner's house.</p>

             BAYFIELD. I am a pawnbroker. I have a pair of ear-rings, which were pawned with me by the prisoner on the 27th of March, in the name of John Smith.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WORLEY. I am a pawnbroker. I have two pairs of ear-rings, pawned with me on the 28th of March by the prisoner, in the name of Nugent - I have known him some time, and thought him a very respectable man; he does not go by the name of Nugent, but I thought this might be an error - this is the duplicate which I wrote, but I might not have recollected his name at that moment: I did not recollect his name, I will swear - he lived in John's-row, Europa-place; he gave me a card in the name of Nugent.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALL. I am a constable. I took up the prisoner on the 20th of April - I found in his back room drawer two duplicates, which relate to these ear-rings; I told him I wanted him about Mr. Levyson's ear-rings he at first said it was all right, he had left them with a gentleman at the west-end of the town; I said I had found the duplicates - he then said, "Yes, two pair I sold,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110039"/>three pair I pawned, and one pair a master builder has;" I found him in a room, at No. 7, Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell - Boot had applied to me for a warrant on the 18th of April; Mr. Levyson and Mr. Boot went and pointed out the house to me - the prisoner gave up this note at the office, which Boot says is what he gave him; he went by the name of Samuel Nesbitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever advise the witness not to pay the prisoner this money? A. I met Boot at the west-end of the town, about three weeks after the prisoner had been in custody; he then said he owed him for a chain and pin - I told him I knew nothing about it, but I thought he had better not give it to the prisoner; the prisoner might have said he was in distress.</p>

            . Q. When did you first know the prisoner was to be found in Albemarle-street? A. When Mr. Levyson found out where he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this the bill you left? A. Yes- it is not such a bill as I should have left with any other customer without the receipt; I have put "Approbation" on it - I did not know where to find the prisoner till Mr. Levyson told me of it; I will swear that I had not had this card in my hand for days before, nor one like it - I did see Davis, and asked him where the prisoner was gone - he said he did not know; I swear that I did not know where he lived till Mr. Levyson found it out, which I believe was the day before he took out the warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you mean that Davis had not given you a card, or told you where the prisoner lived? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the goods in question as I usually buy other goods - there is the bill of parcels; I bought them at three months credit, and a three months bill - Boot said, "As this is the first dealing we have had together, we will have a drop of something to drink;" I sent my daughter for some - I said three pairs of earrings would be sufficient, but he would leave the six pairs - he called the day after, and I said they were out, which they were, for people to look at; it appears this has been through treachery, because I summoned Mr. Levyson - Boot sent a message to me to say, that the warrant would be issued; I produced the bill of parcels, and I said to the young man, "Where can I see Mr. Boot?" he said, "I don't know, but I shall see him tomorrow night" - I said, "Give him this card, I wish to see him, as there is a balance between us;" I had no idea of any thing improper, but on that Saturday night I was in distress - I wanted 15s., and I pawned them; Mr. Levyson called at my house on the Thursday or Friday previous to taking out the warrant - I was busy, and had a gold chain in the fire, and sent my lad down to say I should be down in a few minutes; when I came down he was gone - he said to my wife, "It is of no consequence, I will call as I come back," and then he went and got the warrant.</p>

               <p>MRS. LEVYSON re-examined. Q. When did you first know the prisoner lived in Albemarle-street? A. The day before the warrant was taken; I had sent Boot several times to make inquiries, and he could hear nothing about him -I think he had summoned Mr. Levyson about a month before - it was for work; the prisoner did not purchase the things on credit; I told Boot he should wait till the goods were sold, and bring them back or the money; I asked Nesbitt where the customer lived, in order that I might know the distance he would have to go.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. LEVYSON. Q. Had you any transactions with the prisoner? A. He had worked for me; I was summoned by him for 17s. and he took 12s. 6d. for it; I have no recollection of having refused to pay him more than 6s., but I know the charge was considered exorbitant - I think the summons was not for 12s. 6d. - I think I can swear it was not; I think it was more according to my receipts - I certainly paid him 12s. 6d. after Boot had made this delivery; I called at the prisoner's former residence and found he had left - I inquired of his neighbours, but they did not know where he was gone to; I had called at his residence before he was apprehended, as I wished to know whether he lived there, but I had then received information, as I called at Davis', who is another workman, and got this paper; Davis had some work of mine which he kept longer than he should have done - I paid him for the work he had done - this was ten or twelve days before the prisoner was apprehended; I do not know when I told Boot of it; I have no doubt I did mention it four or five days after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.You cannot say where it came from? A. The King's warehouse; he was leaving that warehouse - there are no merchants deposit in that warehouse; it all belongs to the King: he had been in the Docks thirteen years, on and off; he has borne an excellent character, and the Company did not wish to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WALDEN. Robey gave the prisoner to me - I searched him, and found a little tobacco in his pockets - I told him to open his trousers, which he did, and I found a hard lump of tobacco tied up with yarn; he said he had been sampling tobacco in the warehouse, and that he took that off the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did he say he took it for his own purposes? A. He said he took that little bit, and thought it no harm - he bears a very good character; this tobacco itself is worth 1 1/2d. - the duty upon it will be 1s. 10 1/2d.; men are not allowed to eat any.</p>

I lost three fowls on the 17th of May, which I had seen safe the day before; in the morning, my servant brought up two of their heads to the bed-room, about half-past seven o'clock; and I got up, went to the coop, and missed three fowls; I have no hesitation in swearing they were mine.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SMITH. I am a gardener. On the 16th of May, I had information that my masters pond was about to be robbed - I was on watch, and saw the prisoner enter Mr. Pike's premises, which join the prosecutor's; I went in, and secreted myself under a tree - the prisoner came by me with a spade under his arm, between twelve and one o'clock; I had a gun - I presented it to him, and told him to stop; he refused at first, and said he had as much right there as I had, and at last he went with me a little distance; he then seized hold of the gun, and said he would go no further; we had a struggle - I got the gun from him, and he ran to the gate; I pursued, threw him upon a bush, and kept him there till the constable came.</p>
               <p>MARTHA BAGBAY. I live with Mr. Pike - I picked up the fowls in a bush near the gate, about seven o'clock the next morning.</p>

             MILES. I am a constable. I was on the premises watching; I was talking to Mr. Snell, and heard the gardener call - I ran to him, and found him struggling with the prisoner, whom I secured; the night was dark, which I suppose was the reason we could not see the fowls - they were found in the same bush the next morning; the spade was found near the place where they struggled first: I then went to the cage again, and found some feathers in the prisoner's pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at the Bell public-house with some friends, and we stopped there till eleven o'clock; they agreed to take half a gallon of beer home - we went and sat down in a lane, and drank that beer - then I went close to Mr. Pike's; the gardener came out, and said, "You are my prisoner;" I said, "What for?" - he struck me two or three blows, and I struck him, and got away; he caught me again, and threw me down - he came down to the cage, and found about four white feathers in my pocket.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Harrison, a pawnbroker, of Wardour-street. The prisoner came on the 16th of April, and offered a diamond ring in pawn for 6s. - it was worth about 8l.; I immediately went for Clements, and gave her in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I presume she could not know its value, as she offered it for 6s.? A. She could not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I am an officer. I was sent for. and took the prisoner and the diamond ring; on our way to the office I said, "Where did you take this ring from?" she said, "I took it from my mistress's drawer:" I said,"How did you take it?" she said, "I found the keys on mistress's bed, and took it;" I said, "When?" she said,"The day I left my place." I found a key on her, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110043"/>she said was the key of her mother's lodging, in Catherine-wheel-yard, and there I found these other things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was she not told it would be better to tell the truth? A.Certainly not; Mr. Harrison said,"The unfortunate girl has stolen it; she has said as much to me;" I do not believe any promise was made to her.</p>

On the 13th of April I had 26l. 9s. in the bag - there were fourteen sovereigns and a half among it; I had one bag in another - one contained the silver, and the other the gold; I lost them both; my niece used to come every night and sit with me - she left me at half-past nine o'clock in the evening, on the 13th of April; I know at that time my bag of money was secure: after my niece was gone, the prisoner came up without my ringing for her - she said, "Master, do you want any thing?" I said, "Yes, push me nearer the fire, that I may warm my legs, and then I will go to bed;" I know my money was safe then; she pushed me nearer the fire - I sat there about ten minutes, and rang for the boy to put me to bed; when she pushed me to the fire, she could have taken the bag - it was safe when she came into the room; when I rang the bell to go to bed, I felt for my bag to take it to bed, and missed it - I called her up, and said, "Ann, you have robbed me, and shall not go out of the room till I have an officer to search you;" no person had come into the room from the moment she left me till I missed the bag - she denied all knowledge of it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fordham. On the 13th of April I remember Mrs. Fordham going away, about half-past nine o'clock; the prisoner was then in the tap-room - she came to the bar for some porter, I said, "Mary, Mrs. Fordham is gone, and you need not go up-stairs till the bell rings, for she has brought down all the glasses and the waiter, so you need not go up;" the prisoner took the porter - I afterwards saw her talking to a person in the tap-room; she then pulled the door open, and ran up-stairs very quick, without the bell ringing; the person she spoke to is Wright, a sweetheart of her's -I have not seen him since; she ran up-stairs suddenly, returned in five or ten minutes, and after that she came to the bar; I said, "Did the bell ring?" she said No; I said, "Have you been up-stairs?" she said, Yes; I said, "Why did you go - I told you not to go without the bell ringing;" she said, "I only went up to put master to the fire, and put down an apple to roast;" I do not know what became of the young man after that - I did not see him go out.</p>
               <p>Q.You had seen her talking to the young man; now, before your master's bell rang, had you seen that young man in the room? A. yes, he was sitting in the room - I was minding the customers; he might have gone out without my noticing him, and she might have spoken to him without my knowledge - he has not been to the house since; when master's bell rang, the prisoner went up stairs, came down very quick, and said, "You must go up-stairs immediately, ma'am;" I said I could not, she must go; she said, Master said I must come up immediately - I went up, and she went with me; he told me what had happened, and an officer was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She went up with you? A.We both went up together - I did not go up at first, because the till was open, and I could not leave the bar - I told her to go up; she came down, and said I must go, and we both went up - I had seen her speaking to Wright by the fire before she first went up; there was no concealment about their conversation that I knew of - I did not see her speak to him after the bell rang.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her after she said she had put her master to the fire? A. No, not in the tap-room; I saw her, but did not see her speak to Wright, or give any thing to him, but I was busy; the bar is not above a yard from the tap-room; the door opens when people go in or out, and I can then see into the tap-room - I do not know how long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110044"/>Wright staid there; when the prisoner came down, she sat on the stairs; she went into the tap-room, came out again, and sat on the stairs - she knew the young man, and used to call him her sweetheart.</p>

            . I am pot-boy to Mr. Fordham.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he went away a quarter of an hour before the bell rang? A. As near as I can say; I cannot say whether master's neice was gone then, as I did not see her go - Wright went out about a quarter before nine o'clock, I think; if she went at twenty minutes past nine, he must have gone before her - I cannot say whether he went before nine, but to the best of my knowledge it was; he was often at the house - there was no concealment about their manner; I take the liquor into the tap-room; whether I was there much that evening I do not know - there might be twelve other people there when she and Wright were there; they were all men - one was sitting on the same bench, about a yard from them.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the drawing-office of the Bank of England; the Bank keep cash the same as private bankers. The prisoner came to the drawing-office on a Saturday in May, and presented me a cheque for 4l. 13s. 7d.; this is it (looking at it); it purports to be drawn by Parrinton and Son - the Bank have no account with that house; I asked him if his name was Ridgeway, being the name in the body of it; he said it was not; I said, "For whom do you receive it?" he said,"For Mr. Ridgeway;" I asked him in what way he would receive it; he said "Cash" - I handed it over to Mr. George Griffith, and said that gentleman would pay him; Griffith immediately left the office for an officer; the prisoner staid before me, expecting to receive the cash - an officer was brought, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who are the firm that cash at the Bank? A.Parrinton and Son; the signature in the cheque bears very little resemblance to theirs - it is spelt Parrontin; we do not pay cheques under 5l.; they are drawn at times, but we invariably refuse them, except in special cases - if a person drew for a balance under 5l. it would be paid, but not under any other circumstance. I never knew the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. The Bank could not be defrauded by that cheque, as it never would have been paid? A. I cannot say it would not have been paid; I should not have paid it unless under special circumstances - I did not examine their account, to see if it was the balance.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GRIFFITH. I am a principal in the Drawing-office at the Bank. I received this cheque from Wheeler on the 16th of May, and marked it before I parted with it - the prisoner was detained when Leadbetter, the officer, came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He staid of his own accord till the officer came? A. Yes - I went for the officer myself; I had not the slightest hesitation of the cheque being forged.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did the prisoner know you were going for an officer? A. I should think not - I was not gone many minutes.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Strickland, who keeps a coffee-house in Little Queen-street, Holborn. - The prisoner came there one evening - I do not recollect the date, or the day of the week; I found him there when I came home - he slept there: he went out next morning and I went into his room - nothing attracted my attention that morning he remained there; a few mornings after I was sweeping his room, and saw a bundle under the bed; I lifted it up, and some sand came out of it - it was his bundle; I had seen him bring it in, and nobody else slept there - on seeing the sand come out, I opened the bundle, and found several printed papers; I called my cousin, showed him one, and he looked at the others; an officer came, and apprehended the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was his bundle in a handkerchief, or what? A. In a handkerchief; I am sure I had seen him bring that bundle into the house - I was not at home when he first came, but he took the lodging for a month, after the first night, and I saw him bring the bundle in - nobody but him used the room; the last tenant had been gone a fortnight.</p>
               <p>RICHARD STRICKLAND. I keep a coffee-house, No. 38, Little Queen-street. The prisoner came there on Thursday, the 7th of May - I did not see him bring the bundle in; he asked for a lodging for the night, which I let him have, and next day he engaged the lodging for a month - he remained there till he was apprehended: Curtis showed me the papers in his bed-room - I took one of them into my custody, and took it to the Bank, but the Bank was closed, and I gave it to Collins to take there the next day.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL COLLINS. I am Strickland's uncle - he brought a sheet of blank cheques to me, containing four, and at his request I took them to the Bank of England -I gave them to Mr. Griffith; I did not lose sight of them while in my possession.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street, Police-office. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 16th of May, in the drawing-office at the Bank; I took him into a private room, and asked him where he had received the cheque which was in the possession of the cashier - he said he had found it on the Thursday preceding, on Snow-hill; I asked if he was in a situation - he said he was not - I asked if he had been living with Parrinton and Son; I believe he said he had - I searched him, but found nothing - he said he had found the cheque, and would not have presented it had it been advertised - that he had looked in the paper, and it was not advertised, and he thought he had a right to present it; I asked him if any person came to the Bank with him - he said there was a young man, who I saw; I asked where he had been lodging - he said at a coffee-shop in Little Queen-street; I went there, and searched the room which Strickland showed me, and I found eight sheets of cheques, and part of a sheet with three cheques on it - I produce them; this cheque tallies with one of them: it is No. 2057 - the first number on the sheet is 2058; this is the sheet containing the three cheques.</p>

            , JUN. I am in partnership with my father, in King-street, Cheapside; our firm is Parrinton and Son - we keep an account at the Bank: neither of these cheques are signed by me, nor by any body authorised to sign for our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Why, your name is not to them? A. The one for 4l. 17s. is spelt tin and Paro, as well as I can tell, but here is a blot - the prisoner was in our employ at one time.</p>

               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Was he in your employ? A. We employed him as a porter occasionally - nobody signs cheques but me; my father never signs them - it is not his writing: the prisoner was never employed to obtain cheques from the Bank; we draw on this description of cheques.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He of course knew your names perfectly well? A. He did; he bore a good character in our service, and has left us six weeks or two months, only a few weeks before the cheque is dated.</p>
               <p>MR. GRIFFITH. There is no Parrontin and Son keep cash at the Bank, nor any name like it, except the prosecutors; these cheques were applied for for Parrinton and Son, and the cheques presented are drawn on cheques furnished by that application.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who writes the receipt for them? A. The person applying for them - we only insert the figures - the receipt is spelt correctly.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Do not you take a receipt in a book as well as on the counterpart of the cheques? A. Yes - we make a memorandum in the pass-book, but that was not in my possession at the time; it used to be customary not to deliver out cheques unless we had the pass-book, but for the last year that has been discontinued.</p>
               <p>Q. I think within the last year I have been refused cheques for not having my pass-book? A. I think you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110046"/>must be mistaken - it is always the practice to produce the pass-book or a note from the person sending for the cheques.</p>
               <p>RAYNES KELLY. I delivered out these cheques in the usual way: to the best of my belief the person produced a written order, which is usual; I then make a memorandum of the numbers of the cheques delivered, and the party signs it - if the pass-book is brought we enter them there, but if it is a written order we make no further memorandum - I delivered these to a written order, which has been destroyed; we do not keep them: it comes from the party themselves - I should not deliver cheques without an order or the pass-book.(The cheque was here put in and read.)</p>

On the 23d of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at our counting-house - he produced this letter to me - I think it was wafered; I took this bill out of the letter, asked him to leave the bill, and call again in a quarter or half an hour - I saw him about that time, and told him it was too late in the day to do any thing with the bill, but if he would bring it in the morning, I would see what could be done - he came next morning (there were two bills in the letter), and I asked him to leave the bills; when he came the next morning, he was asked who Pinder was - he said he was a seedsman, and at first said he lived where the letter was dated from; I asked if he had not a place in the City - he said, Yes, in the Borough; I asked if that was Mr. Pinder's writing, and he said it was, and said he was his clerk, or in his employ, and that he came from Mr. Pinder - he called two or three times in the course of that day, and in consequence of inquiry I made, the last time he came for an answer I called him into a private room, and told him I should detain the bills till Mr. Pinder came to fetch them - this is one of the bills that was enclosed in the letter - I wrote the word "forged" on it - the name of Pinder is not on it; this is the other bill that came in the letter: I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it after he was in custody that you wrote "forged" on the bill? A. No, before - it was on the return of post; I knew nothing of the prisoner before.</p>

            , No. 17, James-street, Commercial road; then have erased James, and put Jane over the top, 4-18-29: I gave him 4 sovereigns; he gave me 2s. and I gave him 6d.: after he was gone I suspected the note was not good, and followed him, intending to get my money and shoes back again, but seeing a neighbour in his parlour, I went and asked him what he thought of it; I afterwards went to No. 17, Jane-street, and to several houses there, but could hear no tidings whatever of him; in the course of the evening I went to James-street, Cannon-street-road, and inquired at various houses there, but could find no No. 17; I could not find him: a few days afterwards I saw something in the newspaper, went to Lambeth-street, and saw him in the cells - I had his shoes taken off, and believe them to be the pair I sold him that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was the woman who produced the note, and gave it to you? A. Yes, and she gave me the address in James-street - I knew there was no such street, and the prisoner said Jane-street; I believe that was all he said: when I gave him the sovereigns, he rang them on the counter, and I believe put them into his pocket; he did not give them to the woman in my sight - he put them into his pocket, I am sure; I have inquired after the woman, but have not been able to find her - I could have pointed the prisoner out in any part of London, without his having my shoes on.</p>

               <p>SARAH SOLOMON. I am the wife of John Solomon; we live at No. 9, Little Prescott-street, Goodman's-fields; he is a general dealer. Two 5l. notes were given to me by a female on Easter-eve, the 18th of April, between eight and nine o'clock; I suspected them to be forged, and detained them, in consequence of which, three men called between ten and eleven the same evening - I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them, I was so agitated; on the Monday, at two o'clock, three men came again together - the prisoner was one of those; they said, "We want the 5l. note you have detained;" I said, "I told you on Saturday night I could not give it you, for I have not got it;" (I had delivered one 5l. note up on the Saturday evening to them, and one to the officer) they said, "Oh, you only want to rob us of the note; we shall have the note:" I said, "I really have not got it; it is at Lambeth-street office;" the prisoner said, "Well, then, if it is there, I will go and demand it at the office;" I did not wish to go, but he forced me to go with him - we came to the office door; Healey said, "Is this the man who has come for the note?" I said, "yes, here they are;" the prisoner said, "I have come for the note, and will have it;" Healey said, "Then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110049"/>come in before the Magistrate;" the prisoner went in, but the other two did not - I saw the note I had delivered to the officer - it was one of the same I received from the woman; I had delivered the other to the three men.</p>

            , of Upper East Smithfield, a tailor. I saw the prisoner at my father's shop about the 1st of April, and on the 9th or 10th; he bought a jacket the first time, paid in gold, and I gave him change; the second time he bought a jacket and waistcoat which came to 1l. 16s., for which he tendered a 5l. note - I took it, and asked his address; he said, "William Johnson, No. 23, Lant-street, Borough;" this is it - this is my hand-writing on it; I gave him the change - he took the clothes away and ordered a pair of trousers, which he agreed to pay me for; he was to call for them on the Friday - they were made for him, but he never called.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you know him before you had these dealings? A. I never saw him before; I saw him yesterday in Newgate, and did not recognize him; he was produced to me in the yard among the rest of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a turnkey of Newgate, and was present about a fortnight ago when Lavender came and asked to see Charles Jones - he was in the yard at the time; it was in the middle of the day - there might be upwards of twenty prisoners in the yard; the prisoner was walking up and down with the rest, for Lavender to point him out if he could - Lavender was looking through a window, and had full view of all the prisoners in the yard; the prisoner did not come up to the window - he came towards the rails in front; they all walked up and down the yard several times - no means were used by me to conceal him, but I understand he had a different hat on to what he wore before; he did not come on any other day to my knowledge - I had told the prisoner a person was coming to identify him. and, I believe, he changed his coat after I told him so - we always tell them when any body is coming to look at them.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q.You told him somebody was coming to look at him, and he changed his dress? A. Yes; the window is grated: it is a good square place - the men walked up and down the middle of the yard in front.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you many people recognized through the window? A. Yes; as he could not identify him through the window, I opened the gate and let him go close up to the rails to see better.</p>

On the 8th of May I went to bed about eight or nine o'clock and my house was all fast then - I was ill, and sat up in bed about three o'clock in the morning; it was getting day-light - I heard a great noise at the barn-door, listened, and presently heard the lip go down - I live quite alone; I heard somebody on the top of the oven, and then I heard them breaking the oven door open - they then came to an empty room next to my chamber, and there they pushed twice against the chamber door, which was locked, and the third time the staple flew out, and in they came two by two - there were four of them; I was sitting up in bed, and Hastings, when he saw me, drew back - I knew him before - he had carried my rolls about for a long time; I have known him all his life; then Slater came in - I have known him a long time, his friends live in London - but he knew my house, and was in it the day before; I did not know the other two persons - Slater caught hold of me by the throat, held me down, and said, "Lay there, or it will be the worse for you;" he then said, "Where is your money?" I told him I had got none; he said he knew I had - (I had none in the house) - he then said, "Where is your watch?" I told him it was at Hounslow, I had left it at the watch-maker's; he then asked where my breeches were - I told him under the pillow; they took my breeches from under the pillow and searched them, but there was no money in them; he then took the breeches, threw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110050"/>down in the room, and went to a corner cupboard, and said,"What is here?" I said there was nothing but a few old receipts which were of no use - he searched all the crockery, there was no money there; he then came to my chest - there has been no lock to that chest ever since I was robbed before; he opened it, and took up a patched coverlid, looked at it, and threw it down - then he took up a plain sheet, he looked at that, and threw it down; he then took and pulled four little drawers out of the chest - I said,"There is nothing there but old receipts;" after they had looked at the other end of the chest, they took out a pair of white cotton stockings, and threw them on the landing-place to the other three; they came in with a candle burning, but it was as light as day - then he took out a clean flowered waistcoat, and threw that to the other three, who stood against another room on the landing-place; I did not see him take any thing more: he then came, caught me by the throat again, and said I should show him where my money was - he pulled me out of bed - he said, "Follow me;" I followed him half way down stairs - the other three were down stairs then; I heard them say, "Don't let Spurling come down here;" Slater hallooed then, and said,"Don't you come down here or it will be the worse for you - go back;" I then went back into my room; I saw them leave the premises by the barn-door - I am sure the prisoners are two of them, for I saw them come in; I was sober - I had only drank a little beer; they remained in the house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before they left. I at one time used to keep money in the house, sometimes 100l. - Hastings knew that; I was going to have them taken directly, but I took the opinion of a gentleman, who advised me to let it rest; Hastings came, blowed me up, and said he would know my liver out; the patrols took him up last Friday week - when I got up I found my shoes gone as well as the other things; I got up directly they went away, and shut the barn door - I did not go before the Justice of the Peace, as Mr. Sherbon advised me to let it rest - but I told my daughter of it; I was not before the Justice till Friday week - Hastings was in custody then; he lives at Hanworth - Slater was in custody last Tuesday; I spoke positively to their being the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You have never been charged with doing any thing yourself? A. No; I knew Slater, but had not seen him lately, till he came into the house and sat down - there was no disguise about them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did he not come to your house to pay you a visit, and drink with you? A. He came to the door next day, and said will you be any thing towards beer; I said No. I had no money - he said I should have some, and fetched a pot; I tasted it once - his wife was with him; I did not show them over my house - I knew him very well, and should have taken him, but I was advised to let it rest, for they would burst themselves, and bring all the blackguards in the world to swear against me; I did not take him up for a month, as Mr. Sherbon, who is the biggest man in the place, said let it rest - when Slater came next day, I did not ask where he lived in London, but I heard as he had told Mrs. Prior; I told him not to send for the beer - he might have stopped there ten minutes: it was about ten or eleven o'clock; I did not charge him with robbing me, or go before a Magistrate - Slater had also been visiting me the day before the robbery, and drank with me, but I did not know where he slept at Bedfont; the constable lives about half a mile from me - I knew Hastings lived at Hanworth; I am not in the habit of drinking, nor have I been wrong in my head - I have never found my property; I am seventy-six years old - Slater might have told me where he lived in London, but I took no account of it, if he did; my son found him out.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FORD. I am gaoler of Bow-street office. On Friday, the 5th of June, Hastings was brought to the office in custody on this charge; he was remanded, and when he came out I locked him up: in consequence of information I went and took Slater, at his own house, No. 10, Lambeth-marsh; it was a boot and shoemaker's shop - I understand he lived there; he was at work in the shop - I told him I took him for a burglary at Bedfont, at Spurling's house; he said he knew nothing about it - he came very quietly with me; I have known him these two years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is he? A. A shoemaker; Spurling's son told me where I should find him.</p>
               <p>HASTINGS' Defence. I work at Hanworth. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th of May a man came from Bedfont, and said there was a man from London whom I had not seen for fourteen years, and he wished to see all his friends before he left - I went to the Black Dog public-house, where Slater was and was with him till six; I went from there to the Duke's Head public-house, left about half-past nine, and got home as the clock struck eleven, and can prove I was at home till six in the morning.</p>
               <p>SLATER's Defence. I was brought up at Bedfont - I came to town at sixteen years old, and went down there when I was twenty-nine, to see my friends; the first person I saw was Spurling - I sent for a pot of beer, and sat drinking and talking with him; he made me promise to call next morning before I went away - I went to Smith's and slept at his house; he called me next morning - I got up and called on Spurling again - we had two pots of beer, and talked together a long time; he gave me the address of his daughter, who lived in town.</p>
               <p>JANE PAINTER. I live at Isleworth. My husband is a horse-keeper - I first saw Hastings at the Bell public-house, kept by Smith; it was on the 7th of May - I went there with his wife; he was lying by the fire quite tipsy - we went with him to Hanworth, where he lives, and got there at twelve o'clock at night; it is about four miles from Hanworth - it was Bedfont fair time - it was on the 7th, the Thursday of the fair; I had been to the fair - I do not know what month it was; it was January - I am sure of that.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Fleming, a pawnbroker, of Fleet-market. The prisoner came on the 13th of April, towards the evening, and produced a silver tablespoon; he asked 6s. on it - I had suspicion, but advanced it; next day I heard he was in custody, and saw him: I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say any thing to him? A. I pointed out the crest, but he said he was a dealer in these things - he was dressed as he is now; I thought him a Jew dealer: some poor men deal in silver goods; he said he was a housekeeper, and lived at No. 5, Chancery-lane.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I knew the prisoner by working for my master, Mr. Merrell, a tailor - he came there on the 6th of May, about twelve or one o'clock, and asked for work; he was told Mr. Merrell was not at home - he came up stairs into the workshop, up three pairs of stairs, and must have passed the clock; he staid there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then went away - I did not see him again; he said he should go and get a pot of beer over at the Red Lion public-house, and as he went out I looked out of the window, and saw him with the clock under his arm - that was at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110052"/>one o'clock; I followed him, and took him in Whitechapel, with it under his arm - I asked him to go back with me; he refused, and began kicking and fighting, and I lodged him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not another person with me when you saw me with the cloak? A. Yes; I never saw that person with the cloak, but when I took it from you I gave it to a boy to carry it; the man who was with the prisoner snatched the cloak from the boy - we got it from him, but could not secure the man; that man did not interfere before that. The prisoenr had got to Whitechapel before I stopped him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner: I asked him why he had not paid his master the 5s. he had received on that Sunday - he said that was not all, he had to account for 2l. he owed his master.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLLS. I did not allow him to owe me any money - he should account every night, and we took what money we could get of him - sometimes we could not get any.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor was in the habit of debiting him for all beer he carried out, and deducting the amount from his wages, as he frequently gave the customers credit.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLLS re-examined. Q. Did you stop his wages? A. I never had an opportunity of doing it - he sold beer, and took the money: some nights we could not get above 3s. or 4s. of him - I was to have given him 4s. a week, but he never applied for it; he was to sell beer on my account.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you dealt with the witness before the prisoner came into your service? A. No; she had not been in the neighbourhood: I knew the prisoner owned me money, and he was scolded for not bringing in his money - we knew he had taken more money every week, and said there were no wages due to him.</p>

On the 9th of May the prisoner came for a yard of silk-twist to match a piece of dark cloth he had in his hand; he took up one or two, and asked if that colour would do - I said, "No, we have not got it;" he then went out with one ball in his hand, and as my father was not in the shop I did not like to tell him of it; but when he was gone I told my mother - he had laid the piece of cloth over the drawer, while he took the twist with his left hand- I followed him out till he had got two or three doors off; I then told him to come back as he had got a ball of twist - he said he had not; I brought him back, and called my father - he told me to go to Mr. Avis, who came and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see him take the ball of twist? A. Yes, but I could not see the colour of it - it could not have been swept off the counter; he did not put his hand on the counter - it was about ten o'clock in the morning; he came very readily back - he emptied one of his pockets while I was gone; he put his left hand under the cloth and took it.</p>

            . I was at home when the prisoner was brought back - I saw him throw the ball of twist out of his left trousers pocket, behind a box near the shop door; I saw, I think, half a crown, and he said he would rather pay than be grought to disgrace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is rather a lively sort of colour, is it not? A. Yes; a person could not see the colour if a cloth were laid over it - I was not in the shop when he first came in; I saw him come in and throw it down - he turned out his right hand pocket, and this was in his left; I was near the door.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Running Horse in Piccadilly. The prosecutor came to our house with another man, and had a pint of beer; I think it was the prisoner, but he was not dressed as he is now - he looked like a shepherd, and had a brown smock frock on.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH OSTELL. I am an officer. The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody; when I came up he threatened to knock the prosecutor down - I found this ribbon in the inside pocket of his trousers, which the prosecutor says was attached to his watch; I asked how he came by it - he said it did not affect this case, and he would not tell me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw him till he had me taken into custody; what he has said is false - I never was a shepherd. I am a hard-working man; I thought it was very hard for a man to accuse me of a thing I never did - I never was baffled or hauled up for such a thing as this; I get my bread honest, not as many of them do-I have a right to speak out; I think I stand in a very queer state - it is an astonishing thing that a man like me should lay in such a dark place as this, I only wish him to share the same fate.</p>

On the 15th of April I was in the parlour behind the shop- the two prisoners came in between eight and nine o'clock: the lad rang the bell, and said they wanted stays, which it is customary for a female to show - I went and saw them near the counter; I saw Sullivan take something off the counter - I went behind them, and saw something under each of their arms, but could not see what it was; a customer came in, whom I told my lad to attend to, and I would attend to the prisoners - they then asked for some caps, which I showed them; they did not like them, but said they would call another day - when they had left the shop I missed some lace, and sent the boy after them; he brought back Sullivan, and I told her what I suspected; she said I was wrong - she had done nothing: I sent my lad for Howitt - she came back, and I charged her with it- while I was talking with her she dropped a card of lace into a chair; I sent for an officer: before he came Sullivan begged me to forgive them - I said I could not, and took them into the room; when the officer came he found a pair of stays in Howitt's hand, and two pairs of French gloves, which they said they had bought in the City; the stays were not mine - they belonged to a person named Lee; the lace was mine.</p>

I received information on the 10th of January, and took the prisoner in a skittleground in the Five-fields, in April - as soon as he saw the prosecutor he called him Coachman, and seemed to know him; I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing Groves' watch - he said, "If I have robbed him of a watch, I will go with you;" I found 18s. and some copper on him - he never denied it, nor confessed it; the watch has never been found.</p>

I told him I did not know; he then asked me where the other boy was; I told him I did not know; he then let go my collar - I could not tell him where to find the other boy, and he collared me again</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, searched the prisoner's box, and found a pair of gloves, two collars, and 2l. 3s.; I took him to the watch-house -I neither threatened nor promised any thing - I went to the watch-house on Sunday to take him some dinner, and asked how he came to rob his master of his cash; he said he had got acquainted with a girl, and got into bad company - I asked what had been the amount of the most money he had taken: he said the first time was 2l., the second time 3l., and the third time 6l.; I asked him if he recollected what he had taken at any time - he said he could not, but he thought he had taken from time to time from 20l. to 24l.; I asked him if this was not the key, he had opened the box with - he said it was part of it - I had found this part of the key on him; he said it was part of the key, and he had thrown the other part of it away; I tried it to the lock, and it corresponded exactly with the wards.</p>

               <p>MR. GREEN. It is not correct. I detained him on Friday evening while I sent for his father; that was before I sent for the officer - I did not threaten or promise him at all; I sent to his father to know if he had given him some things, which were in his box - these gloves are ours, and have our private mark on them; the shirt collars have my initials on them.</p>

             - I met the prisoner Ferris and another in the street - I did not know either of them before; I went with them down to Bath's house and saw her there; I remained in the room I first went into - the two girls, Britten, and I were in one room - Bath came up and brought half a pint of gin which the girls had ordered after we went into the room; Britten gave the money for it - I do not know who he gave it to; I knew Britten at Calcutta - he had come over in the same ship that I did; he went away with the other girl; Ferris stopped with me; I had fifty-six silver Spanish dollars in a bag in my breeches pocket, and I had some other money in my waistcoatpocket - I put the bag on the pillow - I was on the bed with the girl; I put my purse on the pillow before I got on the bed - she saw me put it there, and told me it would be more safe in my hat; I then put it into my hat, which I put on a chair near the head of the bed; I

             the chair quite close to the bed on my right side; I was on the bed for six or eight minutes, and somebody from below stairs called her by some name - she was on the bed - she jumped up and went down stairs - I got up as quick as possible after her, looked for my money, and it was gone; I had not seen her take it - she went out of the room very hastily; I got off the bed instantly - my hat was not taken; I was perfectly sober, and neither saw nor heard any one come into the room; when she was called, she said, "I am called, and must go down and see what is wanted;" I do not know whether she said she would return - I went down stairs instantly and saw Bath, and asked where she was; she said she was gone away, and that Britten's girl was gone with her; I asked where Britten was - she said he was up stairs, and I told her of my loss - I told Britten when he came down stairs, and told him to go for a watchman; he brought a man in - I told him what had happened; I sent Britten to the office - I staid there till he came back; while he was gone, Bath told me I should not get the money; an officer came and made a search, but did not find any money at the first search -Bath had gone out - she came in in about half an hour; a young man and another old woman had been left in the house with me; when Bath came back, she came in at the back door, and went up stairs; she came down in about a minute, and told me and the officer to go and search about the bed for the money - we went up stairs; I had taken my hat with me when I went down stairs, and had it on; I am quite sure my money was not in my hat then; I and the officer went up and searched the bed, and Bath pulled sixteen dollars out from the bed in my bag; I cannot tell what part of the bed she took it from, but am sure I did not put it there; no more was found; when I put them into my bag there were about fifty-eight dollars in it; I had counted them that morning, and am quite sure there were fifty-six; I did not see either of the girls for two days after; I know Ferris, and am certain she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you drink any of the gin? A. No; I know I lost fifty-six dollars; I had fifty-eight or fifty-nine in the morning, it was all stolen; I was sober - I do not recollect whether the window curtains were drawn; the bed was not opposite the window, the side was to the wall; she got up once before the voice called, and somebody came to the door - the door was fastened with a chair; the room was quite light - I had given Ferris 2s. from my waistcoat pocket; she got off the bed at the side, getting over me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you been drinking with the women before you went to the house? A. Yes; directly I went down Bath told me the girls were both gone - she said she had not got the money; I waited in the kitchen while she was absent, with two persons -I had seen nobody else in the house; the officer had searched the bed and could not find the money - Bath produced it from between the bed and the sacking.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Some things were found down stairs? A. Yes; two bonnets and two shawls, which I think were the bonnets they wore when I met them - Bath was out when the officer came and searched the bed; she came in, went up stairs, then came down, and said "Let us go up and search the bed:" we went up - the officer had searched the place in which she found the money; if it had been there then he must have found it - it was my bag, and only sixteen dollars in it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I was sent for a little before five o'clock, and went with Britten to the house of Bath; I had never been in the house before - I knew she lived there; she was not within - the prosecutor, a young man and woman, were there; the prosecutor told me he had been robbed of fifty-six dollar - I searched the lower part of the house, and in the cupboard I found these bonnets and two shawls - I went up stairs before Bath came in; the prosecutor showed me the bed he had been lying on - I searched it, and every part of the room; I took off the clothes and stripped the bed - if this bag of money had been there I must have found it; I went down stairs to wait till Bath returned - she came in hastily at the back door, and went up stairs very fast, without coming into the room where I was; it is a corner house - I was going to follow her, but she came down immediately, and I met her; I told her a robbery had taken place in her place - she said, "If you go up stairs I think you will find some of the property now;" I had not told her. I had been searching - I went up stairs with her and the prosecutor; she took off the bed, took up this bag, and said"Here it is;" it was about the centre of the bed, between the bed and the mattress - I had searched there before, and it could not have been there without my finding it; I said it was a very strange thing that it should be there then - she said Kit had given it her at the bottom of the street; I said, "What Kit?" she said Kit Ferris - we went down stairs again; I showed her the bonnets, and said, "Who do these belong to?" she said, to the two girls who came in with them; she told me she put the money into the bed herself, when she ran up stairs - I knew Ferris before, and knew who she meant by Kit; Miller afterwards apprehended her on the 8th - there are sixteen dollars in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Bath at first deny all knowledge of the transaction? A. No; she said Ferris<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110066"/>gave it to her - she is a married woman, and keeps the house; I do not think there was a key to the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When you arrived all three women were absent? A. Yes; Bath said Ferris gave her the money at the bottom of the street - she described the other woman.</p>

               <p>BATH put in a written Defence, admitting that she had placed the bag in the bed, but not with intent to withhold it from the owner, thinking it the most adviseable way to return it - that Ferris had given it to her, and assured her all the money was in it.</p>

On the 11th of May, a little after three o'clock, I was going to the house, and saw the prisoner come out -I had never seen him before; I am positive it was him, because I looked at him very stedfastly - he had some cloth; he appeared to be in the act of adjusting it on his shoulder - it was in the folds, but was not tied up; I went into the house, and made inquiry; I went after him - I turned the corner of Nassau-street into Union-street, and saw him running along Union-street, with the cloth in his possession; he saw me coming after him, and increased his speed, and turned the corner into Well-street, where I lost sight of him - I soon turned the corner after him, and saw the cloth lying against a shoemaker's door in Well-street; he was then running down Well-street - he turned into Mortimer-street, and I lost sight of him at the moment, but soon regained the view of him, and saw him turn into Titchfield-street; I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Where is Bulmer now? A. He left a fortnight or three weeks after; he was a mercer, and I believe has failed - he had been there two or three months; I cannot say he did not employ the prisoner to carry the cloth.</p>

            . I live in Rebecca-court, Well-street, and keep a shoemaker's shop, at No. 49, Well-street. On the 11th of May, as I was at work, I heard the cry of Stop thief! in Unicorn-street, and saw the prisoner coming along with two rolls of cloth on his shoulder; when he got opposite the shop-door I saw him full in the face - he threw the cloth right in my face and ran down Well-street with his hat in his hand - I took it up, and kept it till he was brought back, which was in about five minutes, by Morrish and the last witness; this is the cloth - I carried it after the prisoner, and laid it on the table of the Sir Isaac Newton public-house, and left it in the care of Wall, the officer.</p>

            . I am a printer, and live in Westmorland-buildings, Aldersgate-street. On the 11th of May I was in Mortimer-street - on crossing Well-street I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running down Well-street; he turned round into Mortimer-street, and into Titchfield-street - a young man laid hold of him, who was in front of him; I came up immediately, and took hold of him on the other side - he asked me to let him go, as he had done nothing; Arthur came up, and asked me to bring him back; and on bringing him back he asked me to beg of the gentleman to let him go as he knew he had done very wrong, he had been brought into it by others - that there were two men with him at the time, and they saw the cloth through the parlour window, and told him if he would go and get it they would give him some money - I took him to the Sir

            . I live in Nassan-street; I keep the house; Mr. Bulmer had lived with me about two months; he called himself a woollen-draper, and said that was his place of business - I have seen cloth in his room, which was the front parlour; I have seen different coloured cloths there - I believe he used to take some out, but I never saw him; I never saw the prisoner before -I never knew that Bulmer frequented the Swan: he left my house a fortnight ago last Friday - he told me he was a married man; I never saw his wife - he left every thing behind him, I believe, except what he had on his back, which was very trifling - I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he owe you any rent? A. I believe one week was due the week before the cloth was taken: I seldom saw him in the day time - the property left behind is not worth 5s,</p>

             re-examined. None of my lodgers deal in cloth except Bulmer, to my knowledge: I am a plasterer; I had no cloth in the house - I have seen black, olive, and blue cloth in Bulmer's room; the olive was about this colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you have suffered the cloth to go out unless the rent was paid? A. I should not think of stopping it for such a trifle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have known Bulmer for a long time. On the day in question he asked me to get some things from his lodgings, as he was afraid it would be seized for rent; I went with him - he gave me this cloth, and took some himself; he said, "Wait a few minutes till I get to the top of the street, and then follow me:" I heard a cry of Stop thief! and threw it down.</p>

            : I knew them all as neighbours, and used to speak to them when I saw them; I saw them that night drinking some beer at my cousin's with my husband: I took a drop of beer with them - my husband and my cousin paid for it; I went and fetched some more beer - I think we had three pots while I was there; I only went with the woman who fetched it - it was all brought together - I staid till it was all drank; my two cousins and my husband paid for it; the prisoners did not pay any thing - they drank; we came out together, the prisoners. my husband, and I; Humphries asked my husband to give him a share of a pot of beer - my husband went to the sun public-house, and gave him a pot - I went with them; the Sun is in Lisson-street - all the three prisoners went and tasted the beer - they did not stay long, for the house was being shut up; they went away, leaving me and my husband talking to a person; I and my husband went back to my cousin's again, and staid about half an hour - we had no more drink - we left to come home about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock; I had left a candle on the table, as I usually do when I do not mean to stop long; I found the candle was burning - it was taken off the table where I had left it, and put by the side of my box; it stood on the floor - one box had been taken off another - neither of them had been locked; I had locked the room door when I went away - I cannot say whether I unlocked it or no when I went in, for I looked through the key hole, and finding the candle moved, I was confused, but am certain I locked it when I went out, and had the key in my pocket; I left the window shut - I found it wide open, put up; I had merely pulled it down- there was no fastening to it; I am sure I put it down when I went out - it was open sufficient for a man to get in and out - any man could reach the window with his hand from the ground outside, but could not put it up unless he stood on the window-shutter below; I saw nothing touched in the room except missing out of the boxes my husband's coat, a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, a gown, a petticoat, two shifts, two handkerchiefs, and a shawl; I had been to a club that evening, and took a shawl out of the box, and every thing was safe then - the things are worth above 2l.; I had been to my cousin's twice before on that evening, and saw the prisoners there each time I went -

               <p>MARY BROADFIELD. I live in part of the same house as the prosecutor, on the ground-floor. I know William and Jane Humphries by sight - I have know them two years; I know Phillips by sight - Humphries and his wife lived in the next street; I remember Willetts going out on the 8th of May - Jane Humphries came in with her about ten o'clock, and they went away together; I never saw nor heard any thing of them till half-past eleven, when I was in bed, and heard a very great noise of two persons, as I thought, going up stairs - I heard a very great noise up at their door; I called out three times,"Who is there?" but they did not answer me, and then I heard them come down stairs; I opened my door, looked out, and saw Jane Humphries going out of the passage into the street, and turn towards Willetts' window - the stairs lead to no place except Willetts' room; I am sure it was Jane Humphries - she had no bonnet on; I knew her perfectly well - I had seen her before with Willetts; I was in my own room, and Willetts came in to get a light of me; when I called out to know who was there, they mumbled something, and I heard somebody say they are not at home; I did not know whose voice it was - I did not see Mrs. Humphries after I saw her go out; soon after that. Willetts and her husband came home - I heard them going up a airs; I went no further than the step of the door, and saw nobody but Jane Humphries, but am certain there were two persons, if not more.</p>

               <p>Prisoner JANE HUMPHRIES. Q. Did you see me with Willetts? A. Yes, at ten o'clock, and I saw her going out of the passage, when I was alarmed.</p>

            . I live at No. 25, Little James-street, about one hundred and twenty yards from Willetts'; I keep a horse and cart. On the 8th of May, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, I was smoking my pipe over my half-hatch door - I have known Humphries from a child and his wife, and I knew Phillips - I saw Mr. and Mrs. Willetts and the three prisoners all go up the street towards the Sun public-house; I did not see them go in, and in the course of four or five minutes I saw Humphries and Phillips come running back again as hard as they could towards Willetts' house, which is in Lisson-place - they turned down Lisson-place; I continued at the door, and saw them come back a few minutes after, walking; Phillips walked first - they were about three feet from me; I heard Humphries say to Phillips "D - n your bl - y eyes, it won't do: old mother Broadfield is up;" Phillips answered, "Come on, you b - r, what are you afraid of;" they were then coming in a direction from the house - they went towards the public-house, and I saw no more of them; I am sure they are the persons, but I did not see the woman.</p>

James-street, and the female was standing at the door - I went round my beat at half-past eleven o'clock, and saw the two Humphries come running up James-street; I have known them these twelve months - they were going from Lissonplace; I was about eighty yards from them, and could not tell whether they had any thing with them - the man had his hat holding it over his arm.</p>

On the morning of the 9th of May, the female prisoner was brought into the yard, charged with robbing the prosecutor - the prosecutor named the two male prisoners to me, and in a short time they came to the gate; as soon as I laid my hands on Humphries, they said there was no occasion to do that, for as she was taken they had come to deliver themselves up - I then went for the prosecutor and his wife, and they identified them; I locked them up, and on Humphries I found a pen-knife - I went to his lodging in Charles-street, Lisson-grove, and in a box found some duplicates - Humphries admitted that they were his lodgings; I found this box, containing the certificate of their marriage, and several other duplicates not relating to this property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. It was perfectly day-light? A. Yes; I saw no person near - I was not more than ten minutes gone for the constable; the child is now alive, and appears in very good health - it is a very fine child.</p>

            . I am a constable of Acton. On the 3d of June, a little before seven o'clock, Nelhams came to me in a very agitated state - I went with him, and found the child lying on its back in a deep ditch in the field; there is a footpath through the middle of the field, but it was full three hundred yards from that, quite out of the way of passengers - it would be a trespass to go there; the ditch was very much grown over with stinging-nettles and brambles - I could not get the child out without tearing a large hole in its cap; it was as black in the face as my hat- I thought it was a black child; its face and finger ends were quite black, but those appearances turned out to be the effect of violence - its mouth and eyes were covered with dirt; it had shed tears, which had softened the mould about its eyes - I think the dirt had been put about its eyes; I do not think it was from the grass - it did not appear dirt which had got on it by being put into the ditch. but as having been put there on purpose; the child was barely alive - its eyes protruded quite out from the sockets; I ran across the fields as fast as I could to my own house -I got a woman to put it in warm water; we tore the clothes off as fast as we could - it had an old white bed-gown and a common baby's blanket, which children usually wear: it was washed immediately, and as the woman laid it across her lap she screamed out - I looked down, and saw a piece of black ribbon round its neck, which I produce; it was tied round very tight, so much so that the flesh had swollen above it - I did not observe it till the child was laid back.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, were the appearances the child exhibited in its face and finger ends the result of that being tied? A. It was; for the moment I cut it the child fetched its breath and resumed its natural colour very shortly - I have no doubt the colour was the cause of this being round its neck; I had to cut it in two or three places, it was so tight, and was twisted in the child's cap-string - it got better immediately, and in the course of two hours resumed its colour quite; it was twisted round twice, if not three times - I know I cut it a second time, if not a third, to get it off; I was very much agitated, and cannot say which - it is quite well now, and in Court; I should think it was about three weeks old - I took the prisoner in custody on this charge; I had known her by sight about a year ago - I saw her on the Saturday following, (the 6th,) in the neighbourhood of Hammersmith, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, in company with a young man; I stopped her and said, "I want you: I have been looking for you a good while; your name is

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Acton. I was called in about seven o'clock that evening - I went and found the child as the officer has described - it was perfectly black in the face, and at the ends of its fingers, which arose from the pressure of the ribbon round the neck; it had the appearance of a child nearly dying from strangulation; the ribbon had been removed before I got there - in my opinion, when the child was put into the ditch it was apparently dead, but having been there some time, and received a current of air, it had revived; strangulation had certainly commenced - its eyes had nearly started out of the sockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think if it had not been found it could have survived? A. I think it impossible the child could have survived long if it had not been relieved - sufficient air could not have been admitted into the lungs to carry on life - at what precise period death would have taken place it is impossible to say.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the 3d of June last, between one and two o'clock - she came up the Green-lane, Acton; I knew her before for two or three years, and have no doubt of her - she had got two children with her then, both in her arms; she went up the Green-lane, between Acton and Ealing; I saw her go into a large wheat field - I was about a hundred yards from her; she went down to the bottom of the wheat field, sat down on the ground, and in a few minutes she got up and pulled a black whittle which she had, round her shoulders, and which the little child was covered up in - she looked all round to see if she could see any body, and she saw me looking through the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she saw you? A. Because she sat herself down directly, and I saw her eyes fixed towards me - she sat down as quick as possible, took the black whittle, and tore it over the child again as quick as she could; the little child was in her arms when she looked towards me, and the other sat on the bare ground - I immediately got over the gate, and went down to her, and said, "Halloo, Nance, what do you do here?" she said she was tired, and had sat down to rest; I said, "What, have you got another young one?" and she said "No, it is not mine;" I knew she had had two children before that one - she said, "Do you think if it were mine I should disown it; I said, "I don't know, I am sure, Nance;" she said it belonged to a young woman who was gone to Mr. Goddard's for work; I staid talking to her a little while longer, and asked if she was going down the lane; she said Yes, and asked me to carry the biggest child,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110071"/>and lift it over the gate for her, out into the lane - as soon as she got out into the lane she sat herself down; I asked if she was not going any further, and she said No; I immediately went down the lane - she said she was to wait there for the woman, because the woman promised to meet her there: I left her; it was then between three and four o'clock - I have seen the child since, and knew it by its having the same dress on; it appeared in very good health then - it had an old white bed-gown on and an old white night-cap; it did not cry at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long were you in her company? A. I think about half an hour - I observed the child's features; I saw it again three or four hours after I left her - I have known her three or four years; she used to work at Mr. Young's, at East Acton, every summer - I have seen her husband; they are separated - I cannot say whether she was subject to fits.</p>
               <p>HANNAH DUNFORD. I live at the Red Lion, at Acton - I know the prisoner. I remember seeing her on the 3d of June, at the Red Lion, a little before five o'clock in the afternoon; she had two children with her, one about two years old - she was doing nothing there; she sat with the children in the tap room; I believe she had some beer, but I do not know that - I served her with a glass of peppermint, and she offered it to both the children; I did not see them take it - I never saw her before; I am certain of her person; I did not see her go away - she left a little after five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she treat the children with apparent affection? A. She treated them very kind in my presence - I saw her for about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GAY. I live in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square, at the workhouse of St. George, Hanover-square.- the prisoner was there last Tuesday week, the 2d of June. I took her biggest child with one arm, and her bundle in the other - I was ordered to assist her to take care of her children; I carried it as far as the Swan public-house, at Bayswater, where we had a drop of porter - we walked on to Notting-hill, and she said she was not going any farther, for her brother was coming to meet her at nine or half-past nine o'clock, and I left her there at thirty-five minutes past eight; she said her brother was sure to be there at nine, or half-past, and I need not stop any longer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I left the baby there, I was not sensible of it, and did not mean to do it; I tied the ribbon round its neck because the neck was swollen, and the nurse knows it.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH TYLER. I am a nurse of the lying-in ward at St. George's workhouse. The child was born on the 13th of May - I had the care of it till the 2d of June, when it was discharged; I have seen it here to-day - it is the same child; it was baptized by the name of Elizabeth Chapman, and was called by that name afterwards, when it went away with the prisoner and Gay - it is a female; I held it while it was baptized.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner says there was something the matter with its neck? A. It was a very fat child, and that might arise from its not being well washed, which would chaff the neck.</p>
               <p>Q.In a case of that sort, it is necessary to put a binding? A. A little bit of wet rag, or powder - we never put a ribbon round a child's neck; I never heard of that as a process to make the milk stay on the stomach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would tying a piece of ribbon round its neck be of any use if the neck were bad? A. No. I never heard of that - a piece of wet rag to dab it with would, but not tied round the neck.</p>

On the 12th of May I saw the prisoner and Mr. Morgan coming from Wood-street towards Gutter-lane; I saw the prisoner stop and turn himself towards the passage No. 13, and throw the handkerchief behind him - I ran, and called them back to show them where it was; he was secured - I laid hold hold of him, and a scuffle ensued.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. You lived at Sherwood's before the bankruptcy? A. Yes; the stock was very extensive - I frequently went over the catalogues, and knew what the stock consisted of; these works are to be had at low prices, except a set of "Neal's Seats," which are 10l. a set - I had not missed these; I called the prisoner into the counting-house, where the constable and Ibbett were; I do not think he knew the constable was present - I said he had been taking books, and I should be obliged to give him in charge; I did not say unless he gave an account of them, I would give him in charge; he said, "I am very sorry, Sir, I will have the books restored:" I can swear to one of these books - it is the two volumes of "Mavor's Greece" - it stood in a glass case opposite my desk, by which I noticed it: I told the Alderman I could not positively swear to the books - the reason was I had not then examined them, and had not seen this individual book.</p>

               <p>ROBERT IBBETT. I am a bookseller, and live in Maidenhead-court, Aldersgate-street. On Monday, the 18th of May, the prisoner came to me with "Platt's Biography," in five volumes, for which I gave him 10s., it being an imperfect copy; I had before bought some small books of him, at about 2s. 6d. each - he stated himself to be a bookbinder; on the 20th of May, he called again with a copy of "Neal's Views," in ten volumes - he stated that he had more books at home, among which were thirty-seven parts of the " Percy Anecdotes" - he left "Neal's Views" in my possession, and went to fetch them; in the interim, having suspicion, I went to Sherwood, the publisher: the ten volumes are published at 25l.: I saw Mr. Sherwood, and related what had passed - they sent for Bowyer, who came to my house with me; I showed him what the prisoner had brought, and found the "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know whether the constable was there? A. I believe he was, but I did not notice him; I never knew "Neal's Views" sold at such a price, or near it; there are seventy-two plates, executed by the best masters - I never knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110073"/>a book published so high sold for 35s. - there are books with 1l. printed on the label, sold for 10s.</p>

I went round the rooms, to see if all the plate was put by, and saw several of the men's bundles - I went into another room, and as I came back I missed a bundle, which appeared larger than the rest: the prisoner was gone - I went out after him; he had not gone more than four minutes: I called after him near Ave Maria-lane- he was stopped, and asked what I wanted; I told him to come back, which he did - I told him to open his bundle- he untied it, and in it I found two tumblers, rolled up in his apron; I called to Mr. Leech, and the watchman was sent for - he was taken to the watch-house; there was some broken victuals in his bundle, which was his perquisites; I knew the tumblers by the pattern, and being very large and strong - they were quite plain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were not all the occasional waiters' bundles in one room? A. Yes; I should not think this was a joke played by some other waiter; he could certainly have taken articles of more value - he had 3s. a day: Mr. Leech had a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>HENRY WAKE. I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged with stealing two rummers - I sent him to the Compter; I searched him there, and found a pair of glass salts, one in each of his coat pockets - he said nothing to it.</p>

On the 15th of May, I was in the warehouse, which is under the same roof as the dwelling-house; I had seen this silk about five minutes before it was taken - the door was kept on the latch: the goods lay on a pile on the counter, about a yard or a yard and a half from the street-door - I was gone into the back warehouse and heard the door open: I immediatly ran forward, and saw the prisoner inside the warehouse, in the act of putting something under his coat - he immediatly ran out and shut the door after him; I ran after him, and caught sight of him within ten steps - I saw he had something under his coat, and did not lose sight of him; he was stopped within twenty yards, as I cried Stop thief! - he had got out of my sight before that, but not before he dropped the goods - when he found me so near him, I saw him drop the goods, and he was stopped not more than three minutes after that; I am quite positive he is the person who dropped the goods - I had turned back with the goods; he was brought back by Gibson, and I was quite confident of him, and of the goods (only one person came into the warehouse) the silk was above ninety yards of gros de Naples, worth 3s. or 3s. 6d. a yard - I am confident the door was shut when he came in - I heard the latch go.</p>

               <p>GEORGE CORNER. I am a watchman of Bethnal-green. On the morning of the 13th, about a quarter before four o'clock, I saw three men enter the field near my box, in Three Colt-lane, Dog-row; they each had baskets - I did not then know them, but I imagined they were going to Whitechapel, they were coming in a direction from the prosecutor's premises; I had suspicion, and went up to Crockford, who was behind the other two - I asked what he had in the basket; he said nothing - I caught hold of it, and discovered it was glass; I caught hold of him, and he caught hold of me - we had a scuffle, and I fell; he called to the others to assist him - Pearce looked back twice, but did not return; he got quite away from me, with his basket -I sprung my rattle, and the other two were taken afterwards by some Whitechapel watchmen; I saw them in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110076"/>watch-house, and knew them to be the persons I had seen with Crockford that morning - I knew Bateman by his being nearest to Crockford: I had seen him in Whitechapel several times - I had not so good a knowledge of Pearce, and cannot speak positively to him; I said he had a long coat on, and Bateman a flannel jacket; their dress corresponded with the description I gave - before I went to the watch-house I went with two of the Whitechapel watchmen to the field, and found the sashes; this was about half-past six o'clock - it was a quarter of a mile from where I saw the three men, and about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's premises: the glass had been removed from the sashes - I am certain Crockford is the person I had the scuffle with; I found a basket in the field, which I think had been dropped by Pearce - it was a small basket, with one handle off; I saw Crockford outside the door of Lambeth-street office, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q.Can you speak to Bateman as being one of the parties? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOWARD. I am a watchman of Whitechapel-road. On the morning of the 13th of May, at a quarter before four o'clock. I heard a rattle spring; I made towards it, and in Wellington-street I met Bateman and Pearce running - I saw Bateman drop a basket, containing glass; I met them between these houses and Whitechapel - I took up the basket; I afterwards took Pearce, and Kettle took Bateman, in North-street, by their own doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw nothing of Crockford then? A. No.</p>
               <p>MARTIN KETTLE. I am a watchman. I heard the rattle spring, and saw Howard with a basket in his hand, with some glass in it; I saw nothing of the prisoners then, but we afterwards took Pearce and Bateman at their doors- Corner saw them at the watch-house, and spoke to them as the persons he saw in the field; they did not say they were not there, but said they were going their own way.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BLAKE. I am a watchman of Whitechapel. I heard the rattle, and ran nearly two hundred yards; when I got to Wellington-street. I saw Bateman drop this basket, with glass in it - I described his person; he was afterwards taken: he had a flannel jacket and white stockings- I knew him. but did not know the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BATEMAN. Q.Where is your beat? A.Down by the horse-boilers - I was close by you, and could describe you.</p>
               <p>JOHN HEALING. I am a watchman, I was in Wellington-street, and saw Bateman drop the basket - there were two other persons there.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 13th of May I saw a man with a basket of glass on his shoulder, but he got round the corner of Duke-street, into Wellington-street; I went with Corner and Howard, and found the frames about two hundred yards from Mr. Jameson's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BATEMAN. Q. Did not you see me the evening before? A. Yes, about eleven o'clock - you and Pearce passed by me, in the same line that the goods came next morning; I saw nothing of Crockford - about half an hour after the glass was taken we had lost sight of you, and we saw you again; I have seen you with roots, and other things, early of a morning.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a news-agent and bookseller. I live at No. 11, Brace's-buildings, Newmarket-street. East Smithfield. I have known Crockford one year and a half, and lodged with him. On the night of the 13th of May, I let him in at twelve o'clock, and he was in bed with me till seven in the morning; I went out and left him in bed, and when I returned at nine he was not up.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know it was the 13th? A. His father came the same day, and said his son was charged with a robbery - I went up to the Magistrate, but I was ordered out; I offered to state the fact - I am in the habit of sleeping with him, as he has a sister out of place and she sleeps in my apartment. I do not keep any shop -I have bought books of Piper, late Sherwood, Neely, and Sons, Cowie and Strange, and others; I have not been supoenaed here to day - Crockford is a sawyer, and was out of work at that time - he had been at work the week before, but I do not know for whom; his sister slept in the house that night - I let him in at twelve o'clock, and we went to bed together; his sister had gone into her apartment at half-past eleven - she did not see him that night, but she bade him good night as he passed the door; his father slept in the same room with us, and had not gone to bed when he came home - his father and sister went to the Police officer, and a person named Mayne who had been in company with him from twelve at noon till near twelve o'clock at night; he is here to-day - I never saw Pearce till I was at Lambeth-street; I never saw Crockford in company with him, nor with any persons but those whom I believe to be sawyers.</p>

            . The prisoner is my son. On the night of the 12th of May I will take my oath he was in bed with me - it might be twelve o'clock, or a little before, when he came in, and I called him the morning between four and five o'clock; he said it was no use for him to get up - he never got up till nine o'clock; he could not have gone out without my knowing it - he did not go out, so help me God - he was at home all night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was he taken up the same day? A. Yes, he went out - Pearce's father came to let me know he was taken; I had never seen him before; my son sent word by him where he was; I went to the office, but they would not let me in - they said they wanted no witnesses there; I have a trifle allowed me by the parish, and have been dependent on my son; he had been on the 12th to Hackney, with Mayne, to see if he could get any work - Bethnal-green is the nearest way to Hackney; I do not know the prosecutor's houses - I cannot say whether he had any supper or not; I think I was in bed when he came home - Harper was getting into bed, and when my son came home he let him in; there was a candle - my daughter was gone to bed, perhaps half an hour; she bade him good night - the door was not open, but I heard that through the wainscoat; I cannot tell whether I had any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110077"/>supper - I frequently go to bed without supper; I had cocoa at tea time, with my daughter - I cannot say whether Harper was there then; twelve o'clock is rather a late hour to go to bed, but I have nothing to do - he did not dine at home on the 12th; he had been to look for his mate, and he could not find him - he went out in the morning, and did not come home till twelve o'clock at night; he had been to Hackney to see for work, and got with a shopmate or two - he had nothing to do at the office the next day, but he went by as I am told.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What made him stay at home so long as nine o'clock that morning? A. He was very slack of work, and said it would be time enough for his mate; I cannot say what time I got up, but I was partly dressed when the news came that my son was confined - I am lame, it takes me an hour to dress.</p>

               <p>JANE CROCKFORD. On the 12th of May, I heard my brother come home about twelve o'clock; he bade me good night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.What time did you go to bed? A. About half-past eleven, or a little before twelve o'clock- I did not know Pearce till I saw him at Lambeth-street; I did not know Bateman - my father is old, and gets up late - sometimes at ten or eleven o'clock, sometimes twelve; I cannot say what time he got up on the 12th. I am a glove-maker, and work for Mr. Butts, in Leadenhall-street- I cannot exactly say whether my father had dined at home that day, or whether I was at home at tea; I had been to Leadenhall-street on the 10th, but I do not think I went on the 13th - I cannot say whether my father and I drank tea together - we generally have cocoa for tea; my brother went out at half-past nine or a little before ten o'clock that morning - he was in bed at eight, when I got up; I have one key of the street-door, and Mr. Harper has another - Harper went out, I believe, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he dine at home? A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MAYNE. I am a sawyer, and live at No. 7. Gower-place, Mill-yard, Cable-street - I know Crockford- I have been a mate of his. On the 12th of May I was with him (but not at work) from half-past twelve o'clock at noon till a quarter before twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.What were you doing? A. I met him opposite Mr. Richmond's, in Old-street-road - I did not go in there: we went and had two pints of beer at a public-house at the back of the Vinegar-yard - we then went to Cambridge-heath, stood on the bridge for half an hour, and saw a young fellow who is waiter at the Rose and Crown public-house; we went into the Hare public-house, and had a game at skittles; this was about five o'clock - we had passed some time at the other house, where we went to have some beer; I do not know where the prosecutor's buildings are - there are new buildings in many parts about there; I was with Crockford till a quarter before twelve at night, I then went home and went to bed.</p>
               <p> - PEARCE. I am Pearce's father. He was at home on the night before, and the watchman came and took him against my house - he said there were two more in it - I went to speak for my son; Kettle came out, and said,"You may go home, and make yourself comfortable, not one of us can swear to him;" when the two lads were taken, they wanted to lay it to my son, and then Howard said it was Bateman.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. How do you know the prisoner had not sent it? A. Because I went by the same coach; this is the basket that I sent with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you arrive at Charing-cross? A. I believe about half-past nine o'clock, and I waited there till near ten - I detained the coachman, expecting every moment the basket would arrive: I ran to every coach-office about there to look for him.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, of Chapel-street, Edgware-road. On that Monday a witness and another young man came to my house; they had not got the basket- they brought some silk dresses, cotton dresses, shoes, and other things, and wanted 12s. for them; they said they belonged to a man named Wilson, who was outside the door- I went out and asked him whose it was; he at first said it was his own, and then that it belonged to Mr. Evans, No.11, Prospect-place: I said I should not advance any money until I had made inquiries - they said they would call again, and went away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>GEORGE OBEY. I am learning to be a bricklayer. I was in Lisson-street; the prisoner called me and another young lad, and asked us to take these things to pawn for 12s. - he said they were his own, and that his name was Wilson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see him before?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110079"/>A. No; I suspected it was not right, and told Mr. Trail of it - he was a little intoxicated; I believe he has a wife and child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met that witness and two others tossing in the street; I was a little intoxicated, and set down the basket; he came and said, "What are you going to do with this, old chap - are you going to pawn it, or shall I;" I don't know what I said, but he took the property, which was not in the basket, and endeavoured to get 12s. on it - I do not know what happened between Mr. Trail and me; I returned to the witness - there was some conversation about selling it to a Jew; I was decoyed out of my road into a field - I sat myself down, and during the time the officer came and took me; I accidentally went to get a glass of gin, and the servant came into the public-house, to ask for a person to take the parcel - I met with those three idle chaps, and they decoyed me away.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TRAIL re-examined. Q. Is your shop in the direct road to Charing-cross? A. No, it is down a street; he should have gone straight on.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that the prisoner was a dealer by commission in these very articles? A. I did not know that he dealt at all, except that he bought two or three articles of his master, what had been entered by the clerk in the book.</p>

            . I am head constable of Worship-street. I went with Attfield to the house, and found these articles, which I deposited at the Crown public-house, in the afternoon: at the office he gave me a paper, which I handed to the Magistrate, who gave it to Mr. Howard.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWARD. This is the paper; I have not seen the prisoner write, but this is the paper he handed to the officer, and which I received from the Magistrate; he avowed it to be his in the office, and persisted in delivering it, in spite of remonstrances - (read.)</p>
               <p>To Messrs. Howard and Quincey, No. 115, Old-street.</p>
               <p>HONOURED GENTLEMEN, - I am extremely sorry for having robbed you, but if I had been spared on this occasion, I am perfectly sure you would have been no losers, but rather great gainers; I was truly resolved to be more strict in my duty, and never suffer you to be injured by any one in my sight - my reason for taking what I did on Saturday night, was to have redeemed two pairs of sheets, and then I should have been satisfied.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors; it is my duty to enter all articles bought and paid for by all persons. On the 5th of November, 1828, I find by the book, which I have here, that the prisoner bought some article to the amount of 1s. 8d. - I do not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was there no other dealings between the prisoner and his master? A. Since the 1st of June, 1828, I have received 1l. 8s. 11 1/2d. of him at different payments - the last was on the 5th of November; I have been there ten years and six months - I have kept the books about two years and a half - I believe there had been dealings between the prisoner and his master before I kept the books; I believe he had been a retail dealer in these articles - I do not know whether Mr. Howard knew that; these twenty-four articles which have been identified have been missed since the 17th of February - I cannot say whether there are any more that can be identified - none of these have been paid for to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does any other person receive money for goods? A. Only when I am at my meals - when I return it is accounted for to me: these things could not have been had and paid for without my knowing it - my knowledge of these articles does not depend upon private marks, which may be removed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring that he had become possessed of the goods honestly, and that he was so overcome at the time of his apprehension, he was unconscious of what he either said or wrote.</p>

            . I am a jobber, and live at Enfield-highway. On the morning of the 1st of May, about three o'clock, I saw the prisoner near the shed where I live; he asked whether I was going down into the country, and how long I should be - he asked whether I wanted any corn; I said I did not want any - he said I could put it into the barn if I liked; I said No - he said he had three quarters of corn; a cart came down the street - Warren said some thing, but I cannot recollect what it was - the cart did make a bit of a pause, but he did not to say "Stop" - the prisoner went after it; as he was going out he said I might have it - I said I would not; I understood it to be corn - I said I would not have any thing to do with it; he asked how long I should be - I said twenty minutes, or half an hour; he came up again before the half hour was expired - just as I put the horse in the shaft he asked if I would go down the street and have a cup of coffee; I said Yes; I went to his house, and had the coffee - I saw about a bushel, or a bushel and a half of black and white oats in a tub.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say about the oats? A. He asked if I was a mind to have any oats or corn, I cannot say which he said - I said No; he asked me to go to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110083"/>stable, and I saw a bag tied up; I saw some chaff and oats round the edge of the copper, but I was not near enough to see what colour it was.</p>

I don't belong to you;" I took the woman, and Mrs. Goddard took the child.</p>

I thought she lived at some house in the court, and I had not time to inquire before the man came, and took me - I walked back; I am innocent of stealing any thing - I had the misfortune to be here once; the man who stands there took me - he could speak of my bad qualities, but he would not speak of his own.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was the prisoner in your employ? A. Yes; I build on speculation -I have sometimes two or three men, sometimes twenty or thirty; I had at this time four or five men - I generally paid them in money; never with any thing else - I may have paid them a few shillings short on the Saturday night, but never paid them in goods, to the best of my knowledge, for the last twenty years, nor ever authorised any one to pay them in goods; if a man wanted a board, I let him have it at market price; if so I outset it, but I never let them have goods when I had no money to give them, that I will swear; there was an execution against me in the Forty-Shillings Court, but I did not keep out of the way on that account; I was pulling down some houses in the Strand - I was not out of the way for fear of being arrested; I do not owe 20l. in the world - I was not indebted to some others of my workmen to the amount of 15l. or 20l. - the prisoner was in my employ; they drew their wages weekly; upon my solemn oath, I have not given some of the men materials with the view of paying them their wages, nor allowed them to take materials; I had a labourer named Horsley - I cannot say what I owed him, because his work was not finished; I did not allow him to take any thing by way of paying himself - I do not consider that I have paid him for all that he has done; I did not desire the prisoner to take four long joists from Mr. Sutton - they did do it, and I have had them to replace; these four long joists were employed on my premises without my knowledge - I never knew a word about it till after the surveyor called upon me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARWICK. I took the prisoner on the 9th of May.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BRAIN. I keep a shop in Somers'-town. On the 8th of May I was gone to an auction-room; the prisoner and another man came to me there, and asked if I would buy a couple of doors; I said, "What sort of doors are they?" they said, "New ones, and they are all fair and square - we have got them to sell instead of getting money from our master:" when I returned home, they brought them down, and left them; I gave them 6s. 6d. on the doors - they said they had got two pairs of sashes and frames, would I purchase them; I said, "I don't know - they are things very dangerous - they may be broken, perhaps, in my place;" they said, "We will chance that; if you will have them, we will bring them:" the chief of this discourse was from the other person - they brought down the sashes, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.These men came in broad daylight? A. Yes; they told me to expose them for sale - they said they were not afraid of them; they said their master owed them from 15l. to 20l.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did they tell you their master's name? A. No; I did not ask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have a witness.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TRUSS. I am a carpenter. I know Mr. Sparks; I worked for him at the time the prisoner did -Mr. Sparks owed me some wages, and I was obliged to go, and kick up a noise before I could get any to support my wife - we were to draw money for the work every week, but on the very first Saturday night he left us without a copper; some went to Kennington, to Mr. Sutton's, to try and get the money - he knew of our taking these joists, but he denied it before me - Mr. Sutton, his brother-in-law, who is the foreman, told us to go and take the joists, which we did.</p>

On the 21st of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the back room behind my shop, and some person came in; my wife went to serve him - I went into the shop, and saw it was the prisoner, whom I had known well before; he used to live at Hackney; before I came out of the parlour I heard him say he wanted five such thimbles as he had bought three of, of Mr. Bell a few days before: when I got into the shop, he said, "I want five such thimbles as my daughter had of you;" he bought nothing - as soon as he was gone I went to my other shop at Stoke Newington, and found him there; I told him I would detain him- he said I should not; I said I would, and took hold of him: we had a scuffle - he then said, had I a back room, and he would go there - I took him into the back room, and he began to cry; he said he had a wife and nine children, and he hoped I would not be hard with him; the officer came, and found this property, which I identified as mine - I believe it had been chiefly taken from my shop at Newington; there are four that I can identify particularly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me look at any property at Hackney? A. I have not said I did; I followed him to my shop at Newington - he had purchased a thimble at Newington, and paid for it; he did not mention about his wife being in the family-way - he lived about five years within fifty yards of me; when he put the property on the table he said, "You don't swear to that?" my answer was"That remains to be proved;" I only deal with one manufacturer for this sort of thimbles - we had but half a dozen of them; they were sent to Newington from my shop at Hackney, some weeks before, but it so happened that none of them had been sold; after he had been in the shop there were only two of them left.</p>

            . I am sister to Mr. Bell, and keep his shop at Newington. On the 21st of April I saw the prisoner there, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - there was no one there from two o'clock till he came in; I was giving him change - Mr. Bell came in, while the prisoner was there, under the pretence of getting a thimble of a particular size, to send to the East Indies - he was continually trying thimbles on his finger, and putting his hand into his pocket again - he almost tired my patience.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you for a thimble with a particular motto "Remember me," on it? A. Yes, and I repeated the mottos I had, and gave you one "From a friend;" you said you would have one of them, but you repeatedly put your hands into the tray, and put them into your pocket again; when I saw them on the table, I could be upon my oath, those four had been in the tray - here is one I have worked with myself; it has a small bit of rust on it: I was in the shop when the officer searched him, but I went into the parlour just as the officer had taken them from him; he made no resistance to the officer, but he did to my brother - I went and locked to the door; I believe he got on the step of the door, but he did not get away.</p>
               <p>JAMES OFFORD. I was in Mr. Bell's service. I saw the prisoner come into the shop, at Newington, and opened the door for him; I heard him ask for some silver thimbles - I saw him put his hand into the tray, and then put his hand into his pocket, and make an excuse that he had the size somewhere.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Who told you to say this? A. No one.</p>

On the 17th of April, when I went to bed, the house was all fastened; I got up in the morning and found the ground-floor windows opened; one pane of glass was taken out - by which means they could put in their hands and unfasten the window; I missed the property stated in the indictment, which was worth about 20l. - it was all safe at half-past eleven o'clock at night; the prisoner lived with his uncle, about twenty yards from our house, about four years ago - his uncle keeps a public-house; I have not seen him for these four years.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Borough. On the 17th of April I was looking for the prisoner for another robbery - I went into a house, and he got away from me; next morning I had information, and followed a girl into Fleet-market - I found him in the tap-room of the Angel public-house there; that was on the morning of the 18th, a little after ten o'clock; I told him I wanted him - he said, "Oh. do you Mr. Pett;" I said, "Yes, you must go with me," and I took him in custody - he had a bag there; I asked if it belonged to him - he said it did; I have had the bag ever since - the prosecutrix claimed the contents.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110088"/>Prisoner. I sat there ten minutes - then you asked if the bundle on the table was mine; I said it was not, but it was in my possession, and I expected the young man in every moment. Witness. No, he did not say a young man had left it - he said it belonged to him.</p>
               <p>MRS. REED. I know all this property - here is a shirt, and I believe all the rest to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I came up to London in search of employment - I had not been in town more than two months; I had appointed to meet a young man at the Bolt-in-Tun, as he knew of a situation which he thought would suit me - while I was there a well-dressed person, in appearance a gentleman, came into the house, and asked if there was any one there willing to earn a 1s.; having nothing to do I gladly accepted the offer, and asked him what it might be - his answer was, "To carry this bundle for me;" the bundle now before you is the same one which the aforesaid person gave into my possession to carry - I put it on my shoulder, and went along with him until we reached the Angel public-house; opposite the door he stopped and said, "Young man, I wish you to stop here a few minutes - you can go into the tap-room and sit down - here is 2 1/2d, get a pint of porter; I have to call upon a friend, who is going to Tring with me, and shall not be more than ten minutes, and mind take great care of the bundle" - I went and sat down, and had been upwards of ten minutes there when the officer came in and said,"I want you;" I, not knowing what he wanted, and fearing that it was some trick to get the bundle from me, felt rather reluctant to go with him - he asked me if that was my bundle; I answered in the negative, but that a person, whom I described to him, had left them in my possession and in my care - we waited about ten minutes more, and the aforesaid person did not come; the officer then sent for a coach, and gave orders to the coachman to drive us to Union-hall - judge then my amazement in being taken before the Magistrate, and charged with having those things in my possession, and not being able to give an account of them; I never having been in trouble before, was so agitated that I could scarcely speak - however, I told the Magistrate the whole of the business; I declare solemnly, and in the presence of that Supreme God who created me, that I am innocent of the crime imputed to me.</p>

On the 20th of May I came into the shop first to let the young men in, about seven o'clock - I sleep in the house myself; I observed a ladder on the counter, against the sky-light above, and observed the skylight window was broken - I found two squares had been taken out, and the bar of the window broken - the skylight slants - a small man might have got through; but there was a latch by which the window might have been opened; it was closed then; I had not been in the shop over night - I looked upon all the shelves, and discovered that many pieces of silk were taken away; I missed eight or nine rolls of silk, but am not certain of the exact number - the young men were with me; I missed a piece of calico, used as a wrapper, from near where the silks were taken; it was used to keep the dust from some muslins - the silks were on blocks of wood, which were also missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure the house is in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields? A. Certainly; my father is the churchwarden - I am not in partnership with him; he has no partner: I was the first person in the shop in the morning - the maid servants might have been up before me; I was up before any of the male servants, for I called them all up: I sleep on the second floor - my room looks down about twelve feet from the sky-light; I think the prisoner might get through the hole in the sky-light; a small man could have got through easily - the latch is immediately under the hole; I cannot say whether it had been raised; my father has a very large stock of silks - it is a large establishment; I buy every piece of silk myself: I cannot say how many pieces were in the house - I missed the property, and will swear it was there in the evening, but I was at the theatre that night - I know the wrapper ought to have been on the muslins.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HOLDSTOOK. I live at No. 81 1/2, Drury-lane; I do not know the prisoner personally - I know him, when I see him, by his lodging in that house where I now live; he came there first on Thursday morning, the 21st of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I think; I am only a lodger - before he came, a porter brought a box to the top of the house - this is the box (looking at it); the prisoner followed the porter up; he came at the same time in company with the porter - I was outside my room door, and the porter asked me where the box was to go to - the prisoner was close to him on the stairs; this was on the third floor; I did not know the room was let, and asked the porter who he wanted; he said the box belonged to a gentleman behind - I asked if he wanted the empty room; he said he did; I pointed to the empty room, which was on the same floor; he went in, took the box into the room, and the prisoner followed - the porter left the box in the room, and the prisoner asked me if he could lock or fasten the door; I cannot exactly say which - I told him I knew nothing about fastening the door, but I would take care nobody went in till the landlady came up: the prisoner went away, and left the door just on the latch - it is a kind of a spring latch; the landlady came up soon after, and I left - I did not hear of the robbery till the evening; I did not see the prisoner again that day myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you heard of the robbery that day? A. That evening - it was Thursday; Mr. Foulkes' son told me of it: I am a widow, and a stock and collar maker - I work for Mr. Foulkes and live five or six hundred yards from him, I should think; it is on the opposite side of the way; I was not present when the prisoner took the lodging; the man who brought the box wore a porter's jacket and an apron - I cannot say whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110089"/>the prisoner paid him; I did not see the contents of the box till afterwards.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I belong to Bow-street office. I went, on the 11th of June, about twelve o'clock. to the prisoner's lodging, No. 81 1/2, Drury-lane, at the top of the house, with a search warrant, in company with Ellis, the principal officer of Bow-street, and Mr. Foulkes, Jun.; we went into a back-room, where the prisoner was in bed - the door was open; we told him we had suspicion there was stolen property in the room, and had got a warrant to search the room - he made no answer; I commenced searching, and in a dark corner, close to his bed, I found this box; it was nailed down all round - there were no binges; all the sides seemed alike; it is like a packing-case: I asked him what it contained - he made me no answer; I then broke it open, and found it contained silk: Mr. Foulkes looked at it, and said it was his property - it contained eight pieces of silk, and ten rollers; the silk was off the rollers, which were at the bottom of the box - I then searched his clothes, and in a coat which laid near the bed I found this pocket-book in one of the pockets, and in the leaf of the pocket-book I found eight pieces of remnants of the pieces of silk in the box, and each having the number of yards contained in each piece on them - I also found four duplicates in the book for four pieces of silk, pawned for 1l., 2l., 30s., and 20s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time was this? A. About noon: I cannot say whether he had been asleep - he was awake when I went in; this was about three weeks after the robbery, which had made a great noise in the neighbourhood: a complaint had been made at Bow-street, and it had been stated in all the newspapers - I asked the prisoner what he was; he said he had formerly kept a linendraper's shop at Brighton.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH EVANS. I am shopman to Mr. Gray, a pawnbroker, of Fleet-street. I have some recollection of the prisoner - I saw him on the 1st of June, in my employer's shop; he pawned about thirty-two yards of silk; I lent him 2l. 10s. on it - this is the silk; I have brought it from our shop - to the best of my belief he is the man, but I cannot speak positively to him: I gave him a duplicate - this is the one I gave him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a stranger to you? A. He was.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WESTON. I am shopman to George Benton, a pawnbroker, of High Holborn. To the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man who pawned this piece of silk on the 6th of June; I think it was in the evening, just before candles were lighted - I asked if it was his own; he said Yes, and gave the name of 
               <persName id="t18290611-204-person1548">

             - I lent him 1l. on it; the duplicate I gave him is among these produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not certain of the time of day? A. No, I believe him to be the man; that belief is not strengthened by the duplicate being found - it is not uncommon for persons to pawn in fictitious names.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LAMAN. I am a shopman to Young and Luxmore, pawnbrokers, of St. Martin's-lane. To the best of my recollection the prisoner is the person who pawned this piece of silk on the 10th of June for 1l.: this is the duplicate I gave him - I think it was about six o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS GREEN. I live at No. 81 1/2, Drury-lane, and am landlord of the house. The prisoner came to me on the 21st of May to ask for a lodging; I had a bill up to let a room - I told him I had a room to let, and I could put a bed and bedstead into it; he asked what I should charge a week - I said I could not charge less than 2s. 6d. a week; he agreed to take it - I then asked him what he was; he said a linen-draper, and that he had burt his leg - he walked lame at the time; this was between eight and ten o'clock in the morning - he went away, and before twelve he and a porter came together; the porter had a box on his knot - the prisoner rather came before him to the door, and went up stairs behind him; the box produced is what he brought - I told the porter he had better take the box off his knot, or he would break the wall; he said, "No, I can carry it best on the knot," and the prisoner followed him up stairs with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You heard of this robbery, I suppose? A. I heard a rumour of it, but not on the day it happened - I am not much acquainted with Holdstock; the prisoner was three weeks at the lodging - he was in and out, sometimes he laid in bed all day, and sometimes used not to get up till one o'clock; he slept at home every night but one.</p>
               <p>MR. FOULKES. I can swear to all these silks by having my own private marks on them - here is one piece; the other end of it is marked with a private mark: it has not been cut - I put them on the rolls myself since they have been found; I have examined them all - there are eight pieces; there is no private mark on the remnants, but they correspond with the pieces; and the silk produced by the pawnbrokers are my father's, and have my hand-writing on the end of some of the rollers, and I know the handwriting of our shopman on the others; I have not the least doubt of the silk being my father's property - I value them at about 70l. or 80l.; the wrapper is here - here are part of some letters on it, which were made by our stamps; the word is "white," it is partly torn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you leave the house? A. At seven o'clock; the performance had commenced when I got to the theatre - none of our shopmen are here; we shut up at ten o'clock - it is not at all likely these silks could be sold that night; it is a large quantity: we have had an order for five thousand yards - a little boy at our desk receives money for goods; the people in the shop keep the order-book - we do not often sell whole pieces in the shop, and when we do we invariably take the rollers off; if we sell a large quantity we have them direct from the manufacturer, and then often do not block them - I went to bed directly I came home; I had no supper - I went into the drawing-room; people going out to sell silk often take a pattern with the length on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You receive silk from the manufacturer without rollers? A. Some of them; this wrapper would not have been sent away with silk - if silk is sold we pack it in paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the silks, and paid a very fair price for them. I went into Rowbottom's, in James-street, Covent-garden, to take refreshment; I entered into conversation with two or three young men, one of whom I had been in company with several times; he asked if I would buy a quantity of silks - I said if they were cheap I had no objection; he showed me the samples, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110090"/>after a time I agreed to give him 30l. for the lot - I told him I would pay him 22l., and the rest when I had disposed of the goods, which he agreed to - two of the party left the house, returned in about half an hour, (which was about half-past seven o'clock) and brought the silks - I paid the 22l., and they agreed to take the rest when I had sold them - I know nothing whatever of the robbery, and never had a charge of the kind against me in my life.</p>

I was in a street in Lisson-grove, about eleven o'clock; I had left home to take a walk, between nine and ten - I do not know the name of the street; the prisoner Stephens came to me, and asked me to go with her; I had never seen her before - whether she met or overtook me I do not know; she asked me to go for a walk with her - I went; she said she would take me home, and after taking me through several streets, she wanted me to go to a house to dance with her - I told her I would not; she did not point out the house - she persuaded me, saying she would dance, and at last I consented, and went; I do not know where it was - it was a public-house; we went into a room - there was a fiddler there; she told him to strike up - I took a seat, and she danced with several men; there were seven or eight men there, but no woman but her; she danced with several men; I staid there some time, and after dancing she came to me, and asked if I was ready to go - two or three men left the room just before that, and I think the prisoners were two of them, but I had not much noticed the men there - they left two or three minutes before us; we then left - she had hold of my arm; she took me through several streets, and in North-street I asked how much further she was going to take me; she said, "Not far, only just round the corner;" after that we turned the corner, which took us to the end of the building - it was not a street, but open ground; we stood there a minute in the open air - she then made a sort of cough, and I was instantly knocked down by four or five men; some of them came from the end of the building.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she cough designedly? A. It was a sort of cough, and they came up instantly from the side of the building; I did not know where they came from - there was no lamp very near; they knocked me down, and two of them, whom I believe to be the prisoners, held my throat and mouth - they were both doing that; they kept me so a few minutes, and pressed me very hard, which prevented me crying out - one man knelt over me with a large knife; the faces of the two who held me were towards me only part of the time; I could not clearly distinguish their features - I saw their dresses, and believe the two male prisoners to be the two who held my mouth and throat; I did not know any of them before - I believe them to be the two, and I think by their dress they were in the dancing-room; their dress corresponded with the dress of two men in the dancing-room; I speak to them from their face and their dress both - they left the room before I did: while they held me, one man held a long knife over my breast, while the others robbed me - the knife somewhat resembled a carving knife; he held it over my breast, but said nothing; I once got their hands off my mouth, and told them not to hurt me, and I would give them all I had; one of them said, "Stop him, stop him! stifle him!" they took my hat, my pocket handkerchief, and gloves, which were in my pocket, and a sovereign and a half, which were loose in my trousers pocket; I do not know whether they were in the right or left pocket - I had a little silver, but do not know how much, and cannot say whether they took any; they took a metal watch from my waistcoat pocket, three knives, a pair of scissars, a gold watch ring, and a bunch of keys - they were on me a few minutes, when I heard a little noise, a sort of grating noise, like a window opening, and then the prisoners jumped up.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of four or five men? A. Yes; two were rifling my pockets, while two held me, and the other stood over me with a knife; they all jumped up - the one who held the knife stopped longer than the rest, and kicked me on the head very violently, while I was on the ground; I had heard them say nothing but "Stifle him!" the kick made a large cut on the side of my head, it was with his shoe - it bled a great deal, and I believe, if they had not been disturbed. I should have been murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. When these persons came up to you where was the female prisoner? A. With me; she disappeared when they came up - I saw no more of her; I got up and walked round the corner which they turned before, with my head bleeding; when the witness, Mrs. Raim, looked out of a window above, and asked what was the matter; I told her - John Raim opened the door, and told me to wait till he came back; I had not told him which way they had run; I waited on the pavement - he returned in ten or fifteen minutes, and in consequence of what he said I went with him and saw the two male prisoners in custody, and believed them to be the men who had attacked me; I accompanied them to the watch-house, and saw them searched by one of the watchmen; nothing belonging to me was found on them; I have not seen any of my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What was found on them? A. Two or three knives; I had never seen either of them before - I was much alarmed; I cough myself at times - I do not swear to the men; I do not know what street the dance was in, but the name of the house is the Grand Junction - there were seven or eight men in the room, but no women except Stephens; I do not think there was a dozen men there - certainly not more; I did not dance; I am a single man; I had been with a friend, and was quite sober; I had been to a house with my friends, but do not know what house or the street it was in; my friend's name is Woodhead - it was only one friend; I went into a public-house with him; I do not know the sign or the street; I afterwards went to a private house - I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110091"/>only been nine or ten days in London, and am quite a stranger; I had drank some ale, but am not certain whether I took any spirits, it is so long since - I paid for part, but do not know how much; it was not more than 1s. or 1s. 6d. - that was for drink and biscuits; I might drink some gin, but am not certain; I do not know what street the private house was in - I drank porter and gin there with Woodhead; I believe the person who kept the house was a friend of his; I did not know them; I might be half an hour or three-quarters of an hour in the public-house, and a quarter of an hour in the private house - I cannot say what quantity I drank there; I will swear I did not drink more than three or four galsses, and not a pint of porter; I had been drinking before that at the inn, the Yorkshire Stingo. that is the public-house we were at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you did not know the name of the house? A. I have found it out since; I was drinking at another house about four or five o'clock - I do not know the name of it; I had been into the City that morning, and cannot say where I dined; I think I did dine on that day, but do not know - I took a glass with Woodhead about four or five o'clock - I cannot say whether it was ale or spirits, or what quantity; I was in no other public-house to my recollection; I do no know what houses I might have been in in the City in the morning; I did not drink where the dance was, nor send for any thing - I swear I was perfectly sober; I never said I was tipsy - there are two or three lamps in sight of the spot, but I took no notice of the distance they were placed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You do not swear to the prisoners? A. To the woman I can - I am quite sure she is the woman; I am not so certain of the men, but believe them to be the men; to the best of my belief they are the men who held me down; I am quite sure I was sober.</p>

            . I live at No. 25, North-street, Lissongrove, and am a bricklayer. On the 6th of May I had been out with my wife, about half-past six o'clock, to her sister's, in High-street; we got back about eleven o'clock- the watchman was calling "Past eleven," as we came down North-street; when we got to the door, and while I unlocked it, I heard a whistle; we both went into the house - my wife opened the window, and looked out; I saw the prosecutor under the window, and a girl with him- there was no lamp very near the window, but it was a very light evening; we both looked out of the window - I am sure the man who I afterwards saw is the one who was with the woman; I heard him say, "Where are you going to take me down this way;" I cannot swear the female prisoner is the woman - they continued there about a minute, and then went to the corner, about two yards further; they did not quite turn the corner - they stopped quite at the corner, and immediately they got to the corner two men came directly under my window; it was the two male prisoners - I cannot say whether they came out of the carcases of the houses; the prosecutor had then got round the corner - I knew it was the prisoners, for they came and looked me full in the face under the window; I had no light in my room, and one of them said to the other,"There are some people at the window;" "Nonsence" said one of them, and both came back, and the one in the light jacket (Crowther) came and looked me full in the face, in the window - my window is between eight and nine feet from the ground; I am certain he is the man - I have seen him about, but did not know his name; Turner was the first one who looked up - I could distinguish his face; it was he who called there was somebody at the window -I am certain they are the two men who passed the window; I have seen Turner about before also - when Crowther looked me full in the face, I pulled the windown down - I pulled the blind on one side, and saw these two run towards the corner immediately, and I immediately saw a girl running from the corner. up North-street away from them; she ran quite away, as far as I could see her, she did not cry out at all - I lost sight of her; just as the prosecutor got to the corner, I heard a sort of cough, and these men immediatly came running under the window - I lifted my window up again, and saw four or five men run away with a hat - I was lifting up the window gradually, and my wife came and pushed it up hastily; it made a noise, which they, I believe, heard, for they came running away instantly; there was either four or five of them - I could distinguish the two men who had looked up at the window among them: they went right straight across the way, but near enough for me to be certain the prisoners were two of them, I have not a doubt about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say that from their dress, or how; you could not see their faces at that time? A. I speak by their dress - Turner had a dark-coloured dress, and Crowther a light one; I immediately ran down stairs, and followed them - the prosecutor came up as I came to the door, with the blood streaming from his head; I told him to stop there till I came back - I followed some little distance behind them to Nightingale-street, and I lost them for some little time; I saw them in that street, and saw them go into a house; I saw two watchmen a little distance off - I went up, and told them what had happened; I could not tell exactly which door they went in at: I walked up and down the street about ten minutes, and saw Turner and Crowther come out - they were the only two that came out; I said,</p>
               <p>"Come, you are just the young men I have been looking for" - they answered, and said,"Looking for we! you can't want neither of we;" they still kept walking backwards further from me - I was standing still; I said, "If you don't came to-night by fair means you shall to-morrow by foul; I know you both well" - the watchman was a little distance from me, and I gave them in charge, and they were apprehended - I left, and told them to bring them up to the prosecutor, at my house, which they did; I found the prosecutor ther; he said they were the two men that tried to strangle him - their shoes were daubed all over with the soft clay they had run across; the streets are not completed, and it had been wet - Turner's knees were all daubed over with the same sort of clay, very wet indeed; it was dirty round the corner, but not so dirty as in the middle of the road - it was very muddy there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor speak positively to them? A. He said "Those are the two men, I give them in charge;" he said before the Magistrate he positively believed them to be the men; I cannot say whether the dark coat was blue or black; they had hats on - I will not swear that; I never had a prosecution here - I cannot write; I had once a person committed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110092"/>for trial at Clerkenwell - I committed a person named

               <p>Q. Look at this paper (producing one) and tell me whether you do not know why the bill was not found? A. I cannot read; I never saw this paper before to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot tell - at the time the prosecution was going on at Clerkenwell, a young man called me out one night; there were two or three of them - they said, "Will you come and have something to drink;" I said "I have no objection" - he said, "I understand you have taken up an old sweetheart of mine;" I said," I don't know about that - I have taken one up for robbing me of a sovereign and a shilling;" he said, "Well, I should be very sorry you should lose by her; here, I will give you a sovereign, he as favourable as you can" - I said it was not left with me to be favourable - he said, "Well, take the sovereign, you won't lose much by her;" I took 20s. worth of silver - he said, "Just make a cross here, and I can show her when she comes out of prison, that I gave you a sovereign;" they got me to put my mark to it - I went before the Grand Jury, I believe it was the same day, or it was after he gave me the money - I did not agree not to prosecute her in consideration of having the sovereign; there were a great many people in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not two persons sign the paper as witnesses that you should not appear or prosecute - mind, they are here? A. The words were not mentioned - I put my mark without having the paper read. I was on the first floor when I saw the prisoners - the nearest lamp may be twenty or thirty yards off - I do not know the distance - it was a very light night; I told the Magistrate I had seen the prisoners before; what I said was taken down and read over to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long ago is it since the transaction occurred about Smith? A. I should think eighteen months, but am unable to say - she had picked my pocket of a sovereign and a shilling; I went before the Grand Jury and the watchman was examined - I put my mark to a paper, but what it was I do not know: the young man who gave me the 1l. wrote it - I know him when I see him, he is a coachman - I do not know his name; I stated to the Grand Jury just the same about Smith, as I stated to the Magistrate; no paper was produced to them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>AMELIA RAIM. I remember going home with my husband on the night of the 6th of May; the watchman was going past eleven o'clock: while my husband was opening the door I heard a whistle, and when I got in I lifted up the sash, looked out, and saw a man and woman- I did not know either of them; they were standing underneath the window - a man afterwards came to our house with his head cut - he was the same man as I had seen under the window; I did not see the woman's face, and do not know her; they went round the corner of the unfinished house. and I saw two men come under the window almost instantly - they passed the window, and went towards the corner, where the man and woman had gone- I and my husband were looking out at the window; one of them said there were persons looking out at that window, and he stopped and looked up at a window; the other man said,</p>
               <p>"No, no;" one of them came back quite to the window, looked us in the face, and the other stood two or three steps off - I looked at the one opposite the window in the face for a minute or two; the one in the light jacket(Crowther) is the one who came back close to the window, and looked us in the face - I am positive of him; I had never seen him before to my knowledge - the other is the man who stood two or three paces off the window; I am positive of him; I never saw him before to my knowledge - I have no doubt of them at all: the first lamp, I believe, is about fifty yards off, but I cannot say; it may be more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lamps are there within sight of your house? A. I do not know; I never counted them - I believe they are gas lamps; the window was put down; my husband opened it again a little way, very gently, and in a minute or two I thought I heard a noise, and threw it up violently; I cannot exactly tell what the noise was, but something frightened me - my throwing the window up made a great noise, as it was a very loose sash; it went up freely, and made a great noise against the top - I looked out, and saw some men running along - I believe there were five, but did not count them; two of them I knew to be the two men I had seen under the window; they were not far from me, and as they were running they looked back again, and looked at the window - I saw them sufficient to know they were the same men; I have no doubt of it: I saw the prosecutor almost instantly; he was half bent, and his head streaming with blood - he came from round the corner: my husband went out; I saw the two prisoners again the same night, in custody of the watchman, and instantly recognised them as the two persons I had seen under the window - they are the two men: I was married in January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you were rather frightened? A. Yes: not so much when I saw them run as when I saw the man bleeding: it is rather a lonely place - my husband had told me he had taken two of the men before I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you saw the prosecutor till you saw him bleeding? A. It might be five minutes - I cannot exactly say; it appeared so to me waiting: I dare say the men staid a minute under the window - it was all done in a very short time; I told the Magistrate I could recognise them by their faces - I am almost positive I mentioned their faces; they had hats on - I do not believe that either of them had a cap on under the window; they wore hats, to the best of my recollection; I cannot be certain whether one might not have a cap, but the rest of their dress I particularly noticed; I believe they wore hats - I only guess the distance of the lamp.</p>
               <p>JAMES HORNE. I am a watchman. I was applied to by Raim, and took up the two male prisoners; they said nothing to me - Turner's trousers were both wet and dirty at the knees, as if he had been down in the dirt on his knees; I took them to the watch-house; I did not know either of them before - I had not seen either of them that night.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of Great North-street and Grove-road. On the evening of the 6th of May, a little before eleven o'clock. I was standing at the corner of Great North-street, Marylebone, about ten minutes to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110093"/>eleven o'clock; I observed five men come in a direction from St. John's-wood; I have seen the whole five ofter before - I could tell the names of two of those who are absent, and am certain the prisoners are two of those five -I have frequently seen them passing up and down the grove of a night, but did not know their names; I am certain they are two of the five, for I followed them down North-street to observe what they were about: I know where Raim lived in Great North-street; they were going in a direction towards his house, but they turned off towards Little North-street; the extent of my beat is at the end of Great North-street - I did not follow them further; they were then seventy-two paces from where the robbery was done; I have measured it: though I stated it to the Magistrate to be about one hundred and fifty yards, I measured it, and it is seventy-two paces of my own steps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you measure the distance of the nearest lamp to Raim's house? A. It is about fifty paces; I call one of my paces a yard - her window is a height that I think a person might be identified from.</p>

            . I am one of the serjeants of Mary-lebone watch. About twenty-five minutes past eleven o'clock, I was coming along Church-street, Lisson-grove, and saw some of the watchmen's lights in an open place; I ran across, and saw the two male prisoners in custody; Davis came up, and said, in their presence, "That is the man who held my mouth;" (pointing to Turner) Turner heard that - they made no reply in my hearing; Davis identified them both - he said he believed them both to be the men who held him down, and held his mouth; and he said if it was so, the knees of their trousers must be dirty- I turned a watchman's lantern towards Turner, and both the knees of his trousers were dirty and wet; I examined Crowther - there were no marks on his knees - I examined their shoes; they were dirty - I took them to the watch-house, and next morning I went to the spot where the robbery was committed, and saw a quantity of blood there, and footmarks, as if a struggle had taken place, and the impressions of shoes - it is a yellow brick clay soil; I went with Webster, the officer, to the watch-house, about half-past five o'clock that morning; Webster took off Turner's shoes, and Crowther pulled his off himself - I tried one pair at the place, and 
               <persName id="t18290611-205-person1558">Webster</persName>
             the other; we compared them with the marks, and they exactly fitted, even the nails, and every thing - I am perfectly certain that those shoes had made the marks on that ground - that is my judgment; there were more marks than had been made by these two pairs of shoes - the tip of the heel of one pair had been worn off; this is it, and there were marks fitting it, and other marks of the very same number of nails in - the tips of both pairs fitted some of the marks.</p>

               <p>Q.Was there any thing out of the common way in the shoe, did you find marks that exactly fitted it? A. I did; here are Crowther's shoes - they were also very plain to be seen; these nails in the too were very plain; I have no doubt these shoes must have been on the feet of the individuals who were on the spot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they not appear to be the marks of persons who had been struggling about? A. No; there did not appear to have been struggling where the footmarks were - they are ordinary shoes; Davis did not express a doubt about the men in my hearing - he was quite certain of them; he believed them both to be the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say the two men had knelt over him? A. No, not exactly; he said Turner was the man who knelt over him, and he believed the other to be the man who held his mouth - he did not say I should find the knees of both of them dirty, but I examined both; I found no large carving-knife - I found three knives; Davis said some person in a blue coat held a carving-knive over his breast - it had not rained in the night.</p>

            . I belong to the Police-office, of Marylebone. I went with Birnie to the watch-house, and took the shoes off the prisoners - I accompanied him to the spot where the robbery was committed, and compared the shoes with the footmarks very carefully, and am convinced these shoes had been there before; I was perfectly satisfied as to Turner's shoes by the length, the width, and the tip to the heel, and the nails in the heel, all correspond with the marks - we measured them; I have no doubt whatever of Turner's shoes having been there before, also by the colour of the clay on them - I compared Crowther's shoes with some marks, and was not so satisfied in my own mind as to his as Turner's; I apprehended the female prisoner from the description that was given of her, and knowing she was acquainted with Turner - I went down to the New Prison thinking she would be bringing him refreshment; I saw her there, took her, and told her it was on suspicion of having been with

             that night - she denied it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She knew Turner was in prison? A. Yes, because she went there to him - Crowther took off his shoes, picked them up, looked at them, and said, "You cannot match mine," I have not satisfied myself about his.</p>

             GORDON. I am a cooper and shipowner. I saw Mr. Hardy on his return from the India-house - about twenty minutes before that, I had seen the prisoner and given charge of him to an officer in Cornhill, for taking a handkerchief from a pocket; I took the handkerchief from the prisoner's hand myself, and saw the prosecutor's name on it - I knew him on seeing him; I asked if it was his - the prisoner was in custody with two others; I saw him take the handkerchief from a pocket, but did not know it was the prosecutor then; the other two went away immediately as I laid hold of the prisoner - one of them was older than him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You of course paid him all you owed him, and there was a balance struck? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner ever demand any thing as due by you to him? A.Never; I made this charge about a week or a fortnight after he left.</p>

             WEBBER. I live at No. 48, Chiswell-street, Finsbury. I carried a letter, containing money, to the prisoner; the letter appeared to me to contain money - I felt money in it: I staid while it was opened; it was from Mrs. Thacker, directed to Mr. Taylor - I took it to the East India Chambers, Leadenhall-street, which was Mr. Taylor's counting-house; I delivered the letter to the prisoner, and was in the counting-house when it was opened: I did not positively see him open it- I said I had brought that letter for Mr. Taylor, and I was to take a receipt back for it; he said Mr. Taylor was not there, but my paying it to him would be quite right, the same as if I paid it to Mr. Taylor - he gave me a stamped receipt; I brought it home, and gave it to the lady who gave me the letter - she was in town then; it was Mrs. Thacker's mother; I never read it myself; I did not know what the sum was - I am sure I gave Mrs. Thacker's mother the same paper I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He might have passed off as Mr. Taylor to you, if he had chosen? A. yes; I felt something like money in the letter and heard it jink - I knew it was money; I am sure he is the person to whom I gave it, and who gave me the receipt.</p>
               <p>JANE MANSON. I am Mrs. Thacker's mother. I myself brought the money down to my daughter to put into the letter; I do not know whether I saw her put it in -I was in the room when she wrote the letter; I brought it to London, delivered it to Webber, and told her to take it to the East India chambers, Leadenhall-street -I know it contained money; Webber took it out, returned, and gave me a paper, which Mr. Taylor has got(looking at it); this is the man's receipt for it - I am certain it is the paper Webber brought me (read).</p>
               <p>August 1, 1828. Received of Mrs. Thacker the sum of 13l. 7s. 10d. amount of bill delivered for

               <p>JOHN LEACH. I am in the employ of Mr. Sweet. On the 8th of May, in the morning, this drawing was in the window, which was closed; the shop door was open; I was opening the shop, and just as I took the shutter in I saw the prisoner come in and take the picture; he went out with it; I went after him directly - I lost sight of him and overtook him in Fetter-lane with it, under his arm - I met a gentleman, and got him to lay hold of him, which he did; I took the picture; he said nothing.</p>

            . I am a glazier, and live in the Edgware-road. On the 10the of June I saw my next door neighbour run to the prosecutor's door; I saw the prisoner running down Chapel-street with a bundle - I pursued him, he turned two corners, and was near two hundred yards from the prosecutor's when he dropped the bundle, I pursued him into a court and took him - I am certain he is the person I saw carrying the bundle - it was not taken up till I brought him back to the place where it had been dropped, and I took it up - he had been running very fast.</p>

               <p>GEORGE JUDGE. On the 1st of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was standing near Waterloo-bridge - I saw the two prisoners follow a gentleman, and then they passed on, and went to the prosecutors' shop; Jordan made an attempt to take a trunk, which he could not do - they then turned back and went to the shop again; I lost sight of them for about two minutes - we then crossed the way and went on to Somerset-house, looked down a turning, and saw them tying up something in a handkerchief; they came up, and I took Jordan, who had this bag under his left arm - Bessant ran off, and Fogg took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not see them take the bag? A. No; I saw them attempting a gentleman's pocket before - they then went and tried another gentleman's pocket; I was on the other-side of the way.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FOGG. I was with Judge in the Strand. I saw the prisoners together for about an hour; I know the prosecutors' shop - I saw Jordan stand against it, and Bessant was opposite; I then saw them going towards the Strand - Jordan had something under his arm; they went down a turning which leads to the Adelphi - we came up to them, and Judge took this bag from Bessant.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a private mark on it? A. No; I know it by hanging it up so often - it is not an uncommon pattern; the workmanship makes me positive it is the same - they are made by women; the handle of this is worn away by hanging it up so many times - I was thinking I should clean it up; it is what we call a halfyard bag, the next size would be a half-ell - our shop is very long.</p>

            . I am an officer. At half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 14th of May, I saw the prisoner and two other men in Rathbone-place; the prisoner went on to Charlotte-street - I saw two of the workmen come out of No. 1; he followed them some distance, then returned, went into the house, and came out again with these tools - I took him, and asked if they were his own; he said they were; I then asked if he worked there- he said he should answer no more questions.</p>

I met two men, who asked if I would go over the way and get some tools; I asked if there was any danger of my getting into trouble - they said No, but they had been having some words with their master, and did not like to go; I said I was going to take them to those two young men - the officer saw them, but he did not take them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoners' residence, and found John at home; I found the handkerchiefs in the boxes; some of them John said had been given to them to sell, and some they had bought: when William came home he said he gave 1s. 6d. or 2s. a piece for them - they live in Hoxton; Messrs. Venables' shop is in Oxford-street; William keeps a butcher's-shop, and I believe John is his servant.</p>

            . I go out to needle-work. On the 8th of June I was near the shop at Old Brentford; I saw the prisoner go to the shop - the door was shut; he opened it, and went in - he came out in about three minutes, with a piece of red print locked under his coat; he had nothing when he went in - he went straight up the lane, as if to go home; I told Mrs. Lawrie of it, and she sent the washerwoman, who watched him home; I could not see the pattern of the print, but it was red.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had business there; I went and knocked at the door, to see if it was settled about the hat. Witness. No, he did not knock; I was opposite, with the baby in my arms.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never stepped my foot in; I had this bundle under my arm which I have now, with some old shoes in it. Witness. I am quite certain he had nothing when he went in, and what he brought out was not this bundle - it was quite a flat bundle.</p>

On the evening of the 8th of June, I saw the prisoner come down as I stood at the end of the lane, which is only one house from the shop; he went towards the prosecutor's shop - I took no further notice till about three or four minutes, when he returned with something tucked under the flap of his coat - it was of a red colour, but I did not see what it was; I think it was a larger bundle than the one he has now - it looked like a piece of print.</p>

            . I live in Westmoreland-street. On the 7th of June, at half-past eight o'clock, a person came and told my mistress the prisoner had taken some pots from the doors in the street - I followed her, and in Little Mary-lebone-street I asked her if she had taken a pot off the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110102"/>railing; she said she had not been in the street - I followed her on to Bulstrode-street; she there called another woman - I saw she had something in her apron before she spoke to that woman.</p>

            . I was going along Welbeck-street, and this lad called me to follow the prisoner down to Old Cavendish-street, and on to Shepperd-street - I then went and asked what she had got; she gave me one pot of Mr. Tomsey's and said, "Let me go" - the boy said she had some more, and I found a quart and a pint pot of Mr. Williamson's in her apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told you to stop the woman in the red cloak; she gave me them to hold. Witness. There was a woman in a red cloak who spoke to the prisoner, but I did not know where she was gone - I did not see the prisoner and the woman meet, but they were speaking together.</p>

I took down the bed, and the sheets were gone - he said the bed had never been lain on.</p>

I have only been four months in this country - I only received 10s. a fortnight from the Society for the Support of the Spanish Refugees; it was not quite sufficient, and I pawned these sheets from distress, intending to get them out again - the landlady missed them - I told her if she was not satisfied, I would leave her a coat or something not to make a disturbance - she kept a house of ill-fame, and would listen to no reason - my character may be heard from Mr. Freshfield, the Secretary to the Spanish Refugees.</p>

            . I was with Robert Morris on the 7th of June, about half-past twelve o'clock at night - the two prisoners were passing by; Wright took the handkerchief from Morris' pocket - Morris gave a jump, and said,"My handkerchief is gone;" I ran after them to the corner of Compton-street - I saw no watchman; they then turned, and run down a street - I and a friend ran after them - they crossed Frith-street; I saw three watchmen coming up with a charge - I spoke to them, and one of them came and took the prisoners to the watch-house; the handkerchief has not been found; I am sure I saw Wright take it, and run it into his trousers pocket; Mr. Morris and I were afraid to take them, we were afraid we should be knocked down; Mr. Morris is not here; Farrell was close to Wright at the time it was taken.</p>
               <p>CHARLES O'NEAL. I am a watchman. I took the two prisoners at the corner of Compton-street - they denied all knowledge of it.</p>

               <p>STEWART MACDONALD. I was coming down St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner lift up the tail of Mr. Russell's coat; Mr. Russell stopped, and then he let the coat go, and went on the lamp post; the prosecutor then went as far as the watch-house, and then the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket - I am sure he is the boy.</p>

            . The prisoner and another person passed me about a quarter before twelve o'clock - I passed on down Chequer-alley, and saw the prosecutrix with the prisoner in custody, charging her with stealing the shawl; she denied knowing any thing about it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HORNSBY. I am a watchman. The prosecutrix passed me with a large shawl on; I assisted in taking the prisoner; the prosecutrix had no shawl on then - she said the prisoner had taken it; the prisoner denied it, and kept laughing; the prosecutrix appeared quite sober, though flurried.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I was going home, through Whitecross-street, when two or three persons ran with great violence against me, which nearly knocked me down, and before I could get over the shock, the prosecutrix took hold of me, and accused me of stealing her shawl. Knowing my innocence, I did not attempt to get away, which (in consequence of the state of intoxication the prosecutrix was in) I might easily have done.</p>

               <p>Prisoner CRAWLEY. Q. Did you not have your watch again? A. Yes; I took it up and put it into my pocket again, in the same house where I went in for my dog; there were one or two persons there, and I went in and treated them with drink - I was rather drowsy; there was a blue ribbon to my watch - I lost it afterwards.</p>

               <p>JOHN GATES. I am landlord of the King's Arms. I saw the prosecutor come in soon after four o'clock, with a female and a dog; the two prisoners came in afterwards - the woman was very noisy, and was taken away; the watch was afterwards found on the ground, and was picked up again - after that the prosecutor and the two prisoners had some beer; there was a deal of conversation about the watch: about half-past five o'clock they all went and sat down on a seat in front of the bar - the prosecutor went to sleep, and North appeared to be asleep too; Crawley stood up with a pint pot in his hand - I went into a small room where there was a glass over the fireplace - I heard a rushing, and looked into the glass; I saw Crawley running out of the house - North rolled over the prosecutor, and went out; I went to the prosecutor, shook him, and asked what he had lost - he said his watch; there was no other person there at that time but a female, who had come from the country.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not tipsy? A. No, not at all- I was not sick; I had not had any oysters - I gave you a shilling, and you went and got bread and cheese and raddishes for supper; I did not bolt the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHIELDS. I was night-constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - the prosecutor said she had robbed him of half a sovereign and half a crown; I saw a piece of gold in her mouth, and tried to get it, but she swallowed it - I found a shilling in her purse, half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110107"/>crown in her bosom, and half a crown in each of her stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not put your finger into my mouth? A. Yes, but I took it out again pretty soon, for I know you of old.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor in Longacre; he asked me to get him something to drink - I had 6s.; I took the prosecutor to the White Lion, and had a glass of wine - he asked if I had a room; I said I had not, but took him to No. 3, Legg-alley - he gave me half a crown to stop with him; I scrupled to take it - he then gave me a shilling to get some bread and cheese and raddishes, and he took my bonnet lest I should go away; he shut the door, and bolted it - the landlady went up and knocked at the door, and then he opened it and said"It is all right;" he then said he had lost his money - he had been sick on the bed; I gave him back the half-crown, and said I would not stay with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say it was an old file or rubber? A. Yes - this is nearly worn out.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodging on the 27th of April, and found two screw drivers, two files, and an iron chisel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the man's wife there? A. Yes - she gave us every facility to search the place.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD HODGSON GALLOWAY. My father's name is Alexander - he is an engineer, and lives in West Smithfield; he has many hands. On the 25th of April we had about one hundred workmen; the prisoner was a labourer there - he had 24s. a week; he was rather a superior hand - they are entrusted with tools like these, but are not at liberty to take any away; this rubber is my father's property, and these other tools - one of them has my father's name at full length; I have laid the value of them at 14s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is that large article? A. A rubber we call it, but it is in fact a file - comparatively these things are worth nothing; my father is a very particular man, and always makes out the men's wages himself - the prisoner has been five or six years in our service; we should not have kept him had he not been honest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. For the last seven years back labourers have lodged with me - both single men, and married men and their wives, have lodged with me; they used frequently to bring files, hammers and screw-drivers when they went to breakfast - they threw their tools down on the floor, and then took them back to the factory; if any of them have been left till night I have taken them to the gate, and the time-keeper has said, "Take them back, and bring them in the morning," and now at last they came and found these things in my house; the officer said,"Tell me the truth" - I said, "I am not ashamed, I live on Saffron-hill; tell my wife to come here" - she came, and I told her to go to Mr. Galloway's, to tell him I was in custody; she did, and he said, "It is more than I expected, but if it is my property I shall know it."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What is your father's name? A. Charles; these bricks were in a field which he had bought some time before - there was a private road across the field, not a regular thoroughfare for carriages; there were from twenty to thirty thousand bricks in that clump - they had been left regular, and I found the clump not regular.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LOWE. I am a shoemaker, and live at the back of Hale's-place, where the prosecutor's bricks are, I know the prisoner, and on the 14th I saw him taking away some bricks, between nine and ten o'clock, from the heap on the left hand side - I saw him take one barrow full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they brick-bats? A. Yes; some of them were very good ones.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q.Was this at near ten o'clock in the evening? A. Yes; I followed him, and saw him wheel the bricks down the place where he lives - some of them were whole bricks; Mr. Vale is dead - he was examined one Thursday, and died on the Thursday following.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to JOSEPH LOWE. Q. Did you see me on the 14th take any bricks or bats away? A. Yes, and many times before - I was crossing the road to get some strings for some shoes I had to take home.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the reason you did not tell the prosecutor of it? A.Because I did not like to make mischief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARTIN. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 26, Wood-street. I have known the prisoner nineteen years- I was at Queen-square, and heard Mr. Sadler say that I was the man who took the bricks; Mr. Gregorie told him to look round and see if he knew the man - he saw me in the corner and said, "That is the man," meaning me - he then turned round and saw the prisoner, and pointed to him.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER re-examined. Q. Is that the fact? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your solemn oath were you not told to turn round, and then pointed to him? A. No; I pointed my hand backwards without looking at the man, as I knew he had been there before - the prisoner was the only man in the bar; Mr. Gregorie asked me twice -I did not mean to allude to this man; I pointed behind me.</p>
               <p>MR. THORNTON. That is true; he kept his eyes on Mr. Gregorie, and pointed behind him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you make any sign to him? A. No.</p>

            . I live in Tottenham-court-road. On the 9th of June the prisoner came to my shop and presented a silver milk-pot to sell; she said she lived with a lady in Oxford-street, and during her absence the children had got the milk pot and battered it up, and her mistress sent her to see what I would give for that, and what a new one would cost; I said the old one was worth about 15s., and a new one would be about 2l.; she cried and made a great piece of work - she said she would leave it with me, but it was a very hard case that she should have to pay for what was done by the children.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had to clean the parlour, and I had to move a trunk from one side of the parlour to another; I did not see the milk-pot, and I put it upon it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110111"/>I knew my mistress was very severe, and I know the property is not hers - it belongs to a man she lives with, who has a wife - I wanted to know what I could get one for, as I knew she would make me pay for it; I asked what he would charge for a milk pot the size of that, he said 2l. but he said," You can sell this for old silver, and it will come to 15s. or 16s." - I said it was a good deal of money to pay, but I would go and ask my mistress to come.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNT. This is broken purposely.</p>
               <p>MRS. NUTTALL, re-examined. Q. Did you make her pay for any thing before? A. Yes; for a baking-dish which I lent her - she was very insolent, and I did keep 2s., and told her when she replaced the baking-dish I would give it her back again; I am a little hasty sometimes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you are sure he is not the man? A. I mean to say I have my doubts about it; I conceive he is not the man - he is not the man; I have no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure the prisoner at the bar is not the man? A. I really believe him not to be the man - I think I can swear I am sure he is not: but fifteen years is a long time, and may much alter a person, but I believe him not to be the man; I will swear he is not the man - I have not seen the man since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner since? A. Yes; Mr. Wontner gave me leave to see him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear he was in Newgate? A. His friends, no doubt, wished me to come and identify him; I am a fellowship-porter, and work at Billingsgate - I was suspended, but the suspension was taken off last hall-day, the second Wednesday in this month - it was for six months on suspicion of doing wrong, taking two Dutch-plaice - they were in a boat where I was measuring them, I brought them up, and they suspected I took them improperly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept any place of public entertainment lately? A. I have been to many such places; I kept a bear and badger bait, in St. Luke's, for three or four years- it is more than ten years ago; I got a reward for Tisley's conviction, and a Tyburn ticket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you were found out to be brought here? A. About a week or ten days ago, I think; I do not know who sent for me - I do not think it was the prisoner; he might occasion it - it was from some of his friends no doubt; any man might find me at Billingsgate - I never saw the prisoner at my house; a gentlemanly sort of man asked me to come here - he said a man was taken up, named

               <p>Q. Then what made you say you believed he came from his friends? A. I cannot understand these equivocations - he told me what he came upon; I should be sorry to swear he is the man, when I do not think he is; I did send the prisoner a bit of fish into Newgate a few days ago as I felt for him - I did not know him.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JACKSON. I knew John Tisley about sixteen years ago; I am a silk-weaver, and now work for Mr. Archibald, of Mitre-court; Tisley was convicted of burglary about sixteen years ago - I knew him very well- he was not an acquaintance; he was older than me a good deal, but he lived next door to me; I did not associate with him - the prisoner is not that man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Tisley was your next door neighbour, perhaps you attended here and give him a character? A. No; I was but eleven or twelve years old, and lived with my father and mother; I have not seen him since - he was about the prisoner's height, but much stouter; he had dark chesnut hair and dark eyes.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know he was convicted here? A. I recollect Armstrong's father coming and apprehending my brother in the room of him, but he let him go again -I think it was sixteen years ago, but cannot be sure; I recollect him by a certain mark he had on his hair; he had some marks of white hair - he was not very intimate with our family, only his mother kept a mangle, and we took our things there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see this prisoner? A. I have known him about eighteen months: he lived in the neighbourhood, but not next door; he goes by the name of

I have come to say I know he is not John Tisley - Loader and his wife came for me; Tisley is a man I was acquainted with; Loader's wife did not come for me - it was Loader and the prisoner's wife; they said it would be kind of me to come, as I knew the prisoner so well; he is not at all like Tisley - he is the man whom I have come to say is not Tisley.</p>
               <p>Q. Who have you come to give a character to? A. They told me it was Tisley that was here - I was not in Court when he was tried; I was a neighbour of his, and lived close to him - I do not know the prisoner now at the bar - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who have you come to give a character to? A. That man - I never saw him before; his wife asked me to come to look to see if he was Tisley or not; Loader asked me to come as well.</p>
               <p>Q. What character can you give him? A. People tell me he is a very hard working honest man - I know no more than that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The man at the bar is quite unlike the man who was tried here? A. Quite so - he is not at all like him; he was stouter than this man, and had dark eyes- the prisoner has not got dark eyes; his hair was lighter than the prisoner's; it was a kind of sandy colour, inclning to carrotty red hair; he was about the prisoner's size - I knew him well; I never saw the prisoner before to-day.</p>

            . I am not related to the prisoner - I am the mother of the man who was transported - I do not know the prisoner; I never saw him before to-day - I am quite sure he is not my son; I knew nothing about him till I was found out - they at first said it was my son, till I was brought up: my son was transported for life - I do not know what has become of him - I have not seen him from that day to this; I never saw the prisoner in my life- I went to Loader, and desired him to come and say it was not my son; there is not a bit of likeness between the prisoner and my son: I have had but one letter from him; that was ten yearsago - I live at No. 7, Turvey-street: I know Jackson; we live pretty near each other; not far off - that is not in the same street; I never saw the prisoner with Jackson; I am sure I never saw him before - I first heard of this about three weeks ago, and went to Loader -I have not been to Newgate since my son was there, nor sent any of my family there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you known Jackson? A. I did not know him till he came and told me to come here - my husband is still living; Jackson did not live next door to me - I keep a mangle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jackson ever bring things to you to mangle? A. Why I forget; he knew my son - I do not think his father and mother ever lived next door to me, but the young man says he lived in the same neighbourhood - I lived in Winson-street, Spitalfields, at the time of my son's misfortune - I never heard of Jackson before this.</p>

            . I am married, and live at Bethnalgreen; my husband is a painter. I am sister to Tisley, who was transported - I am older than him; it was seventeen years ago; or it may be not quite so much; I have only heard of him once since; I know nothing of the prisoner -I never saw him before; I have lived at Bethnal-green all my life - I do not see any likeness of my brother in him; he is very unlike him: I never saw the prisoner till this morning - I am sure he is not my brother, nor is he the man who was transported: I do not know Jackson; I lived with my brother before he was transported - my mother keeps a mangle; I came here with Jackson this morning - Loader did not come with us: the first time I saw Jackson was on Saturday; I do not remember his coming to my mother's about the time my brother was transported - I am now about thirty-seven years old; I and my brother lived with my mother: I have known Lydia Foulkes these eighteen years; I never saw Loader till Saturday; I never saw the prisoner in Newgate, and know nothing about fish being sent him there; I went to see my brother in prison about seventeen years ago - I have not been to see the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at the Jury - was your brother taller or shorter than the prisoner? A. I think he was much of the same height; rather stouter, and rather darker hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Not carrotty, or inclined to be sandy? A. Yes it was, but it was darker.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that man, and tell me, on your solemn oath, is not that your brother? A. No, he is not; I never saw him with my eyes before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Jackson did not live next door to you when your brother was tried? A. Not to my knowledge - I never saw him before Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has been sworn that at the time your brother was convicted Jackson lived next door, and used to take clothes to be mangled by your mother, that is false, is it? A. I do not know; he might have done that - I cannot say; I lived with my mother then; Loader did not ask me to come here.</p>
               <p>MARTHA LOADER. I am the wife of the Samuel Loader.

            ; he had no complaint for months before the 10th of May, that I know of; we were always together, and I should have known if he had - his last severe illness was last Christmas twelve months; he at times said his inside was a little out of order: for a week before the 10th of May he stated himself to be better in strength and spirits than he had been for months - I lived next door to him: he came to me on the 10th of May, about five minutes before he went out, and asked the way to Golden-square - I told him; I went out for about three hours, and when I returned he was at home, lying on the sofa, so unwell; he could not rise without assistance - this was between one and two o'clock: I persuaded him to get up and come down to dinner, in order to rally him, but he hardly took any thing; he appeared in great pain, and great agitation - towards five o'clock he got so extremely ill that I persuaded him to go to bed, and helped him up stairs - he got gradually worse; I got Dr. Lloyd about eight o'clock that evening; he died on the Saturday morning following - from the time he took to his bed he was certain he should not live, and arranged his affairs; he said he should never recover - he said nothing more than that, as to the certainty of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had Mr. Lloyd been attending your brother for any length of time? A. Not for two months; he then paid Mr. Lloyd two or three visits; he had a depression of spirits in consequence of the death of his wife - there was nothing the matter with him at this time; his inside had been out of order - that was set right by a little medicine: I believe Mr. Lloyd wrote for him - his wife died of a complication of diseases- I have heard she had some stoppage in her inside, what it was I cannot say, and there was a tumor also. I attended the Coroner's Inquest; Mr. Van Butchell was not there - the verdict was returned without his being there: no proposal was made to delay it till he could he sent for; an attorney came from Mr. Van Butchell, and requested to see my brother's body, on Friday, when it was too late - he came about three hours before the funeral: the friends were all assembled, and the body fastened down; Mr. Van Butchell was taken into custody on the day of the Inquest(Wednesday); we refused to grant a view of the body, as it was fastened down, and not in a fit state to be opened - I saw Mr. Lloyd after the Inquest; I know of no application being made for a surgeon to see the body till the Friday I mention; if any body had come to see it on behalf of Mr. Van Butchell in proper time, he should have seen it; I did not say if I had the Coroner's authority they might see it - a paper was brought with a request from the Coroner, the day after the funeral.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether your brother had walked from Golden-square? A. He walked to the first coach-stand, and rode the rest of the way.</p>

            . I live in Frederick's -place, Old Jewry, and am a surgeon. I called on the deceased about the 8th or 10th of May, and found him in a state of great depression of mind and body, apparently suffering great uneasiness; he complained of great uneasiness in the abdomen, and greater pain in the lower part, towards the left side - he said, "I am aware I have received such an injury in my bowels as I shall not recover;" my opinion from an examination of him, and from his report of an operation he had undergone, was that his bowels were seriously injured: I stated that I considered his life in a very uncertain state, but that at that moment it was impossible for me to say what injury he had sustained: independent of the injury he had received, there were not those symptoms to lead me to suppose he must necessarily die; I had several conversations with him - I endeavoured to encourage him, but his expression always was, he believed he should not recover. On the evening of his decease I examined his body, and found the whole of the abdomen very much extended, and on cutting it I found it arose from gas; the contents of the abdomen altogether exhibited appearances of inflammation: the general appearance of the covering of the viscera was that of recent inflammation - the parts were gathered together by a sort of lymph and serum, mixed with flakes of lymph in the cavity of the abdomen: the appearances of inflammation were greater in the lower part of the abdomen, and on endeavouring to examine the upper part of the rectum, I found such inflammation had gone on to that part, that another portion of the intestine was adhering to it - I was anxious to examine that part particularly, and as some injury might be occasioned by removing the parts at once from the body, I examined them in their natural situation; for that purpose it was necessary to separate a portion of the intestines, which was adhering to it - I did so, and at once perceived the rectum had been perforated, so that its cavity, and that of the abdomen were injured - I proceeded to remove the injured part from the body, and the portion of the intestines that adherred to it; I was then enabled to examine them more particularly, and was then confirmed in my opinion, that it was occasioned by violence, and not by disease; I have subsequently examined them again and again, and am the more fully confirmed in my opinion; any uneven instrument being introduced would have produced this injury, whether sharp or blunt - I have here a straight clyster-pipe, six inches long, by which a similar accident was occasioned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q.Who occasioned that accident? A. A nurse in the hospital - the patient died: on pressing the lower part of the deceased's abdomen he complained of pain - I found the peritonoeum considerably inflamed; his feeling a tenderness there, was not a decisive criterion of a peritonoeal inflammation - I was con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110115"/>vinced he was not suffering from peritonoeal inflammation to any extent when I first saw him - it came on afterwards; he was bled two successive days - I generally prescribe only, but I did bleed him on the Tuesday; he had a dozen leeches on the Sunday - they usually take about half an ounce each, but the quantity is uncertain; leeches were again applied on Monday, and I think twice that day - I bled him in the arm on Tuesday, till he was faint, which is the only good rule to bleed by in such cases; I should think I took sixteen ounces or eighteen ounces, but will not undertake to say positively - I bled him again next day in the arm; on examination after death, I found the upper part of the rectum adhering to some of the smaller guts - I had used a cutting instrument to open the body; I took the part out, partly with my hand, and partly with a cutting instrument; I found the adhesion before that - I separated the smaller intestines from the large, with my hand - the rectum, in my opinion, varies in different individuals from seven to eight inches - in my opinion, decidedly not ten inches; it is a continuation of the large gut.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the distance from the anus to the part where the adhesion was, seven or eight inches? A. Not in a straight line, it would be little more than four inches to the upper part of the rectum; the gut lays round in a curved situation - if the rectum was taken out of the cavity, in which it lays, it is much longer, but a straight instrument, could only go in a straight direction; I did not take away any part of the gut in separating them; where the inflammation is of recent duration, it could not be done - I separated them gently with my hand; I doubt the possibility of doing it, if the inflammation had been of long standing; it was almost impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. If you wanted to examine the rectum, and parts adjacent, would not the right course have been, to have taken them out, and infuse water into them, to see where the injury was? A. I never adopted that course - if I could not discover it, it would be necessary to use other means, but here it was quite obvious, generally speaking - from two inches and a half to three inches of the intestine is in contact with the bladder: when distended the bladder is much higher up, it depends on the size of the bladder - when it is distended, it extends quite above the rectum; the injury was about four inches from the anus, in a straight line - if an instrument had gone in a backward direction, it would have gone against the back-bone or bladder, but in a front direction it would not; a cellular membrane fills up the space between the bladder and rectum - in my judgment it would not be safe to pass a straight gauge, six inches long, if made of uneven materials; it is not within my knowledge that any regular surgeons introduce such an instrument as an uneven gauge - there are flexible metallic gauges; I never saw an uneven one, six inches long, introduced - I have seen a pliable one used; I have for years paid particular attention to the disease of the rectum.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like to know how many patients you may have had under your care in those cases? A. I have been in large practice for many years, and cannot tell you within one or two hundred; I include strictures and those sort of complaints - I cannot tell how many cases of stricture of the rectum I have had; I never saw Mr.

             before to-day - I attended the inquest, but left when I had given my evidence; I did not suggest to the Coroner the propriety of sending for the person who performed the operation - I had nothing to do with it; Mr. Salmon called, and told me he was going to examine the body - I replied,</p>
               <p>"I have the parts here that are injured, and you can see them," and it was no use his going to see the body, as I had the parts; I had taken them out on the evening of the day he died - it was by day-light, between seven and eight o'clock, I think; we were a good while about it, and as the part, in its natural situation, lay in a cavity, I had a candle to put into that cavity, that I might better examine them - in my opinion the rectum is not ordinarily ten inches long, decidedly not; parts of the body vary according to the height of an individual, but in the average number of cases it is not ten - it possibly may be so in some individuals; the cavity of the rectum is usually strong and thick compared to the smaller intestines.</p>
               <p>Q.From the anus for the first four inches is it not natuturally straight? A. I should say not; the principal curve is that of the lower part of the back bone - the intestines in their natural state may be dilated very much, but when inflamed they cannot.</p>

               <p>Q.Suppose the patient was on his knees, and his head down to the floor, would not the rectum be straighter than if in another position? A. I should think it possible, the lower part might be, but the other part would be still more curved; I have put a patient in that position merely to examine the state of the prostrate glands, and to examine if their was a stricture in the rectum, but not commonly - the cerum in the cavity would arise from inflammation, which would cause the smaller part of the gut to adhere; inflammation of some standing, at times, produces ulceration - I do not think I had seen the deceased for more than three months before; he then consulted me for the piles, which is a disease in the lower part of the rectum - operations fail at times, when performed by the most regular surgeons: I remember the case of Mary Kent, at the hospital - I removed her breast when she was in a state of pregnancy; she died soon afterwards - it was a tumor I removed.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have had more experience since that, do you consider you acted right? A. I still consider it doubtful, for I have heard it discussed in medical societies, and heard different opinions; many think it was wrong, but allow me to say she died of a disease she had had several times before, and whether it arose from the operation it is impossible to say - she did not die from the operation clearly; I found the deceased's liver slightly diseased. I am a member of the College of Surgeons; Mr. Smith, who assisted me in the examination, is not so.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing the rectum had been perforated, would not the consequence have been very acute pain, and an inability to walk or stir? A. With such an operation as this I should say not immediately - it would cause great pain and faintness, but I consider the pain would not be longer than the faintness; he would be able to walk, for I saw a person who walked from Islington in a worse situation, with part of his bowels hanging out - that was not with a hole in the rectum.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cellular membrane had been perforated as well as the rectum, would not blood flow? A. I think very little; I am unable to say whether any would have ap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110116"/>peared externally, if the operation be performed by a blunt instrument - if the bladder was perforated it is uncertain whether there would have been blood: I think it more probable that there would not - if blood had flown, I think it most probably would have gone to the intestines; it depends entirely on where the vessel was wounded - there was evidence of active inflammation having gone on about the parts; I did not use any injection when there was a difficulty in getting the bowels to act - I said the proper thing to be done was a clyster, but as I believed the bowels were perforated, if an injection was thrown up, it would destroy the patient at once.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have the injured parts here? A. I have; I attribute the death to the inflammation arising from the injury of the rectum. The case of Mrs. Kent occurred within the last twelve months - will you, as an observation made will tend to insinuate I did not treat the patient right, permit me to say the reason bleeding was not had recourse to at first, was his being in such a state of great bodily and mental depression, that it would have caused instant death.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You adopted the best means in your judgment? A. I did.</p>

               <p>GEORGE COOMBS. I come from the prison in custody: I know the prisoners at the bar - I became acquainted with Conway about three years ago, he at that time lived in the Temple with a Mr. Bale; I was living as clerk to Mr. Busby, a barrister - our acquaintance was broken off, and resumed about four months since, when I saw him in the Temple: I was still living with Mr. Bushy; I told him where I was living - he stated that he was living with Mr. Hinrich, in the Adelphi; I had taken him to Mr. Busby's chambers, and this conversation was there; he asked me if I would call any evening, after six o'clock, at Mr. Hinrich's house to see him - I agreed to do so; Mr. Hinrich lived at No. 9, John-street, Adelphi - he is a solicitor; we saw each other frequently after that; we sometimes met at Mr. Hinrich's house, and sometimes at the Brunswick coffee-house, in Pickett-street, Temple-bar, kept by Jonathan Busby; I recollect Conway saying to me that he was very much in want of money - that he had unfortunately seduced a young girl who lived at Mr. Hinrich's house, and he wished to marry her; he said if he did so, he feared he had not sufficient from his employment to keep her, and the only thing he could do, was to ask Mr. Hinrich to advance him 10l.; the next evening when I met him there, he said Mr. Hinrich had declined to do so - this was about the beginning of March; a few evenings after that I went there, and he said Mr. Hinrich had refused to advance him the money, and he knew how he could obtain some money if I could obtain him a blank cheque; I said I did not know how to obtain one, and if I did I should not like to do it; the conversation dropped then, and I appointed to meet him next evening at the coffee-house in Pickett-street; I did so - while we were in there reading the newspaper over, Martelly was there, and got into conversation with us - I only knew him before by seeing him at this coffee-shop; Martelly said he had been out of work a long time, and asked if we knew of any situation we could tell him of; I said I knew of none - Conway answered the same; Martelly said he had been out of a situation since last September and no one could assist him, and he was almost starving - I think he said if he did not soon obtain employment he must do something; Conway answered, and asked him if he could obtain a blank cheque, and I recollect Conway saying he knew of a good go - Martelly said he could obtain one, that his father had been a clerk, and I think he said at a banking-house; Conway then asked me whether I would give my consent to his procuring one; I said I would leave it entirely to him - Conway and myself got up and went out, Martelly followed us, and said if we were afraid to let him get the cheque, he would tell us of a circumstance for which we might have a down upon him: I understood, from what he related afterwards, that we could tell of a circumstance he had committed in case he split upon us; he said, that about two years ago he saw an advertisement in the paper of a young man wanted at a wholesale stationer's in Cornhill, and that security was required; that he endeavoured to get the situation by forging the name of some security, and that he obtained the situation, and was sent round the country to obtain orders; he received money for other orders which had been completed - and that on one occasion when he went out there was a great deal of money owing, that he had contrived to collect as much as 200l., absconded, and went off to New York with it; I believe Williams and Co. of Cornhill, was where he got the situation; Conway said he felt disposed to let him have the cheque - we then parted, and he promised to meet us next day at the coffee-house in Pickett-street, this was about the 12th of March; we met, and Martelly said he had got information from his father how he could obtain cheques, but he knew a clerk living with a solicitor in Old Burlington-street, who kept cash at Drummonds, he said he would rather go there and try to obtain a blank cheque than that he would go from the information of his father - he appointed to meet me on the following morning at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Before that application did Conway say any thing?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110117"/>A. I do not remember: he was to meet me at the coffee-shop, in Pickett-place, next morning; I met him there, and he asked if I would walk a little way with him - we went to Old Burlington-street: nothing whatever passed about where we were going to; when we got there, he asked me to wait at the corner of the street until he returned - I did so; when he returned, he said he had been to the gentleman he thought he could get the check from, and was sorry to say he had not obtained one, and could not obtain one; he did not mention the clerk's name, but said the solicitor's name was Hoper - we came back again to the coffee-house, and in a short time I left him; in the evening we all three met there - Martelly stated to Conway that he could not obtain the cheque there, and he must go to his father's, and get information how he could obtain it - we were to meet there next morning again; I and Martelly met there next morning - he said he had got information how he was to obtain the cheque-book, by going to Drummond's, and asking for a cheque-book in the name of Mr. Hoper - he said he would see Conway, would tell him of it, and he would go next morning to Drummond's to obtain the cheque-book: he appointed to meet me next morning, at half-past nine o'clock, at the coffee-house in Pickett-place - I went, and Martelly was not there; he came in about half an hour after, and said he had been and obtained the cheque-book; that I was to accompany him to Conway's office - we went together to Mr. Hinrich's office, and I saw Conway; I do not remember what day that was - there were several cheques shown me by Martelly; he had them in his hand when I first saw them; they were filled up, ready to go to the banker's - he showed me several; they had Mr. B. W. Horne's name on them; I believe he belongs to the Golden Cross, Charing-cross: as Conway had shown me a letter which had come from Mr. Horne to Mr. Hinrich, Conway asked me which signature I thought was the best; fetched a letter, with the name of B. W. Horne to it, and asked me to compare it; I said I thought he was better able to tell than myself - Martelly was there - I had seen Conway write the signature" 
               <persName id="t18290611-274-person1985">B. W. </persName>
            Horne" from the letter, on a blank piece of paper; he asked Martelly if he would select one - Martelly selected one, which he thought would do: it was put into my hands to present at Drummond's; Martelly said I must go to Drummond's to get the money for it - Conway was by; I took the cheque, but told them I thought I could not present it, for I thought I should betray myself - Martelly said he would go himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any woman in the office? A. A pot of ale was sent for, which I paid for; there was a woman there; I believe her name is Mead; she brought the ale - we were all together when she brought it; we each partook of some ale: Mrs. Mead left the room; Martelly said he would go and present the cheque, and that I should not have any of the money; I said he might do as he pleased: I do not recollect saying any thing else - the cheque was for 100l.; Conway made answer, and said I should have a share - we then all three went out for the purpose of going to Drummond's with the cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cheques were brought, with the name of Horne to them - were they all filled up? A. Yes; Martelly asked if there should not be a signature at the back of the cheque? Conway said he did not think it was necessary, but he could put it if he Martelly pleased, and he put on the back "Wood and Co., Long-acre" - this is the cheque, (looking at it) - I saw him put that name at the back - the cheque appeared as if it had been fresh drawn when I first saw it; nothing else passed - we walked together arm-in-arm to Drummond's, the bankers' door, which I believe is in Parliament-street - it is three or four doors from Spring-gardens; I understand that to be Parliament-street - it is about sixty or seventy yards from the figure on horseback, at Charing-cross: Martelly went into Drummond's - I and Conway were very near the door when he went in; I and Conway walked on in the street towards the Horse-guards, on the same side of the street: we crossed over, and waited at the corner of the street, and looked for Martelly coming out - we stood at the corner of Craig's-court, which is nearly opposite Drummond's; we saw Martelly come out, and cross over in a direction for St. Martin's-lane - we walked fast, and got up to him; Martelly said he had got the money - we went as far as Bedford-street, Covent-garden, and took a coach to Coleman-street, in the City; Martelly gave me in the coach twenty sovereigns, and Conway twenty sovereigns - he counted twenty, being all he had remaining in gold, which he kept for himself; we all three got out of the coach in Coleman-street, and Martelly said he would go into the Bank of England to change the notes with Conway - I remained at the corner of Tokenhouse-yard: they went away together - I remained where I was, and in about twenty minutes I saw them at the corner of the Bank and Bartholomew-lane; they came towards me, and we walked together as far as King-street, Cheapside, took a coach, and went to Lant-street, in the Borough - I and Martelly stopped in a coach, while Conway went into a house to see his young woman; he came out and got, into the coach again, and we went on to No. 7, William-street, Waterloo-road - a person named Johnson kept the house; I went there for the purpose of seeing a young woman named Smith: while we were in the coach going to William-street, Martelly gave me twelve sovereigns and 1l. 6s. 6d. in silver, and the same to Conway; I was acquainted with Smith - I lived with her occasionally; we had a bottle of wine there - Smith was there: we staid there about half an hour - I gave the landlord money to get the wine; I did not pull any out of my pocket - I pulled sufficient to pay for the wine out of my pocket, and gave it to the landlord; I gave the girl Smith two sovereigns - Martelly and Conway went away in about half an hour, but I remained there the whole of the evening; I did not go any where with Smith that evening; I may have pulled ten or twelve sovereigns out when I gave her the two; I cannot safely say there were more than ten.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not brought into this business altogether against your will? A. I accepted the money - I did enter into this king of life against my will, and continued it all through against my will - it might be going on a fortnight from the time it was first proposed - I was then out of employ; I had been with Mr. Busby, a barrister - before that, I was with a Mr. Martin, a silversmith, of Falcon-court, Fleet-street - that was seven years ago; I was in his employ I think about a year and a half, and should think a year and a half elapsed from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110118"/>that time till I went to Mr. Busby - I left that situation in consequence of having ruptured myself by carrying more than I was able; and at the end of a year and a half I went to Mr. Busby - I left Mr. Busby for a short time, then I went to live with Mr. Spearman, No. 11, Paper-buildings; I was only a month with him; Mr. Busby's was the first situation I took after leaving Martin; I left Mr. Busby, and went to live with Spearman, and Mr. Busby took me back again; I swear I was in no person's employ from the time I left Martin till I went to Mr. Busby - I only went to live with Mr. Spearman while his servant was absent through illness.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you leave Mr. Busby? A.Conway had done something wrong at Mr. Bale's chambers; and as he came to see me, I believe, Mr. Busby discharged me; he charged me with nothing up to the time I went to live with Mr. Spearman; it was not for any thing I had done that he discharged me - he did make a charge against me about three months ago; it was for fees I had put to my own use - Mr. Busby, I believe, saw I had no intention of robbing him, as I expected some money by which I could have made the fees up - he knew it was in my power, and had he not discovered it before, it would have been made up - he did not make an accusation of robbery - he charged me with taking nine or ten guineas - I had no salary but the clerk's fees - it was not more than ten guineas that I kept - he did not accuse me of doing this for any length of time for he knew what I should receive - I was absent from the office when he discovered it - I did not fall out with Mr. Spearman - he found no fault with me - he is a barrister or conveyancer, I do not know which - I was only his servant, and never received fees for him - I lived with Mr. Busby, altogether five years and a half - I gave no information about the prisoners till I was in custody - I was sorry for the offence I had committed, when I was in custody - I gave information because the other prisoners, I believe, had offered to give information themselves - I gave information, because I believed they meant to do so, if I did not - that was my reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was to save yourself, and from no motive of honesty? A. I thought it my duty to do so from the persuasion of my parents - I submitted to their persuasion; it was not altogether to save myself - I do not know whether I shall escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not a hope that you will be saved, if they are convicted? A.From what my parents say I believe I shall - I made the statement by their persuasion - it was not from the pure motive of getting off myself - I do not hope to get off if they are convicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then if that is the case, your disclosure has been voluntary all along, and you come here for the purpose of justice? A. I have acceded to the persuasion of my parents; it is not with the hope of getting off myself that I gave the evidence I have - it is not for the hope of escaping - I do not see that I have been guilty of many more offences -Mr. Busby's ten guineas is one; there are no others, I swear - I know Mr. Hinrich's house; he had no lodger when I first went there - he had one the last time I went there.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you happen to know whether that lodger had a box? A.Conway took me up one night into a room to show me a box; when it was opened by Conway there was some china and glass in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were never guilty of any thing but Mr. Busby's ten guineas? A. I said I had not been guilty of many more; Conway took two pieces of glass out of the box, the rest did not remain there certainly; some of the things were in my possession - Conway gave them to me- and I took them to the pawnbroker's - I left the tickets with the keeper of the coffee-shop - I believe that is all the offences I have committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you include highway-robbery and burglary? A. I believe they have all been enumerated - I know Goodyear, of Holywell-street, Strand - I used to inhabit his house - I was never accused of what happened there- he may have been the owner of beads, and so have I.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the beads he owned the same as you became the owner of? A. They were - he did not give them to me - I never before committed a similar offence to that the prisoners are charged with - I cannot say in what month I became acquainted with Martelly; it was certainly this year; I should think about February - my intimacy with Conway had been renewed about a fortnight or three weeks before that - I was not guilty of any offence like this during that time, nor did I know of any - I redeemed Hinrich's lodger's things - I do not know that that was the reason I was not prosecuted - I pawned the glass, took it out, and it was pledged again; I was not threatened by any one with a prosecution about them - I never had any thing to do with them, except through Conway; I had no intimation that any prosecution was going to take place. Martelly had been in custody a month or five weeks when I made this disclosure; I only knew it by seeing it in the newspapers -I do not know whose hand-writing the cheque is, for I did not see it written; I know Martelly's hand-writing; I did not look at them so minutely, as to say whether they were his writing (looking at one): I cannot say whether it is his or not; I do not believe it is; I thought they all appeared in the same hand-writing, from what I saw of them - I have seen a piece of paper with Mr. Horne's name written several times on it - I do not know where it is; it was never in my possession - I had seen that paper before I knew Martelly. but only once - I was apprehended rather more than five weeks ago - I then lived in Newcastle-court with my cousin, not with Smith - I believe the premises were searched after I was taken - I saw in Mr. Gates' hands a pocket-book, which I believe was found there - I left it there - there was no practising of Mr. Horne's writing there - none could be found, for I never had any, and never did practise the writing; I left none at Mr. Busby's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send to the prosecutor's, or they come to you, on this information being given? A. I gave the information at Bow-street before I was sent to gaol: but I made out a written statement in Newgate - I had been asked to do it before by my sister, at Bow-street, but declined - I was never directly asked by any body else to do it, nor told there was already enough to convict me, and I might as well do it to save myself, or that every thing was known - I heard somebody else had made a statement - I sent a letter to Salmon, the officer, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110119"/>May, before I was in custody, or charged with any thing; I had seen nothing in the newspapers about it except the account of Martelly being in custody - it did not say I was charged as being concerned.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you did not know you yourself was charged with it? A. I knew Salmon was seeking for me - I heard so, but in what way I really do not know; I wrote the letter before I was in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then you were apprehended in consequence of a disclosure? A. Yes, and nothing else - Conway was then in custody; I have stated all the charges which were made against me up to the time this business happened - I was never charged with embezzlement by any body but Mr. Busby; I left Mr. Martin on account of rupturing myself; I did not leave without his knowledge - I gave him regular notice; that is more than six years ago - I know a Mr. Hamlet; I never saw any of his writing - I have seen Conway write; I have seen an imitation of it, but never imitated it myself.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You wrote to Salmon - was there an accusation against you about something which happened after the business of Drummond's? A. I did not know it - I heard Salmon was after me about a forgery, and I wrote to him; I believe I was wanted about Mr. Hamletts and Mr. Horne's business - Mr. Hamletts happened after this; Conway shewed me an imitation of Mr. Hamletts hand-writing soon after the forgery on Drummond's was committed - it was before Martelly was in custody; I never practised an imitation of Mr. Horne's signature - Conway produced a paper to me with Mr. Horne's name on it, at Mr. Hinrich's - it was not before I was acquainted with Martelly; but he was not present when it was shewn me - Mr. Busby never charged me with embezzlement before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by joining in this transaction against your will? A. It was against my will that I accepted the money - Martelly seemed unwilling that I should have a share, as he said I had done nothing in it, - that I ought to have presented the cheque, and ought to have none of the money; Conway wished me to accept of it, for fear that I should report it to somebody if I had none - I had left Mr. Busby at the time the cheque was offered at Drummond's.</p>

             Drummond is the principal partner; there are others. Benjamin Worthy Horne, of the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, is a customer of ours - he is a coach-proprietor, and is in in the habit of drawing cheques on us. On the 4th of April this cheque was produced at our counter, and paid by me with four 10l. notes; my information is obtained from my books - I have an extract from them; the book is in my own hand-writing - I have looked at the original book this morning to refresh my memory; I made the extract last Friday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any body examine the extract with you, or did you do it yourself? A. I did it myself - I made the original entry myself; this cheque(looking at it) has been paid - it has my writing on the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a distinct recollection of having paid the cheque, independent of the books? A. I have; I paid it, because my mark is on it, by which I cancelled it at the time of payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Having refreshed your memory this morning, by looking at your books, how was it paid? A. with four 10l. notes, and 60l. in gold; I cannot say whether it was sovereigns, or half-sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Is it the habit of your house to give blank cheque books to any stranger who may come in the name of a customer? A. Yes, it is done so; I am not aware of the circumstance, but we do not always know the servants who come from their masters - we should give cheques to strangers if they asked for them in a customer's name.</p>

The prisoner, Martelly, was in my employ - I knew him by the name of Edward Gage; he came into my employ in October, 1826, as town traveller - in June 1827 I proposed to add him to several country travellers; it was necessary he should produce me security for 200l. - he produced to me this paper, purporting to be a security; he continued in my employ till the following August - his last letter was dated August, 1827: I did not dismiss him - I heard no more of him after he was at Leeds in August, and saw nothing of him from that time to this; part of his duty was to collect money for me, and for that reason the security was given.(The cheque was here read.)</p>

               <p>CONWAY'S Defence. I am quite innocent of the charge imputed against me.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Martelly a good character.</p>

I did not know the prisoners before this - my salesman came out of the shop in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I had sold them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110121"/>which was at half-past seven o'clock, and told me he had lost a sheep; he described a young man who he had given it to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was it worth? A. Twenty-five shillings; I never said it would not sell for 1l.; Collins had not paid for it - there are a great many carts about at that time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURLEY. I am servant to Mr. Lee. The three carcases were sold to Mr. Collins; the prisoner Sansom came and asked Mr. Collins' man, (Matthews,) what he had to weigh - he said three sheep; he asked who they were for: I showed him the three sheep - Sansom said he would lend him a hand to weigh them; I did not know him before: after they were weighed Matthews took one on his shoulder, and Sansom gave him another on his shoulder, to carry down to the cart; he said, "You had better leave the other one till you return, you cannot carry the three;" Matthews went out of the shop with the two sheep - Sansom followed directly after, and then Warde came in and said, "I am come for a sheep, which Mr. Collins' man has left:" I did not know him before; I gave him the sheep, and directly after Matthews came for it himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose two are as many as a man can conveniently carry? A. It depends on the size; Sansom was not there when Warde came in - he went out directly after Matthews; I have seen them about the market before, but not to know them - it was a busy morning: the cart was about two hundred yards off - I saw Warde in custody in a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MATTHEWS. I am servant to Mr. Collins. I went to fetch the three sheep from Lee's; I saw Sansom there - he was a stranger: he put one sheep on the scale - I carried away two of the carcases, which he helped on my back, and when I came back he was gone, and the third sheep also; I was not gone five minutes - I know nothing of the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not usual for one man to assist another? A. If asked, not without; I did not see Sansom speak to any body - he was alone for any thing I know.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You can tell a Merino sheep when skinned, from any other breed, I suppose? A.

            . I know that Page paid Shelston 24s. for the sheep: I am a butcher - I saw it in the shop; it was a slight sheep, of the Merino breed - a good many Merino sheep are sold in London.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COLLINS. I know nothing of Warde. I never authorized him to fetch my sheep - I know nothing of any of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>WARDE'S Defence. I know nothing about it. I left home at seven o'clock, and was in company with a person who cannot attend here now.</p>
               <p>SANSOM'S Defence. I had been to work for a master butcher, who had bought a rump and loin of beef at the prosecutor's, about half-past seven o'clock that morning; I always work for him - he came to look for me, said he was in a hurry, and told me to go with him, and see the meat weighed; he took me to Lee's, and said, "Who do you follow?" meaning when was it my turn to weigh; Collins' man said, him; and when his meat was weighed, I put mine into the scale, helped his sheep on his shoulder, hung the third one up, and took my beef away: when I got to the corner of the Old Bailey, where the carts stood, I saw Warde and another man, and asked him to let down the tail-board of my cart, which he did -I returned to Lee's for my hat: it wanted five minutes to eight o'clock; I went to see Hibner executed - when that was over, Warde wished his friend good morning: I went down Warwick-lane with him, when Hopkins came up to us. I know nothing whatever of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning in question I saw three men run round the corner of Circus-place, pursued by the call of Stop thief! I and another officer, ran and took the three prisoners with two loaves and a half - they had each a loaf divided in two, and were eating them very voraciously; I asked why they took so many loaves; they said they were very hungry - they made a deal of resistance; we found nothing on them but a small bag and a spoon.</p>

On the 9th of June, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoners taking coals out of the Joseph barge, which laid on the shore - they reached them out of the barge, and put them into a bag on the side; neither of them were in the barge; they must have pushed one another up to have reached them - there was about a bushel and a half in the two sacks: I have seen them there frequently before - the coals could not have tumbled overboard, for they had not been in the mud, and there was a vacancy in the barge where they were taken; I had seen the coals safe the night before - I saw them both take coals out of the barge; I saw Spencer taking them out of the barge - he reached them by standing on his toes; there were five in all - Spencer was the biggest; I apprehended them directly; I have warned them at least fifty times.</p>

On the 21st of April, about eleven o'clock in the day, I was standing in the shop and heard a window break - I looked round, and it might be half a minute before I put my eyes on the pane which was broken; the prisoner then had her hand through the pane, helping herself to watches; I hallooed to her - she immediately left the quantity she had collected, and walked away with two in her hand; I opened the door, went out after her, and took her with the two watches in her hand - I am certain the window was safe before she broke it; it is my dwelling-house - the watches are worth ten guineas; here they are - I know them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He tells me he gave you a 5l. note and a sovereign, and you gave him 2s. change? A. He did not I am certain; he gave me no money, the bill of parcels was for 6lbs. of sugar - he said that was to be delivered in West-street, the others, being small parcels, I had no bills for them; I went to Green's before I went back to master, then went home directly, and told master; I had a stamped receipt in my pocket, which I brought home.</p>

On one Saturday in April he shewed me a ring with seven stones in it, which he desired me to clean; he asked me the value of it - I said, as near as I could guess it was worth 7l.; he seemed to agree with me - I took it home and cleaned it, and took it back on the Monday; it was very dirty - he did not say how he came by it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known him? A. Seven or eight years; I do not know a more respectable man - I considered he was in doubt as to whether it was of value, or not; I do not think he is a judge of such things; it was in a very dirty state - I do not think any one, who was not conversant with diamonds, would have known them to be diamonds; they would have passed for paste with many shopkeepers - he has not much to do with such things; he is a clockmaker.</p>
               <p>KITTY HURST. I live with Mr. Hind, in Torrington-square - Mr. Terrade was lodging in the house. I went to clean his room, and saw a ring with seven clear white stones in it, lying on a table; I took it, put it into my bosom, and went away with it - in the afternoon I was sent out on an errand, and at the corner of the square I met a girl called Kitty Barrett; she asked if I had any thing for her - I gave her the ring; she went up Store-street with me - she told me to go to a shop, and ask 4s. for it; I went to a shop, and saw Mr. Stiles - he looked at it a few minutes, and asked what I wanted for it; I said 4s. - he said it was not gold, and he would make it 3s. 6d. for me; I left the ring, and came away with the money - he did not ask my name, nor where I lived, nor how I came by it; I think it was on a Tuesday or a Thursday - I went before the Magistrate as a witness on Easter Monday; I think it might be a week before that, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You stole this ring, did you not? A. Yes - I knew it was not right; upon my solemn oath the man did not ask me where I lived - I did not hear him ask that question; there was a little boy in the shop - I had not dropped the ring in the mud; there was no mud on it, nor streaks of mud - I did not offer it to a cheesemonger, who refused to buy it, nor to this gentleman, Mr. Franks; I never saw him before in my life - Mr. Stiles did not ask me where I lived; I did not tell him that I lived at Mr. Stevenson's, a linendraper, at the corner of Bowyer's-court, in Oxford-street, nor that I lived at any linen-draper's - mistress missed the ring, and asked me to tell her God's truth, and I told her; I never went to sell any thing before in my life - I lived at Mr. Ayers', No. 165, Regent-street; I left them because they were going to let the house as ready furnished lodgings - I did not state at the office that I was turned away from Mr. Ayers for having committed a robbery; that same girl wanted me to take a prayer-book from there, but I would not - that girl is not here, she was let off at Marlborough-street; I never was in any place of confinement till I was brought here - I did not mention before the Magistrate that there were seven stones in the ring; the reason I mentioned seven stones to-day was because there are seven - I counted them.</p>

            . I am keeper of Torrington-square. On Sunday morning, the 22d or 23d, I was sent for to Mr. Hind's; there was some conversation about Hurst and a ring - she was turned out for stealing 15s. from the cook; I took her to Mr. Stiles on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock - she said he was the person who bought the ring, and pointed to the boy and said he was present; I asked the prisoner if he knew the girl - he stood for a moment, and said Yes; I then asked if he recollected buying a ring - he said Yes; he went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110125"/>the window and got it; it was exposed for sale - any one might have seen it; it had seven diamonds in it - I asked what he gave for it - he said 3s. 6d., and said to the girl,"Did I not ask where you lived, and you said you lived at Mr. Stevenson's?" she said he did not ask any such question; he said it was all dirt, and she said she found it - that induced him to think she had found it; he said she told him she lived at Mr. Stevenson's, and he had sent to inquire there, but found no such person lived there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.All this took place in a very few minutes? A. Yes, not five minutes - I remember your taking the ring in your hand at the office, and you asked a person, who is not here now, how many stones there were in it, and he said five; the prisoner was there at the time - it did turn out that the ring had seven stones in it; I took the prisoner's word for his appearance he - came voluntarily to the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mr. de Terrade claim the ring at any time? A. Yes; he lives at that house in Torrington-square - his name is

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the girl came to me the ring was all over mud; I have no knowledge of diamonds, and I thought it was only paste - she said she found it a little higher up; I thought it was not gold; she said she lived at the bottom of Bowyer's-court - I said, "I hope you have not taken it from any where;" she said, "If I did such things as that, how could I keep my places?" I said,"Where do you live?" she said, "At the bottom, at the draper's;" and then I incautiously purchased it; I am always active in stopping any thing I have suspicion of, and bringing people forward - one case particularly which Lord Winford knew of.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoners at the watch-house, and found this yellow handkerchief in Johnson's hat; I searched, and found nothing else - I then ordered him to pull off his boots, and found one handkerchief in each of his boots; I found Mr. Joyce's handkerchief in Austin's trousers - it had this shop ticket on it; this waistcoat, which they said belonged to Austin, was put on the table at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. I passed the shop door, and looked at some of the things; when I got about six doors further, the man took me.</p>
               <p>AUSTIN'S Defence. I saw this at the door, picked it up, and the man came after us.</p>

Vigo dropped a bag from under his coat; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110127"/>had known Holland before; he had lived in the empty house which they had been in; Holland put down a white wash-hand bason near the kennel; I ran and took up the bag, and gave it to my mother - there was some pipe in it, and about seven brass cocks; the prisoners got away then, but they were taken the same day; I am quite certain they were the persons.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first time I saw him it was about eleven o'clock in the day; we went into a public-house, and had a slice of bread and cheese; he said, "You look very bad;" I said, "I am out of work;" he said,"So am I, come along with me:" we went begging together, and drank all we got on the road - I should not have gone that road but for him; he pretended to be blind, and a cripple, and got money where I could not.</p>

No; I never drank with them- I did not drink tea there; there were two brokers in the house, West and Evans, who I believe had sold her a bedstead - I do not recollect Mary Ann Bird saying if she were ruled by the officer, she would send you out of the country for life.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my misfortune to be se<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110129"/>duced at an early age, by a gentleman, by whom I became pregnant; the offspring of my indiscretion did not survive its birth, but I was left before that event to earn a subsistence as I could; I did apply to my parents for forgiveness, but without success: at length I obtained some employ in the hat business, but unfortunately continued an acquaintance with the prosecutrix, which I had commenced before, and on the Sunday evening, from which I date my present misfortune, I called on her - she invited me to take a walk with her; she lent me some articles of body linen, as security for which I left some of my own with her: a quarrel afterwards took place between the prosecutrix and a lodger; the prosecutrix was conveyed to the watch-house, to release her from there - I lent her 5s. to give the watchman: on the following day she said she was distressed for a sovereign to pay her rent, and asked my assistance - I said I had a sister in service, but my dress was not suitable for me to call on her, and the prosecutrix lent me her bonnet, cloak, and veil to go to her; on my way I met the gentleman who first drew me aside from the path of rectitude - every other idea was then forgotten, and I spent a week or two with him, previous to his going to Liverpool, to which place I certainly should have accompanied him, but for these very articles; having disappointed the prosecutrix, I was ashamed to carry the things home myself - I met her lodger, and asked her to take them, but she refused; I then came to this Court, to see the officer, who I was aware knew her, to offer him the articles, to deliver to the prosecutrix, when I was taken into custody for an offence of which I solemnly protest my innocence. Since I have been in prison I have heard the heart-reading intelligence of the death of my mother; let all these circumstances be considered, and let my youth and the miseries I have experienced in my short career, plead in my behalf, and I trust you will not consign me to further disgrace on the accusation of one more experienced in crime than myself.</p>

            . I am a labourer - I live in Meard'scourt; the prosecutor lives at No. 1 Kemp's-court. On Monday the 25th of May, I saw two young men with this cart, in Berwick-street - I cannot say whether the prisoner was one - I went to Kemp's-court, saw Mrs. Smith standing at the door, and she asked me if I thought David had lent his chaise to any body - I went into the brewhouse, and saw the prosecutor's brother, John, who told me it was not lent; and I then went in pursuit of it - I did not come up with it till I got to Panton-street, Haymarket, Where I saw the prisoner drawing it; two other persons were behind him - I asked what he was going to do with it; he said he was a spring-maker, and he was going to repair one of the springs - I saw it had no springs - I told him if he came by it honestly, he would have no objection to go to the person it belonged to - he turned, and drew it as far as Rupert-street; the other two walked behind; one of them called out,"Bob, what a fool you are to draw it;" he made no answer, but walked on till he got to the corner of Archer-street. when he dropped the handle and ran off - I cried, Stop thief! a person got in the middle of the road, he turned back towards me, and I collared him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Look at me, and say whether I was one of the persons you first saw with it? A. I did not take notice - you did not ask a young man if he did not give it you - there were three of you; one had an iron footman in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a person you had a communication with yesterday, and you said you were very sorry you had any thing to do with this business? A.

            .

I was turning Coventry-street, and saw two young men drawing the cart - I knew one of them, and told them where I had been; we walked down the Haymarket, and one of them who had a white handkerchief and a snuff-coloured coat, asked me to take hold of the cart, while he gave his parcels to the other men- I had not had it two minutes when Mr. James came up - I turned back, and asked the young man whether he did not give it me - I might have run away; but knowing I received it innocently, I scorned to run till I saw the other two running, and then I did run a little way.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you swear you were not tipsy? A. I was not; I had been out two nights looking after my master's barges, and met her in Tothill-street - she was the only woman who caught hold of me; I had been talking with another woman, but not stopping with any other; the other woman asked me if I was going to give her any thing to drink - she walked about the street with me, but I took up with this woman; I suppose I should have gone to sleep by myself if this woman had not caught hold of me - it was Duck-lane we went to; I cannot say what number; the officer told me the name - I did not tell the Magistrate I was intoxicated - I said I had been working two days, and up two nights, and I had had a glass or two; the last publichouse I was in was the Crown; it is in Westminster - we had a quartern of gin and a pint of beer between another man and myself - I left there before ten o'clock; that was all I drank besides the glass of gin the prisoner gave me - I had been on board the Fame, where I am employed; I left about nine o'clock - I had been in a public-house in the morning; we had a pot of beer there between three or four of us; I drank no gin or spirits<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110131"/>there - I had no dinner, and drank nothing in the night but some coffee; the prisoner was taken the next day -I lost a watch, two 5l. notes of the Devizes bank, seven sovereigns, a guinea, and a half-guinea, besides some silver; I cannot say how long I was with her - I sat down and fell asleep: while I was asleep she robbed me; when I awoke the door was open, and she was gone -I cannot say what she was to get; one half-crown would not have got much; I only went to get something to drink - I awoke that night between eleven and twelve o'clock, but I did not see any watchman; I staid there till morning, then made an alarm, and sent for an officer; there was no one that I could see in the house - as soon as made the alarm they threatened to kick me out of the house.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ALLEN. I am a Bow-street patrol. I saw the prosecutor on the afternoon of the 25th of April, in Orchard-street, Westminster; he stated what had happened - I went to No. 8, Almonry; he said he had lost two 5l. notes, seven sovereigns, one guinea, a half-guinea and his watch; he said the half-guinea was under weight, and rather bent; I found the prisoner at the house - he had described her; I said I wanted her for robbing a countryman of his money - she said she knew nothing about it; I took her, and as we went along I thought she wanted to put her hand in her pocket - I took hold of her hand, and found on her two sovereigns, this bent half-guinea, 11s. 6d. in silver, some copper, a handkerchief, and a pair of stockings, which were new; they were under her arm - I had before asked what money she had got, and she said only a few halfpence; when I found this money she said a gentleman gave it her the night before - she afterwards said she had saved it, as she wanted to go into the country to see her friends.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are not these old coins very often under weight? A. I do not know; it was between five and six o'clock in the evening when I took her - I think it was half-past four when I saw the prosecutor; I do not know whether I was the first person he went to.</p>
               <p>HENRY SELWOOD re-examined. Q.Who did you go to? A. I went to an officer's house between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, but he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What time did you leave the house? A. I suppose between six and seven o'clock - I did not see any watchmen about; I called the people at the next door, and they talked of kicking me out of the place - I had only been in London two days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got the money from a gentleman I formerly resided with - he gave it me to redeem my clothes; the prosecutor and another female parted with me, and went home together - he never mentioned any mark on the half-guinea till it was shown at the office.</p>

               <p>Prisoner BARRY. Q. Where did you see me first? A. There were three of you sitting on a stool near Argyle-street.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN MURRAY. I was with Roberts, and saw the prisoners in Oxford-street; I knew Barry, and watched them - I saw Keys take the handkerchief, and give it to Barry; I took Barry, but he got away - I took him again, and he got away again; I pursued him to Cavendish-square, and secured him - he threw the handkerchief over some rails; the gentleman came and said it was his, and that he lived in Pitt-street - they both acknowledged in the office that one took it, and the other received it; I am a fancy steel-worker - I do not make a practice of taking people in the street, but if I see a felony committed I take the persons; I was a constable twelve months ago, and have been with Roberts before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with any thing in my hand? A. Yes, when you ran down the street; I cannot say what it was - I did not see him again till the 9th of May, when he came down the street with two others, and pointed up to my front; he went into the same house -I saw him again on the Monday; he was alone - I went and took him - I said I wanted him for a felony; I got him to my door - he knocked me down, cut my eye, and got away; I heard he was in the neighbourhood, and went to Worship-street - Garton sent three officers to take him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SIMMONDS. I am a dyer.

I went to the Two Brewers public-house, in Spital-street; I saw the prisoner in a yard adjoining the skittle-ground - he said he would go with me, but not with any parish officer; if the property had been taken it could not be found, as there is a common sewer runs through the privy, which would carry them away.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Holywell-street, Shoreditch. Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 4th of June, I was in Shoreditch, and saw three people together; I do not know who they were, but they went to Mrs. Wilkinson's shop, and took a bag of coffee - they went with it to a chandler's shop at the hack of Shoreditch-church; I went and told Mrs. Wilkinson's people of it - they went to Worship-street; the last witness is her foreman - the officer found the coffee on the stairs.</p>
               <p>JAMES OSMOND PHILPOT. I belong to Bow-street. On the night of the 4th of June, I went near the Loggerheads public-house, and saw the prisoner come from his own house, which is near there; I went after him, down a passage, took him by the arm, and said I wanted him - I took him to his own house, and asked if he was the owner of it; he said, Yes - I said I had suspicion there was some stolen property concealed there; he said he knew nothing about any - I went with him into the back room, and shut the door; I searched, and in about a quarter of an hour, I found the bag of coffee about half way up the stairs - I believe Best was at the door, or in the shop; it is a chandler's shop, at the back of Shoreditch-church - I took the coffee to Worship-street, where the foreman owned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner is married? A. I do not know; I saw a person I understood was his wife - I believe my expression to the prisoner was "Stolen goods," but I allnded to the coffee; he said he had no stolen goods that he knew of in the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEST re-examined Q. Did you say you saw some persons take some coffee from Mrs. Wilkinson's to a shop at the back of Shoreditch-church? A. Yes - it was about half-past eight o'clock, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner at that time? A. No, Sir, I cannot positively say I did; there was some one in the shop - there was a woman there, but no man except the one that took the coffee; Mr. Wilkinson's two shopmen were in the shop; I did not observe any other persons - I was before the Magistrate on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q.And now you state you did not observe any body else? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the Magistrate - the same as you have now? A. Yes, Sir, to the best of my recollection; I saw a woman in the prisoner's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. No man? A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect whether there was or not? A. I believe not, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you do not recollect seeing any man but the shopmen and the thieves in Mrs. Wilkinson's shop. and no men but the thieves in the prisoner's shop? A. No.</p>
               <p>RICHARD FICKRIDGE. I am a Bow-street patrol. I went with Philpot to a house that I have understood since is Mr. Cauch's, in Virginia-row - the prisoner was there, without his coat, and his shirt sleeves tucked up; I asked him for half a pint of small beer, which I paid him for, and he said it was right; I turned to speak to my conductor, and the prisoner rushed by me, and ran up a passage - I ran and caught him by the right arm, and said, "This won't do;" I handed him to Philpot. and I stood there while my conductor and Philpot went to search the house; in twenty minutes I was called into the house, and there was this bag of coffee and a roll of cloth; I took the coffee, and Philpot took the cloth - the prisoner was gone then; he went out while I stood in the passage - the next morning I took him at the toll-bar near Shoreditch church.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you look into the shop? A. Yes, when I had information from Best; I saw the coffee in a bag that night, but not in the same bag it had been in; I believe it was Philpot showed it me- I did not go up stairs; it was brought down: this is the bag the coffee was in, not this bag; this is Mrs. Wilkinson's bag.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I took this coat from the prisoner at a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, on the 30th of May; he was running from the carriage, and about three yards from it - I did not see him take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where did you first see me? A. At the corner of Russell-street, with four or five others - I saw a man get on the wheel, take it, and give it to you; this is the coat - I called to stop the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home - there were seven or eight persons behind a carriage, and in a moment this coat was thrown upon my shoulder; the gentleman took me, and ran after another person, leaving me with the officer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect any conversation between you and I? A. Yes; you came and asked me to have a glass of gin - you did not ask if I had lost my bell - I said I had lost it; you asked me what the value of it was, and I said 6s. or 7s.; you did not state that you lived in that square, not ask when I should be there again - I left you in the wine-vaults; my fellow-servants took the cart away.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CONSTABLE. I took the prisoner and the bell; he told me it was merely a joke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out and saw the bell at the door; when I came in I took it up stairs, merely as a joke - I put it on a stool, and went down to the yard till my landlord and landlady came in: she said you have been at some of your larks - I said "I will wash myself, you look out at the window, and see that the man don't go without the bell;" I said I would put a night-cap on it, and put this paper over it - I then went down and said to the prosecutor, "Have you lost any thing?" he said, "Yes, a bell of my master's, and I must make it good - it will cost 5s. or 6s.;" I said "I live at No. 13, when shall you be here again?" he said in a day or two - I said, "Don't be surprised if you find your bell again before night; will you have a drop of gin?" he said, "Yes, and thank you too;" he said no more about the bell, but went away - I went home and said, "I don't like this bell, it begins to be troublesome to me - I know where he shoots his carts, and I will go with it;" I followed him to White Lion-street, where I saw him with five or six more dustmen; one of them said, "He has got a bell;" I said Yes, and I untied it and gave it him - one of them said, "Why don't you give him in charge?"</p>
               <p>RICHARD PAPWORTH. The prisoner lodges with me in Gun-square; he came in with the bell under his arm, and said he was going to have a bit of fun with it - I wanted him to give it the man; he said, "Stop a bit, I will give it him presently;" he went down to the witness, but did not give it him then - he then took it from my house to give it him, I believe; he asked me to go with him.</p>
               <p>MRS. PAPWORTH. I heard the prisoner say he was going to play a lark - I said, "Where the goodness did you get that bell? go and give it the man;" he said, "I mean to give it him;" he went - the prosecutor and he had' some gin. <rs id="t18290611-307-verdict1621" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect the prisoner? A. He had asked me for work some time before; he had not contracted with me about these timbers.</p>
               <p>MARGARET HOWARD. I live opposite the prosecutor's premises. On the morning of the 6th of June, I saw the prisoner get over a partition, put over three boards, and then put them on his shoulder; in a few minutes he came, and took three more boards - he was taken on the 10th of June.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the prosecutor for work- he said he could not employ me till that day week, as he had no materials ready; I went to a public-house, where Mr. Brown was, and begged him to be sent for - he came from the parlour, and said he was going to put most of his work out of doors, as he believed he had a parcel of thieves about him; he was a little elevated, and I left him - I came down to the place that morning, and saw the materials; I said to myself, "I will get about these doors," which he said he would let out to me - I took these boards, which are the regular thickness, for common pannel-doors, and I said "I will make them on my own bench, and let him allow me what he likes;" there were two officers, whom I knew, in the street, and I should have been mad to take them if I intended to steal them.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. I did not employ him to do any work; he said he was going to make some doors - I said it was not proper stuff for doors - I do not recollect seeing him at any public-house, but I might at the Black Boy publichouse, where I usually breakfast and dine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

I was on duty near the palace on the day of the drawing-room, the 30th of April - I saw the two prisoners and another person in the crowd; they went close to a gentleman, and Howard put his hand into his pocket - they went on, and Howard put his hand in again, took out a handkerchief, and gave it to Mason, who I thought put it into his trousers, but it was under his jacket - I followed them, and pushed them into an open place; I touched the gentleman, and said, "You have lost your handkerchief;" he said No - I said, "Feel, sir;" he then said he had, and owned this as his: I begged him to come with me, but he said he would not have any trouble with it - I begged him to give me his card, but unfortunately it has no address on it, only the name; I took the prisoners, and the gentleman appeared to follow me - I lost him; the prisoners were remanded twice, but I could not find him.</p>

The prisoner came on board - he said he was distressed, and asked me to let him say on board a few days, as his master owed him some money, and when it was paid he would go; he staid one week, and went on shore on the Monday; I missed four spoons - they had been in the caddy; he had the key of it; I came on shore the next day, and saw him in Shadwell; I told him I had lost some silver spoons - he said he knew nothing about it; a friend said he had some money in his possession; I asked where he got it - he said he had taken his money of his master; I sent my friend to know if it was true, and he gave him in charge; the spoons are lost, but I have seen the top of the mustard-pot - it is the property of Alexander Hanning.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. He had the top of the mustard-pot himself; it was in the basket of dust. Witness. Yes; it was in the dust, and I put it on the dresser, and you asked what it was.</p>
               <p>JACOB DE SOUZA. I went with the prisoner to the City, as he said his master had given him a sovereign, and he lived in some square, but I forget the name; I asked if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110135"/>would go there - he said he did not know the number of the house; I then sent for a constable, and took him up.</p>

The plate was all safe in the footman's pantry at three o'clock - I heard the cook scream out, came down stairs, and saw the prisoner running by the iron railing; I ran after him, and took him about one hundred and fifty yards from the house; the plate was lying on the mat; I found the cupboard and the pantrydoors open; here is the plate; here are eight spoons, worth 4l.; two ladles, worth 18s.; three forks, worth 28, and one pair of sugar tongs, worth 5s., that is the market price - it is worth more than that; I have had it weighed since, and swear it is worth 6l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him till he was running? A. No; the cook pointed him out - I did not see his face.</p>

On Friday, the 15th of May, I saw him standing against a public-house, directly opposite the manufactory; the men were leaving their work to breakfast - I was observing them going out, and heard the prisoner speaking to them; he used the most shocking language, which I cannot repeat - it was addressed to one of my men: I could not at first believe it was the prisoner using such language. On Saturday night, the 16th of May, at half-past eight o'clock, I saw the manufactory locked up, and left it perfectly safe; there had been neither light nor fire on the building, for at least a fortnight previous - our premises were not insured; they were of considerable extent and value - my father was with me when I left the manufactory, on the evening of the 16th; we left nobody behind there; it was locked secure - they were ordinary locks; round the lower tier of the manufactory the windows are cast-iron; some of them in the centre were left open - they were on the ground floor. I was one of the first persons on the spot when the fire was discovered; an alarm of fire was given to me on the Sunday, a minute or two before two o'clock in the afternoon - I went immediately to the spot; when I arrived there, there was an immense volume of smoke arising from the union of the two buildings - there was a higher building, and a lower one; I did not peroeive any flame, but it broke out directly; the building was on fire in two spots - there was, I suppose, a space of thirty to forty feet between the two places where the fire was; the first fire I observed was in the large building, which I call the manufactory - we have stables; there is a carpenter's shop adjoining those stables: the second fire was at the carpenter's shop, which is not under the same roof as the manufactory - there is an interval of thirty or forty feet; they are under separate roofs - there was no combustible materials kept near the manufactory; there was tow - all our articles some people consider combustible; we had a very forocious dog on the premises - we have had him about three years; we had him during the time the prisoner was in our employment, and he was familiar with the prisoner: I am sure of that, for I have seen him feed the dog and caress him - if any strangers came on the premises the dog was very fierce, and barked at them. After the examination at the Police office I searched by the palings, and found there a number of common brimstone matches, on a spot which was pointed out to me by Fletcher, one of my workmen; the matches were close under the fence: they were lying on the ground there, with a little of the mould over them- there was part of the paling broken down at that place; it was thrown down before I found the matches - the mob had thrown it down, and some of the palings were over the matches also: I know

            . I am not in partnership with the prosecutors; I am employed in the counting-house, and have been so ever since the manufactory was built, which is about four years. I was there for about half an hour, about nine o'clock, on the morning of the fire; I went about half way down the length of the manufactory, in the manufactory; I passed two doors, they were both locked, I opened them - the premises were quite safe then; I neither saw nor heard any thing to induce me to think any body had been there; I believe I was near the part where the fire broke out - I left at half-past nine o'clock precisely; I perceived not the least smell or indication of fire - there had not been a fire or a candle on the premises for, I should think, three weeks or a fortnight before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>HENRY WILLIAM RUSSELL. I live at No. 1, Mermaidcourt, Turk's-row, with my father - I am twelve years old. I know where Mr. Downing's manufactory stood; I remember the day it was burnt down, it was Sunday - I went out that day to take a walk; I was out about half-past one o'clock in the King's-road - the palings of Mr. Downing's manufactury run along that road; I was near the palings, and observed a person inside the palings - I know who that person was - that is him (pointing to the prisoner) -I did not know him before; I observed his dress - he had a blue coat and blue trousers, and had shoes on, and his stockings were white; I saw him inside the palings - he ran from the back part of the manufactory; I am sure he was running, he was running fast - he ran towards the stable,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110137"/>which was also inside the palings; I cannot say how near it was to the manufactory - he halted at the stable, and I ran on towards Smith-street; the prisoner was then standing; I turned round to look at a coach coming along, and saw him getting over the palings - he ran out and turned down Blackland's-lane; he was running very fast, and as he ran he hit himself against a post opposite.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that done with violence or gently? A. Gently; I remember seeing the fire, it was about ten minutes before I saw the fire that I saw the prisoner getting over the palings; I had an opportunity as he got over the palings of seeing his face, and observed it; I gave a description of his person before - the prisoner was at the Police-office; I told my mother that afternoon what I had seen - I pointed the prisoner out myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where were you when you pointed him out? A. At Queen-square; he stop at the bar - I knew he was there for setting the premises on fire; it is a close wooden paling round the manufactory - I saw him through a crevice in the boards; he was running from the manufactory towards the stable - his face was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the stable stand between the manufactory and the place you were looking through, or on the other side? A. The stable stood on the other side - he stood fronting me, and was looking at me.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not see you through the crevice, not being close to you? A. The place I was looking through is as wide as this (about two inches), and I had my hand through the hole; he was halting when he was looking at me - he stood halting there and looking at me; it was about half-past one o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the King's-road much frequented by company about that time, or are there not a good many people walking? A. No; it was quite quiet - church was over; there was another boy with me - I saw nobody else; Blackland's-lane comes into the King's-road; the boy who was with me did not look through the crevice. he was on in front of me, a good way farther than the window of this Court - he saw nothing of it; I went on to him afterwards - I did not tell him what I had seen; he was at the fire - I did not tell him then what I had seen; he was running on and I was walking - he was a playfellow - we often go out to play together, his name is Mockford - he was at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the man going from the manufactory to the stable? A. He ran very fast the whole way, and did not halt till he got to the stable - he stood outside the stable; he came out into the King's-road over the paling - I have been examined at Queen-square five times about this; the first examination was on the Monday after the fire - I do not know when the last was; I have not been there when the prisoner was absent, nor have I been to any private room since to be examined.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have said he was running from the back part of the manufactory? A. Yes; I was in the King's-road, his face was towards me then, and when he halted at the stable; there is an alley which leads from the King's-road to Blackland's-lane - I do not know the name of it; it was down that alley that he ran; I was at the watch-house before I went to the Police-office, but did not point the prisoner out there - I did not hear any dog bark when the prisoner was inside the railing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who took you to the watch-house? A. My father; it was the same day as I went to Queen-square (Monday) - I did not point the prisoner out there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go into the watch-house? A. Yes; the prisoner was there - he was the only prisoner; several gentlemen were there; Mr. Maybank opened the door for me - my father was with me; I knew the prisoner when I saw him there, and was sure he was the person I had seen running from the manufactory; I said he was the man, but did not point to him - I am sure the person I saw was the person I had seen on Sunday between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWNING re-examined. Q. How high are the ground floor windows, which were open, from the ground? A.About seven feet; the paling is from five to six feet high - it is very old, with a number of apertures in it; it has originally been closed.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Peto, a carpenter, and live in the King's-road, opposite Moore's nursery, which adjoins Mr. Downing's premises. On Sunday, the 17th of May, I went out about eleven o'clock, and on my return I came up towards the White Stiles, between the horse-chesnut trees, that are on the other side of the King's-road, nearly opposite to the manufactory - it was near one o'clock, or about a quarter past; I saw a man leaning on the bar, and by the side of him I saw the prisoner - I am certain of him; the bar belongs to the King's-road - it is a private road; I looked at them, and they looked at me - Benham was with me, and we observed that they looked very much agitated; they still looked after us, and we looked at them - I made an observation about it, and then went into my house, and sat down at my window, where I had a full command of Mr. Downing's premises, and when I had been sitting down about three-quarters of an hour, or an hour, I saw a man just coming from the pales to the corner, close up to Mrs. Moore's (it was before the fire happened, but I cannot speak with certainty to the time) - the man was just springing from the pales; he had just come over - I observed him; it was the prisoner, I am sure - his hands were just coming from the pales; he had come over - he ran away towards London, and I think he turned to the left; there is an alley to the left, leading into Blackland's-lane - he appeared to turn down that alley; he did not run very fast - it was between a run and a walk; I was called to my dinner at that time, but stopped to observe him; the alarm of fire might he ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes after - I cannot speak exactly; I heard no dog bark - I was the first person that went down, and was the first on the premises; I saw the fire first come from the window over the folding doors in the manufactory, and I think there was fire coming from the stable, but am not certain; I saw nothing but smoke when I first saw it, but in the course of a minute or so the flames began to come, and in four or five minutes it was all over the building; it was quite burnt down - all the wood-work was burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been employed by Mr. Downing, as a carpenter, in the manufactory? A. No; I did not know the prisoner before - it was rather before one o'clock when I saw him talking to a person on the bar - I think it might be after, and it was half an hour or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110138"/>three-quarters of an hour before I saw him getting over the palings; I dine at any time on Sunday - my window is more than forty feet from Downing's premises - I never measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think it is one hundred feet from the fence? A. I do not know - it is not a very great way; it is across the road - the lane is on his way towards London; the turning is very close to the premises - he ran from the fence to the lane, which is not a great way; I did not observe anybody else on the King's-road - there were some boys there; there had been some boys up getting some lilac - I cannot say, I saw them looking through the palings - there had been a lot of boys there before, but I did not observe at the time; two o'clock is about the working people's time for dinner - there are not many people walking there at that time; I did not know the other man who was at the bar - I did not take sufficient notice of him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You only saw that man once? A. No; I saw the prisoner twice - at the pales and at the bar.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had no acquaintance with the prisoner, I suppose? A. I knew him by his working near where I live; it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>JAMES JAMES. I am going on for eleven years old - I have learned to say my prayers; I believe people who tell lies will go to hell fire - I am errand-boy to Mr. Sellers, No. 9, King's-road, a chemist and druggist; I remember the day of the fire - it was on a Sunday; I remember two little girls coming to master's shop the day before the fire - they came for a fire-box; I knew the children - I had seen them in the neighbourhood a great many times before - they had the fire-box; I saw them go out - they went towards Mr. Downing's manufactory; it was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - I saw those two girls at Queen-square office, and saw Mr. Downing there; I did not show the girls to him - I did not point them out to any body; I knew them to be the two girls who had been to master's the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What sort of a box was it? A. A long box, with a fire bottle and red matches - not common brimstone matches.</p>
               <p>MERCY HILL. I am servant to Mr. Downing, and have been so eight months. I remember the day of the factory being on fire - I was in the kitchen chiefly all the morning; the stable-door is across the yard - the doghouse is by the stable-door; I can always hear the dog bark very distinctly when I am in the kitchen - it did not bark at all on the morning of the fire; I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the kitchen from the manufactory? A.They are not under one roof - it is just across the garden, which is a very little distance; we have candles lighted at night and fire - we use brimstone matches.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was the kitchen burned? A. No.</p>

            . I am in the employ of one of the Mr. Downing's, as groom. I am in the employ of one of the fire; on the Friday before that, I was watering master's garden, and saw the prisoner Butler; he came over from the White Hart public-house, looked at the manufactory, and said, "Graham, you b-r, water away, you b-r, you shall want plenty of water:" I saw no more of him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where were you? A. Watering master's garden, which may be twenty yards from the manufactory; it was Friday evening; I did not speak to him - I was not examined at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell any body of this curious conversation? A. I told my master, Mr. G. Downing, a few days after; it was some time after the prisoner was taken: I knew of his being in custody, and of people being examined - I did not mention this before in consequence of my young master hearing the expression; I did not think it necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was in the garden when they were used? He was, by the warehouse door; it was Mr. Charles Downing; he is twenty-two years old - I calculated that he must have heard it as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you thought it unnecessary to say any thing about it; is that it? A. Just the reason: I did not know I was to be examined on this trial till one day last week.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was the prisoner taken up on the day the fire happened? A. Yes; he mentioned my name when he used this language - I had known him about twenty months.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM POOL. I am a constable of St. Luke, Chelsea.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.At what time did you take him? A.About half-past three o'clock; it was opposite Mr. Downing's, and also opposite his father's house, which is nearer to London than the manufactory: I had been at the fire - I did not see the prisoner there; it might be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110139"/>about two hours after it began that I took him; I do not know of his having assisted to put the fire out - Russell saw him in the watch-house; and after he (Russell) came out, he told me positively that was the man.</p>

This is a correct plan of the premises, and the lanes and streets adjoining (looking at it); here is Butterfly-alley, Blackland's-lane, and the King's-road - I have made a black mark on the spot where I found the matches, and it is the same place pointed out as where the man got over - this plan was drawn by Mr. Pocock, an architect.</p>

               <p>ISAAC RYDE. I saw the man get over the corner, near to Mrs. Moores' garden - it was just at the side of this black mark on the plan.</p>

            , in Manor-buildings, and supped there - he went with me to all these places; he slept at my brother-in-law's, in Manor-buildings; I saw him about eight or half-past eight o'clock in the morning; my brother-in-law came with him - they went away together in a few minutes; I saw him again about ten o'clock - we all three went into St. James's-park to see the soldiers; we went to Bird-cage-walk, by the old palace, and went with the soldiers to Hyde-park, up Constitution-hill; I left my brother in Hyde-park, about twelve o'clock, and saw him next at my lodgings, about ten minutes past one, at No. 9, Francis-street, Chelsea-common, and he dined with me; I am sure it was about ten minutes, or not more than a quarter-past one o'clock when I saw him there - he remained in the house till past two o'clock; he was not out of my sight all that time; my brother Thomas, my wife, and my sister Mary, were there.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned him to leave? A. The alarm of fire being given in the street; he got up and went out - he had not parted from me from the time he sat down to dinner till after the alarm was given; my brother Thomas went to the fire with him - I went about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour after; I saw him there, and was with him several times - he was only looking on at the time I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long were you at your father's on the Saturday? A. About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - it was in the afternoon; I have two little sisters - I do not recollect whether I saw them there; I saw no phosphorus-box, nor heard of one; I should not suppose my lodgings to be more than three minutes walk from Mr. Downing's - it is a very little distance; Francis-street runs out of Kepple-street - it is a street from Blackland's-lane; the alley leading to it leads to Francis-street; a person wantiag to go from Mr. Downing's to Francis-street, would go down the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. If he ran he might effect that in less than two minutes? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you looked at the clock or watch? A. No, I did not, but my dinner was sent for from the baker's about one o'clock; I make my calculation from the dinner coming, and not from any clock or watch; dinner had not come when he arrived - it was sent for when he came; he was there about ten minutes after one o'clock; dinner is not to be had till after one, when the people come from church - he came before we sent for the dinner; people who send their dinner to be baked dine about one; not about two o'clock; church is over about one - the dinner must he fetched before two; I believe it cannot be had after two o'clock - he did not dine at home that day; he dined with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he was waited for? A. He was not waited for at my father's, because my father knew he was dining with me - we had baked beef and potatoes for dinner; they were baked together - I am sure it was beef, but am not quite certain about the vegetables; I believe there were potatoes in the dish - we had beer, and, I believe, rhubarb pudding, but am not certain; that was dressed at home - we had no cheese; when I left him in Hyde-park I did not go home - I went up Oxford-street with my brother-in-law; I left Hyde-park about twelve o'clock - my brother complained of his feet being sore; he could not walk further; we left him just inside Hyde-park-corner gate, at the end of Piccadilly; we then went through the park to Oxford-street, as far as Portman-street, which leads to the barracks - we went with the soldiers to hear the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to any house? A. Yes; we went to a brother-in-law's, but he was not at home - we did not stay there; we came down Oxford-street again to return home; I suppose I live half an hour's walk from Hydepark-corner - I got home about one o'clock; we did not go as far as the barracks - we did not go out of Oxford-street - my brother-in-law lives in Oxford-street - I do not know the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any means of judging that it was about one o'clock when you returned home, except by guess? A. No; my brother wore a light blue coat and black trousers; they were dark, and I think they were black; they were a very different colour from the coat - he had low shoes with two holes on each side of the shoes - I did not observe his stockings, because his trousers came down to his shoes; I was not present when he was taken; I saw him on the premises after four o'clock, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak always about time with uncertainty? A. I had no clock; I was with him at the fire at various times - it was after four o'clock or near five when I left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110140"/>him; he had the same dress on then; I saw no more of him till I saw him in custody: I did not see him again till he was at Queen-square - he had the same dress on then; I am certain that every thing I have stated I am positive of.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He did not change his dress from the time he was walking with you till he was at Queen-square? A. No; I am positive his trousers were much darker than his coat - his shoes were very bad; he went to my father's and shaved, after we parted with him in the park we had agreed on Saturday to dine together - my eldest sister is about twelve years old I think: I never heard my sister talk of having bought a fire-box - I sent for the dinner immediately, and it came hot - people always hurry to the baker's to get their dinners hot - we sat down to dinner as soon as it came; we sent for it as soon as we thought we could get it; my brother sat down to dine with me.</p>
               <p>Q.Could a man go from your place to this manufactory, stay there till he had time to enter the premises, and return in a minute and a half? A.No; it was impossible, and he was not absent at all - I went for the beer; I was not gone more than five minutes; I went to the Marlborough Arms, at the top of the street; I went for it before the meat came, and my wife went for the dinner - I left my brothers, James and Thomas, in the house - when I came back I found them there as I had left them - my wife got back before me.</p>

            , stopped while the guards were relieved, then came out with the guards, up Constitution-hill, and in Hyde-park he complained of being fired, and persuaded us to go no farther; we left him there - he said he was going to dine with William - I went with William to Oxford-street - when I got back to Chelsea, it might be twenty-five minutes to one, or between that and the half-hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did William go back with you? A. No; we met his brother Thomas and Fulbrook - I and his brother Thomas went one way, he and Fulbrook went to Frances-street; I saw James again directly I got home, about half-past twelve o'clock - he was at his father's - I stopped with him a minute or two till the silent drums heat at the Duke of York's Asylum, which is about one o'clock - I then left, and the next time I saw him was after the fire broke out; I saw him two or three times, and was with him about three o'clock, when he was sitting on the wall in front of his father's house - I saw him taken into custody - I think that was about five or six o'clock; I had dined at my own father's.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did you leave him at Hyde-park-corner, when he complained of his feet? A. I should think about ten minutes to twelve o'clock perhaps - I got home about half-past twelve - I had walked to Oxford-street, and back to Chelsea; I am not positive as to what time I left him in the Park; I had learned he was to dine with William; I do not know that I heard William invite him - I do not know that the clock had struck one when I left him at his father's, but the drums had done beating; I did not go to my brother William's after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to in Oxford-street? A. We might have gone about one hundred yards down Oxford-street; as he had gone back, we thought we would go back too, and I had to clean myself - we went into no public-house in Oxford-street, nor to any house; we did not knock at any door in Oxford-street - I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you find each other, then? A. We knew the road, and had agreed to go back together throught the Park - we were out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know when to return? A. I do not exactly know; I did not knock at any door, nor stop at any house, that I remember - the prisoner has a sister married to a young man who lives in Oxford-street - I believe at a poulterer's; I understand so, but he sleeps at home - I have been at his house; it is in Oxford-street, a few doors from North Audley-street - it is a good way down beyond Portman-street; we did not go down Portman-street with the soldiers - I do not know that we turned back; we might have gone further down Oxford-street - we did go further; I do not know why I believe we did go further.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, the crowd would follow the soldiers; your brother and you were then alone? A. There is generally a crowd in that street; I know we went back through the Park - I remember we went into Oxford-street with the hand; we might have gone lower down than Portman-street, but I cannot remember whether we did or not; I think my brother-in-law lives by North Audley-street - it is at the end of the coach-stand; I know the house, but do not know what street I go by - I do not know whether my brother called there; I know I went to no house in Oxford-street.</p>

            . The prisoner dined at our house the day before the floor-cloth manufactory was burnt - I first saw him between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; he then left our house in company with Dickens - I saw him again at our house from ten minutes to a quarter-past one; he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110141"/>to dine with us - I went to fetch the meat from the bake-house about ten minutes or a quarter past one o'clock; it might be twenty minutes past one when I returned - I left him in the house, and found him there when I returned: I was gone five, six, or eight minutes - we had roast beef, rhubarb pudding, and potatoes; Thomas, and his brother and sister Mary, dined with us; she is a little girl, and has been away from home some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at what time James left you? A. Yes; there came a knock at the door - there was a good many people in the street; when I came down I asked what was the matter, and they said there was a fire in Whiting's-grove - I asked a person who was running where it was; he said it was Mr. Downing's manufactory - I stood a few minutes before I went in, and then went in and told my husband and James there was a fire; Thomas and James both went to the premises, leaving my husband at home for some minutes - then he put on his clean things, and went also: I and the little girl followed them - I did not see James there; he had not been out of my sight from the time he came, except when I went to the baker's.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you any watch? A. Yes, my husband has a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. He looked at it, did he? A. Yes; it hung up in the room we were in - I do not know that he looked at it; it was there for him to see: my husband had finished dinner, and was cleaning himself when I told him of the fire - he had been out walking in the morning, but was not clean; he was going out to tea in the afternoon - the little girl dined with us; we did not wait for the prisoner to come to dinner - he was there before I went for the dinner; I had not to wait for the dinner - there was very few people there when I got it; it was Sacrament Sunday: it depends on the number of people who stop the Sacrament - as to what time it is over - I suppose the usual time is a quarter past one o'clock - the service is over about one, I believe; I have not stopped the Sacrament since I have been at Chelsea; we did not wait at all for the prisoner to come to dinner - I had my dinner ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before my landlady; people about there generally get their dinner between one and two o'clock; we finished ours, I suppose, five or ten minutes after two; it takes us a quarter of an hour to dine in the general way - sometimes longer and sometimes shorter.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you longer at dinner that day, or did you get it in a quarter of an hour? A. We were longer, I am sure; the time I went to the baker's was about twenty minutes past one o'clock, and I waited there about ten minutes - I was told it was Sacrament Sunday; the watch is called my husband's - it hangs up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BUTLER. I am the prisoner's brother. I was with him first when he came to my brother's to dinner; it was about ten minutes past one o'clock - he dined there, and went out about a quarter-past two, on an alarm of fire being given; I was in the room all the time with him - he did not go out till then.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go out with him? A. Yes; I had not heard him complain of any illness, or any thing to prevent his walking - he was dressed in a blue coat and black velvet collar, a sort of dark black mixture trousers, and black hat and shoes; I did not see his shoes particularly - they were almost worn out; the soles were a little worn: we had ale to drink after dinner; just as we had done dinner, the alarm of fire was given.</p>
               <p>Q. All of you were sitting comfortably round the table when the alarm was given? A. Yes; my brother William, my sister Mary, my youngest sister, and the prisoner and I were round the table - William was shaving himself at the time the alarm was given; he had got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear he was sitting at the table when the alarm of fire was given? A. Yes; he got up to shave, and was talking about cleaning himself just as the alarm was given; he was sitting at table at the time the alarm was given - I am certain of that; and then he got up; dinner was over about a quarter-past two o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. William got up to clean himself - before that he had been sitting at the table with you all? A. Yes; my eldest sister Mary came in and said there was a fire, and then we went out: the soles of my brother's shoes were very bad when I saw them.</p>

            , JUN. I go to church, and believe in God people who tell untruths when they swear will go to a wicked place. (Sworn.) I am the prisoner's sister; I have now come from my father's house - I went there on Monday evening; I have not been at home since my brother has been in prison till then; I have been at the Chelsea National School; while there, I saw my sister and brother when I was up at the window, but not so as to speak to them: I know Mr. Sellers' chemist's shop in the King's-road; I have bought cream of tartar there for ginger-beer for my father - I have been there many times; I never bought a fire-box, or any thing of the kind there or any where else: I remember the Sunday the floor-cloth manufactory was burnt - I went no where for a fire-box on the Friday before that; I am sure of that - I was not at Sellers' that day, nor on the Saturday; my little sister is six years old - she and I were not there on the Saturday- I dined at my brother William's on the day of the fire; my brother James was there; I do not know at what time I went; James was not out of the room from the time he came in till he left.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You did not go any where with your younger sister on the Saturday before the fire? A. No, I am sure of that: Mrs. Perry is mistress of the school- I have not told her that I did so, nor has my sister, in my presence; I know that boy (James) by sight.</p>
               <p>JAMES JAMES. She is the girl I saw on Saturday</p>

            . Now recollect you are on your oath; were you not there? A. No, Sir; I never heard my little sister tell mistress, nor did I tell her I was sent there for a box for my brother - I am quite sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you wait dinner for your brother on Sunday? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For your brother James? A. Yes; we did not wait long - he came in just after.</p>

               <p>Q. Just after what - after the dinner had come home? A. No, when I went in; I did not understand what you meant - we should not have had dinner sooner if he had come sooner: I was at chapel that day, and came out at one o'clock; the chapel is in Sloane-street; it would take me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110142"/>about five minutes to walk from there to my brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you said to your school-mistress that you waited some time for your brother? A. No, I never heard my little sister say so - I never told my sister so.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Your chapel is over about one o'clock? A. Yes, or a little before; it would take me five minutes to go to my father's - it is a very short distance; I went home from chapel, and from there to my brother-in-law's, and got there a little before my brother; I lost no time in going to my father, and from there to my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there was dinner ready, or did your sister go and fetch it? A. My sister went and fetched it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK called -</p>
               <p>ELIZA PERRY. I am temporary mistress of the Chelsea National School - the last witness and her little sister were under my care: 
               <persName id="t18290611-318-person2286">
                  Mary 
                  Butler
               <interp inst="t18290611-318-person2286" type="surname" value="Butler"/>

             told me they waited dinner for her brother ten minutes at the brother-in-law's; her little sister told me, in her presence, that she bought a box of Mr. Sellers - she did not say a phosphorus-box; Mary said."You tell a story, Bessey, it was not me that was with you;" I then said, "Was there any other little girl who was in the habit of going of errands with her?" she then named some - I turned round to Betsey, and said,"Was your father in the habit of sending that girl with you on errands?" -</p>
               <p>Q.Without giving the particulars, did Bessey say any thing, in the presence of Mary, about the box? A. She said it was Mary that went with her for a box, and that Mr. Sellers gave it into the hands of the little one.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The sister told her it was a story? A. Yes; they were put under my care at the office; the Magistrate turned round to the father, and asked if he had any objection to put them under my care - he said No; Mr. Downing is not a subscriber to the school to my knowledge - I have been there about seven weeks; I never understood the father was not to see the children - I understood the family were not; I really do not know that I had instructions about it, but seemingly the children were put under my care.</p>

               <p>Q. They were not to be seen? A. No, but many of the family did see them - I took them three times regularly to church, and they might have seen them in the street; they could not speak to them alone - they had been with me perhaps a fortnight or a week when I had this conversation; I told my husband of it the first thing.</p>
               <p>Q.What time they had dinner, or what time he came in, she did not say? A. I never asked her any question but that once, and that was in consequence of the girl crying.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear you were to be a witness to contradict the child? A.When the children were given up to their father it was stated to me by Mr. Downing that it would be necessary for me to come here, simply to say the children were used well; I think that was yesterday, or the day before - I do not know that Mr. Downing knew of this conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. The children were given up to the father this week? A. Yes, on Monday; I have not spoken to them since.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES JAMES. Q. Who served the little girl with the box? A. I went and fetched them from a neighbour, as master had none in the house; the girls remained in the shop at the time - I gave the box into the girl's hand at first, and master took it out of her hand and wrapped it in paper for her; he is here.</p>
               <p>JOHN SELLERS. I am a chemist; James is in my service. I recollect an application being made by two girls for the fire-box perfectly well; it was as near as I can recollect, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - I had none by me, desired them to wait, and sent James out for two; they only asked for one - the girls stood in the shop during his absence; he went to a shop about twenty yards off, returned with two boxes, and handed one to the eldest girl - they paid for it before they left with 6d. in halfpence; the boy was gone about ten minutes - I continued in the shop writing at my desk all the time; I did not know the girls before - I have seen the two girls repeatedly since, but cannot positively say they are the girls; the witness answers exactly in size, and to the best of my recollection in age, to the eldest - she had on, at the time, a white shawl, but I cannot speak positively to her.</p>

               <p>CHARLES BOLTON. I am a clerk at Messrs. Coutts and Co. Sir Coutts Trotter, bart. is one of the partners - he has other partners; Mr. Hamlett, the jeweller, of Princes-street, keeps an account at the house - Mr. Hoper keeps an account there, and I believe he lives in Old Burtington-street. On the 29th of April, this cheque (looking at it) was presented at our house for payment by the prisoner Martelly - I looked at it, and as soon as I saw it, I knew it was not the hand-writing of Mr. Hamlett. and asked him who he had brought that from - he said, "The person there," making a motion with his arm, by which I supposed him to mean the person named in the cheque, which was either in my hand, or lying on the book immediately before me: I asked him, "Who is Mr. Arlett;" he said,"A gentleman or person at the door;" I said, "Do you live with Mr. Arlett;" he said, No - I said, "Do you know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110143"/>Mr. Arlett;" he said, No - I said, "Then where are you to take him this money?" he said, "At the door, or if I find he is gone, I am to take it on to him at Raymond-buildings;" I then said, was it not extraordinary that a person entitled to receive that sum should come to the very door, and ask a perfect stranger to come in and receive it for him? he said in a sort of indifferent way that he did not know - he stated that he was coming along the Strand, and that the gentleman told him that his handkerchief was hanging out; that he thanked him, and they fell into a conversation, in which he told the gentleman he was out of a situation, or in want of a situation, and the gentleman asked him what situation he had been in, and what sort of a hand he wrote, and, on being told the gentleman said he thought he knew of a situation that might suit him, and that the gentleman then asked him to come in and receive the money for this draft, and when he received it, he was to take it to him at the door, and if he found he could not wait, and was gone, he was to take it on to him at Raymond-buildings - I told him if he had any thing further to say, he could say it to one of the partners, if he would step in with me to one of them, which he was very willing to do; he followed me in to one of the partners, and gave the same account of it - Stevens, the officer, was sent for from Bow-street, and he was detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.You did not go to Newgate to see Martelly afterwards? A. No; Taunton, the officer, is here - I believe he has been engaged in this investigation.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL STEVENS. I am a constable of Bow-street. I was sent for on the 29th of April to Coutts', and took Martelly in custody; I told him I was an officer of Bow-street, and came respecting the cheque - I asked him who he received the cheque from - he said he was in the Strand looking in at a shop window, and a person tapped him on the shoulder, and told him his handkerchief hung out.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any name mentioned to you after that by the prisoner? A. Yes; when I asked him who he received the cheque of, I understood him to say Mr. Arlett; I asked where he lived - he said No. 6, Raymond-buildings, Chancery-lane; I took him into custody at Coutts' house- I took him to the door, and asked him to look round, and see if he could see the person who he could recognize as giving him the cheque, as he had said the person was waiting at the door - he looked round, and said he saw no one; he described the person as a tall man, about forty or forty-five years of age, pointing to one of the clerks at Coutts' as being a man of the same description; I took him to Bow-street, got the assistance of another person, and then went with him to No. 6, Raymond-buildings, - I found nobody of that name, or like it, but at No. 5, the name of Arlett was on the door, but I ascertained that he had gone to reside in James-street, Bedford-row - the prisoner was kept in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to say he said he had the cheque from Arlett, or that was the name the person gave him? A. He said he had it from a person named Arlett; I asked if he knew the person who gave him the cheque - he said he did not, but he told him he resided at No. 6, Raymond-buildings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to the door with him; there was nobody answering the description he gave you? A. No; I did not look - he was to point him out.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live at Ware-In September last, I had an office in Raymond-buildings, No. 5 - I removed from there in October; I do not know Martelly - I never saw him before this examination, nor had I ever seen this cheque before that.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HAMLETT, ESQ. I am a jeweller, of Prince's-street, Leicester-square. The signature to this cheque is not my hand-writing, nor the hand-writing of any person authorized to draw cheques for me - it is a little like my mode of signature, but entirely differs from mine altogether; I bank at Coutts', and had an account there on the 29th of April - this letter, signed "
               <persName id="t18290611-319-person2293">T. </persName>
            Hamlett," is not my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Does the letter bear a resemblance to your writing? A. It is a little like it in the mode - the cheque is not signed so large as I sign; I should think the cheque and letter were written by the same person - I did not go to Newgate, nor send any body, or know of any body having been there.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COOMBS. I am in custody - I have been acquainted with Martelly nearly three months; I have known Conway two years and a half or three years - our acquaintance ceased for about a year and a half, and I became acquainted with him a few months since: I and the two prisoners frequented a coffee-shop in Pickettplace, Temple-bar; we were there often together, generally in the evening - in April and May we met there several times; I have seen the prisoner Martelly there in March - I did not see Conway there in March; I do not know where Conway lived in March - I might have seen him about the latter end of March; I was living at that time with Mr. Busby in the Temple - Conway told me he lived at No. 9, John-street, Adelphi; I went there to see him about the beginning of April - I did not see him there before that time.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any thing said at any time by Martelly relative to any transaction at Coutts'? A. About a week before last Easter; we were all three together at the coffee-house in Pickett-place, about six weeks since, I think; Martelly asked Conway if he could not commit another forgery - Conway said he had no wish to commit another forgery and I said the same; Martelly said he was very much in want of money, and must have some - we refused, and the conversation ended: we met there several times after, and the subject was repeated by Martelly several times after, and Conway and I refused each time; Martelly said he could obtain a blank cheque-book from Coutts', in the name of Mr. Hoper, who banked there; we met at the coffeeshop one morning together, and went out together, Martelly, Conway, and myself; we went towards the Park, and in St. James'-park Martelly said to me that he had got a cheque-book - he pulled it out of his pocket, and showed it me: Conway was present - it was a cheque-book of Coutts': it contained these cheques - he said Conway was going to put his signature to one of them, and that he, Martelly, should present it; I told Conway he was very foolish if he let Martelly persuade him to put the signature - no signature was mentioned; I left them, and said I gave my refusal to have any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110144"/>Q. You say he proposed it to you several times, and you always refused - what was it he proposed to you? A. To get the consent of Conway to put the signature on the cheque; that was the subject he always spoke to us about- I saw Conway the next afternoon, about half-past five o'clock: he said that Martelly had presented the cheque that afternoon at Coutts' - that he went with him to the door, and waited a long time, half an hour I think he stated; and that he saw him come out with a person who had hold of his arm; that he watched them, and saw them go into Bow-street: I told him I did not think he would have been persuaded by Martelly to put the signature: he said he was very sorry for it then: I saw Conway again next morning; we saw the account in the paper of Martelly being taken into custody - Conway came to me at the coffee-house several times after that, and said he wished me to come over to Martelly's sister, at No. 9, Surrey-row, Blackfriars-road - that he wanted me to write a note to Sir

            ; he said he was to put the signature, which when Sir Richard Birnie received the note he would find it corresponded with the signature on the cheque; I agreed to go over, and went over with him; I saw Martelly's two sisters - Conway was with me: it was the first time I had seen Mrs. Pearce, Martelly's sister - she went and fetched a sheet of paper, brought it, and said she had been instructed by her brother to get me to write a note, and Conway was to put the signature to it; this is the note (looking at it) the body of it is my hand-writing, and the signature Conway's; I folded the letter up, directed it, and put it into the post in Portugal-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields; I was afterwards taken into custody - before that I had written a letter to Salmon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You refused to have any thing to do with it? A. I did - it was because I thought it dishonest; that was the reason, and my only reason; after I had participated in one forgery, I did not wish to do any thing dishonest - I cannot tell how many crimes I have done myself; I certainly have done things which render me liable to be called a dishonest character; I have done some few things - I was dismissed from Mr. Busby's for being deficient in the sum of ten guineas; it was certainly a robbery - Mr. Busby has received the money since: I had received his fees, and never told him of it; I have heard, from very good authority, that fees which Mr. Busby acknowledged were coming to me when I left, were upwards of 20l.; I have heard clients have paid those fees, which Mr. Busby has kept back to repay himself -above 20l. was due to me for fees when I left, and I received nothing but the fees when in his employ; I swear that different clients owed me 20l. in fees - Watson and Broughton, of Falcon-square, owed 6l. for my fees, as clerk's fees, not Mr. Busby's; they owed that at the time I left; I said on the last trial, I intended to repay Mr. Busby when I got those fees; I do not think I mentioned about fees being due to me, or that any particular sum was due to me: I might say I intended to repay him when I got money - I have had money since I left him; I did not go to settle with him because I heard he had been paid; I went to ask him, I cannot recollect the day, but Mr. Busby is here - I think it was in April; I did not, settle with him - I have not been charged with any other theft; no one has accused me, nor told me I had stolen any thing - I was not accused of stealing beads from Holywell-street by Goodyear; I did not return any beads - I did take some; I had not his consent - he did not speak to me about them, nor any body else; he found out that they were gone - there was also an empty purse, there was nothing in it of any kind - it was Goodyears; I found it in his house up stairs, in the second floor bed-room, on the top of a chest of drawers - I reached them without climbing up - the door was wide open; I lodged in the house - I pledged them; I did not redeem them, they are there still - I have been out of employ about three months; Mr. Busby was the last person I was with - Mr. Hughes, of Clifford's-inn, owed me five guineas in fees; I did not receive Mr. Busby's fees on which the five guineas were due to me - I do not know why I did not mention about these fees on the former trial; I was not asked if I had paid him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked by me if you had paid Mr. Busby, and you said No, but you intended when you got money? A. I will not swear that; I have come here to-day for the pure love of justice, and no other motive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. On your oath do not you come here to save your own neck? A. No, I do not; I do not expect to be prosecuted - I have not been promised that I shall not; I expect I shall not - I have seen my sister on the subject, and Mr. Butler, the solicitor; it is not in consequence of the evidence I have given that I do not expect to be prosecuted - I have been induced to give it at the entreaty of my parents, and because the prisoners have offered (I have reason to believe) to give evidence against me, that is my only reason.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before your only reason was the pure love of justice - which of the two reasons do you stand to? A. The one I have just given, the first must have been a lie; I do not recollect swearing that that was as true as the rest of my evidence; love of justice had something to do with it - I consider I am doing justice by giving evidence, that is one reason; I wrote to Salmon, I think on the 11th of May - Martelly was in custody at that time, and I had heard the officers were after me - I had heard it about a week before; I surrendered three or four days after I wrote the letter - I had not seen the officer; I never absconded - I was not residing at any place at the time; I was compelled to get a living where I could - I was not hiding at the time I wrote the letter; I have lived on my parents since I have been out of employ - I lived very near them, at a place they appointed for me, nearly all the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is this the letter you wrote to Salmon? (producing it). A. It is; and I wrote him this one - I put the first into the post, and sent the other by a little boy; I was clerk to Mr. Busby five years and a half - the fees I mention are clerks' fees, which come with barristers' briefs; the fees I embezzled belonged to Mr. Busby - Mr. Busby has since received mine, and is not out of pocket; he never made a charge against me before a Magistrate.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Surrey-row, Blackfriars-road, and did so in the beginning of May - I saw Coombs there in May, and a young man with him, who, he said, was named Conway; he said so in the presence of that person - I stated at Bow-street I was not positive of that being the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110145"/>Q. What is your belief? A. Why, on the previous evening a person called, and said his name was Conway, and I doubted it - I cannot say positively; the prisoner is the man I saw at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, on the oath you have taken, do you or do you not believe that person to be the same young man you saw at your lodging in company with Coombs? A. I cannot swear to him; if I judge from what I have heard, I must believe it was him.</p>

               <p>Q. From your recollection of the person at the time, what is your belief? A. I do not believe it is him, because he is very much altered if it is him; the lad that came with Coombs was fresh-coloured, and, as far as my recollection goes, was dressed in a surtout coat - I really have a doubt of the prisoner being the person, and should not like to take a solemn oath about it - I believe Coombs to be the person, but do not recollect Conway to be the person - I am half-sister to Martelly; I was by the same father - Coombs wrote a note in my presence; Martelly was in custody at the time - it was on Tuesday, the 4th or 5th of May - I believe this to be the note I saw Coombs write - the young man who was with him signed it; I saw him sign in a slanting direction, but I did not read the name he signed; I knew what the letter was about; I knew the first sentence, but I did not read the whole; I was not desired to have the conversation with them, at the request of my brother - it was of my own accord - I heard my brother was committed to Newgate for trial; I called on him, and asked if he was innocent; he said he was, and if I could find the young man, he could inform me he was; and if I enquired of the mother of the young man named Conway, I should find Coombs' address.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HERCULES TAUNTON. I am a Bow-street officer. I apprehended Conway in Great Suffolk-street, Borough, No. 96; he lodged in the front room first floor; in consequence of information I searched the privy in the yard, and found thirty-eight cheques and this paper with them; I received this note (looking at it) from Sir R. Birnie, on the 11th of May - I found this letter on Conway.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Conway lodged there: then it was a lodging-house? A. Yes; I did not inquire how many persons lodged there; there might be several for what I know - the privy is common to the whole house; I had a chimney-sweeper with me, and a person to pull up the seat - I took the cheques out myself- Conway was not present.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see him after you found them? A. Yes: I took him before a Magistrate, then returned to examine the privy - I said nothing about the cheques in his presence, except before the Magistrate - I stated in my examination that I found them there; he made no answer to it.(The letters were here put in and read, as follows:)</p>

               <p>SIR - The young man, Marlelli, who has lately been examined upon a charge of forgery on the Bank of Messrs. Coutts and Co., and who has been committed to take his trial, the writer of this feels it his duty to acquaint your Worship, is innoccut of the charge.</p>

               <p>SIR RICHARD BIRNIE, Police-office, Bow-street.</p>
               <p>MR. HAMLETT. The signature to these blank cheques are not mine - there are thirty-eight all signed with my name; none of them are my writing; these cheques are not filled up with any sum.</p>
               <p>ANDREW HINRICH. I am a solicitor. The prisoner Conway was with me about ten months as clerk; Mr. Hamlett, of Prince's-street, was at that time a client of mine, and communicated with me by letter; my clerk had opportunities of seeing the letters of my client's on business, but Mr. Hamlett signs his letters, deeds, and instruments different to what he signs his cheques; while Conway was in my service I had a cheque from Mr. Hamlett more than once, I dare say.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN BUSBY. I keep a coffee-house in Pickett-place. I know Coombs and the prisoners by their frequenting my house for tea and coffee - they came separately, and I have seen them twice together, but not more, I think.(Cheque read.)</p>

               <p>THOMAS LAILEY. I deal with Mr. Scales, and know the prisoner. On the 23d of April he was not in my service; I gave him no authority to apply to Mr. Scales for a sheep - he had left me three weeks all but a day; he never brought it to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRHIMES. I am a constable of Leadenhall-market.

               <p>The prisoner put in a long written defence, complaining of ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110146"/>treatment from his master, but nothing on the subject of the charge.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM LADWICK. I am an officer. On the first of June, between four and five o'clock, I was in the field; I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner, and three others - the prosecutor had hold of a table-cover, which he claimed, and said the prisoner had taken it; the prisoner said that he awoke the prosecutor up, or he would have been robbed by the others, and that he had been drinking in the same house with them, but the prosecutor denied it; the prosecutor said if he would go to the White Horse, and the landlord would deny that he had been there, he would forgive him; we went - the landlord said he had not been there, but the landlady said he had; I took the prisoner to the watch-house - he struck me in the face on the road, and was rescued at the Bellisle; I took him again at eight o'clock the next night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you, on the first examination, swear to him as the man? A. Yes, and he was remanded, that I might find the parties who rescued him - I found a sixpence and some copper on him.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRANT re-examined. The others were his comrades; I said to him, "Are not you the man who was drinking with me at the White Horse, a few minutes ago?" he said, "No - I am pot-boy at the King of Prussia public-house, and am gathering my pots;" he struck me a violent blow, and said he had saved me from being robbed by the others, but it was no such thing - he afterwards said he had been at the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you not asleep? A. I was nearly asleep; my eyes were shut; he had the cover in his hand when I awoke; I had not drank much - I was not tipsy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What time was this? A. Half-past ten o'clock at night; it was moon-light - I was not very drunk; I could keep up: I have known the woman three years, every time I came home from sea - I had been only two or three days on shore; I cannot say whether she was a woman of the town.</p>


               <p>MARGARET BROWN. I was walking with Maden, and the prisoner took his watch from his fob; there were three others with the prisoner - I called out Watchman! and the watchman sprung his rattle; the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see the prisoner taken? A. No; they all ran up Angel-gardens: we went out, about seven o'clock, to the London Docks for a walk; we had a pint of beer, and some gin - he had been drinking in the day: the prisoner and his companions shoved against us, and then took his watch; I was alarmed, but not confused - I saw the prisoner in custody, and knew him again.</p>
               <p>CHARLES LOUGHTON. I am a watchman of St. George in the East. I was on duty. at half-past ten o'clock, and heard the rattle; I saw the prisoner come running towards me; I do not think he saw me - when he came up, he said,"There he goes, there he goes;" I said, "Never mind him, you are the man I want:" I went to take hold of him, but his coat was buttoned, and he got away - I pursued, and saw him throw something into a court: I could not see what - I took him, and my brother watchman found a watch in a court, where I thought he threw something.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say he ran towards you? A. Yes, at first; I do not think he saw me, as I had a dark coat on, and my lantern was under the cape - there was no one running in the direction he pointed to; I was not more than five yards from him when he threw something from him - the court leads to several houses, but is no thoroughfare; the watch was about ten yards up the court - he made no resistance, but stood still, and seemed very much hurt at being charged with it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM INCH. I am a watchman. I heard the rattle, and came up; Loughton had the prisoner - I found the watch in the court next morning; the prisoner asked if it could be made up - I said I thought not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What distance up the court was it? A. A good bit; the glass is not broken, but the case is gone - it is a brick court, and it was in the kennel.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUNT. This is my watch - the case has not been found.</p>
               <p>MARGARET BROWN. I bought this watch-ribbon for Maden that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is the court from where they had been walking? A. The watch was taken in Ratcliff-highway, and the court is in Blue-gate-fields, not a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been working at my father's; my brother came and asked me to carry a child down to his house, and then he asked me to have a bit of supper -I then said, "I will make haste home;" I sat off running, and just as I got to Blue-gate-fields I saw four or five persons running; I made a stop, and then thought I would not stay, as I am not used to be out late - I ran and met the watchman; I said, "There he goes;" as there were three or four persons running, I kept on gently run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110149"/>ning, and the watchman took me to the watch-house; in half an hour the other watchman brought in this watch, and said he found it in the court; next morning I said, "I never was guilty of any thing of the kind; I should not like to have my character spoiled, do you think it could be made up?" he said he thought it could: he asked if my friends were there; I said I believed my brother and sister were; and when he went before the Magistrate, he stated that I asked about its being made up.</p>
               <p>MARTHA THOMAS. I am the prisoner's brother's wife. He carried my child home that night, and left directly; I suppose it was two or three minutes after ten o'clock - he said he should make haste home: our house is in High-street, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>JOHN THOMAS. I am the prisoner's brother. He left work at nine o'clock that night, and went to carry the child home.</p>
               <p>CHARLES LOUGHTON. It might be twenty minutes before eleven o'clock when I took him - I had finished crying half-past ten.</p>

               <p>CHARLES JESSOP. I am in the prosecutor's service. The prisoner called, and took 6s. of Mr. Young, of Somers'-town, and several other persons.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is your name Roach? A. Yes; it is not Murphy.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LINDLEY. I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and said it was for stealing a coat from the prosecutor - he said he was no thief, and would not be taken by any body; he showed fight, but I struck him with my staff - he gave the prosecutor some wounds, and he has not been able to work since.</p>

No; he was not walking with his hands in his pockets; he had the coat - I saw him throw it on the nearest hind wheel - there were no other persons about; the landlord was talking to us; he said the coat was going - I ran round the carriage - on my oath I saw the coat thrown on the wheel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came out of the corner door - I went round the carriage; the coat was on the near wheel; I was on the off side with my hands in my pockets; the coachman caught hold of me, and said,"Where is my coat?" - the footman went and got it, and said, "Here it is;" and then he said, "There is no one here but this man, we will give charge of him, in fact, I will swear I saw him throw it."</p>

               <p>MARGARET EASTON. I know Mr. Spicer; he is the father of Emily Spicer - she is sixteen months old. On the 1st of May I took her out; she had a row of beads round her neck; we were at the corner of <placeName id="t18290611-335-crimeloc1762">Gerrard-street</placeName>

               <p>ROBERT PRIDHAM. I was going along with a board of fish, and saw Easton running with the child - the prisoner ran down Porter-street, and looked to see if any body was running after him - he then turned down Newport-street towards St. Martin's-lane; I lost sight of him - I heard, when I came back, what had been lost.</p>
               <p>PHILIP RILEY. I was sent for about four or five o'clock, and found the prisoner in custody, from the girl's description.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in St. Martin's-lane; the gentleman came and asked if I knew any thing of the beads - I said "No, I am innocent."</p>

On the 2d of May I was in the Haymarket - the prisoner came there in a gig, and said he wanted a load of hay and a load of straw; it came to 6l. 4s. - I said I could not let it go without the money, as I wanted to pay my men; he said,"I have a cheque in my pocket for 190l., and I am going to get it cashed at a banker's, and any time after I return you may send to my place; I will pay for them;" I sent between four and five o'clock, to Mill-hill-mews - my brother took the straw, and lowood the hay; I said,"The agreement is for ready money, mind, and bring the money back, but they returned without it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known Tickness? A. Five or six years; I have taken perhaps 20l. of him; I have a bill of his returned for 18l. - he became a bankrupt on the 31st of May: I entered this hay and straw in a common day-book - I did not give credit to Tickness; I believed the prisoner ordered it on Tickness' account - I thought, as he was his servant, he had got his master's money to pay; I was not to allow him any commission - he asked for something to drink- I said I would give him a pint of beer or a glass of gin; he did not say he was going to Sir John Beresford's to receive money on his master's account - a man did call on me on the Tuesday, but I had taken a warrant out on the Monday, and on Wednesday Mr. Tickness' sister came, and said she came to settle it: half a dozen people came to me to try to settle it - there was a man called on the Tuesday; I said it was in the Magistrate's hands; some man did say if I would go up about four o'clock, but I did not hear him say I might take the receipt: he said the money would be ready - the Magistrate did not say I ought to take the money; he said it was a gross fraud: I have not offered to forego this prosecution if the bill was paid, and the money for the hay and straw; a man did call and say he came as a friend to ask me to settle it.</p>

               <p>JAMES TROUT. I am the prosecutor's brother. I took the straw; I saw the prisoner and gave him the bill - he said, "You have 6l. 4s. to take back, I will go and fetch the money in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes and settle with you;" I had not unloaded the hay, but we did afterwards - he came on horseback in about twenty minutes, and said he had seen our master and settled - we came away without the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said I wanted a load of hay and straw for Mr. Tickness; I said, "What time will you send it?" he said, "Between this and two o'clock;" when I got home there were six trusses of hay in the cart - I was called to speak to a gentleman, and went to a public-house to have something to drink - the man and boy came to the house and had a drop of beer, I saw neither of them afterwards; Mr. Trout afterwards came to the house and rang the bell, and said, "Have you got my money?" I said"No: I am going to Sir John Beresford's to get a cheque for 5l., and I will give it you, or you can have it on Monday."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TICKNESS. I am a stable-keeper, and live at Mill-hill-mews.

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you become a bankrupt? A. On the 30th of May; Mr. White, who lives in Kent, was the drawer of that cheque - I sent it back to him and got the property back.</p>

               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I was going up Fleet-street on Thursday, and saw the two prisoners together; I took them to Mr. Slee's, and the lad identified them - he expressed no doubt about their being the persons; it was from his description that I took them.</p>

I was returning home, and saw some persons at the door - I heard there was some one going up stairs; I went up the next house, and called to the people to watch at the bottom - no one came out at the top, and I went down; we broke the door open - I went up stairs, and found a flower-pot removed from the window, and several articles of wearing apparel on the stairs; I went down again, and found the prisoner in the cellar at the foot of the stairs - he said, "I am he: there is only me, don't be afraid" - I took him up.</p>

On the 5th of May, about four o'clock, or a little after four in the afternoon, (I think it was on a Tuesday,) I put seven dozen pairs of shoes into a trunk; they were worth 17l. 10s.; the trunk was two feet six inches long - it was a common wooden trunk, covered with leather, such as goods are exported in, and at the bottom was printed W. A. P. and Co. No. 1, that was printed with a brush - I left that trunk in my passage about four o'clock; my outer door was open; I saw it safe after the clock struck five, missed it a few minutes before six, and a little after seven I went with the officers, Duke and Waddington, to the prisoner's house, in a place called the Hole-in-the-Wall, which is a passage near Brooke's-market, Baldwin's-gardens - he was not at home; we found there fifteen pairs of shoes, which were mine, and part of the shoes which I had lost, and which had been in that trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110158"/>have a private mark on them? A. I have - I did not see the prisoner at home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see him, did he not tell you they had been left by a person named Burgess, for him to sell? A. He said he did not know any thing about it; that he was not there - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURGESS. I am a bookbinder, and work at present with Mr. List, No. 4, Prujean-square. On Tuesday evening, the 5th of May, I saw the prisoner - I knew him before; I was sitting in the house of call, the Swan and Sugar Loaf public-house, Fetter-lane - a person came in and asked me whether I would carry a box; that person went by the name of Rushlight Tom, but I have since found his name is Thomas Gall; he asked me at first if I would earn a shilling, and said it was to carry a box for a gentleman - I immediately went out with him down to the bottom of Bartlett's-buildings, and saw Jones standing with the box; it was the best part of a quarter of a mile from Greville-street - the box was as Bird has described it; his is an accurate description, according to the best of my memory, both as to the size, appearance, and every thing: I asked Tom if that was the box, and the prisoner said Yes; I asked Jones whether it was all right, he said Yes. and told me to take it into Chancery-lane; he preceded me - I went into Cursitor-street; he was a few paces before, and went up White's-alley; I took the box to a house in Kingsbury-place, White's-alley - it was Tom's house: I suppose Tom had been walking behind me, as I did not see him till I got to the house: I took the box to the foot of the stairs, and was helped up by one of them up to the second floor - they were both there; when I got up to the second floor, the prisoner Jones paid me 5d., and stated that he would send me the remainder, which was sent; I ought to have had 7d., but 6d. came down in the course of the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the box particularly? A. I was not many minutes with it, so that I did not particularly notice it; I do not know what has become of Tom - I knew him by his frequenting a house I was obliged to wait at while out of employ, as it is a house of call; I did not know his house, but I saw him go into it, and heard afterwards that it it was his - I did not know it before; I cannot say he had not placed the trunk in the prisoner's care while he fetched me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you quarrelled with Mrs. Jones? A.

I never saw any thing of any box at all; these fifteen pairs were brought to me by Burgess and another man who I do not know; I was in a publichouse when Burgess called me out; I saw a man at a short distance with the shoes in his hand - he said he expected a seizure in his house every day, and wished to make some money; I said I did not understand him, but if he would allow me two pairs I would take them to Downes' to ask the value - Burgess said he would be answerable for the whole bundle; I took two pairs and went to Downes' - he said he had no money - I said I merely wanted to know what they were worth - he did not know; I then went to this woman to ask for her brother - he was out; I went home, carried the shoes down, and they are the two pairs found by themselves. <rs id="t18290611-364-verdict1909" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was not the prisoner taken up, and set at liberty? A. That was about a hat; he was taken within half a mile of my house - I had seen him about once after the robbery, two or three months before he was taken, but I was not certain about him.</p>

No; while James was in prison he wished to see me - I went, and he said he would write to his sister, and I should have a sovereign if I would say he only came in to inquire about Tom Bedford, and that I only knew him by his dress; I was tried here myself for this offence- I did not at first know the pork was stolen; I told several people about it before I was taken up - I saw the prisoner two or three times after of an evening, but I did not know where he was to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your motive for coming forward now, because the prisoner would not come, and swear falsely for you and Dearman? A. No; I was never in custody before; Dearman sent the prisoner a letter to come and see him, but I never asked him to come forward - I saw him once at the Cock public-house at Hounslow, and at the King's Arms public-house, about three o'clock in the afternoon - I never saw him at any other place, except of an evening; there was no officer to give him in charge - if they had come for me, when Dearman was here, I should have come and spoken the truth; I know nothing of his having been asked to come forward to swear an alibi.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SAPSWORTH, SEN. My son left my house between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and went to play in the fields with his brother, who is about two years old - he goes to church and to school; he had a dark sealskin cap on when he left home - I was informed his cap was taken; I went into the fields, and he was there crying- the cap has not been found; I am a labourer in the East-India Company's service.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH ROGERS. I am thirteen years old, and live with my parents. If I take an oath, I am bound to tell the truth; I was in the fields, and saw Sapsworth and his brother sitting down - the prisoner knocked him down, took his cap off, and ran across the hill with it.</p>

On the 8th of April, the prisoner, whom I knew, came to our warehouse between five and six o'clock, and asked for Mr. Burbidge; I said he was gone home - there were ten shawls lying in the warehouse they had been marked by me for a particular purpose - he staid about a quarter of an hour, and when he was gone, I missed two; I sent our apprentice after the prisoner - he came back; I asked him to walk in the counting-house, and taxed him with having the two shawls - he denied it; I told him I could not think of his leaving the place till he convinced me he had not got them - he told me had not; I wished him to take off his hat - he asked me the reason of that; I told him from a circumstance which had occurred some time before - he took off his hat, and gave me the two shawls out of it; he promised that he would return the next morning to see one of my employers, and I let him go, but he did not return - I did not see him again till Friday, when he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was be taken at his own house? A. Yes; by Mr. Burbidge - I believe Mr. Burbidge has known him ten or twelve years; I believe some of the female members of their families are related; I was not present at any interview between him and Mr. Burbidge - I know he came there with Mr. Burbidge; I was at the warehouse at the time; he was in the counting-house with Mr. Puzey, perhaps twenty minutes or half an hour - he was then given into custody; I am sure he did not say, "I have not stolen the shawls."</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is the prisoner in the habit of dealing there? A. No; he came backwards and forwards as one of the family.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. PUZEY. Q.Have you had any conversation with any person? A. Yes, Mr. White and another gentleman; I never said if I could have the 40l. I would not prosecute - I said I believed my partner put Wray out of the way; I am satisfied he was very desirous of getting him off - he brought him, and said, "Here is Wall, do what you will with him;" I believe he has lent the prisoner 500l. at a time - he had a good opinion of him.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Spread-Eagle. On the morning of the 23d of April, the prisoner came into the coffee-room, took breakfast, and desired me to get him a ticket-porter to take a note - I got Scott, and he took it; I did not observe where it was directed; when the prisoner went out, he said there would be a parcel or two come in the course of the day, and requested me to take care of them; two parcels came - one I took in, the other the porter would not leave without seeing the gentleman; I gave the parcel I took in to the prisoner: I did not see it opened.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am a constable. I went to the Spread-Eagle on the 23d of April, about half-past four o'clock, by desire of Mr. Devas, with his porter, and was desired to take any person in custody who might apply for the parcel; the porter left the parcel, and I waited till about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, when the prisoner came and asked the waiter if any parcels had been brought for him: he said Yes - one was left, and the other was taken away; the prisoner said, "Get me my tea," but in a minute, he said, "Give me the parcel, and I will take it somewhere;" I did not hear where - I permitted him to take it, and go into the street; I then went to him, asked him if his name was Day - he said Yes, but then recollecting himself, he said, "Not exactly Day; my name is Cannon - I married Mr. Dasy daughter;" I said I had authority to take him into custody- in going to the Mansion-house, he made an attempt to get away - he got a few yards, fell down, and was secured.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LEWIS. I took this parcel to the Spread Eagle; I took it off Mr. Devas' counter in Watling-street, in Mr. Devas' presence - I saw it packed up by a gentleman named Hainson, in Mr. Devas' presence.</p>
               <p>MR. DEVAS. These are the articles I sent packed up in the parcel; I know Mr. Day; he lives at Stansted Mountfitchet, and is a customer of mine. I sent the parcel, with orders that the person should be taken up, because the wafer of the letter was rather wet, which struck me as singular; and it was dated the 22d of March, which was the day before - I did not place any confidence in the letter.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TAYSPILL DAY. I live at Stansted Mountfitchet, about thirty miles from London; the prisoner is not my son-in-law, but he lived servant with me two or three years. I did not write this letter, nor give any body authority to do it.</p>

               <p>- HENSHAW. The landlord of the Coach and Horses public-house, in Bunhill-row, is my brother-in-law. The prisoner was there that day, between half-past six and seven o'clock in the morning; she tendered a gilt 6d., which I would not take; a person followed her in, and said she knew it was bad, and she had offered it at a house opposite: I asked the prisoner why she tendered that when she had money in her pocket; she said, because she owed that person some money - I would not serve her; she said she took it at the Seven Stars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What money did I give you? A. You pulled out a sovereign, and some girl at the bar went out and got change for it, though it was against my wish; I counted it out before this woman, and told her to sound it before she took it away - she was partially intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I changed it when I was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110163"/>liquor.

               <p>WILLIAM QUIN. I am a coal-dealer, and keep a shop in the general line, in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane - I keep a horse and cart. Goodman came to me on Wednesday, the 3d of June, about ten o'clock; he asked if I had a horse and van; I said, "No, I had a horse and two carts;" he asked what I charged an hour; I said 1s. 6d.; he said one of my carts was too small; I said, "I have another, come in and see it;" he said, "That is too large, it is for two sheets of lead, which weigh about 11cwt.;" but he said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, never mind, I am in a hurry;" he got into my cart, and we went on to the bottom of Fleet-street; he then said,</p>
               <p>"We have a job in the City; you go on, and deliver this to Walker and Parker, at Bull-wharf, Thames-street, in Mr. Briggs' name," giving me a letter, sealed up; I could not tell what was inside it: I took it there, and they delivered two sheets of lead into my cart- it weighed 13cwt. 3lbs.; I know nothing of Long.</p>

             CRIPPER. I am a clerk to Messrs. Walker, Parker and Co. I gave directions for the delivery of this lead, in consequence of the receipt of this order, which I believed to be from Messrs. Briggs; it was delivered to me while I was in the office - I do not recollect by whom, but to the best of my knowledge, it was our assistant-warehouseman; it was on Wednesday, the 3d of June, I delivered it to Quin, who gave me his card.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Are you quite sure this is the very identical paper? A. Yes - it has not been in my possession ever since; I made no mark on it, but I feel satisfied it is the same.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Chichester-place, St. Pancras. I know Goodman very well - I saw him and Long coming up Liverpool-street, St. Pancras, with a truck, about half-past two o'clock on Wednesday, the 3d of June - there was one sheet of lead in it; they drew it up to the side of the street, to a house not built, and shot the lead out - Goodman asked me to mind it while they got another; he said they were going to take it to John-street - he pulled off his hat, and wiped his face; I said I would look to it while I was there - they went away together; the constable came in about threequarters of an hour and took the same lead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you known Long before? A. No, but I am sure it was him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NICHOLLS. I am a constable. On the 3d of June I went to Liverpool-street, and saw a sheet of lead - this is a piece of it; I saw Slough there - I shewed the lead to a gentleman who is not here, and to Mount Stephens.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What did you do with it? A. Locked it up in a coach-house; I then took it to Hatton-garden Office.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BRIGGS. Long was in our employ - I believe this note to be his writing; it was not written by my authority.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you seen him write? A. I have seen his writing on a slate - I could not swear I have seen it elsewhere.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you feel confident that it is his writing? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN BLAKE. I am a constable. I took the prisoners in the Northumberland Arms public-house, Bagnigge-wells-road, about half-past five o'clock that day; I said I had suspicion that they were wanted for some lead, I must take them in, and wait for a person who would identify them - they said they had not done any thing, but if I had waited a little longer, perhaps they might have done something; they said they were both out of employ, and had a right to get the best living they could- I do not recollect their saying any thing more; I said if they said they were not guilty, and knew those who were, I would go and take them - Long said he knew nothing of it, and the other said he did not choose to answer the question; I asked where the lead was, and they both said they knew nothing about it - there were two trunks at the door of the Northumberland Arms, which I took on the Friday to Hatton-garden; I asked the prisoners whose they were, and Goodman, I think it was, said he did not choose to tell me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GOODMAN. Q. Did I not say if you would wait you might see the person who employed us? A. No, you said you might have done something.</p>

             STEPHENS. I am a constable. I went to the Northumberland Arms, and assisted in securing the prisoners - there were two trunks in front of the house, which we put in a cow-yard opposite: the name of Elliott, Little Sutton-street, was on one of them - I went to Brick-lane, Old-street, on the Sunday, and found a sheet of lead on Mr. Compton's premises; I took possession of it, and have a piece of it here - there is No. 4184 on it; the reason we took it was, because there was another sheet wanting, and from the marks given at the office we thought this was the sheet described by Mr. Walker's foreman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where are the marks? A.These are them - they are not so plain as when I first saw them; here are other marks on it - here is 25 1/2, 7020 and 20.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS ELLIOTT. I am a Wheelwright, and live at No. 8, Little Sutton-street, Clerkenwell. On Wednesday, the 3d of June, Long came to me, between twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110164"/>and one o'clock, to hire a truck; I asked him what it was for - he said to take some lend from near St. Pancras church to John-street, or John's-lane, I do not knew which; he said he was recommended by Mr. Thomas, and, as I knew him, I lent Long the truck - he never returned it, but I saw it at the Green-yard on the Monday following; the officer told me he had it locked up - my name was on it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where did you get these numbers? A.From the books; I did not put down the number at the time - it was put down by one of the clerks; I did not see it put down - I called out the number, and can recollect them for a day or two.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see the number on the lead, before you put it into the cart? A. Yes; these are the numbers I called out that day, and I am able to say these are the numbers I saw on the lead.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>SECOND COUNT, stating his intent to be to disable or do her some bodily harm.</p>
               <p>LEAH GOODING. I am not in any business. I came to London six years and a half ago, and met with John Perry- we were out-asked in Lambeth church, but we were never married: he is a watchman, and I have been in the habit of going to meet him of a morning when he came off duty, as the doctor said a little morning air would he the best thing I could have for my health. On Sunday morning last I met Perry with the prisoner, whom I had not seen for some time, in the Hampstead-road; it was about half-past five o'clock - I said to Perry, "How is it you keep Waters' company, when I desired you not?" the prisoner gave me a blow on the bonnet, which tore one or two rows off, and gave me a kick on the left hip - I cannot say whether it was with his knee or his shoe; Perry then interfered, and said he could not think how he could behave so when we had acted so kind to him, and he had been as a brother to us - they went wrangling on to the watch-house, and I went in with them; they still wrangled, but I desired Perry to give over and come out, as it was Sabbath morning - he came out with me; when we got to the top of the Mews I saw the prisoner again - I said, "Here is Jem Waters;" we just passed by him, and I said, "Come on," but Perry turned and so did I - words again occurred between us, and I dare say I aggravated him, as I said I should be ashamed of myself to behave in this way, after we had been so good to him - he knocked Perry down; I turned to get him off, and recollect I pulled his hair - he then pulled off his shirt, and said he would fight both of us.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You tore it off me. Witness. No: he tore off his shirt, and he fought right and left with both hands, and gave Perry such a blow as filled his mouth with blood; I turned again and made two or three attempts to strike him; he got quiet, and we passed along Little George-street on to Great George-street - Perry then said to me, "My girl, I have forgotten my key, we cannot get in" - I said, "If you go to the watch-house for it, you and Waters will begin quarrelling again;" and he was afraid he would quarrel with me, so we went back together - as we went down the mews, the prisoner was standing on the right side; I turned and said, "Jem, where are you going?" - he said "To the watch-house;" I said, "We are not going to the watch-house to say anything about you;" he then turned back, and went to some men and two women whom he had been talking to - Perry then went on to the watch-house, and I sat down on the curb - my cough came on, which I am subject to, and I heard Waters say.</p>
               <p>"D-n my eyes and limbs, I will end my own life;" I turned, and saw him coming towards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110165"/>me - I said "Is it me he means to stub?" I looked at him, and thought he did not look natural - he pulled something out of his jacket pocket, and I saw it come to my heart; he said, "D-n your eyes and limbs, I will be hanged for you;" I was no more sensible - I thought I was going into eternity - I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it from your leaving him to go for the key, and his striking you? A. Nine or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.You are very ill, I believe? A.Yes Sir; Perry is not my husband; I have known the prisoner about two years and a half; I do not know whether he has been much given to drink - I had not seen him for some weeks - he had been drinking; he looked not natural; when he came to me he appeared a good deal affected - there had not been a great deal of quarrelling with us; I do not know what length of time had passed - not an hour; it was about six o'clock when this happened - I cannot say how many times I struck him; I did not pull the clothes off his back - I do not know what this blow was indicted with; I thought my time was come and I was thinking more about another world - I had not made use of any foul language, and not a foul word came out of my mouth; I had not called his mother a wh-re; he had before that morning said I was like his old mother; we have had some bickerings together - I summoned him for 10s. which he owned me - I had called him a bastard that morning, perhaps ten minutes before I was struck; I wanted him to tell the Jury that - I did not strike him, nor raise my hand to him when I received the blow; I could not have thought he was going to do it - I had made two or three attempts to strike him because he first struck me - but that was before I sat on the stone; I have had a fright since, which has weakened me a good deal - I suffered more from the fright than I did from the cut; I have been ill three years - I have not been to a surgeon for this cut; I have not been using any unkind expression as to what I would do to the prisoner; I forgive him with all my heart -God is my witness; we were in a public-house on Monday, before we went to the Grand Jury, but I did not speak unkindly of him; I said if the law would forgive him I would - I did not say any thing about hanging - I hope he will not be hung; Mrs. Stephens and another person were at the public-house; I said as my life was preserved, I hoped the Lord would preserve his - I said nothing about his not having means to procure a professional adviser.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I think I understand, that when you sat on the curb there were no words between you? A. No; There had been no words for five minutes between us -Perry had left us to go to the watch-house, and Waters went up the mews to speak to his company; he had spoken to them - I heard him say, "D-n my eyes and limbs I will go and end my own life;" it was before Perry and he fought - I had called him a bastard.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERRY. I was with the witness; we met the prisoner coming off duty, about half-past five o'clock or a quarter to six; something occurred between us and he struck me - Godding asked me why I kept his company, when it was not agreeable to her; she said something to him and he made her an answer, but I did not hear what it was - in going to the watch-house she spoke to him about his ill treatment of us, and he struck her; I stood in my own defence, and he struck me - I said I did not think he would behave so to us - we went down the mews and had some angry words about his striking her; when we got to the watch-house he struck his hand on the table and wished to fight me, but I would not - we came out, he struck me, and I struck him; he knocked me down in the road, and I said "I am ashamed of your striking us, as we have behaved so well to you;" we parted, and I went on to Great James-street - I said to Godding "I have forgotten the key of the street door, I must go back to the watch-house or we cannot get in;" she said "Let me go with you;" the prisoner was at some distance - we were going back, passed him, and left him at the top of the mews; as we were going down, Godding said "I will stop here," and she sat down on the curbstone - while I was in the watch-house she was brought in in a young man's arms.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long have you known the prisoner? A.Near five years; we are both watchmen, and our beats join each other - we had passed the previous evening together and then been on duty; in the morning he and I had a pot of beer together at five o'clock, when we left duty - I had had a small glass of rum, and we had a quartern of gin between us - it was at the New inn - I had the glass of rum before I joined with the prisoner; we went into the New inn together, but I drank my rum at the bar and he was at the door - he must have known I had it; I then had the beer with him - we had the gin at the King's Head public-house at the corner of New-road; I had a pint or porter before I went on duty, at the

               <p>COURT. Q.Did you not hear her call him a bastard? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MEARS. I am a hackney-coach master. I was present when the prisoner and the witnesses were together in Hampstead-road, at a quarter before six o'clock; I heard them quarrel - I saw the prisoner strike Perry; they then walked away, and Perry went back to the mews, with Godding - I saw the prisoner come round the corner from the Hampstead-road, with his hands in his jacket pockets; when Godding saw him coming, she rose from the curb-stone, and leaned against the house - when Perry came nearly opposite her, he pulled his right hand from his pocket, and forced it against her left breast, drew back his hand, and threw a knife down; I ran and caught hold of his right arm - he said, "I know my doom- I shall be hanged at Newgate; I resign myself up to you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Six months; I never quarrelled with him, nor joined in any prosecution for which a man was transported.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was not the prisoner's back to you? A. Yes - I was a good bit off; it seemed to me that she aggravated him very much - she seemed like a woman in a rage.</p>

            . I produce this knife, which was given me by Mears; the prisoner came into the watch-house without a shirt, and looked like a madman.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JAMESON. I went to the watch-house, and found the prisoner in one of the cells: he began by stating that Perrys' wife had called him a rogue, and a rascal, said his mother was a wh-e, and he was a bastard - I said "You had better compose yourself; where is your shirt?" he said they tore it off: I went and consulted about searching him - when I went back to him, he said he had done it, and he should be hanged next Monday week; in going from the watch-house he met Perry, and said to him."Jack, I have killed your wife; I shall be hanged tomorrow week;" he sent me word afterwards that he had a present to make me, if I would come and see him hanged - he afterwards begged me to go for a shirt for him; I went to his sister-in-law - she said she could not get out, as her two children were had with the measles, and I took it him in the evening; he stated that Mrs. Perry was the cause of his not marrying a girl he had kept company with some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What took you to the watch-house? A. I go there for letters and orders for the Commissioners; I am street-keeper - I did not think any harm of speaking to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>LEAH GOODING re-examined. I was stabbed in my left breast, and a little on my arm; he did keep company with a young woman - I know they were asked in church, and I persuaded her to marry him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PARKER. I am a porter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I have known the prisoner six years - he bears a humane character; he got a hurt, and has not been well since - for the last three months he has been drinking more like a madman than any thing else, and when he drinks he is overcome by it; he has, complained of his head and side.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAMPBELL. I am a watchman, and have known the prisoner five years. I and my fellow servant got to the watch-house just before him, and the prosecutrix - I heard her say Perry was with that d-d villain Waters - she ran to him, and struck him repeatedly; he thrust her away with his hand and foot.</p>
               <p>EDWARD TALBOT. I am a watchman. I was going to the watch-house, and saw the prosecutrix strike the prisoner several times; and as she passed me she struck Perry, and said, "You are not a man, for not taking my part."</p>

On the 11th of April, about five o'clock, or a little after, I returned home with a pocketbook and 1/2lb. of tea, tied in a white handkerchief - there was a sovereign, seven half-crowns, some shillings, and 6d. in halfpence, in the pocket-book; the prisoner was at the door, and he began in his foolish way, as he does when he is tipsy - I said, "Let me in;" he played tricks and molested me in the passage, and on the stairs he began violence; it continued till he got up to the landing-place: he then said, "I will have none of your b-y soup; I will have what you have got here;" he began to beat me, and snatched it by violence from me - he had not beaten me before that, only pulled me about; the handkerchief came untied, but I held it, and received more violence than I should have; the door opened, and I threw them on the bed - he got the pocket-book, but the tea went on the bed- I then swooned away: I said nothing more that night. but next morning I went to his room, about five o'clock - he did not appear sober then; I asked him to give me the pocket-book and papers; he said, "I don't recollect, she is not at home; but if you want a few shillings, I can lend them to you;" he cohabited with a woman of the name of Parker - I never got my book or money: he followed me down, and gave me three blows on the back of my neck, he said, "Where is your b-y pocket-book now?" and mentioned such words as I cannot repeat.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house, with two other young men - he came on the 13th of May; he was there two or three nights; the then said he was going to Yorkshire; some of this property was in drawers, and some in a trunk - he slept there on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights. On the Friday evening I put my pocketbook into the trunk, in the room in which he slept, and on the Saturday morning I missed it, when I went to get the money - he had left that morning, and said he was going to Yorkshire, by the steamer, on the Monday morning; he had paid me, but I thought he was coming again on the Saturday night and Sunday, but he did not return: I have only seen the coat since, which had been in the trunk - I lost two pins, a brooch, three coats, four pairs of trousers, and various other articles, and five sovereigns; the value of the whole was 10l. - I have only seen one coat. On Saturday, the 6th of June, I met the prisoner in the Com<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110167"/>mercial-road; I took him by the arm, and said, "You are the thief that robbed me!" he never spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you observe any alteration in my dress? A. No; when he left he put the sixpence on the table, and walked out; I do not know that he spoke to me, nor I to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this coat and the other articles were in the room I slept in? A. I cannot swear that; they were my lodger's clothes.</p>
