            . About four weeks ago, or upwards, the prisoner brought a sattin gown and coat, and desired me to pledge them. I asked him whose property they were; he said they belonged to one Mrs. Gray in Whitechapel: he said she had a great many things in pawn, and she would be glad to sell some to redeem others. The same week he brought a crimson gown and some pieces of silk. I went and sold them, and brought him the money. While I was out selling them, he brought some other things; eight shifts, and a muslin toilet for a table. I could not get the value of them, so I brought him them again. After that he asked me to go out with them again. Then he brought a sack and coat, and set the price five guineas. There were other things he brought also, but I did not sell them; a black bombazeen coat, a callico counterpane, but no linen, a cradle quilt worked in the same manner. I sold the sattin gown and coat to Mr. Everingham: the prisoner and a woman were with me at that time. I sold a small spotted one, and some pieces of silk, to

She said they were none of Mrs. Gray's; then I thought I had been led wrong. I then sent my brother-in-law and others after him, and they brought him to me. I begged of him to tell me whose property they were; he said they were Mrs. Gray's. I said I would go with him to her, and if she said they were her things, I would release him.

I moving from my house in Berwick-street, to Newman-street, near the Middlesex Hospital, I desired her to help me. After she had went a second time, I enquired for the piece of lace: she said I should find it among the things. After that I missed several other things; when I asked her about them, she made slight of them, but at last she owned the fine lace and some ribbons were sent to Chertsey in Surry, to her sister, to be sold. I went the same day to Chertsey, and shewed her sister the hand-writing of the prisoner of the things; then her sister gave me this letter (producing one) which I know to be of the prisoner's hand writing. (It is read in court.)</p>

            . I was in the Hay-market on the 6th of October, and between nine and ten in the evening. There was another woman with me, whom I never saw before. She asked me for a penny: I told her I had none. She sat upon a step of a door, and I sat down by her. As this gentleman went past, the other girl asked him to give her a glass of wine, as she was sitting on the step, and she put her hand towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she touch him?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I cannot say whether she did or did not: I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that for?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I believe it was by way of inducing him to go with her. He went a little further on, and then turned back and struck me a great blow on the side of my face.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I was looking at the girl, and he came unawares to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open-handed, or with his double fist?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. It was with his double fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it hurt you?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. It hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body near you then?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I did not see a creature near me then, except he and the girl. Then I called out.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he go before he returned?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. As near as I can guess, he went about a yard. When I screamed out, three young men came to him: they asked him how he could strike a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say something about your patten?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. Upon my word I did not, nor did I hear it mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say he ought to be clove down with a patten?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the young men say so?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I did not. One of them asked him how he could strike a woman; and they shoved one another against him, and shoved him off the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. This was at the corner of Panton-street. They shoved him off into the Hay-market, into where the coaches go. Then he drawed his knife out of the case and held it in his hand; but I did not see him stab either of them. They cried murder, he has a knife out!</p>
               <p>Q. What was done then?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. The gentleman ran away immediately when they called out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you here them say they were stabbed?</p>

               <p>E. Ward. I did not. They all ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they shove one another against him before he took his knife out, or after?</p>

               <p>E. Ward. They shoved one another against him before he took his knife out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take it out of his pocket?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I saw him take it out of the case. I did not see him take it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that woman with you?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. Upon my word I knew nothing of the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know her before? You are upon your oath.</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her since?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I have not. I asked in the Haymarket, but could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. What size woman was she?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. She was rather shorter than I.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. She had a brown gown on.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180008"/> It appeared to be black. I do not know whether it was brown or black.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been sat down by her, before the gentleman came by?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did she put her hand?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. Towards his breeches; towards his private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think she did or did not touch him?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I believe she did touch him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did the three young men come up?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. In a moment; immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of those young men were you acquainted with before?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I was not acquainted with any of them; only one of them kissed me the night before in the Haymarket. I believe I saw two of them: I remember one of them in particular, because he squinted. *</p>

               <p>* The evidence Clark squinted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see them, or either of them, before?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. Upon my word I never saw them in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the Haymarket did you see them?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. It was by the Orange coffee-house, at the end of the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the other was it that you saw besides he that squinted?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I believe the other was Morgan, he that is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they said - How could you strike a woman? I was it that they shoved the gentleman?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did they shove him?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. It was twice. They shoved one, and then another. They were all close together. They shoved him from off the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you saw the knife in his hand?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. He was then off the pavement in the high-way; I saw the knife in his hand; and then he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run very fast?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. He ran quite fast, about eight or nine doors up Panton-street, the way where he ran into the house, only the house was farther on; then I saw his head over their shoulders turn back. This was when he was gone eight or nine doors up. They all kept to close to him. I believe it was then that the deceased was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow them?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I did, and saw him afterwards go into a shop in Panton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors was that house from the end of the Haymarket?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other house open besides that?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I saw no other open but that: that house was not above two or three doors from Oxendon-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no names called?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. There were no names called by any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, or the other girl, call him French dog, or to that purport?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. No. I remember he called us b - hes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the young men call him such names?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I did not hear them. I was in a flurry. I do not remember they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect you have ever said they did?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I believe I might say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe you then told what was not true?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I never designedly said what was not true.</p>
               <p>Q. Then recollect what you did hear.</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I remember hearing some say buggerer, or some such name. Some of them called him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was it, the other girl, or some of the men?</p>
               <p>E. Ward. I cannot tell whether it was the girl, or one of them.</p>

            . On the 6th of October Mr. Clark and I were coming up the Haymarket. We met Morgan near abouts where the fire was. We drank three pints of beer together, at a house that turns up on the left-hand. We asked Morgan to give us a song; he said he would give us a song, if we would go along with him to a house in Golden-square. We were going along the Haymarket all three together, and just at the corner of Panton-street, coming by, there was a gentleman struck a woman. I saw him strike her on the head. She reeled, and was very near ready to fall. I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180009"/> not know whether it was me that said he was not a gentleman for striking a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman?</p>
               <p>Patman. I did not. I had never spoke to her in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say?</p>
               <p>Patman. The woman cried out. I never heard her mention a word before. She said, You do not behave like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Patman. I never heard him speak a word. The other two men were behind me, and they immediately pushed me against the gentleman. I received a blow from him directly on my left side: the blood ran down into my shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times was you pushed against him?</p>
               <p>Patman. I remember no more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with any great violence?</p>
               <p>Patman. No, none at all. It would not hurt any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the word buggerer mentioned, or something like?</p>
               <p>Patman. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call him names?</p>
               <p>Patman. I did not call him any names at all. I cried out I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the gentleman then?</p>
               <p>Patman. He was just at the corner of Panton-street, off of the Haymarket pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Morgan do to him?</p>
               <p>Patman. I never saw Morgan do any thing. The gentleman made off half way up Panton-street. I did not know he had a knife. Morgan ran after him, to take him, and just by the Hole in the Wall Morgan received a wound. I saw the gentleman strike at him as he was running up Panton-street: he struck him on the side of his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was he when this was done?</p>
               <p>Patman. He was half way up Panton-street, on the right-hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other blows given?</p>
               <p>Patman. I saw none but that. We pursued him, and cried murder. We saw him go into a chandler's shop. I went just by the door. Morgan was lying on the ground, as they told me. I did not see him. I never lifted up a hand against the gentleman, neither did I see any of the others offer to strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any such words as buggerer, or French bugger?</p>
               <p>Patman. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him no offence at all?</p>
               <p>Patman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not pushed against him?</p>
               <p>Patman. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he then?</p>
               <p>Patman. He was off the pavement.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you at the public house?</p>
               <p>Patman. There were Clark, I, and Morgan. We wanted Morgan to sing a song there, but he had been desired by people there before, and he would not sing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you and Clark meet with Morgan?</p>
               <p>Patman. We met with him accidentally in the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Patman. I had seen him some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. How many woman did you see?</p>
               <p>Patman. There were two women sitting on the steps, within two doors of Panton-street, in the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Patman. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Patman. I cannot say whether he did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never declare that Clark and Morgan knew the girl?</p>

               <p>Patman. I knew I was stabbed before.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not you say you did not call out you was stabbed, till after the other man was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Patman. I gave notice directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Morgan attempt to strike him?</p>
               <p>Patman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when Morgan laid hold of him?</p>
               <p>Patman. Just by the Hole in the Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might that be from the place where he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Patman. That was about eight or nine doors distant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see the knife?</p>
               <p>Patman. I never saw it at all. I thought it had been a little pen-knife.</p>

            . I was going up the Haymarket on Friday, the 6th of October, in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock. Patman and Morgan were with me. I saw Mr. Baretti strike a woman. Mr. Morgan pushed me against Patman, and Patman pushed against Mr. Baretti.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a shove with violence?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; it was a slight shove. He did not push me so very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened upon that shove?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not see the knife till they hallooed out they were stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Patman cry out he was stabbed?</p>

               <p>Clark. Yes. The gentleman ran away, and Mr. Morgan went up to him, and he stabbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did Patman say he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. Some time after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after?</p>
               <p>Clark. It might be a minute, or a minute and a half, or two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the moment Patman had been pushed against him, he ran up Panton-street?</p>
               <p>Clark. Not till they both cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Morgan stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. In Panton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether as soon as Patman had been pushed against the gentleman, did they not both go off the pavement upon that push?</p>
               <p>Clark. The gentleman did. I do not know whether Patman did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that, did not the gentleman immediately run up Panton-street?</p>
               <p>Clark. He went on towards Panton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went on for Panton-street before you heard Patman say he was wounded?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the blood upon Patman?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, after he got to the grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell whether it was before or after Patman was stabbed that he ran?</p>
               <p>Clark. I cannot say which was stabbed first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not all run after the gentleman when he ran up Panton-street?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Patman say he was wounded?</p>
               <p>Clark. That was after we had run after the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had not heard him say so before?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you run after him?</p>
               <p>Clark. Because they said he had a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear somebody say they were stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You was sworn before the coroner to tell the truth?</p>

               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you before the coroner swear that Morgan was first stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not know which was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that Morgan was the first person that said he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180011"/>Clark. I did not know who that was. Somebody cried out they were stabbed, but I did not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so before the coroner, and sign to what you said? Have you seen your deposition lately?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I agree with you, you say you do not know which was first stabbed: but did not you swear, and sign before the coroner, that Morgan first said he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said Patman did not know he was stabbed, till he came into Panton-street; and did not you say, when asked, who followed the gentleman, when he was shoved off the pavement?</p>
               <p>Clark. I am not certain; I did not take particular notice who ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not endeavour to recollect before the coroner, when a man's life was almost as much at stake as here? Did not you say then somebody went up and collared the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes I did, it was Morgan: I am not certain who it was, I think it was Morgan: that was after he ran up towards Panton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Morgan when the gentleman stabbed Patman?</p>
               <p>Clark. I believe Morgan then was in Panton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said upon your oath, that Morgan did go up to the gentleman to collar him?</p>

               <p>Clark. That was when he went to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Morgan first say he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Remember, the Jury are to depend upon something where a man's life is at stake. Have not you declared upon oath that Morgan was the first that said he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, sir.</p>

               <p>Q. Have not you said that upon oath before the coroner?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Patman say he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. Patman did not say he was stabbed, till near the grocer's shop, as I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that Morgan knew that Patman had received any injury, when he went up to collar the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Clark. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Morgan go up to collar the gentleman before he knew Patman was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect another thing. What words were made use of on this occasion by the woman?</p>
               <p>Clark. The young woman said, he deserved a knock over his head with her patten. That was after he had struck the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the words, to have his skull cleaved? Did not you make use of the words cut or clove down with her patten?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, it was have a knock with her patten, or words to that effect. I said the same words then, as now.</p>
               <p>Q. After you was examined, was not you called up to the head of the table, and your deposition read deliberately to you? And was not you desired to attend to it? And did not you sign your name to it, and declare the whole to be truth?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the gentleman called any names?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Wyatt, the surgeon at the hospital, he was called French bugger, or French woman-hater, or words of that sort?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to this

            . I have endeavoured to collect all the evidence together, at a great deal of trouble and pains, and when I had so done, I gave it the prosecutor's sollicitor to make what use of it he pleased. I am a tallow-chandler, and was then a constable. On the 6th of this instant October, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was sat down to supper, when I heard the cry of murderer, or stop murderer, which alarmed me a good deal. I got to my door, and observed the prisoner and two or three men pursuing him: he ran into a grocer's shop just opposite to me. Patman was standing at the door when I went over. He was unbuttoned, and there was blood running down; I observed it through his shirt. I asked him what was the matter; he said he was stabbed by that gentleman, who was then in the shop, and had a knife in his hand. The silver case on it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180012"/> bloody. He had a green shagreen case in the other hand. I said, Sir, I beg you will surrender. One or two of my neighbours came in; he said, Are you friends? I said Yes, we were, and would protect him. By that time a mob was gathered about the door, being between nine and ten. He endeavoured to put the knife in the shagreen case, and I believe he would have done it, if I had given him time. I not knowing who, or what he was, I thought it best to secure him. Immediately I sprang to him, seized him by the collar, and took the knife and knocked it against a tea-chest to force it in; it was not quite in; and bent the point of it as it is now. ( Produced in court, in a silver case over the blade.) I did propose carrying him to the round-house, but Sir

            . I was a patient in Middlesex hospital when Morgan was there. I asked him how he received his wounds; he said he received them in Panton-street, near the Haymarket; that he and two men were going along, and they saw a gentleman strike a woman; and one of them said he was no man for abusing a woman in that manner; that the deceased being in the middle, they shoved against the gentleman, and he stabbed the next man to him: the man cried, I am stabbed, and he made after him; and when he overtook him, he stabbed him in two places, turned round a third time, and stabbed him again, which hurt him worse than the two first.</p>

            . I am a surgeon at the Middlesex hospital. Morgan the deceased was brought in there. He had received three wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you apprehend that each of these three wounds might occasion his death?</p>
               <p>Wyatt. That wound received in his abdomen was the occasion of his death. Wounds in the lungs do sometimes prove mortal, and sometimes not. After I had seen the deceased, I was going through the hall, when the porter stopped me, and told me there was the other man that had been wounded: I turned to him; there was Patman and Clark with him. I asked them how the affair happened. Clark began to tell his story. He said they were coming up the Haymarket; they had drank some beer; where they saw a gentleman abusing a lady, who was an acquaintance of the gentleman's up stairs (meaning Morgan.) These were the very words as near as I can recollect. I kept those words in my mind, because I thought there was something extraordinary, not only in the manner of the man's expressing himself, but in the matter. I let him go on. I believe I asked him what provocation had been given to the gentleman; he said none, only pushing upon him. I asked how that was: he replied in these words, The gentleman up stairs pushed me against that gentleman (pointing to Patman) and I pushed him upon the gentleman (meaning Mr. Baretti.) I asked who it was that struck the gentleman. (I had not heard that any body had, but I thought it probable.) They said they only pushed him. I asked him what provocation the girl had given him; he said he believed she had d - d him for a French bugger, and said he ought to have his head clove with a patten; but, said he, I saw no patten. Clove, or cut down, it was one of those expressions. Then the patients and pupils in the hall were collecting about us. I took him out of the hall into the board room, and said to Clark, This woman was an acquaintance of yours: he said no. Then I said, Probably I made a mistake, she was an acquaintance of the gentleman's up stairs: he then said, No, not at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180013"/> all. Then the gentleman with me said, You rascal, you said so, not two minutes ago. But he then denied it: after that, I did not ask him any other question.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Baretti, the evidence is now gone through that they have produced against you, in regard to the crime of which you stand charged. It is now your time, if you chuse to say any thing in your own defence, or if you think proper, you may leave it to your counsel to call witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baretti. I have wrote something concerning this accident. I do not know whether it is proper for me to read it.</p>
               <p>Court. You certainly may be permitted to speak or read any thing you have wrote. I suppose you mean it as a history of the fact?</p>
               <p>Mr. Baretti. Yes.</p>
               <p>He read to this purport:</p>
               <p>On Friday, the 6th, I spent the whole day at home correcting my Italian and English Dictionary, which is actually reprinting and working off, and upon another book in four volumes, which is to be published in February next, and has been advertised in the News-papers. I went a little after four to the club of Royal Academicians in Soho, where I stopped about half an hour waiting for my friends, and warming myself in the club-room. Upon nobody's coming, I went to the Orange coffee-house, to see if a letter was come for me, for my letters come there, but there was none. I went back to go to the club, and going hastily up the Haymarket, there was a woman at a door; they say there were two, but I took notice of but one, as I hope God will save me: there might have been two, though I only saw one: that is a fact. There was a woman eight or ten yards from the corner of Panton street, and she clapped her hands with such violence about my private parts, that it gave me great pain. This I instantly resented, by giving her a blow on the hand, with a few angry words. The woman got up directly, raised her voice, and finding by my pronunciation I was a foreigner, she called me several bad names in a most consumelious strain; among which, French bugger, d -

            , and a woman-hater, were the most audible. I had not quite turned the corner, before a man made me turn back, by giving me a blow with his fist, and asking me how I dare strike a woman; another pushed him against me, and pushed me off the pavement; then three or four more joined them. I wonder I did not fall from the high step which is there. The path-way is much raised from the coach-way. A great number of people surrounded me presently, many beating me, and all d - ning me on every side, in a most frightful manner. I was a Frenchman in their opinion, which made me apprehensive I must expect no favour nor protection, but all outrage and blows. There is generally a great puddle in the corner of Panton-street, even when the weather is fine; but that day it had rained incessantly, which made it very slippery. I could plainly perceive my assailants wanted to throw me into the puddle, where I might be trampled on; so I cried out murder. There was a space in the circle, from whence I ran into Panton-street, and endeavoured to get into the foot-way. I was in the greatest horror, left I should run against some stones, as I have such bad eyes. I could not run so fast as my pursuers, so that they were upon me, continually beating and pushing me. Some of them attempting to catch me by the hair-tail: if this had happened, I had been certainly a lost man. I cannot absolutely six the time and place where I first struck: I remember, somewhere in Panton-street, I gave a quick blow to one who beat off my hat with his fist. When I was in Oxendon-street, fifteen or sixteen yards from the Haymarket, I stopped and faced about. My confusion was great, and seeing a shop open, I ran into it for protection, quite spent with fatigue. I am certainly sorry for the man, but he owed his death to his own daring impetuosity. Three men came into the shop, one of them cried to me to surrender myself to him, who was constable. I asked them if they were honest men, and friends; they said, Yes. I put up my knife, desired them to arrest me, begged they would send for a coach, and take me to Sir

            's; and the constable was the first who took notice of a blow I had received on my chin. But when the heat and fear had subsided, I found a great pain in divers parts of my body. Mr. Molini and Mr. Low being with me, desired me to let them see what was the matter with my back, which I had complained of, I stripped, and they saw several bruises. - This, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, is the best account I can give of my unfortunate accident; for what is done in two or three minutes, in fear and terror, is not to be minutely described; and the Court and the Jury are to judge. I hope your Lordship, and every person present, will think that a man of my age, character, and way of life, would not spontaneously quit my pen, to engage in an outrageous insult. I hope it will easily be conceived, that a man almost blind could not but be seized with terror, on such a sudden attack as this. I hope it will be seen, that my knife was neither a weapon of offence or defence: I wear it to carve fruit and sweetmeats, and not to kill my fellow-creature. It is a general custom in France, not to put knives upon the table, so that even ladies wear them in their pockets for general use. I have continued to wear it after my return, because I have found it occasionally convenient. Little did I think such an event would ever have happened. - Let this trial turn out as favourable as my innocence may deserve, still my regret will endure as long as life shall last. A man who has lived full fifty years, and spent most of that time in a studious manner, I hope, will not be supposed to have voluntarily engaged in so desperate an affair. I beg leave, My Lord and Gentlemen, to add one thing more. Equally confident of my own innocence, and English discernment to trace out truth, I did resolve to wave the privilege granted to foreigners by the laws of this kingdom: nor was my motive a compliment to this nation; my motive was my life and honour; that it should not be tho ught I received undeserved favour from a Jury part my own country. I chose to be tried by a Jury of this country; for if my honour is not saved, I cannot much wish for the preservation of my life. I will wait for the determination of this awful Court with that confidence, I hope, which innocence has a right to obtain. So God bless you all.</p>

            , at Brocket-Hall. I had been in the country, and came to town the day before this happened. I went this day to see a person that was ill of a fore throat. I staid and supped with her, and going home, I came through Leicester-Fields. I was on the left side of the way in the first Panton-street, (there are two Panton-streets ) where I saw a shop open. As I went on (I had my child in my arms) I saw a croud of people at the end of the street by the Haymarket. I also saw a gentleman run from among them on the side of the way I was. I stood still. My child asked me to go home. Whether the gentleman stopped, or they stopped him at the Hole in the Wall, I cannot tell: they all ran after him: they were all in a great bustle: I saw but one woman among them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you think there were of them?</p>
               <p>A. Thomas. There might be eight, or ten, or a dozen. I did not think of being called in question about it. I was about facing him when he stopped. I saw him turn upon them. He was in the midst of them. I saw him run from them again, towards the other passage; and when they ran again, I heard the cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard that cry before?</p>
               <p>A. Thomas. I had not. I was much frighted. I and my child wentforward, towards the grocer's shop. I asked a person to take hold of my child, that I might go and see who it was. The person was not willing, so I went on towards home. I never saw the gentleman in my life before.</p>

            . I am acquainted with Mr. Baretti. I dined with him to-morrow will be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180015"/> a fortnight ago, the day after the affair happened. As he was complaining of pain in his body, I desired him to strip, that we might see. In looking on his back, I observed a bruise under his shoulder, on the left side, and another a little lower, on the other side his back; I also saw a swelling on his right cheek, and a scratch on the right side. Two of the bruises were very visible. His jaw was swelled, and there was a little scratch on the same side. There were two other gentlemen present at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this knife here produced. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Molini. I have seen such knives as these before; they are used by almost every body. It is usual to carry them in pockets. Ladies use them to peel fruit, and eat sweetmeats, abroad. It is not common, as here, to put knives on the table. The outside is silver, and the inside steel, to cut a little bit of bread with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Low. I am acquainted with Mr. Baretti; I visited him in Tothillfields-Bridewell. On Saturday, the 7th of this instant, a gentleman came and told me of the affair. I went about three, and asked him how he did; how he found himself: he said, I can scarce tell you; my mind is in a very bad situation, and I have bruises on my body. I said, You had better shew them before they go off. I lifted up his shirt, after his coat and waistcoat were off, and saw six or seven bruises on his body. The most remarkable was upon his blade-bone. There was one on his hip, and another on his side, which seemed as if the skin was a little off.</p>

               <p>Justice Kelynge. I once was coming from a relation of mine down Panton-street, when a woman took hold of me, and endeavoured to put her hand into my breeches. I immediately sprung away. I was going to knock her down, when two men came up to me. I called out watch! watch! very loud, but no watch came, though they were very near. A gentleman, a major, crossed the way to me, and then they all ran away. It is a common case there, I am sorry to say it, notwithstanding all the care we take. Here is another brother magistrate in court, that has been attacked in the same manner: there is seldom a woman that attacks a man, but they have two or three men behind them, ready to pick your pocket, or to knock you down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Perrin. It is impossible to walk up the Haymarket in the evening, or night, but you will meet with women the most indecent, the most abandoned wretches, that ever I saw, and they have often men following them.

He did me all the civility he could do to a stranger, as indeed he did so to every Englishman that came in the course of my acquaintance with him.

On the 16th of September, a little after nine in the evening, she had first shut in the shop, and was shutting the door, when she screamed out thieves! Mrs. Perry being nearer the stairs than I she went down. I went down when the people were gone from about the door. I saw my show-glass was broke, and five of my watches were taken away, all silver. One of them was a new skeleton one, which opens at the back, and shows all the work. I never recovered any of them again. The prisoner was taken, and brought in: his hand was cut and very bloody, done, I suppose, by breaking the glass. I had been gone out of the shop about ten minutes, the watches were there when I left it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Perry. I had just put the shutter on the door, and shut it, when a man pushed the door open, and asked me if my master was at home. I said he was. He came in, and another came in sideways. The first that came in said, I need not call my master. He held a pistol to me, and bid me not to speak a word. The other kept his face towards the show-glass. When my mistress came down, the man left me, and went and held the pistol to her. The other man smashed the glass, and they soon made their escape out of the shop. As soon as I recovered myself, I went up stairs. I should know the first that came in, could I see him; but the other kept his back towards me all the time. By the prisoner's dress, and his size, he resembles that man. They had both blue coats on. The prisoner was brought into the shop in less than three minutes, I believe. He kept his hands in his bosom all the time he was in the shop, which was the best part of an hour.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Perry.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180018"/> The-clock had just gone nine. I was standing at the door, and saw the prisoner and another man loitering about our window-shutters. I saw the other man go into the prosecutor's shop, and the prisoner follow him. In a minute or two I heard a glass smash, and heard the cry, Stop thieves and robbers! by Mrs. Perry and her servant. I saw the two men run out: the prisoner was the last. One ran down Holborn, and the prisoner ran down Leather-lane. I pursued him. He was not got above thirty yards from Mr. Perry's shop, before I laid hold of him: he was never out of my sight. The street at that time was very clear. He was running as hard as he could. When I laid hold of him, he struggled several times to get away, till assistance came up. I am sure he is the man that I saw at our door, and went in last, and out last, at Mr. Perry's door.</p>
               <p>John Green. I am constable. I saw this young man bringing the prisoner back again. He said, Green, you must take charge of this man. I took him into Mr. Perry's house. The mob was so very great, I could not examine him there, so I took him into my own room, which is just by. I found nothing upon him. I observed from two or three of his fingers the blood run down. I said, If you are innocent of this affair, how came your fingers cut? He said the man took hold of him, ran him up against the wall, and rubbed the skin off. I looked at them. There were four, five, or six different places, all fresh done. It was his right hand. Here is a pistol, (produced in court) which was found loaded about four yards from the place where he was taken.</p>

            . I live close by the prosecutor, and having heard there was a pistol presented to the girl, I asked the young man that took the prisoner, where was the place he took him; he went and shewed me, and about a yard or two from the place, where he shewed me, I picked up this pistol. It lay up against a dead wall.</p>

I was coming from an acquaintance, and going along I observed a crowd about the door: they called, Stop thief! I turned round, and was immediately seized by the collar. I asked what he accused me with. He told me for robbing the shop. Then I went back with him.</p>

            . I live in Marybone, and am a lamp-lighter. On the 14th of last Month, between one and two in the day, I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw a mob running. There was Mrs. Jones pursuing the prisoner. A gentleman catched the prisoner by the collar and held him. He was brought to Mr. Jones's house. I saw the prisoner take this watch out of his right-hand pocket and put it behind the door in a chair. (Produced in court.)</p>

I was obliged to pay six-pence a week to these people the cutters for each loom, that is, three shillings and six-pence a week. I was ordered to send it to the house where they used, by which means I thought myself safe. About the beginning of August, I believe it was between the 7th and 9th, about half an hour after eleven at night, there came a great body of them to the door. I was in my bed. They rapped and tore at my door with a gross voice, You b - h of a w - e! You son of a w - e! Let us in, or we will cut down your door. My wife desired me to lie still, and said they would be more merciful to a woman than a man. She was obliged to open the door in her shift. They came in, and made a great noise. I got up after they got into the shop, and looked out of my chamber and heard the weight stones fall about the house. After they had done there, and was looking out, I saw a great number of them. I saw the two prisoners among them. They came and shook hands with my wife. I knew them before. The shop is thirty-six feet long. I saw them by the light of the window. I had no candle. That they would have put out first, if I had had one.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they in their hands?</p>
               <p>Poor. I saw nothing in their hands. When they went away, after they got down into the alley, they said, Are you all out? Then they fired a shot, and quitted the place. Then I struck a light and went into the shop. They had cut the cane. There was a piece of silk in the loom, they cut it, and cut the rest of the things; and bent the reed double, and twisted it like a worm. They destroyed the silk, and the tackling of the loom. I have gone to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180023"/> committee at the Duke of Northumberland's Head where they held it. I did not see the prisoners there before. I have seen them at the committee since. I have been there three or four times, begging my life of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you fix upon any time when you went?</p>
               <p>Poor. No, I cannot. They came a second time, on the last day of August, and cut all my goods again.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners among them?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to the prisoners about the mischief done you?</p>
               <p>Poor. No, I never did. One night Valline was at the Pewter-platter, (that was after we were cut) and he desired to have the money given to him. I used to carry my money at six-pence a week, and I continued to pay it after I was cut. I said to Valline, You shall not have a penny of it. He offered to give me a receipt for it. After this mischief was done, we continued to dwell in the house by day, but very little by night.</p>
               <p>Q. What silk did they cut?</p>
               <p>Poor. It was a bombazeen cane.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a cane?</p>
               <p>Poor. That is a piece. A cane is the silk, put in the reed to work. There was about a yard of it made, which was all cut.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by weight stones?</p>
               <p>Poor. They are to keep it tight. The reed is all steel. They cut that.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were the looms?</p>
               <p>Poor. They were my property. The silk was the property of Mr. Horton.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they your consent to destroy the looms?</p>
               <p>Poor. They had not. I knew nothing of their coming: I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this injury done?</p>
               <p>Poor. I think it was about half an hour after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them came in?</p>
               <p>Poor. There were I believe five or six of them. They went out one after another. I was in a great flurry, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of them masked?</p>
               <p>Poor. No, none, as I saw. I know the whole of the other people very well. I know their names. If they were to alter their voice, I should know them by their voice. I have known them these four years. We were forced to give money to them, in regard to the Defiance, as they called themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see neither of the prisoners up in the committee-room?</p>
               <p>Poor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make information in regard to these people?</p>
               <p>Poor. Three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to make it sooner?</p>
               <p>Poor. If I had, I should have been in danger of being shot like a dog in the street.</p>

            . In the month of August, I cannot tell the day of the month; I remember the night very well; I live up in a long alley; we were between sleeping and waking, and my husband said, Here are the cutters. I said, Make your self easy. I was told they would not meddle with me, and they might hurt him. They came to the door and cut at it with their swords, or what they had in their hands. They were cutting and hacking. I got up, and said, Gentlemen, don't cut the door; let me put my petticoat on, and I'll let you in. They still kept cutting. I went and opened the door. The first man that entered my door was

            , with a pistol in one hand, and a sword in the other. There were seven of them came in. I pushed the sword from my stomach, that D'Oyle held. The other went up to the room. They said, Get out, you old w - e; get out of the shop. I said, You know I know you all very well, I will not go out. I was in my shift all the time. Valline cut the work, the property of Mr. Horton; and D'Oyle had a pistol standing along side me at the time. D'Oyle was a neighbour of mine; he lived within three doors of me. I said to Valline, You are known in this alley, why do you come here? I am sure they were there, as I am sure I am alive. Valline came into my own bed-chamber, and shook hands with me. He asked for Mr. Horton's shoot. I said I had none (this was at their first coming). They said I lied, like an old w - e.</p>

               <p>Poor. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>D'Oyle's defence.</p>
               <p>This woman knew me, and had seen me often the very afternoon before I was taken. I met that wicked woman, and a man stopped me to tell me she had served a warrant upon a relation or friend of her's. I then did say a b - h of a w - e. She heard me. She began to call us a parcel of thieves, robbers, and cutters. I took a warrant for her, and had her before the justice. She wanted a warrant against me, but the justice would not grant one. I never was in her house before I was taken up, neither was I there with this man that night, (meaning Valline). He was a tenant of mine. I am in the whole silk way. I had worked for no body for four weeks. When the justice committed me, he said he believed she was a bad woman, for he had her here too often. If I was to be out of wor twelve months, I could live by my wife's business. She is a hair-sieve-maker.</p>
               <p>Valline's defence.</p>
               <p>Poor said I offered to give him a receipt at the Pewter-Platter for the money, and I can neither write nor read. She has said I got three or four guineas, by cutting. If that was true, I never should have gone for a militia man. I entered the 14th of April last. I can give an account how I get my living. I worked for Mr. Ham. I got between fifteen and sixteen shillings a week. The militia were drawn out the 19th of September last. I have had thirty-eight shillings and six-pence of my sister since I have been out of work.</p>

             I heard people come in. I did not see them. I covered myself up with the bed-clothes, fearing they would do me an injury. In about a quarter of an hour after they were gone, I saw it was impossible for me or any body else to distinguish any man, it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been asleep?</p>
               <p>Riley. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Mr. Poor said he could distinguish them from his room door.</p>
               <p>Riley. I could not do it that was in the shop. In the shop there is a window five yards long.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the two prisoners?</p>
               <p>Riley. I have seen both the gentlemen, but my acquaintance with them is but slender. I have known Valline about four months. I have not been much longer from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Why could you not perceive them?</p>
               <p>Riley. Because I did not make it my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear stones fall from the looms?</p>
               <p>Riley. Upon my word I do not remember any thing in particular. There were a great many bricks made use of instead of stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mrs. Poor's voice?</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180025"/>Riley. I know it extraordinary well. I heard it that night before she came out of her own room, and I heard her when in the shop. She was close to my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear her say that night?</p>
               <p>Riley. She said, Wait a little, and you shall have admittance; so she got up in her shift, and opened the door, and they came in. They asked if there was any work of Mr. Horton's in the house; she said there is one loom, which was just at the door they came in at. They went to the other side, and stood by another loom and asked whose work that was; she replied it was Thompson's. Then they said they would cut none of Thompson's work that night. A man then past me, and went to a loom where her husband worked, and said, Whose work is this? The woman was storied: I suppose she wanted to say some other master; but the little boy being rather wittier than she, said it was Champion's. They said they would cut none of Champion's work that night</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear her desire mercy?</p>
               <p>Riley. I heard her say a great many things, which I cannot recollect. I am lately come out of a fit of illness, and am deprived of a great part of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say anything about putting in her petticoat?</p>
               <p>Riley. I do not recollect it. I am sure and certain she did not call any body there by the name of D'Oyle, she mentioned the name of a man that put his arm round her, and wanted a kiss.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear D'Oyle's voice?</p>
               <p>Riley. I do not know the voice of D'Oyle. I believe I could distinguish Valline's voice in company. I could not distinguish any body's voice that night, upon the virtue of my oath. I had no suspicion of either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see D'Oyle before this happened?</p>
               <p>Riley. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at any of the committees at the Duk of Northumberland's Head?</p>
               <p>Riley. I have no connections with them. I never heard Mrs. Poor mention D'Oyle's name, either before or after. The work that was cut was M. Horton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any that were there?</p>
               <p>Riley. Upon the virtue of my oath, I know none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Mrs. Poor mention Valline's name?</p>
               <p>Riley. I have heard her say that gentleman did belong to them, but not that he cut the work in her apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she mean by belonging to them?</p>
               <p>Riley. She might mean that he transacted in both businesses, that is, cutting, and the committee also.</p>

            . I have heard Mrs. Poor talk of this transaction. I heard her say she knew the men in particular, but did not hear her say who they were. I never heard her mention the name D'Oyle. She said there were some of her friends there, and no body there that would hurt her.</p>

               <p>Donavan. I lodge in Poor's house. This thing was transacted on the 8th of August, and she remained in her house till the 31st, when she told me in the afternoon she was going to Limehouse, and would leave the journeymen to take care of the house. Some people came and broke some chairs and things in the house that night.</p>

I found the sash wide open, but cannot tell whether it was fast over night, tho' I am positive sure the door was shut when we went to bed. I stood sentinel till he got assistance. After the prisoners were secured, I went down into the area. I found they had forced the sash of the door in the wash-house that looks into the area. I found a two-inch chissel lying about three feet within the wash-house. I went round to the fore-part of the area, and there I found the hinges of the outside shutter wrenched off, but the window-shutter on the inside they had not got open.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going my rounds, about a quarter after two that night, and saw a fire. I went to alarm the turncock. I also saw these four men that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180027"/> are at the bar. I past them, and went up Wells-street. I saw them all look at me. I then went to my watch-box. After that I went again, to see if I could see them. I perceived two of them. I laid my head down against the kerb of some rails, and saw two go down the prosecutor's area. I saw Wood, but not down, for he seeing me when I was coming, he went round, and returned back again. I went, and took hold of him. He asked me what I wanted with him. He said he was going to see the fire. I asked him where his companions were. I brought him towards Mr. Cockran's, and there came

             to my assistance. I gave Wood into his charge, while I went for other assistance. But I was afraid he would get away, for then the rest might get away also. Then I went back, and put him down among the rest in the area. I then went and rung my rattle, and more assistance came. Then I alarmed with my staff at Mr. Cockran's window-shutters, he came down, and we took the four prisoners, one at a time, as they came up. I saw none of them any farther than the area. There was a window I found open, which was not open when the servants went to bed. We could see fresh feet marks in the wash-house, but know not by whom made, and there was a door betwixt the wash-house and the house, so that they could get no farther; then they made to the right side of the house, and had drawn out the nails of the hinges of the shutter.</p>

There was another man in company with him; he had a piece of black silk, or crape, over his face. I delivered to the prisoner eighteen-pence. I told him I was but a servant, and had not a great deal of money. The other man discovered my watch; he said I had a watch. The prisoner took it out of my pocket. I held up my waistcoat, to give him room to get it out, as there was a button to my breeches. He said if I made any resistance, he would blow my brains out. He took also a five-and-three-penny piece from me. When they left me, I believe I gave notice to about a dozen of the patrol upon the road of them. I got home about nine o'clock.

They then began to swear, and said if I would not, They would break it open. This was Cavalier that blasted and swore he would break it open. They insisted upon my going along with them.

My husband had four looms in the house; the cutters went into the room, and cut the four looms to pieces. I saw two of the men upon the stairs; they spoke to me: he that is called captain came into my bed-chamber, and demanded my money. Perrin came up with them. I saw Cavalier and Read upon the stairs. I knew them before. Read taught my husband and daughter the weaving business. There was no work in any of the looms; after it had been cut out the first time, we used, as soon as a piece was made, to take it out. There was no trimming work in the looms. I do not know but there was trimming work lying in the room. They totally destroyed the four looms.</p>

             the younger. My father is a weaver. I know the prisoners at the bar. In the beginning of January, 1768, about one in the morning,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180031"/> on the 4th, they came to my father's house at Stepney, and knocked at the door; I went out of my bed in my shift and opened the casement, and asked who was there; they asked for Mr. Clare, and told me to come down and open the door, or they would blow my brains out. I said to my mother, There are some cutters come to destroy us again, (my father was in the country.) I told them I would come down, as soon as I had put my clothes on. They said they would fire at the window directly, if I did not come down immediately. I went and opened the door: one of them took hold of my hand, and desired me to lead him to the shop door. I did, and told him there was the shop, and every thing belonging to the weaving trade. I begged of them to spare my life, and my mother and children. They asked where my father was; I said in the country. Perrin knocked at the chamber door; he said, Open the door directly. They wanted a knife. I went down on my knees, and begged my life. They said they did not want my life, they wanted a knife. I said I must go down two pair of stairs for one. They said, if I went directly, I should not be hurt. I went down. The moon shone very bright, and it was a very deep snow. They had no other light with them. I turned round at the door, thinking I should know some of them. I went to the table-drawer, and took out a knife. They snatched it from me. I then asked if I might go up stairs; they said, Not till they pleased. I could not tell what to do. I stood at one corner of the room till they ordered me to go up. It was very cold. I asked them if I might go up to bed; they said, Yes. I saw Perrin and another in the shop, cutting the looms to pieces. Cavalier was below stairs, and who else I do not know. I cannot tell who the other persons were. I went up stairs, and walked about the room. They came up stairs, and knocked at the door again. I asked what they wanted? They said they wanted money. Who that was, I cannot say. They said they must have something to drink. One came into the bed-room, and said, Mrs. Clare, I must have some money to drink your health. My mother said, How can you expect any money, when you distress me in this manner? I said, Mother you have a shilling in your pocket, let me give them that. I gave it into a man's hand. I do not know who he was. I said, Here is all we have in the world, except three farthings. The man said, I am sorry for it, a good morning to you, and down stairs they went. They called when they were out at the window for me to come down, to come and take my father's books and writings that they had thrown into the snow. I said I could come and fetch them when they were gone. They kept making a noise, and staid about an hour; They made me come down. As I came down I saw a man. I called to them to take that man to them. The man that asked for the shilling said, if it was not true, he would blow my brains out. Every thing was broke in the house like an earthen-ware shop. I believe they had a guard at the door at the time. They cut all the four looms, and every thing, all to pieces, and took some things away. There was no silk in the looms, neither were any silk trimmings cut.</p>

I left him in the house alone, while I went to Snow-Hill on an errand. I was absent not a quarter of an hour. When I returned, he met me on the top of the stairs, and said he must go, and away he went. I went to iron three shirts in the morning, and found them gone, and two pair of cotton stockings. The next morning he was taken up, and confessed two of the shirts and one pair of stockings were at his mother's. When I came there, there was only one shirt and one pair of stockings. He had one shirt on when taken. (Two shirts and one pair of stockings produced in court, and deposed to.) He served four years of his time with my husband.</p>

I saw her as she was taking it away, and felt her hand in my pocket. She got it out. I grappled about her, to see if I could find it.

            . I was the constable. In searching the prisoner, I found a silver watch concealed in her stocking, near her shoe; it was going, and near the time about eight o'clock. She said a man gave it her for lying with her.</p>

               <p>We went into that house to have a pint of beer, and there came three men in. This man forced his discourse to a little girl that sat by me. He went out, and she followed him. She asked me to go with her. He lay with her. I stood about ten yards distant. After that he said he was robbed by that girl, and he squeezed the money out of her mouth. I never set eyes on the money.</p>

            . I belong to the printing office at Chelmsford. I come up every Wednesday, and go down every Thursday, for news. I was coming from Whitechapel, on the 5th of October, instant, to go to Mr. Bedford's, in St. Paul's church-yard. I met with a man in Cheapside; he said, Pray what part of the country do you come from? I said, Why do you ask? He said, he had an uncle, that lived in London, who had a servant gone away who had stole a mare, and he would be very glad of a person that would carry bills into the country of the mare. I gave but little heed to it. He asked me where I was going; I said but a little farther, to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180033"/> Bedford's, in St. Paul's alley, by the church yard. He said, I'll go along with you. He went with me, and called for a pint of purl. When I had delivered up my bags, I asked him where his uncle lived; he said he often was in Smithfield, and there was a house he used near there, and perhaps we might meet with him there. I went at his desire with him into Smithfield, then through a little place to the sign of the Blue Coat Boy. He looked at the dial, and said, It is very often about this time he comes into this house. I saw nobody at all. He ordered a pint of purl, and it was brought in. I do not know whether we had drank or no, when in came a man dressed in black. He seemed to be in liquor. Then in a minute in came another man. They began discoursing with each other. They talked of some fray the man that seemed to be in liquor had been in. Sir, said the man to one of the others, I am obliged to you for bringing me here, and taking care of me, will you please to drink any thing? What you desire to drink, you shall have. They were saying, this man that was in liquor had a man took him in for 10 l. I think they said it was by a butcher. Then the man that was with me asked him which way it was done; they said it was in this, that he could not name three things. The man with me replied to him, No, nor no more can you, and he would lay him a shilling he could not. They laid, he won the shilling. Then the man that appeared drunk pulled out a large purse, and said, Though I have been taken in, I have got so much left still, and I have so much more to receive. The man along with me wanted me to go his halves, or to lend him some money. I told him I would have no concern in it at all. I wanted to go away; I put my hand into my pocket, to take out some halfpence, to pay for the beer. My gold was wrapped up in paper. I could not get my half-pence out, without taking that out. The man said, D - n it, you said you had got no money. You have plenty of money. (There were four guineas, and four half guineas in one paper, and three half guineas in another, all wrapped up in one paper.) I got up directly, and said I want to know the reason why he took it out of my hand; he said, D - n you, hold your tongue; I'll double your money; you shall not lose your money. I said, Don't pretend to take it; I'll have my money. I'll have nothing to do to play. The others went on in the scheme they were about; they past my money over from one to the other. The time I was talking to him, he delivered it to one of the others, and he got it in his hat, and before I could say a very few words, they said it was lost. It was received by the prisoner. I saw it in his hands last, and there was one half guinea found upon him that I swore to. The prisoner is the man that was in black, and who seemed to be fuddled. At the time I was disputing with him for it, the other men got away. I called for help. I believe a woman came to the door first; after some time a constable came. Just before the constable came to the door, the prisoner did not know what to do with his purse that he had in his pocket. I saw him conceal it under the seat where he sat. I said to the constable, He has a purse concealed under such a place, see what it is. The prisoner hearing me say so, took up the purse, and put it in his pocket. He was asked whose purse it was; he said it was his own. Before he went out of the house, he asked leave to go to the necessary house. The constable let him. We did not miss the purse till we came before my lord mayor. We found upon him three half guineas, and two watches. The constable was ordered to go to search the necessary. I went with him. We found in it a purse; we counted the pieces. They were all yellow counters. He pretended to be a captain, and said he had taken some money on board a ship. When the prisoner took my money out of the hat, there were something fell on the floor, but I was in such confusion, I do not know what it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took the money out of your hand?</p>
               <p>Ellison. The person that went in with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from the time he took it out of your hand to the time they said it was lost?</p>
               <p>Ellison. I do not know that it was a minute. There were four people met me at a house where I used, and offered me my money again, and to pay the 20 l. that I am bound in to appear here, if I would not prosecute.</p>

On the 6th of this month the prisoner came to my house, I believe a little before eight in the evening; he called me into the passage, and desired me to light a fire and show him a room for two young women that he was going to treat. One he said was a lady's maid. I lighted a fire. They went up and had some oysters and some cheese, and about one o'clock, when all my company were gone, I wanted to go to bed. I went to him, and wanted him to pay and go. He insisted on having more punch, and insisted much on my drinking. (I suppose to make me drunk.) I told him I did not chuse to drink any more, or make any more punch. He much insisted much upon it, so I did make a shilling's worth. After that he would have some shrub. Some time before that he wanted me to change him a note. I said, If it is not a very large one, I will. He said, It is but a 10 l. note. I knew nothing of him. By and by, when the punch and shrub were drank, he pulled it out. I held it up by the candle, and said, This note will not do for me. I never saw such a one in my life; and gave it him back again. He had a green purse in his hand. I thought he would take out some gold to pay me. He would not pay me. I called my son to go and call the watch. Then we took him to the watch-house. There we searched him for this note, which I had seen him put into a pocket-book. We could not find the pocket-book, nor green purse. We went out of the watch-house, and found the pocket-book, and the false note in it, and the green purse, with a parcel of false guineas and half guineas in it. They were yellow counters. What appeared as guineas had a George the Third on one side and the English arms in a field in the other, and the half guineas a Queen Ann, and the other side resembling a sixpence very badly struck, and only lacquered. Though they shone like gold in the purse, a child of ten years of age might easily discern them not to be coin. In the pocket book was the 10 l. note which he had offered to me (produced in court) on thin paper, to resemble a 10 l. Bank note; the resemblance such, that possibly it may deceive some unwary tradesman.)</p>
               <p>The constable confirmed that of finding the note and counters, near the watch-house door.</p>

I remember the prisoner coming to my husband's apartment on the 22d of September last, a little after eight o'clock in the evening. There were others came with him. They came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I believe I had known him five or six months before. I was sitting by the fire when he came in. They broke the shop door down. Three of them did the execution. I saw the prisoner with an ax cut the tackling down, and the silk in the loom. All three did part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. They quitted the house directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of them?</p>

               <p>M. Edwards. Yes. We had the first floor, a whole floor, a lodging room, and a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner come in at the street door?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come into your room?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. My room door was upon the latch. They lifted up the latch and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. They said nothing to me.</p>

               <p>M. Edwards. They were obliged to go by me to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop door locked?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. No, it was only latched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light in your room?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I had, and they took it from me, from where I sat.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. There were six of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came in first?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I do not know that. It was the first of them that took my light away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. Yes. When they knocked the door down, I could plainly see them all. They were not far from where I was. Three of them might stand between the prisoner and me. I am very positive he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. What silk did they destroy?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. I do not know the name of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it to make?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. It was to make ribbons in the engine loom; that is, a different loom from the broad work.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the ribbons all silk?</p>
               <p>M. Edwards. They are. It was in the loom, and there was a great deal more not in the loom.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dowell. The loom was my property that was destroyed in the house of Mr. Dupree. On the 23d of September Mr. Edwards came and told me, between nine and ten o'clock, that there had been people there who had destroyed the loom, and cut the work. He said he did not know any of them, but that his wife did. I went to look the next morning, and found the loom cut to pieces, and the ribbon that was made destroyed, as also the rest of the materials. The silk was the property of Messieurs Dickinson and Graham. I was their servant, and gave it out.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that his loom was cut?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I saw his loom on Sunday the 24th of September, and saw that it had been cut. I asked his wife how it came cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it cut in the manner the cutters do?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. That I cannot tell any thing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 22d?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I did. I met him in Blue-Anchor Alley, about a quarter of an hour before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. No body at all. We went together to the Two Brewers, in White-Cross-street, and called for a pint of beer. We had not been there long before one Mr. Price came in, and knowing him, I asked him if he would drink with me. He said he would. We staid there till ten o'clock, then we came out, and I left the prisoner and Price at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner and Price in company with you all that time?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. All that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take notice of the time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180036"/>Riddletale. I looked at the dial.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. About three years. I never knew any thing but honesty by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of the weavers collecting money about Spitalfields; is that right or wrong?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What can't you tell?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I have no connections with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that right or wrong?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I cannot tell how to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that act honest or dishonest of those committee men?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I cannot tell how to think it dishonest.</p>
               <p>Q. Now another question. What makes you remember the 22d of September?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. It being a rejoicing night, I went out to get a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the rejoicing about?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. It was the king's coronation. I remember it by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not some club or other on that night?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. No. I met him intirely by accident. It was a quarter before eight by the dial when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the dial that day se'nnight at a public-house?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I always do, when I go to a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you do, where there is no dial?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. Then I can take no notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in a public-house last Friday?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Wednesday or Thursday?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever put down the time?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. I can generally remember.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you employ your time about?</p>
               <p>Riddletale. We talked about state affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Edwards. Do you know this last witness?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Edwards. I do not know any thing of him. I do not remember seeing him.</p>

            . Coming from work on the king's coronation night, between eight and nine, I went into the Two Brewers and called for a pint of beer. There was the man at the bar and the last witness, who was an acquaintance of mine. They asked me to drink with them. I did, and staid there till ten o'clock. Then we came out together. I left them, and went home. I know no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you leave work?</p>

I went out, and ran after her. She ran so fast, I could not overtake her. I was about two or three yards from her once, and called, Stop thief! but she got away. I saw about half a yard of the gown hang down on her left side, under an old red cloak she had on.</p>

               <p>E. Trooper Sen. I was in the shop when the prisoner came in, in the afternoon. She asked me for a neckcloth. I gave it her. She wanted change. I could not give it her; and while I went out of the shop to call my daughter, I suppose the prisoner took the gown. When I came back into the shop, she was in a great confusion, wanting to go. As she was going out, I saw half a yard of the gown hanging down. She got out of the shop, and I being behind the counter, could not get out soon enough. I called to my daughter, and told her; she ran after her, but could not overtake her. We never got the gown again.</p>

He took two pair out of a shew-glass. He kept one pair in his hand, and delivered the other to me to weight; and see what they came to. I weighed them, and told him what they came to. He said they were too dear. He then asked the price of several others, but they were all too dear. I then put that drawer away, and shewed him another drawer full; he still kept to the same, they were too dear, but he kept the pair in his hand. Then he wanted a second-hand pair. I said it was needless to shew him any, as he did not want to buy. He then pitched upon a pair, and they were weighed. He agreed to pay five shillings and nine-pence an ounce, and they came to fourteen shillings. Then he said he would not give so much, he would have some allowance for the chases. He would give but twelve shillings. By this time he had secreted the pair he had in his hand. He then said they were rather flight, and there was a crack in one of them, and he had seen some he liked better, and wanted to look in the drawer again. I said, if he did not like them he might leave them; I would not shew him any more. It was about tea-time. I called to my spouse to bring my tea down. She did. I desired her to stay in the shop. Then I went round the counter to where he was to drink it. At last he said, You will not take any less. I said, No. Then he went out of the shop. I followed him out, and brought him in again.

I asked him what was the matter; he told me the prisoner came in to cheapen a pair of silver buckles, and he had stole a pair. I lent him some assistance. We got him in. He went on his knees, and begged forgiveness, and said it was the first offence. He was some time before he would quit hold of Mr. Bridges. When he said he would go for a constable, I held him. Mr. Bridges could not get a constable, so we took him to the Compter.

               <p>Wade. As good a character as a poor man can do. He served me duely and truely the time he was with me, day and night, in order to get money.</p>

We live in Red-Lion-Street, near a quarter of a mile from where my stall is. He was gone from me almost a fortnight. before I knew he had robbed me of any thing, and then I should not have missed them, but he had dropped some stockings in a public-house. I was told to go and see them. I went: they were four odd stockings. I will not be positive to them, but I think they were mine. The people told me the boy had more things. My husband was then at Blackheath-fair. I went and told my brother; we took the boy up, and he directly owned that they were my stockings, and that he had robbed me of great many more. He owned to taking three handkerchiefs; this he owned before the justice; and that the woman at he had received stockings of him. We had a search-warrant, and found four pair hanging on a line publickly for sale, and she had another pair on her legs, all my property. She owned she had them of the boy, but said where they came from she did not know, for she did not examine him.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is Duggan?</p>
               <p>A. Coste. He is about eighteen years of age. The woman owned before the justice she gave half a crown for the first parcel. The boy said there were nine pair. She said there were but six or seven. And that she gave eighteen-pence for another parcel. The boy said there were two or three pair of them. The boy also said he took another parcel, but could not tell what he had for them. Some of the stockings were for all childrens stockings, that I sell for five-pence a pair, and some that stand me in nineteen shillings a dozen, and some sixteen. The stockings she had on her legs stood me in twenty-two shillings a dozen. They were all new. The boy owned he had pawned the handkerchiefs at three different pawnbrokers. I went, and they delivered them up. ( Three handkerchiefs produced in court.) These are them, and they are my property.</p>

On the 7th of this month I took in one of these handkerchiefs of the boy at the bar; two days after the prosecutrix's brother came, and asked me if I had any handkerchief of this pattern. I said I had. I went with him to the justices, and delivered it us. There the boy declared where the other handkerchiefs were, and the other pawnbrokers came and delivered them up.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of September, about noon, I was backwards in the kitchen. My child was just come from school. The street door was open, and the kitchen door shut. The child came in and told my maid, a man was gone out of the parlour with a great coat on his arm. I went into the kitchen, and said to my friend that was come to see me. Come along with me. We ran out and overtook one of the prisoners, Fitzpatrick, about two yards from the door. He had my two great coats, and my tea-chest in them, under his arm. I took him by the collar, and asked him where he got them things. He said a stranger gave him them in the street. I said I would take care of him. My friend

             took hold of him, and we got him back into my house: going in, he made a struggle, and then the other prisoner rushed into the house along with him. I had not seen him before. He came up to me and asked me the reason I would not quit him; and said he was innocent of the affair, and I had got my things again. Now, said I, you rascal, I will charge you likewise. I locked the door, and sent my maid for a constable. The things were my property, taken out of my parlour, a fore room.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's black parlour when the maid came in, and informed us a man had ran out of the fore parlour. Mr. Pritchard called me. We both went out, and took Fitzpatrick with the things under his arm. Mr. Pritchard asked him how he came by them things. He said they were given to him to carry them to the water-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he knew the man?</p>
               <p>Watkins. No, he did not. He came back very willingly till he came to the door; there he struggled, and Bowers rushed in along with him. I did not see him before. Bowers said, What business have you to detain the man, as he was innocent, and as long as Mr. Pritchard had his things again? He said he knew he was innocent, and desired we would let him go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he saw a man deliver the clothes to him?</p>
               <p>Watkins. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Pritchard. Fitzpatrick said before the Justice that Bowers gave him the things at the door. Bowers denied it.</p>
               <p>Watkins. I pressed Fitzpatrick to say who gave him the things, that we might send after them immediately. He said there was no occasion to send after them. When before the Justice, he said Bowers gave them to him at the door, and cried very much.</p>
               <p>Fitzpatrick's Defence.</p>

When I had so done, I was walking up Virginia-street, to go to my mother's, when a man crossed the way to me, and asked me whether I was not a wat erman. I said, Yes. He said, Where does your boat lie? I said, at Execution-dock. He asked me if I would carry these things. I took them and was walking towards my boat, and these people followed me, and took hold of my shoulder. I was pretty much in liquor. It was a man much like this man (meaning Bowers) that gave me the things to carry.</p>
               <p>Bower's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was called in three times before the Justice. He desired me to swear to this man (meaning Fitzpatrick ); I said, I did not know any thing against him, and I would not.</p>

               <p>William Green. As I was walking in Blackheath fair on the 11th of October, I saw this gelding. I knew him; for I sold him to Mr. Beecroft. I said to the man that had him there, named

I said, Do you think he will sell the horse? I know a man that would be glad to have him. If you will go with me to the person, I'll treat you with a bottle of wine. I took him to Mr. Beecroft's yard, and said to him, Here is your horse. I asked the man if he could give any good account of himself; he said he hired the horse of Mr. Heath; which we found to be true; and when we saw Mr. Heath, he said, he bought the horse of

I said, What is the other? He said, A bay mare, and described her. Then I said, I know who she belongs to. The next day, Mr. Heath had got the prisoner in the parish of Shadwell. I asked him how he came by the horse; he said he bought him in Smithfield, and that he had him in a raft two or three days before he sold him to Mr. Heath. Mr. Heath said he bought the horse on the 22nd of September, and he was stole between the 18th and 20th, which we thought could not be true, because there was no market-day between. I asked the prisoner if the horse had any shoes on before: he said, No. The horse had a tender foot, and I think he could not be had up and down bare-footed, as he was at Luisham, without hurting him.</p>

I have seen him since, and it is the same horse that Mr. Beecroft owns. I bought him of the prisoner on the 22nd of September, and I bought another horse. I have known the prisoner nine or ten months; he lived in Will's-street, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse shod when you bought him?</p>
               <p>Heath. He was. At first, when the prisoner was charged, he said he bought him in Smithfield; then he had him in exchange; then after that he said he bought him in Bedfordshire. I paid him eleven pounds and six-pence for the two.</p>

               <p>Court. Give an account of what you know, and of what happened about the death of your father.</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. William Elder came up in the morning, between six and seven o'clock, and knocked at our door: he staid a little time, and said, Very well, you will not let me in. Then he went down stairs again. After that he came again, about eight, and knocked at the door, and my father bid me let him in. I did. He is my uncle, he married my father's sister. We lodge at Mr. Mitchell's, at the White-Swan in Chandois-street. My uncle came about my aunt. When he came in, he said, So, you have got your sister concealed here. He went to the closet, opened the door, and said, I wish she was here, I would well broomstick her. My dadda and he had a good many words. I do now remember the words. He said to my dadda, Pay me what money you owe me. My dadda was in bed. He said, I have paid you the money, and above. My dadda got out, and said he would show him the bill. He put his coat and waistcoat on, and went round the bed, and pulled out a pocket-book, and came to the other side of the bed, took a key out of his pocket, and opened the drawer. My dadda called him Irish dog, and he called my dadda Scotch dog. My uncle gave my dadda two or three blows with his double fist. My dadda said, Very well; I shall not strike you. My uncle said, I suppose you will take the law of me. My dadda said, I will. Then my dadda fell upon him. Mrs. Breaden, that lives above us, came down, hearing a noise; then came our landlord, Mr. Mitchell, and took my uncle, and turned him out of the room. He was without his hat. I got it, and gave it to him. My dadda went to the glass, and looked in it, and said my uncle had given him a blow on his eye. He went and lay down on the bed, and said to me, O Polly! my head achs, and he never moved or stirred after, nor ever spoke more. This was on the Thursday morning, and he died on the Sunday morning after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any scratch on your dadda's face?</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your aunt?</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. She hid herself in the closet. There was only me with my dadda.</p>

            . I lodged over the deceased in the same house. I heard a noise in the room about eight o'clock that morning. The child screamed out. I went down to the deceased's room; the prisoner and the deceased were standing pretty close together, but no blows passed. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180045"/> begged they would not fight. The deceased said he would not fight; but it was a hard case to be struck. He asked the little girl for a key, and went to a drawer and took out some writings. He fell in a passion upon taking out the papers, and struck Mr. Elder on the left side the face, and Elder fell against the door. I begged of Mr. Elder that he would not strike him again; he said he would not, and I did not see him lift his hand up at all. The deceased seemed to be very much in a passion, and the prisoner quite calm. Mr. Mitchell came; then the deceased had his two hands in Mr. Elder's hair. Mr. Mitchell took Mr. Elder by the shoulders, and turned him out; and said he would not have a disturbance in his house. Elder said, Give me my hat, and I'll go. And he went away. When he went out of the room, I went also. I saw the deceased about two hours after; he could not speak. The child came up to me, and desired me to come down, saying she believed he was in a fit: he lay, and neither spoke nor stirred. Mrs. Elder was there. She asked what must be done. I desired her to send for a surgeon, for I thought him in a very dangerous way. She was his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Elder and his wife use to live together?</p>
               <p>J. Breaden. That I can't tell. I have seen them come backwards and forwards; they behaved themselves well. She came home with her brother over-night, and had been in the room all night. I cannot tell what this was owing to. I did not see them come home. They came about one in the night. I believe I saw the deceased strike Mr. Elder twice, but did not see Mr. Elder strike the deceased. As far as ever I saw, Mr. Elder was always a quiet, peaceable man; he always was very agreeable. So was the deceased a quiet man, when sober; but very quarrelsome when in liquor. The deceased had lately been in a good deal of trouble, and had hardly been sober for a fortnight.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the house, where this unfortunate thing happened. I saw Elder go up stairs, and heard him knock at the door. He came down again presently, and said, Mr. Mitchell, they will not let me in. I said, I dare say they are gone out; he said, I heard somebody stir in the bed; he said his wife went to Bartholomew-fair, and got drunk, and came home with her brother; and I have been used very ill by him. He says he does not owe me above 3 l. and he owes me 6 or 7 l. I will go up again and see whether they will let me in: He went up and knocked at the door again; what he said I do not know. Presently came the lodger and called me up stairs, and said, There will be murder in the house. This was in about three minutes time. I ran up, and saw the deceased have the prisoner by the hair of the head, beating him in the face with his fist. I got myself in between them, and parted them. I took both the deceased's hands out of the prisoner's hair; and took Elder in my arms and brought him out at the door, and said, You dirty rascal, what business have you in my house, to come to make such a disturbance in a morning? He said, If you please to give me my hat out of the room, I'll go out of your house. He had used to come there, and he came very civily. I never before this heard them any otherways than as brothers to each other. Elder went away, and I did not see the deceased from that time till after twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am uncle to the deceased. This was on a Thursday, and a man came to me on the Friday morning, for me to come to the deceased, saying he could not speak. That man asked me to go and drink. I went with him to the sign of the Sun, in Russel-street. There was the prisoner. This was about eleven o'clock. He offered his hand to me, and said, Will you shake hands with me? I hope you are not angry. I said my kinsman is not well used; the prisoner answered, D - n his Irish stomach. If I was to do it, I would do it again; he only shams Abraham; that is, to extort money from me. Said he, I hit him a tap, and gave him right and left, taylor fashion. After he got up to struggle, he put his head up, and said he, I could have twisted his head off, but I would not; he could not resist me, but he put his hand up, and catched me by my hair: that was all he could do to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was the deceased?</p>
               <p>Wooderow. He was a small man, and very weak.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of the deceased striking him?</p>
               <p>Wooderow. No, he never said a word of that. We spent an hour or two together, and he said the deceased scratched him on his forehead. He said the deceased arose up to resent his being struck; and he put his head under his arm, and could have twisted it off.</p>

            . I did live in the same house at the time of this, but I do not now. The prisoner came up stairs and swore a great many oaths, and wanted to get into the room. He went from the door down stairs, and said, D - n you, I'll wait all day, but I'll do for you. Whether he meant Wooderow, or his own wife, I do not know.

               <p>M. Crow. I cannot tell which.

I heard blows, but who struck them I do not know. They were very soon after the door was open. Then I heard the deceased say, I will not strike you; the prisoner answered, No, d - n you, you will take the law of me. Then they went to fighting again, and calling names.

He brought the prisoner out to the landing-place; then the prisoner said, Give me my hat, and I'll go. He took it, and went away. Mr. Mitchell said to Mr. Wooderow, Must I always have this disturbance in my house? Said the deceased, He struck me, as I was in my bed: you would think it very hard to be struck so. I was in the room when the deceased died. The prisoner surrendered himself to Sir

The door clapt too, and I heard no more. There were a great many bad names called on both sides. I called Mr. Mitchell up: he came. The child called Mr. Elder Scotch thief, and said he was murdering her dadda. The deceased and his wife were always a quarrelling. I was afraid of murder often with them. After that I saw the deceased go across the room to the glass, and I saw no more of him till about twelve o'clock.

            . On Thursday the 7th of September, about twelve o'clock, I was sent for to the deceased. I found him speechless, senseless, and motionless. He was alive. I examined him, and concluded from the symptoms there was something of the apoplexy. At that time they had no told me what had happened. I treated it as an apoplexy, or a pressure on the brain. I bleeded him. He bled freely, but that did not ease him. He was able to take very little. The second visit was about five or six hours after, then I was informed he had had some words with some relation, and that there had been some blows. I examined his head with great accuracy, but I could not find any external symptoms of bruise or wound that had done him any injury at that time. I attended him, and treated it as a concussion on the brain for the three days he lived. I declared to people about, that it was a case that I believed would prove mortal: that I concluded from the first. The second visit I thought it might proceed from some blows he had received. He died on the Sunday morning, and on the Monday I opened him. I raised the scalp. I could not find the least fracture, or the least injury in the bones of the scull in any part. The temporal muscle had a duskish appearance, as though it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180047"/> had been bruised on the left temple muscle: the muscle on the other side appeared in a found state. I raised that muscle, and examined the scull; but could not find the bone had received any injury at all. I then opened the scull immediately under the left temple, where this appearance of a bruise was in the muscle, and I found a great quantity of extravasated blood lying between the pia and the dura mater.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have a vessel broke there without a blow?</p>
               <p>Rowley. Most certainly. I found he had been drinking about a fortnight or three weeks very hard. The muscle appeared, as if there had been some bruise, but the scull was perfectly found underneath it. I examined it in the presence of three or four surgeons.</p>
               <p>Q. If a blow had occasioned a rupture of a vessel, so as to occasion such an extravasation of blood, would he not have immediately grown senseless?</p>
               <p>Rowley. He most undoubtedly would have been senseless immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he, after he had received such a blow as to occasion this rupture, have been able to have pulled the hair, and fought five minutes after?</p>

               <p>Rowley. For a few minutes he might. It might be five, ten, or twenty minutes before the blood emptied in that part.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not known in the course of your practice such a vessel burst merely through passion?</p>
               <p>Rowley. After eating a great meal it has been done. I concluded it must arise from this cause. The man had been drinking very freely, and had not been accustomed to drinking, being in a violent passion might force the blood in such great rapidity to the head, as to occasion these circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you upon your oath say some external injury was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rowley. I should imagine so, but it is impossible to determine that it was. I cannot be quite positive. I am a little doubtful. A cough, or any violent passion, or strain, might occasion it. To the best of my knowledge it was owing to an external injury. After I had opened the head, I did conclude there might be some external injury. It might be by a fall.</p>

             up with a stick and swore he would knock me down. I made no resistance. I understood he had been to a great man; pawnbrokers to release his wife's things out of pawn, in order to sell them. I went home about eleven, and went to bed. The next morning I got up about seven; I found I had no wife come home. My boy said his mother went home with his uncle and Polly. I went there, without any mischief in my heart, in order to see whether my wife was there. I knocked at the door. I had no answer. I came down again, staid in the passage and asked Mr. Mitchell what time Mr. Wooderow came home; he said between eleven and twelve. It was almost one. I said, Did you see any body come with him? No. said he, I did not. I went up a second time, and knocked at the door again, then the door was admitted to be opened. My wife was got in a small closet. I opened the closet door, and saw the bed folded up. I thought she was not there. He jumped out of his bed, and put his coat and waistcoat on, and said, You Scotch son of a b - h, there is your wife; why don't you find her? I said, She is not there. He repeated Scotch son of a b - h. I said, If he said so again, I would give him a knock on the head. I gave him a blow on his right cheek bone, under his eye. He flew to the drawer, and said he had paid me 3 l. more than my due. I said, You shall not use me so, knowing you had my money. He owed me pretty near 7 l. I was going: he said, I should not go; he would fight it out. He ran his head against me, pulled me about the room, and threw me on a chair. I catched his head under my left arm, and twisted his head about, which I allow might hurt him. The gentlewoman that live in the garret came down, and said, Pray do not strike him. I said, I will not, I will only hinder him from hurting of me. Then Mr. Mitchell came up, and said, You have no business to come to make a noise here. I said, I did not come to make any, but only to look for my wife. The deceased had his hand then in my hair. Mr. Mitchell released me. After I got home, half my hair came off.</p>

I never found him ill-natured. He has worked for me. He is a remarkably peaceable and quiet man; no ways addicted to quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. I did. He has worked with me. He was a leading man on the board.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he for temper?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. When he got a little in liquor, he was rather peevish and ill-natured. The prisoner worked with me about seven years, and the deceased about as long.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was the deceased?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. He was a little man, much less than the prisoner, and he had had a fit of illness.</p>

            . The prisoner brought me into her room, and put me into her bed, and went out again, and put the door too. She came in again; I had not got to sleep, and in rummaging about, she came to the place where my breeches were. I thought she was looking for her own necessaries, till she was gone out again. After she was out of the room, I clapt my hand at my pocket, and found my money was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Boyd. It was this day fortnight, about seven in the morning. I had sat up in the watch-house all night, and in the morning I wanted to refresh myself, being heavy for sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I never saw her with my eyes before that morning. I happened to see her sitting in a public-house, where I went in. She said her lodgings were but a few doors off. So I went with her. She was to have called me about nine, but she never came near me after she was out, and I could not tell were to find her: so I sat in the house till five in the afternoon. She did not come; then I went to the watch-house, and the next morning I found her in the same public-house where I first saw her. She had a pint of purl by her, and a pipe in her mouth. I charged her with having my money. I fetched the watchman, and took her to Clerkenwell goal. She did not own that she had robbed me, nor will she now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your money again?</p>
               <p>Boyd. No, I never did. I had nine guineas in gold. That was gone, and she left me a bad six-and-nine penny piece, and three farthings. She had seen the six-and ninepenny piece at the public-house the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. I want to know where the other woman is that lay with you?</p>
               <p>Q. to Boyd. Was there another woman in the room?</p>
               <p>Boyd. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that woman lie in the bed with you?</p>
               <p>Boyd. Yes. That woman staid in the room with me till five in the afternoon, but the prisoner never appeared.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have so much money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I had received it, being paid off a man of war, and I was willing to keep it in my own custody, not knowing who to trust with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the other woman?</p>
               <p>Boyd. She and I were in the watch-house together the whole night.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you both in the watch-house for?</p>
               <p>Boyd. There was nothing laid to her charge nor mine neither. I went there to get out of harm's way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that woman?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that woman take your money?</p>
               <p>Boyd. This woman took my money. I felt her about my breeches.</p>

               <p>In the morning I was going for some purl, when this man came in bloody, and his wife was in the same condition. He asked me to give him a little water to wash his face. I got a bason of water, and wiped his eyes. He asked me to show him the way to my house, and then to show him the way to bed, which I did, and he and she went to bed together.</p>

             5 l. 8 s. I had it in my pocket; thirty-four-guineas and 4 s. I was to go down into Kent, to lay it out for oysters, at a place called Whistable. It was all in a bag. I received it at Masey Island, in Essex, within nine miles of Colchester. I received it on Monday the 25th of last month, and lost it on Tuesday the 26th. I came up in a hoy, went on shore, and went to the Beehive in Nithtingale-lane, about two o'clock, where these two girls met with me. They inticed me to their lodging, a few doors from thence. I never was there in my life before. I was carried into a room, I do not know how high, I believe only up one pair of stairs. There was a bed in it. I did not pull off my clothes. When I was in the room Smith went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Blois. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep?</p>
               <p>Blois. No. I had been in the room perhaps half an hour, or thereabouts. Then Davidson took my money out of my left hand breeches pocket, and hastened out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took it?</p>
               <p>Blois. There was nobody in the room but she and I; and I mist it as soon as she flew. I was going after her, and Smith stopped me at the door, while she got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money when you was in the room?</p>
               <p>Blois. I am sure I had. I felt it, and had it in my hand. I was upon the bed with her, and she flew from me at once, and ran down stairs. When she was got away, I went and acquainted my friend with it, and the two prisoners were pursued and catched in a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your pocket buttoned?</p>

               <p>Blois. No, there was never a button on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you upon the bed with Davidson?</p>

He gave me a shilling to go and fetch six-penny-worth of liquors. I went for it, and returned him the six-pence. I went about my business, and shut the door after me. I went to the washer-woman to get me a clean cap. Then I washed myself to go to Dr. Lioney, to have my face dressed. I then went up into the room. The man began to laugh and joke. He never took any notice of having lost any thing. He said, Where is the girl gone? I said I do not know. Then we went to this public house again, and called for six-penny-worth of liquor. Then he said I am going to Mr. Cockbourn's, and if you hear of such a girl, I should be obliged to you if you would let me know. I saw no more of him till about dusk in the evening. I was going to a sister of hers to buy her some cloaths. She called for a coach. We went together, and were stopped, and we were taken out, by whom I do not know, for I was a little in liquor. This was at the top of the Butcher-row in East-Smithfield. After that they searched me. I pulled off every thing I had. They found nothing on me. I was carried before the Justice in New Gravel-lane. There I saw a bag, and a quantity of money turned out upon the table. I never saw it before.</p>

I went into a house with the woman at the bar, and lay down on a bed. It was near the sign of the Boot, by Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I met her on the top of Holborn, near St. Giles's. I awaked near two or three o'clock, and found myself alone. She was gone, and my watch was gone; likewise about six shillings in silver was gone. There had been none but the prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put your watch?</p>
               <p>Anderson. I was not undressed. My watch was in my fob.</p>

               <p>E. Owen. I get my bread as well as I can, in the same way as the prisoner does. On last Tuesday morning I was by the Pilgrim alehouse, in Holborn. The prisoner had a watch; it seemed to me to be a silver one. She shewed it me. I asked her where she had it. She said she had it of a young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what young man?</p>
               <p>E. Owen. No, she did not. Her husband bid her let the right owner have it again. I never saw it after that time.</p>

            . I was at a public house last Wednesday morning. E. Owen came and told me, a man was robbed of a watch. I asked what man. She said she did not know. I said, Who has got the watch? she said, Pat Bourn, that is, the prisoner. She lives with a man named Burnet. I went and found her, and asked her about it. She acknowledged she took a watch from a man, and delivered it to Burnet, and he returned it to her again, and would have nothing to do with it. She owned before Justice Welch she had it of the prosecutor. She told me before that, she sat down in the street, and while she was sleeping, somebody picked her pocket of it.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday night, as I was going to St. Giles's, I met this man; he asked me to take part of a pint of purl. I went with him. We had two pints and some gin together. He asked me where I lived. I went with him to Cross-lane. We sat down upon a bed. I asked him for a present. He said he had but sixpence. Then he said, To make me satisfaction, I might keep the watch for a security. I said, I had rather you would leave it at a pawnbroker's. He said, My dear, I think it is as safe in your hand as in a pawnbroker's. After that he went away. I went out and fell asleep, and lost the watch out of my pocket. Somebody stole it from me.</p>

I rode up to a gentleman, and asked what was the matter; I was told a man had committed a robbery, and that he had crossed the road and took down a grass plat. I rode very hard in pursuit till I came to Bethnal-Green; there I saw a man on a slow run upon the Green. I galloped and overtook him. I asked him where he was going; he said, Not far. I put my horse round a post, and met him: I held the but end of my whip up to him, and desired him to stop till the man he had offended came up. Soon a man came up, and said there were others behind. I sent him back to hasten the person that had been robbed. The prosecutor soon came up, and, That is the person that robbed me. I will swear to him. Then a constable took charge of him. I left them, after I saw him searched in regard to arms, but none were found upon him as I saw.</p>

            . As I came up the field I heard somebody hollow Stop thief! I got upon a bank, and saw the prisoner coming as fast as he could. I made an attempt to stop him. He said, God bless you matter do not stop me, it is for a bastard childs this was as he was going over Bow-road. Just as I came to the corner of Bethnal-Green I lost him. Mr. Hodges came up immediately on horseback: said he, Which way is the man gone? I shewed him. He rode one way, and I ran another. He came up with the prisoner. I believe I was about three hundred yards off at the time. When I came up. I asked the prisoner what he had done. He said, he had done nothing that he knew of. I said, You certainly have, or you would not have ran so when the people hollowed Stop thief! Mr. Hodges wanted somebody to go and, fetch the man up that was robbed. I told him, If he would take care of the prisoner, I would go. The prosecutor, I found, had lost him, I found him, and brought him to the prisoner; he said, That was the man that robbed him, and gave the officer charge of him. I went up into the room with him. When he was searched. I saw half a guinea, 2 s. and 6 d. and three halfpence taken out of his left hand breeches pocket. He went across the room and flung himself down with his right hand in his pocket. The officer asked what he had there; he went and took out a knife. We asked him where he had that money? He said he received it the week before at Dartford, in Kent. Some time after he cried, and said it was the first thing of that sort that ever he did in his life.</p>

             I was at Bethnal-Green that day, about one o'clock. A young fellow came running, and said, Somebody must come and take a thief for robbing a person on the highway. I went, and there was Mr. Hodges standing with his horse's head before the prisoner. I asked what was the matter; he said that man had robbed a person in a lane. Said I, Where is the man that has been robbed? Presently the last evidence and the prosecutor came. The prosecutor said, That is the man that robbed me (meaning the prisoner.) Then I said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180052"/> will take charge of him. I took him into a public house and up stairs, and said, Let us see what you have about you. I searched him, and found 2 s. 6 d. and three halfpence, and a half guinea. (Produced in court.) I took also a knife from him. At first he said he took the money at Dartford, in Kent, the week before; and soon after he said it was the first fact that ever he did, and said he was very sorry for it now it was done. We took him before Justice Wilmot. He ordered us to take him to New Prison.</p>
