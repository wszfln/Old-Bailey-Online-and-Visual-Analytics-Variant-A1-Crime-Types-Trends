                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MARY ANN FOSTER</hi>. I am the wife of Jonas Foster, of 40, Chesham Street, Horton Road, Bradford, Yorkshire—we are breeders of dogs—we exhibit them at shows—on 12th December last we exhibited, amongst others, two Yorkshire toy terriers, a dog and a bitch—I valued them at 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were sold at the reduced price of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were what we call silver blue back with long hair; the head and the feet are a light golden tan—silver blue means slate colour—each dog was under 4 lb. weight—the prisoner also exhibited dogs in the next pen to ours or the next but one; he had seen our dogs—on 12th December a gentleman came to my stall and spoke about the two dogs; he was very well dressed, with a light overcoat, which was buttoned up, and he was very full in the face; he had a tall hat; his height was about 5 feet 9 inches—he was rather dark; he had a full moustache and a little whisker, but I am not sure about his beard—I should say his moustache was brown—I took the dogs out of the pen and showed them to him—a lady was with him when-he first came—I agreed to sell them to the gentleman at the close of the show for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—whilst I was talking to him the prisoner came up, touched his hat, and said "How do you do, Mr. Ramsay?"—he made some answer, but I did not hear what it was—then the gentleman and the lady went away—the next day was the close of the show; the gentleman came again, and I put the dogs into an open willow basket which had a division in it, and the lid of which was lined with a piece of print like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the interior of the basket was lined with another kind of print</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270004"/>
               <p>—on the previous day I asked the prisoner if he knew the gentleman he spoke to—he said "Well, not particularly, only I sold him a dog for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was not worth more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You are a wretch doing a thing like that"—he said "He has got plenty of money," and that is what induced me to take the cheque—I gave the dogs to Mr. Ramsay in the basket—I afterwards went to the secretary's office and found Mr. Ramsay there. (<hi rend="italic">The cheque was on the London and Westminster Bank, Bloomsbury Branch, dated 13th Decmber,</hi> 1881, <hi rend="italic">drawn by H. Ramsay, pay to M. A. Foster</hi> 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I returned to Bradford that night and paid the cheque to tradesmen in the town—on the Friday afternoon I got a telegram to say the cheque was dishonoured—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 16th <hi rend="italic">December, from R. Carling, Ship Tavern, Lime Street: "</hi> Here is a man in London offering your Yorkshire terriers; have you lost any? wire me at once")—I telegraphed for him to look after them, as there was something wrong—I went up to London and com-municated with the police at Scotland Yard—on the 17th December I went to see the prisoner in Leadenhall Market—on 19th I got a warrant for the apprehension of Ramsay—when I asked the prisoner if he knew where the dogs were he said he had not seen them—I asked him if he could tell us where they had been trying to sell them—he said he believed at Bird's and Bevan's over the water; he said "I will have a look round at the dog places, and if I can find them I will take possession of them, but you must pay all expenses"—of course I did not promise anything—the prisoner said if the Prince of Wales had them he would take possession of them; he said he had seen them times enough and knew the dogs—the letters produced were addressed to me (<hi rend="italic">From the prisoner, one stating that he had been round to the dog places, but could get little information, but would write again when he got any news; the other letter expressed surprise that Mrs. Foster should judge him to be mixed up in the affairt and send police officers to annoy him</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This letter produced came after I left home; it was sent to Scotland Yard ("<hi rend="italic">This was asking Mrs. Foster to wire the prisoner at the Ship, Lime Street, if he could do anything for her</hi>)—I have known Carling nine years; he was respectable up to this affair—toy terriers are very valuable dogs, and are always very much admired—I only had Mr. Ramsay's offer at the show; I had not seen him before—Carling took no part in the conversation between me and Ramsay with regard to the dogs—the lady did not return with him when he came for the dogs—I did not say to the prisoner with regard to Ramsay "He is coming back to-morrow, and if I cannot sell them for more I am going to let him have them for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not know whether Ramsay would return—I would not take a cheque from a stranger without inquiry; I do not swear I have not done so—I know the London and Westminster Bank by repute—I do not know whether Ramsay had a light overcoat on—it was not very light in colour; I think it was rather brown; I said it was dark before the Magistrate because at first I thought it was black; then when I came to think more about it I thought it was brown—I heard Hunter examined before the Magistrate; I cannot remember saying that his description of Jackson did not correspond with my recollection of Ramsay; I do not think it did exactly-Ramsay said the basket would be of no use to him; he would send it me back; it was not round, but oblong, with a division in the centre.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman and live at 32, Martin's Street, Blackfriars Road—on 14th December, a few minutes after 5, I was having my tea—a message was given to me, in consequence of which I went to the Joiners' Arms, kept by Mr. Bird, in the Westminster Bridge Boad—I saw the prisoner; he said "You are not the man"—I had never spoken to him, and I said "Perhaps not, sir"—he said "Your name is not Bevan?"—I said "No, air, my name is Hunter"—then he asked me if I knew Bevan—I said "Yes," and that he lived at 5, Warwick Street, Blackfriars Road, round by the Surrey Theatre—he asked me to have something to drink; I said I had just had my tea; he persuaded me and I had half a pint of mild and bitter—he said "Does Bevan buy dogs to send away?"—I said "Yes, sir; he buys them for the French people, and his father beforehim"—he said "Will you go with me to Bevan's, as I am a stranger about here?" and I agreed to do so, and went with him, aud the potman Randall joined us—when we got outside the door he put up his finger and called "<hi rend="italic">Hist,"</hi> when two other people followed us; they looked as if they had come from another compartment of the same public-house—I did not see them come out—one of the men stood six feet high, and carried-a brown cane basket, and was dressed like a gentleman all in black, with a tall hat and a hatband on it; they called him Jackson—we all went to Bevan's at 5, Warwick Street, except the potman, who left us—I knocked at Bevan's door, and Mrs. Bevan answered; I asked if Bevan was at home; she said "No"—the prisoner said "I wish he was at home, for I have got two pretty little toys we can sell him"—Mrs. Bevan said he would be in in naif an hour's time—I said "Is he at the Flowers of the Forest?"—she said she did not know, and we all four went to the Flowers of the Forest, and found he was not there—we remained about three-quarters of an hour; I had half a pint of mild and bitter, and we had a cigar each—the prisoner paid for them—while I was in the Flowers of the Forest the prisoner said "Here's two you don't very often see;" then he pulled out of the basket and showed me two little Yorkshire toy terriers, one from each side of the partition in the basket; they were a dog and a bitch—I said "I never saw two like them of this breed in my life, not that size, so small"—they had silver blue backs, with golden tan heads, the mane coming right over the top of the head, with a bunch coming over the eyes; the hair was very long for little dogs like them—I know a goodish dog if I see one—I went to see if Bevan had returned home, and he had not, and I went back to the Flowers of the Forest and told the prisoner Bevan had not returned—Jackson said he wanted to get away, and that he would be too late for the Birmingham train—the prisoner said he was sorry having made a fool of him, not having sold the dogs—the prisoner and Jackson went outside and spoke to each other, and came in again and asked whether I knew where they would be likely to find Bevan—I said "He</p>

Smithson" on the back—I asked him where he got it from—he said it was his writing, and it bore the office stamp of the St. Katherine's Dock office, and he must have remitted it that day, but he did not know where he got it from—I pointed out this erasure to him, "S. B. 455," and asked him if he wrote that also—the S.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Alexander as art cabinet-makers, in Phoenix Place, (gray's Inn Road—previous to July last the prisoner had had transactions with us—the last bill for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not met at the time it was due; a balance was left of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave an <hi rend="largeCaps">IO</hi> U—that was about July last—I did not after that let him have any goods, on credit—he did not apply for credit till about 20th November—about October I saw him at his own place, when he wanted some marqueterie cabinets on credit—I told him as he had not met his last bill, and we had not got paid the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we could not let him have credit, we would let him have anything if he paid cash—on 20th November he called and said he wanted a black cabinet which was standing in our show-room, which a gentleman had commissioned him to buy—we told him that it was already sold to Messrs. Maple, but if he could pay the money we would let him have it—he said he was very sorry, his stock was very heavy, he could not pay then, but would after Christmas—I referred him to my brother, who was with me at the time—he said the gentleman had a house in the Regent's Park, which he had to furnish, that he had sold him a lot of china, and unless he got the cabinet to show it off on, he would lose the order—my brother asked if he could pay half the money down—he said "Well, I will go home and see if I can raise the half of it, and I will let you know to-night, but don't part with it"—we did not hear from him at 6 o'clock, and the cabinet was sent to Maple's, who had bought it—he came the day after, and said" The gentleman has commissioned me to buy" so and so, mention-ing articles that were about;" I must have them, but I can't raise any money just now, but if you will come I will let you see my books and my stock"—we asked him who he was dealing with—he said he had entirely given up dealing with the trade, that he had a number of good customers, private persons round about the squares, who owed him money, and he could not send the bills in till after Christmas—I went there that evening and looked round his place; it was full of good stock, he kept his books very nicely, and we decided to let him have the stuff on the condition of its going to this private house—we told him we could only part with them for cash—he said the gentleman had arranged to pay him a fortnight after Christmas, when he had finished the furnishing, and he said "You had better, to make sure, draw a bill on me"—consequently we did so, adding the amount of the <hi rend="largeCaps">IO</hi> U, making 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we said we did not take short bills, and he asked me to date it back, which I did; I made it a two months' bill, from 12th November, so that it would be payable on 15th January—we then sent the things to him by our van—I believed that he had got this customer in the Regent's Park, or we should not have parted with our goods—a few days afterwards he came again and said that the gentleman was very much pleased with the things sent, and he wanted a couple of bric-a-brac satin wood tables for holding china—</p>

               <p>after a deal of conversation, and his again assuring us that he had plenty of money coming to him at Christmas, we had the tables finished and sent home—he said the gentleman's house was nearly finished, and he only wanted two brackets, and if he did not keep them he would send them back—this was about 8th December; they were sent in on 14th December—he said he had sold the gentleman a pair of glass and brass cabinets that we had sold to him two years previously, and in taking them to the house they broke the centre glass, and he asked me to supply that, which we did—we should not have parted with any of the goods unless we had believed they were going to a private house—on the 25th January I heard of the prisoner's liquidation—I then went to his house; he was said to be out, but after a time he came downstairs—I said "What is the meaning of this?" producing the notice of liquidation—he said "I am very sorry; I look on you as my friends, I will pay you, I have got the money and the stuff"—I said" This is a queer sort of business, who have you sold, the stuff to?"—he said "In the trade"—I said "Where?"—he said" I am not going to tell you"—I said" You will have to tell"—he said he would not, he was not bound to criminate himself—his receiver then came in, and I left—I attended the first meet-ing of creditors; he disclosed no debts whatever, and said no one owed him anything except one customer, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and his liabilities were 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his stock in trade was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and furniture, &amp;c, was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—our solicitor, Mr. Abrahams, was there, and asked him about our property—we were there for the purpose of tracing who had our stock—he handed in this paper in reply to our solicitor's questions, it is in his own hand-writing.

He says he is not sure whether he put the half-crown in the till or not, therefore what proof is there that the one I gave him was bad? Any one is liable to take two bad half-crowns in five months, and it was not worth my while to buy a hat for the sake of passing a bad half-crown.

I now live at Bermondsey, and am a clerk—in April, 1877, I was in search of employment, and saw an adver-tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> which I have destroyed—it said "Wanted a young man to learn a business; 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium required"—I replied, and received an answer, in consequence of which I went to 16, Hart Street, Bloomsbury, to Mr. Charles Read, an auctioneer's office—I saw the prisoner there—he said that he would give me an appointment if I would give him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium, and would teach me the business of a manufacturing chemist, and at the end of three months he would return the money with 5 per cent, interest added, without any reduction, and would give me six guineas a month salary—on 30th May I met him again at the same place, and paid him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and he signed this</p>

On the morning of 31st January I was in Norfolk Road, Hackney, in uniform at half-past 3—I heard a cry "Stop thief" at a great distance, and went in the direction of Mon-tagu Road, and met two other constables, Bruce and Riches, and we all three went down the Montagu Road—I there saw the prisoner walking alone in the carriage way quietly—no one was pursuing him—I was in advance of the two other constables—I stepped in front of him, and said" What's up, old man?"—he then put his right hand into the breast of his overcoat and took out this revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said "Which of you will have this?" presenting it towards me quite full—he was between four and five yards from me—I called out to the other constables" Look out, 40, he has got a revolver"—I turned left about, and took three paces to my right—he said "I will shoot you, "again pointing the revolver at me—I said" No you won't," and at the same time threw up my left hand—he said "I will"—I said" Come," and at that moment he fired—the pistol was fired directly at me—I felt nothing at the time—as soon as he fired I closed. with him, and knocked him down; while he was down, and I on the top of him, he still had the revolver in his right hand, and he turned his wrist so as to bring the revolver as far round as he could towards me—I then slipped my hand along the revolver, and took it from him—with the asssistance of the other constables I took him to the police-station—when we got there I found that a bullet had gone through my outer coat, the inner coat, and had lodged in the lining; it dropped out—the inspector found it—I gave the revolver to the inspector—it was examined at the station, and found to be a six-chambered revolver—five chambers were loaded with powder and ball, and one appeared to have been recently discharged—I saw the inspector search him and find upon him a chisel, screw-driver, gimlet, two table knives, a dark lantern, silent lucifers, two keys, twopence, and a circular—I should think the place where the prisoner fired at me was about two miles from No. 10, Brook Road, on the other side of Hackney Downs.</p>

On 21st January I was in the Montagu Road—Reany came up to me and another constable, and we all three went up Montagu Road, and met the prisoner—Reany was in front of us about two paces—he said to the prisoner "Well, old man, what is the matter?"—the prisoner said" What?"—he put his right hand to the breast of his coat, and pulled out a revolver, and pointed it in the direc<lb/>tion of us—Reany turned round to the left, and called out "Look out, 40, he has got a revolver"—I looked at the prisoner, and saw the revolver in his hand, I staggered back three or four paces, taken by surprise a bit—during that time the prisoner stepped across on the path where Reany was—Reany turned to him, and he said "I will shoot you"—Reany said "No you won't"—the prisoner said "I will, "and Reany put up his left hand as a guard, and said "Come"—the prisoner pointed the revolver up, and fired towards Reany—Reany closed with him, and threw him—the revolver was still in the prisoner's hand; Reany also had hold of it—it was turning towards Reany's body—I caught hold of the barrel, and turned it back away from Reany's body—between us we succeeded in taking him to the station—he was not violent on the way.</p>

Some time after I met the constable Reany, and I admit that I presented the revolver, but not at his body; if I had I should have shot his body, not through the sleeve of his coat. When on the ground, he said before the Magistrate, that I presented the pistol at his body again. I admit that I did so, but not then. I refrained from firing because I had no intention, of killing or wounding. The lives of the three constables were in my hand, had I felt disposed to have taken either, but such was not my intention. I only carried the revolver to frighten people, to prevent my lawful apprehension, and I think anybody else would have done the same placed as I was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector N</hi>). About 3.45 on the morning of 31st January Franklin was brought in custody to Dalston Station—the revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me by Reany, loaded in five chambers—on Franklin I found a chisel, screwdriver, gimlet, dark lantern, knives, silent matches, two keys, and twopence, also this printed circular of a photographer, Messrs. Brown, Barnes, and Bell, on the second page of which there is written the name of Otley—Franklin was charged and detained at the station—some constables and Sergeant Payne afterwards brought in Miller about 4.30—I took him into the room where Franklin was and said" You will be charged with being concerned with Franklin, being suspected persons, found on enclosed premises and having housebreaking implements in his possession"—he</p>

               <p>said "I don't know what you mean, I never saw that man in my life before"—Franklin did not say anything then—I saw Miller searched—Payne took from him this circular, which corresponds with the other one taken from Franklin, and on the second page there is writing and the name of Otley—I noticed the boots of the two men, they were covered nearly to the laceholes with loose fresh black mould—I said "They have been over some one's grounds this morning"—on the next day, 1st February, I went to Grenville—I saw there marks as if two persons had dropped from the wall on to the newly-made borders—I saw that the garden gate had been broken through and loose mould on the top of the wall dividing 10, Brook Eoad from the road—in that way they could have got out of No. 10—No. 10 is about 100 yards from Grenville—I took the different housebreaking implements from Franklin and compared them with the marks at Grenville, and I also took with me a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> which had been placed on the mantelpiece of the police-station—the marks on the outer sill of the window corresponded exactly with this <hi rend="italic">jemmy,</hi> which is really a packing-case opener, and the chisel which I took from Franklin—the marks were nearly in the centre of the windows—there were four windows marked, the catch of one was broken—there were marks also on the back garden door, it had been forced with both instru<lb/>ments apparently.</p>

I am a coachman, and live at 21, Chapel Place, Brompton Road—on Friday night, 13th January, I was at the Queen and Prince Albert—I saw the prisoner come in on the Knightsbridge side between 9 and 10 o'clock—he went into the cellar—between 11 and 12 o'clock I saw him go behind the bar on the Park side where Mrs. Webb was sitting—he spoke to her in an angry tone; I did not take notice of the words—a little while after I heard her say "Oh"—I afterwards saw her come round to the Knightsbridge side to serve some customers—her eyes were black, and her face bleeding from the right side; her right eye was marked and bleeding—Mrs. Hughes asked the prisoner if he did it—the deceased said "Yes, it was him that done it"—the prisoner said to Mrs. Hughes," Yes, what has that to do with you?"—the deceased asked me to put up the shutters for her, and I did so, and then she closed the house directly—I did not see the prisoner strike her at all—the prisoner went away at the same time that I did.</p>

On Saturday, 14th January, I was sent for to see Mrs. Webb at the public-house about 10 o'clock—I saw hex in the room adjoining the bar—her right eye was very much blackened, and a bruised cut under the outer angle of the eye; the left eye was also blackened and bruised, but not quite so badly as the right—there was a large bruise on the right side, partly on the bone and partly on the soft parts—there were bruises on both legs below the knees on the outside at the back of the legs—she answered my questions quite sensibly, but her hands trembled and her tongue was very tremulous when it was put out—the injuries were such as might have been inflicted the previous day—the injuries on the face might have been caused by a blow with a fist; those on the legs might have been from kicks—I saw her each day—I saw her standing there on the following Tuesday, but she stood in a very bent position, she could not stand upright—I ordered her to her bed each day—she was up contrary to my directions, but on Wednesday she took to her bed, and was in bed after that—she got gradually worse, and on Saturday morning she could be roused with great difficulty, and she died about half-past 2 on Saturday afternoon, 21st—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I did not make it—a medical student of St. George's Hospital actually did the acting part under my direction—I saw the state she was in—there was an effusion of blood close to the injury to the right eye, and between the skin and the temporal muscle—on opening the head there was an effusion of blood over the brain about two inches in diameter, and about one-eighth of an inch in depth, extending in between the convolutions of the brain, that was exactly opposite the injury to the right eye—there, was no external mark over where the injury was; it was opposite the injury at the front—a severe blow from the fist in front striking the right temple would account for the injury at the back; it is what is called counter-stroke; it was not an exact concussion—in this case the effusion was from a very small vessel, and must have gone on very slowly—a violent blow with the fist on the Friday night would be quite consistent with the appearances I saw and death happening on the Saturday—the rest of the organs were all healthy—the trembling hands and tremulous tongue are almost always the result of drinking—the brain was healthy excepting from the injury.</p>

                  </hi>. On 30th January I applied for an order for Maryle-bone Workhouse at their office, and saw the relieving officer—the prisoner was there; I said nothing to him, but he said to me "You great beast, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to go the workhouse"—I only knew him by sight—I told him to mind his own business and not interfere with me—I was passed out of the office, and as I went down the passage he came behind me; I turned round, and he struck me on my mouth—he rolled down and I walked away—I stopped at the corner of the street, and he took up the stick he was walking with and struck me in the eye—I gave him in custody.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 22nd January, I was on duty in Lisson Grove—I heard a cry of "Police"—I went to 4, William Street and saw the prosecutrix at the door in her night dress—the prisoner was standing opposite the house—the prosecutrix said "Be quick or he will be off"—the prisoner was walking sharp—I caught him, brought him back, and she charged him—I said "Where have you been?"—he said "I have not been in there at all"—a few minutes afterwards he said "If I was there I was there for no unlawful</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My evidence at the police-court is correct; I asked him if he had been in the house—I have seen his sister; he was staying with her—I know nothing against him—I wrote this note at home about 12 o'clock after I had given my evidence—it is correct. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> Stated that he had been trying the parlour door; prisoner first denied being there, and then said 'If I was there it was not for an unlawful purpose.'") The prosecutrix first accused him of being there, then he denied it; the prosecutrix was about twenty yards off when I stopped the prisoner; he said "Very well;" nothing more till we got back to the shop; then the prosecutrix said "He has been trying my parlour door; I stood and listened"—it was when I was taking him to the station that I said "Where have you been to-night?"—he made no answer—I have been fifteen years in the force—I never had a burglar before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Oakland Street, Kennington Road, and am a joiner—on the Sunday before Christmas Day, about 10 o'clock at night, I was on the Thames Embankment, between Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars, with another lad named Wilmore, near the Temple Gardens—I had been in his company once before; we were walking by ourselves—there was somebody in front; as we were walking along two lads came up and spoke to us—they said "Do you know any one from the City Road?"—Wilmore said "No"—they said" We come from Lambeth; we hold with Lambeth, do you?"—Wilmore said" Yes"—they said "We want to pay the City Road boys if we can catch them; you say you come from Lambeth; what do you use when you fight?"—Wilmore said "We use our fists," and then they said "Do you use any of these?" and showed us a belt—Wilmore said "No," and lifted up his waistcoat, and they said "You say you come from Lambeth; we don't come from Lambeth, we come from the City Road, and we are going to pay the Lambeth <hi rend="italic">chaps"</hi>—then the one that had had all the conversation called up the gang—he said "Here are two of the Lambeth lads, thrash them," and then the one that was by the side of the one who had had all the conversation struck Wilmore on the nose with his fist; the gang then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270054"/>
               <p>came up and started thrashing us with their belts—I think there were about 20 in the gang—Casey is one of the two who first came up to us, and the one who had all the conversation, but not the one who struck the blow—I was about a yard from them when we were having the conversa-tion; we were in front of each other, face to face—Casey had a belt; he took it out of his pocket after he said a few words; it had a large square brass buckle on it; it was very much like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not see him do anything with it—the gang started thrashing me with their belts, and pulled off my hat—all that I could see had belts except the one that struck Wilmore on the nose—I was knocked down, but I got up again—my head was cut at the back, and I was bruised down the back—I saw Wilmore struck and knocked down; he was struck with the fist; nothing else that I saw—I saw the others make for him with their belts, but I could not see whether they hit him or not; the best part of them made for him—I saw him on the ground, and I ran into the road and called out for help—a gentleman came across the road to me—I did not see what he did; he went to the side of Wilmore, who was bleeding from the head; blood was running down on to the pavement—when the gentleman came across the gang ran away—I lost my hat; it was similar to the one I have now, flat on the top—Wilmore also lost his hat; the same sort as this—the best part of the gang had gone away when the gentleman came up—Wilmore fell into Casey's arms when the other one punched him on the nose, and Casey dropped him—two lads remained there after the gang ran away—I can't say whether they were two of the gang—I saw nothing in their hands; one of them asked for a handkerchief, and while asking for it a Hansom cab came up; one of them called the cab, and said "Do take them to the hospital; they have got the fare?"—the cab stopped, and the two lads put Wilmore in the cab; I got in as well, and the two lads also—I asked some young lady that was standing by for my hat—she said "I can't see your hat; get in the cab"—the gentleman walked away then—that was the only cab I saw—no cab had come up and gone away refusing to take us—I did not see any one at the horse's head—no one told the cabman where to drive; he drove us to Charing Cross Hospital—we all four went in there—the surgeon saw us—nobody paid the cabman—the two lads said they lived close by the meat market—at the hospital I heard Wilmore's name—I did not know it before; I only knew him by the name of <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>—I did not know where he lived—my head was dressed—Wilmore was detained at the hospital; I went to his house with his scarf—he told them at the hospital where he lived, and I went and told his sister that he was there; that was between 10 and 11 o'clock; then I went home—I afterwards saw Galliers when he was in custody, but did not recognise him—I saw Casey in custody in the beginning of February at Bow Street Police-station—a good many people were standing in a row, and I pointed Casey out as the man who had the conversation with us and who took the belt out of his pocket—I have no doubt about him—I had never seen him before that Sunday—I saw nothing in the possession of these people except belts—I saw no knife or file or anything of that kind.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector E</hi>). On 5th January, about 2 o'clock in the day, I went to Charing Cross Hospital, and there saw Frederick James Wilmore in the presence of the house surgeon, Dr. Cray—he made a statement to me, which I took down in writing—I read it over to him, and he signed it—he was quite conscious at that time—this is the statement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I left it with Dr. Cray—I heard that he died on 14th January—I made inquiries about this attack on the Embankment—on Monday morning, 30th Jauuary, about 8.45, I went to the workshop of Mr. Benjamin, in Henrietta Street, City Road—I knew that Galliers had been at work there—the shop was then closed—I went several times—about 9.45 I saw Galliers standing in the doorway of some model buildings next to the shop—I went up to him and said "Are you in Benjamin's employment?"—he said" Yes, I am waiting for him to open the shop"—I said "I am a police officer, and I want to ask you some questions; do you remember the Sunday before Christmas?"—he said "Yes"—I said" Where were you on that Sunday at about 10 o'clock in the evening?"—he said "Early in the evening I was in Old Street with Sarah Williams and Dickey Hustwith; after I left them I went to a coffee-shop in Old Street, on this side of the Curtain Road"—I said "Were you alone there?"—he said "Yes, I go there every Sunday; after I left there I went home"—I said "On that evening two lads were assaulted"—he interrupted me and said "Yes, I read it in the paper yesterday, and Mr. Benjamin and I were talking about it at breakfast this morning"—at that time Benjamin came up, and I went into the shop with him, leaving Galliers outside—I had some conversa-tion with Benjamin, and then returned to where Galliers was standing with Constable Compton and a sergeant—Benjamin followed, and he asked Galliers for his father's address, so that he might inform him, and he said "We were only talking about it at breakfast this morning"—Galliers said "Yes, and you asked me if I was in it"—I then said to Galliers "I am informed that you were there, and that you struck the blow; I will have to take you to the police-station for inquiry"—he said" No, I was not"—I then took him to his lodging, 45, Cowper Street, City Road, and then to Hoxton Police-station—there he was placed among seven or eight others of the same age and description as near as possible—that was some hours afterwards, about 2 o'clock—the witness Thompson was brought to see the whole of them—he failed to recognise</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270056"/>
               <p>any of them—I saw Galliers afterwards the same day—he was still detained at the station—I said to him "Let me see how your trousers are fastened or secured"—he said "I usually have a string round them; this morning I left it at home"—I saw that he had neither belt, braces, or string to secure them—I then went to 39, Henry Street, Peutonville, where Culver, the prisoner's stepfather, lived—in the meantime I had seen Thomas Parker, and I went there from what he said about 7 p.m.—I had some conversation with him, and after some hesitation he gave up to me this belt—on the outside of it there is the representation of a gate, and the initials "T. S.," with a flag on each side of the gate—it is the sort of belt that is sometimes used for fastening public-house doors back—it is not the sort of belt used for fastening up trousers; it might be used for such a purpose—next day I took Galliers before the Magistrate—there was a remand to 7th February—about 6 o'clock on the morning of 2nd February I went to Mr. Barrett's, a biscuit factory, in Shepherdess Walk, City Road—I there saw Casey; he was employed there as a stoker—I asked him his name—he said "Casey"—I said "Come this way," taking him aside; "I want to speak to you; you have heard of two young lads having been assaulted on the Embankment the Sunday before Christmas, and that one of them is dead?" he said "Yes, I have heard of it, but I was not there"—I said "Where were you on that Sunday at about 10 in the evening?" he said "On Holborn Viaduct with two young women"—I said "Who are they?" he said "I don't know their names, but I think one was Mary Ann Sullivan; I don't know where they live, and a young fellow named Adam White was with us"—I said "Where does White live?" he said "I don't know exactly, but I know him"—I then said "I have been told that you were there, and you will have to come to the police-station"—while he was dressing himself and putting on his coat he said "I don't deny that I know the young fellow you have taken; it is strange that people cannot get into trouble without wanting to bring others into it as well"—I then took him to Bow Street Police-station—I put him with eight or nine young men of the same age and dress as nearly as possible—I took Thompson there; he looked up and down the line of lads, he then turned round and looked towards me—I said "If you know any of them put your hand on them"—he then went and touched the prisoner Casey on the shoulder; that was all that passed—Casey was taken before the Magistrate that day, and he was after-wards brought up on the 7th with Galliers—I know Patrick Kennedy, who was in custody at Worship Street—I took Thompson to see him, and he failed to recognise him—the prisoners were committed for trial on 14th February—on the 23rd I went to the House of Detention with Mr. Eldridge, a clerk to the Solicitor of the Treasury—Casey was brought into the waiting-room—Mr. Eldridge said to him "Casey, I understand you desire to make a statement;" he said "Yes"—Mr. Eldridge said "We will ask you nothing, you can say what you wish, it will be taken down in writing, and you will have to sign it;" he said "Yes, I do want to make a statement to clear myself"—he then made a statement which Mr. Eldridge took down in writing at the time, without being asked questions—it was then read over to him, and he was asked if it was correct; he said "Yes," and signed each sheet and signed it at the end, and I witnessed it—this is the statement—Casey gave the address of 12, Galloway Street, City Road, where he was taken into custody; that is</p>

               <p>about a quarter of an hour's walk from where Galliers lives. (<hi rend="italic">The statement was then read as follows:</hi>—"I was at the corner of Pitfield Street, Hoxton, on Sunday before Christmas. About a dozen or sixteen chaps came up to me, and asked me if I would go down the Embank-ment; I said 'No, I have got to get up to work to morrow morning early to make a good week.' They said Don't;' I said 'No, I'm not coming.' They went on towards Type Street, Bunhill Row. I thought about taking a walk round this street. It was about 8 o'clock when they first spoke to me. I took a good walk round by myself, thinking about going home, but I saw Adam White and Mary Ann Sullivan and another young girl just down by Type Street. They said 'Are you going for a walk?' I said 'No, I think I will go home.' We were walking along, and got as far as the Holborn Viaduct. We went up Holborn, and down one of the turnings which led us into Fleet Street, just by where the archway (Temple Bar) used to be. We took a little walk along, about two or three minutes, and then went down one of the turnings on the left hand side of Fleet Street, down some steps which led us on to the Embankment. We crossed the road on the Embankment to the river side. We saw a young chap lying down on the footway. We said to a chestnut woman there who was selling chestnuts 'Who did it?' She said 'A gang of chaps.' She said 'I wouldn't go up there too far if I was you.' I said 'No, unless I get an unlucky blow.' I said 'Are you coming home, Adam?' The two girls said 'Yes.' We got on to the corner of the kerb; stepping into the road, I halloed out 'Why don't you put him into a cab?' One cab was going along in the road. I halloed out 'Take this man to the hospital.' I said 'He has hurt himself, he is bleeding.' The cabman said 'Not me,' and drove on, and halloed out something like 'He will make my carriage in a mess.' There was another cab just behind it, so I said to the cabman 'Take this man to the hospital,' and ran to the head of the horse with the intention of getting hold of the horse, but the cabman drove close into the kerb against the water, and two young chaps picked the one up that was bleeding. I believe that the one who picked the man up who was bleeding was Jack Evans, better known as <hi rend="italic">Toffey,</hi> and a chap they call <hi rend="italic">Jack the Sailor.</hi> I put my hand at the back of the wounded chap, and Jack Evans and <hi rend="italic">Jack the Sailor</hi> got into the cab, and another boy as well, and we got the wounded man into the cab. The cabman drove off with four of them in it. I shouted out 'Take him to the nearest hospital.' I then walked across the road with the intention of going home. The chestnut woman followed us across and said to us 'I will take good care I don't stay out after 9 or half-past of a night if there is going to be this every Sunday night.' I said 'The people who did it ought to get punished.' We then went up the steps into Fleet Street and got down to Temple Bar, and the chestnut woman said 'Good night,' and we all said 'Good night,' and we saw no more of her after she got across the road. We went towards home, and I left them in Old Street. I went home up Bath Street; I went indoors, and got into bed. This was about a quarter to 11. On the next night (Monday), about half-past 8, I went into Pitfield Street, and I heard two or three of them talking about the Thames Embankment. I said 'Some of you will catch it before long.' Joe Plenty, living in a muffin-shop at the corner of a court in Noble Street, had a bit of string with blood on it; he said 'That's the way we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270060"/>
               <p>carry the blood about.' I said 'You ought to be caught with the string.' He laughed, and said 'You go to b——,' so I said 'Ah. you will <hi rend="italic">cop</hi> it before long, all of you.' I then went home again. This was about a quarter-past 11. I heard no more of it until just a little before I was taken into custody (the day before) Tom Barrett asked me if I knew anything about it. I said 'No, I wasn't there,' so he said 'They have got one of your <hi rend="italic">blokes.'</hi> I said 'They can have a lot more if they like, they can't touch me; what are they going to touch me for? I have done nothing.' Tom Barrett said 'Oh, you will be the next one.' I said 'When I have done anything I will be the next one.' I laughed at him, and walked away. I turned back again, and he said 'You know who done it, don't you? You must know who done it.' I said 'From what I have heard it was Joe Rayner who did it (he is a clockmaker working for his father down Lever Street, opposite Nelson Street). Patrick Kennedy, I heard, knocked him down with a file, and Joe Plenty and Joe Rayner were the two who spoke to the two chaps on the Embank-ment first. I heard no more about it till the Tuesday that we were fully committed for trial. I said to Galliers while we were in the cell at Bow Street, when my sister and Tom Barrett's wife and another young woman who lodges with my sister were present, 'Who did it?' He said 'I believe Patrick Kennedy knocked him down with a file.' I said 'Who gave you the hat?' He said 'Patrick Kennedy.' I said 'Whose hat was it?' he said 'I believe the chap's hat who we knocked about.' I said 'Is that the hat?' so he said 'No, I tore that up.' He said 'There was blood in it.' I said 'Oh, you must have been there; why didn't you say so, and let the innocent free? He said 'I am not going to say so to get myself knocked about if I get out of it.' He then told me that Joe Rayner had a big buckle with a piece of string tiod to it, and he knocked the chap down, and Joe Plenty spoke to him before he was knocked down, then Joe Plenty called the gang over. I said 'Oh, what did they do when they came over?' He said 'Oh, they all knocked him about then.' He said 'You lay it all on to me.' I said 'I can't lay it on to myself because I was not there.' He said 'Ah, you'll get off.' I said 'I don't know.' We were then taken off in the police van. There was Patrick Kennedy, Joe Rayner, Thomas Galliers (the prisoner), Ben Oakley and Bill Oakley, Joe Plenty, and others among the gang that spoke to me in Pitfield Street about going on to the Embankment I told my sister to go to Mr. Barrett, and ask him to write to the inspector that I wanted to see him to make this statement I have now made to show that I am innocent.—(Signed) J.

I was in this Court on Saturday morning, between 10 and 11, and saw a number of men being tried for a riot at Hackney—among them was Patrick Kennedy—he was the man that I took Thompson to Worship Street to identify—Kennedy was at liberty on the night of 18th December—Sarah Williams, a witness in this prosecution, made a communication to me at 2 o'clock on the date of Galliers'a arrest—Galliers was actually charged at 10 o'clock at night on 30th January—I detained him from 10 in the morning till 10 at night, and then charged him—at that time I had heard about the statement of Sarah Williams and the statement about the belt—I had him in custody after I had recovered the bolt—I was examined the day following at the</p>

One asked where we belonged to. I said 'Lambeth.' He said 'I come from the City Road.' He then called out to a number of his companions, who were standing outside, 'Here are two Lambeth lads; pay them.' One then struck me with a belt with a buckle on it, and another stabbed me on the head with a knife. There were twenty or thirty of them in all. When I was struck I fell down on the pavement, and remember nothing more until I found myself in the hospital. It was the two men who first spoke to us that assaulted me—they were about 18 years of age, and were dressed as working lads. "</p>

I lived with my brother, Frederick James Wilmore, at 5, York Street, Lambeth—on Sunday night, 18th December, I was out with him—we went to the Thames Embankment—we got there between 9 and 10 o'clock—we were walking towards Blackfriars Bridge on the river side—I was in front with a young man, a friend of mine—my brother was behind—after we had gone some way between 20 and 30 men passed us, coming from Lambeth—before passing us they spoke to three gentlemen about slapping their faces—the gentlemen went on, and the men passed us—they did nothing to me; they were walking along, talking rather loudly—my brother was a few yards behind me, I could not say exactly how far—I walked on towards Blackfriars Bridge—I heard my brother halloa out, "Hold on"—I turned round, but could</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packer, and live at 12, Chatham Gardens, Hoxton—I know the prisoner James Casey—on Sunday night, December 18th, I saw him at the top of Type Street, Chiswell Street, just after 9 o'clock—two young girls were with me, Lizzie Hammond and Mary Ann Sullivan—Casey came up as we were standing there—he said, "Will you come for a walk?" and the four of us went straight down Chiswell Street to the Meat Market, through Chancery Lane, and brought us out by the Strand; I could not tell you the name, we went down a turning which brought us out by the Embankment—we went down some steps somewhere near the Temple Station—when we got down to the bottom of the steps just across the road we saw a crowd—I said to Hammond, "Let us come across the road and see what's up"—we saw the deceased lying down on the footpath bleeding, holding his hand up to his head—I said to him, "Who <hi rend="italic">done</hi> this?"—he said," Some lads from the City Road," whereupon Lizzie Hammond called Mary Ann Sullivan and Casey across—presently a Hansom cab comes by—we all stopped there—a young woman with some chestnuts came about two yards off—some conversation took place between Sullivan and her; I did not hear it—Casey halloed out for the cab to stop—the cabman did not like to stop at first; he drove on a little way, and I got hold of the reins to stop the horse—I told him to stop, and I think Casey told him to stop, that the young man had money to pay for it—with that Casey and another young man helped the deceased into the cab—two young <hi rend="italic">chaps,</hi> strangers, got into the cab with him—another young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> came running up and said," I want to get into the cab too, I am hurt"—his head was bleeding at the back—he was with the deceased when we first went over—he got into the cab, and it went off with the four young men, leaving Casey and me and the two young women standing on the Embankment, and the chestnut woman—she said," I have to get my living on here," and she told us not to go up any farther, and with that we went up the steps and went the same way home—we left the chestnut woman just at the top of the steps—Casey went back home with us.</p>

Pitman and Oliver's, close on twelve months—I lost my situation about three weeks ago, by going up to Bow Street—Casey's father told me to go to Bow Street, but I was not called as a witness—I did not see the solicitor defending Casey—I was in Court when the in-quiry was going on—Sullivan and Hammond went with me—I only went once; and when I went to my situation next morning they asked where I had been, I said to Bow Street, and they said" We have got somebody in your place"—I have known Casey about six months—I never used to be with him; I knew him by passing him now and again and speaking to him—I did not know where he lived; I knew where he worked—I had never been out with him before—I had known Sullivan</p>

Gate gang, or the City Road gang—I have heard that there is such a gang—I do not know Galliers at all—I saw him at Bow Street—I might have seen him before, living round there, but not to speak to him—I did not know him by any name—I never go by any nickname.</p>

               <p>12, 19th, and 26th—I have taken out from the invoices the amount of goods the defendant purchased between 15th January and 26th March——it is 304<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it may be more—that is for raw material—he puts down in the wages book 178<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for wages paid in the same period—my experience as a trustee is principally in the boot trade—178<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in wages would in the ordinary way represent that amount of manufactured goods, and would bring out 534<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of manufactured stock which he had to deal with during that period—I have taken out the amounts which he has entered in the sales book between those periods—it amounts to about 274<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which leaves about 259<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unaccounted for as far as I can trace—I took possession of 76 pairs of slippers and a few pairs of boots, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of raw material—all I took was worth about 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last entry in the sales book is Feb. 22nd, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., against which is "By cheque 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., returned on box 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—making it appear that Mrs. Downs's debt was paid—I discovered it afterwards and gave Mrs. Downs notice not to pay it—I ultimately received the amount from her, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no entry of that as a debt outstanding—the last entry is Gainsford, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not received anything from Gainsford, and it does not appear to have been paid—before any of these discoveries were made the defendant's mother offered to buy the estate—among other things I received were certain trade fixtures, plant, and different things—I ultimately considered it the interest of the estate to sell it to the defendant's mother for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the instructions of the committee—I had no knowledge then of the transactions which are being inquired into—I only knew of the diminution of the stock by hearsay——there is no entry in the books, of any sales to Lovelace in March, or of the receipt of money from him—no cash book or ledger was kept that I am aware of—I have looked at his pass book and find that the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque did not pass through at all.</p>

Stanley, 164, Queen Victoria Street, one share, but it is written here Harvey; then follows a number of nominees with a bracket against them Ida, Rhoda, and Hastings Stanley, with others, as nominees of H. C. Stanley; there is no address against them—John James Blake is the secretary, with 101 shares, and in another place I find that he has 19 nominees; the next name is J. J. Walker, with 19 names of nominees bracketed against him—a large number of shareholders are described as newspaper proprietors—by resolution passed on 13th March, 1876, and registered at a later date, the name of the company is changed from the "Government Securities Co<lb/>operative Fire Insurance Company, Limited," to the "Government Securities Fire Insurance Company, Limited.

(<hi rend="italic">This was stamped with a Coronet, and dated from Clyde Villa, Romford, enclosing a prospectus of the company, and saying that he should not be disposed to part with more than</hi> 30 <hi rend="italic">shares, and would receive jewellery in payment.

Smith and Son having my breakfast, when some of the prisoners and another man came to me and said it was the last meal I should take, and had I got any dying speech to make—then one of them said they had come to the conclusion that I had got to sustain the penalty they had inflicted on me, and that I was to go down into a tank—I was sitting on a form, which was pulled from under me, and I was thrown to the ground and a rope was thrown over my head; I got that off with my hands—another rope was put round my body and legs, and I was dragged to the door and down the steps head foremost—I felt the blood ran to my head, which caused a bursting sensation, and I remembered no more until I found myself in the stables with a lot of slime and stuff over my face—I had been saturated with water—then somebody stuck something into my hip to try and revive me—when I came to somebody was holding a sponge which smelt of wine, and some of the prisoners said how I lapped it in—while I was struggling for my breath three buckets of water came over me, which took away my breath—then I was taken up by Mathews, and my wet clothes were taken off, and I was given some hot tea—I went out afterwards to do my work, and I fainted on the cart and fell off because I was so unnerved, and I had no use of my limbs—this was on the Saturday, and I remained in bed all Sunday—on Monday I went to the doctor, and in consequence of what he said I kept ray bed for seven or eight days, and the prisoners were remanded because I was unable to attend—with the exception of the circumstance of the boys being prosecuted I had not given the prisoners any cause for their conduct.</p>

I saw Blatch on the Monday after the alleged assault—he was suffering from general nervous irritability, and complained of a pain in his left side and left leg—he had several sores on his legs; old ones for which I had attended him before—his system had received a severe shock—he had varicose veins on his legs—the sores on his legs appeared to have been caused by the rubbing of the varicose veins,</p>

I am a barmaid, and live at 262, Waterloo Road, Lambeth—on Wednesday night, 8th February, I had been to the Royal Albert Docks to see a friend who was on board the Mira—I did not see him because the ship had gone out before I got there—I arrived at the docks about 9.30 at the latest—I was returning along Canton Street, Poplar—I saw the prisoner leaning against the railings of a house on the left-hand side of the street—he asked me if I would help him to a night's lodging, as he was a stranger in London, just come up from the country, and did not know where to go—I took compassion on him, and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was carrying my purse in my bosom—he took the sixpence, and before I could get my purse back again he put his hand on my throat and took it away—I was not able to shout at first—a window on the opposite side of the street was opened—I screamed "Police" and "Murder," and the prisoner ran away—he thrust me up against the railings, and I could not speak for a little while; I was rendered almost senseless—a policeman came up, and I gave him a description of the prisoner, and showed him the way he had gone—we walked till we met another policeman, and the first spoke to the other—about a quarter of an hour after the policeman brought the prisoner into Ellesmere Street—I said "That is the man"—I had no doubt—he said "I have not got any money about me"—I had in my purse 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I left Waterloo about 10.30 a. m.—I did not know my way, and I went to several places wrong—I got to Poplar about 3 p.m.—I was going all day—I took a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> at the end of Fleet Street to St. Paul's Churchyard, where I got out and took another to Poplar—I never went into any house till I got to Poplar—I went into a public-house where the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> stopped, and had some bread and cheese and a glass of stout—then I walked over the iron bridge to Canning Town Station; then I took a ticket to the Custom House Station, and then to the Royal Docks—when I found the ship had gone I came back—I went out of my way several times—I wandered about the streets—it was 1.30 a. m. when the prisoner spoke to me—I have been a barmaid at the Spring Grove Hotel, Kingston-on<lb/>Thames—my mistress left, and I went to live in the Waterloo Road—I was not in employment at this time; I had left the Spring Grove Hotel about a fortnight—I am engaged to be married in April.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I left my situation because the proprietor sold the hotel, and I did not like the next people—I do not know London well—I am not certain of the time I left home.</p>

John (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) said, 'Yes, you have got them,' and John attempted to enter Antonio's bunk to get the mittens. Antonio pushed John away, and John pushed Antonio away.

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of 140, Essex Road, Islington—the prisoner came into my service as general servant on the evening of 2nd January—I had another servant, a nursemaid, named Chipperfield—on 10th January the prisoner gave notice to leave at the end of her month, my wife gave her notice—on 12th January we had a fire in our bedroom between 9 and 10 in the evening—Chipperfield said something to me on this evening, and I went up to my bedroom and found the bed and bedding on fire; the valence alongside the bed was in flames, the counterpane was burning, and the sheets and blankets damaged; also the pillows and mattress, and an Eider down quilt—I thought at the time that the fire had been caused by a coal flying out from the fire; we had a fire in our bed<lb/>room that night—it was three or four feet from the bed—the prisoner assisted in carrying up water to put out the fire—on Saturday evening, the 14th, about 8.30, we had another fire, in the back parlour—one of my assistants gave the alarm—I noticed a reflection in the shop, and I went in, and found a horse with linen before the fire in flames, and a blind about 9 or 10 feet on a skylight above was burning—the room is about 11 or 12 feet high—the wainscoting of the room was scorched and burnt near where the linen was; it appeared to have been scorched from the burning linen—I asked the prisoner how that fire occurred—she said she did not know anything about it—at 9 next morning, Sunday, 15th; we had another</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270104"/>
               <p>fire, in the kitchen—I went in and saw a sheet burning hanging on a chair about four feet away from the fire; the prisoner was in the room—I put that fire out—I inquired how it occurred—she said she did not know—about 1 or 2 in the afternoon we had another fire—my wife smelt something burning; I went into the kitchen and found an apron belonging to the prisoner in flames hanging on a nail, upon which was a waterproof and some other garment belonging to the nursemaid, on a meat<lb/>safe about 10 feet from the fire—there was smoke in the kitchen—the prisoner was upstairs when that fire was discovered—I put it out—my wife gave the alarm on the stairs, and the prisoner came down—I inquired how the fire happened—she said she did not know—about 5 o'clock that day as I was going upstairs I noticed a very bright light in the nursery—I went in and found a horse with clothes on fire, and scarcely any fire in the grate—the horse was between two and three feet in front of the grate—I inquired of the prisoner how that occurred—she said she did not know, but everything she touched seemed to catch fire—about 7 I went into the nursery again; the prisoner was in the room—I then found the bed and bedding on fire—the bed was on the opposite side of the room to the fire, about six feet from the fire<lb/>place, and there was not a spark of fire in the grate—the fire was about the centre of the bed, on the top, the counterpane and blankets were partially destroyed, and the side of the bed—I asked the prisoner how it occurred; how she did it—she made no reply—I sent for a constable, and she was given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About two months before the prisoner came into our service a pillow accidentally caught fire before the fire on the kitchen fender—Chipperfield was then in the service—our general servant then was Louisa Harlow—she was afterwards discharged, but not in connection with that fire—she was blamed for carelessness; she was not charged with the fire—I was not present when that fire was discovered; she was not accused of causing it—a shop blind in my warehouse was also on fire before the prisoner entered our service; that was about the end of October or the beginning of November; that Was when Chipperfield was in the service—it was through a gas bracket under the blind; the bracket was turned the wrong way, and it set fire to the blind—I said so at the police-court, and that that fire was never explained—the next fire after that was the pillow catching fire—during the time Chipperfield was in my employ<lb/>ment we had two general servants, Harlow and one called Elizabeth; they were both discharged, one at the end of October and one on 31st December—Harlow went away at 9 o'clock; she had notice in the morning; I believe besides the fire we had several things broken<lb/>Elizabeth did not suit us—when the prisoner came into our service we received a very fair character with her, I believe from a Mrs. Walton—I believe it was a six months' character—our bedroom is on the second floor; the dining<lb/>room is on the basement—our bed was between three and four feet from the fire—we have fire screens, but they were not on—Chipperfield was the first person who gave the alarm, between 9 and 10 o'clock on Thursday, the 12 th—she gave alarm twice, I believe—the nursery is on the first floor—I did not hear Chipperfield accuse the prisoner of setting the things on fire—the prisoner's general answer when I asked how the fires occurred was "I don't know"—about the last fire she made</p>

               <p>no reply—I do not know who lighted the fire in our bedroom that night; I believe the nurse took a fender up—I don't know how many times she went up into that room before she gave the alarm of fire—she took the fender up before she gave the alarm—I don't know whether she then came down and went up a second time—I don't know where the prisoner was then; she assisted to carry water up—I heard on Tuesday, the 10th, that the prisoner was to leave; I can't tell whether she gave notice or not—on the Sunday afternoon I was at home the nurse went out about 3 o'clock, and I let her in about 4.40 or 4.45, and she went upstairs—no fire occurred while she was out.</p>

The mere setting fire to an article in the house, which might have set fire to the house itself will not do. There must be an intent, or something from which an intent may be inferred, to injure the house. A mere intent to injure the owner by destroying his goods in the house is not sufficient. The object of the enactment was to provide against this state of things. Before the statute, to set fire to goods in a house with the express intent to burn the house did not amount to more than a misdemeanour, namely, an attempt to commit the crime of arson, unless some part of the house was actually burnt, in which case the crime amounted to arson. The real object of the statute was to make such an attempt to fire the house, by setting fire to goods in it, a felony, and not a mere misdemeanour.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">In my opinion that would not do. If a person maliciously, with intent to injure another by merely burning his goods, sets fire to such goods in his house, that does not in my opinion amount to a felony, even though the house catches fire, unless indeed the circumstances are such as to show that the person setting fire to the goods knew that by so doing he would probably cause the house also to take fire, in which latter case there would be strong evidence that lie intended to bring about the probable conse<lb/>quence—viz., the burning of the house. If the prisoner put coals on the bed, and then immediately called out" Fire!" so that there, was little chance of the house being burnt, or if she spitefully set fire to the curtains, thinking that only the curtains would be burnt, but against her wish the house caught fire, would that be arson?</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the London Salvage Corps—on the morning of 14th September I went to 108, Lancaster Gate—the fire had then been extinguished—I made an examination of the boudoir; the floor was burnt a great deal underneath the frame of the picture, about eight feet in length and about three feet wide—that was the only portion of the room which was burnt—from the appearance I should think there had been two or three fires; they were disconnected—the joists were burnt in several places, and they were intersected by two or three which were not burnt at all—the lower portion of the frame nearest the floor as you entered the room was burnt through at the lefthand corner, and the sides were blackened—the lower part was properly the side of the picture in the way it stood, but it was the bottom of the frame as it then stood—the top of the frame was slightly burnt, and a great portion of the backing of the picture—I examined the canvas, part of the edges of the picture were burnt, and the remainder that was not touched by the fire indicated plainly that a knife had been used to cut the picture out—at the back there were marks of a knife, and of some oil, about a foot in length, as if it had run down from a person's hand; that was six, seven, or eight inches wide—the drawing<lb/>room was marked very extensively with smoke, the whole of the furniture was smothered—there was a greater deposit on the marble mantel<lb/>piece of the inner drawingroom, and on a piece of statuary close by, than the other part, though it was farthest from the fire—that was 58 or 60 feet from the boudoir door—I should think the fire had been burning seven or eight hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crossexamined by Harris.</hi> Some of the flooring had been torn up, not all—portions of the top of the flooring were burnt through—five pieces of the joists were burnt, three on one side and two on the other—my reason for saying the fire was in two or three places is from the marks and smoke on the wall, and the planking itself—I could tell by the look of it that it was not a continuous fire—I only give it as my opinion.</p>

The frame was a flat one, and fitted flat on the floor-<lb/>having gold preparation on it would prevent its catching light like ordi<lb/>nary wood—they must have used something else to light it—it could be set fire to by putting turpentine or some other inflammable material—about one half or a little more of the bottom part was burnt—I could not tell whether it had been lighted at more than one spot. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HEARN</hi>: The frame stood in the same position on the 13th.) If it had been set fire to in one or two places it would be likely to produce the sort of fire I saw—it would take a considerable time to burn, but the probability is that the planking had been taken up and put down loose afterwards, and in that way assisted to set light to the frame—the flooring underneath was concrete, to render it fireproof, and the boards could not have been burnt through without they had been disarranged before—it is possible that the setting fire to the frame may have burnt the floor, but some of the</p>

               <p>planking fitted in next the wall—the lower part was burnt more than the upper, where the picture stood—my opinion is that fire must hare been placed underneath the boards—the planking that was burnt was exactly where the picture stood—they were not all burnt, more on the under side—about two of those farthest from the wall were burnt a little more on the upper side, burnt right through, gradually eaten away as the fire travelled.</p>

I was Mr. Hearn's foreman in August, and was at work at 108, Lancaster Crate—I was there on 13th September<lb/>some time that morning I lifted the cloth that covered the picture and the picture was then safe, I put my hand upon it—about ten minutes to six the last man left the work—I count them one after the other—to the best of my belief I counted them that night—I was standing in the kitchen doorway—there is a long passage from the kitchen to the area door, with rooms on each side; also a servant's staircase leading to the top of the house—Harris was there that day—to the best of my belief I saw him leave, I can't swear that I did—I was the last of the workmen to leave—I returned the next morning about three minutes before half-past six—the door was just open, waiting for us—I was the first to enter—shortly after my arrival I went up to the boudoir, on the first landing—I saw fire on both sides of the doorway—I opened the door leading into the drawing<lb/>room, and called the men to assist me—Harris was there among others, and he assisted in extinguishing the fire—we did it with pails of water—the workmen took up the boards by my orders—I can't say whether they came up easily, because the mem were excited and picked them up all alight.</p>

He is already in prison; he is a cousin's husband, and has been a complete scamp since he was married, therefore I could not give evidence against him; but you would have to charge me with the unlawful possession of the painting, when you will find out I had nothing to do with the taking the painting any more than your<lb/>self, as I did not see the painting till the Sunday evening after it was taken, when it was put where it is now; but his wife is going to move, and he has threatened to murder his wife and children if the painting is not kept for her, or if it is destroyed. He has been sent away, and you will have no trouble to convict him of it, if he is sent for trial.

I am a jeweller of 14, Ann Street, Islington—on 21st February, about 12.30 a. m., I was with Revett at the corner of Shepherdess Walk, near the prisoner's shop—he is a butcher there—I have seen him frequently in passing, but did not know him—he came towards us and said "Good evening, gentlemen," and asked me if I would drink a drop of whisky—I said "No, I am a teetotaler as regards spirits; my friend might have a drink"—he handed Revett a flask and said" As regards teetotalers, a man who drinks in moderation is better than a teetotaler"—as he said that a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> came and tapped me on the shoulder and said something about a club—I had seen her before—I said" I don't go to the club, and I don't know anything about the club"—the prisoner said that "I was a b jackass, only my ears were not long enough"—he pointed to the <hi rend="italic">facia</hi> in the street and said" I done that with a quill pen"—I said" Did you?"—he said "Yes, I am a collegian, I have been to college for seven years, and I am a pugilist. Do you know the meaning of the word 'pugilist'?"—I said" No"—he said" Shall I explain it to you?"—I said" Yes"—he said "Pu'is 'hit; 'gi'is 'hard;' and list' is 'b hard,'" and knocked me down with his fist—that was my first lesson in the art—I got up and struck him again—I then saw him presenting this revolver at me—I knocked it down on to my hip, and then I heard the report, and the bullet went through the cuff of my sleeve and through my coat and struck me on my hip and made a great bruise—the prisoner tried to get in at his door, but I knocked him down, and the policeman took him—I had not provoked him in any way.</p>

I live at Felix House, Priory Street, Colchester, and am a stamp manufacturer—in November, 1881, I purchased of Mr. John Lee, of Colchester, the stock and business of the East London Manufacturing Company, carried 'on at Stratford—1 saw the prisoner, who was the manager of the business at that time, and I continued to employ him as manager, and supplied him with goods for the business, which <hi rend="smallCaps">WM</hi> for the sale of knife and fork cleaning machines and endorsing stamps—I manufacture an article called the" Repellant," and I advertised it in the newspapers—I supplied the prisoner with a stock of the" Repellant" and other things to sell—it was his duty to open letters addressed to him, and dispatch goods, and keep a set of books, and render to me a balance<lb/>sheet showing the amount of goods ordered—he had to account for the money he received—he kept a parcels' book in which the articles were to be entered that were sent out, and it was signed by the railway company's carman—in consequence of differences which arose I discharged the prisoner on Saturday, 21st January—three days before his discharge I went to the premises and took possession of all the goods and papers and sent them to Colchester—I found a number of letters from persons complaining of goods not being sent—I then issued a circular and sent to my customers—I do not find any entry of Payne, or Skeates, or Worsley in the book—there is an entry of" Payne 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. here—the prisoner's wages were 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week and 11/4 per cent, commission, and his rent free—these three</p>

I am Coroner's Officer to Mr. Carttar, the Coroner of West Kent—on Monday, 9th January, about 9 am, the prisoner came to the Woolwich Police<lb/>station; he said he came to report the death of his child—I asked him to state the circumstances—I asked him what the child died of; he said small<lb/>pox—I asked him if then. were any other children in the house with small<lb/>pox, and how long the child had been suffering from small<lb/>pox; he said since the 27th of Decem<lb/>ber—I asked him if he had called in a medical man; he said "No, he did not believe in one"—I then asked him if there were any more children suffering from it in the house; he said "Yes;" I think he said they were getting better, I heard so afterwards—I reported the case to the Coroner and the sanitary officer and the relieving officer—I then went to too prisoner's house on two occasions; the wife prevented my removing the body—I went on a third occasion, on the 9th January, the same day, and saw the prisoner there, and he allowed me to remove the body—I told him I had the Coroner's order to remove it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., living at Woolwich. My attention was drawn first to the child on 9th January, the same day that the body was removed from the house—I saw it in the act of removal from the house to the con<lb/>veyance it was taken in—I found that the child had been suffering from small<lb/>pox—small<lb/>pox is a disease that requires skilled advice, great atten<lb/>tion, and great care; if not properly cared for it is calculated to spread—in my judgment it requires medical skill—I made a post<lb/>mortem examination of the body—it was covered with confluent pustules; all the organs were healthy—death was due to confluent small<lb/>pox, without a question—<lb/>I think the life of the deceased might have been probably prolonged if medical skill had been called in; but I would rather put it in this way, that the chances of the boy's life would have been increased by having medical advice—I heard the prisoner's wife examined before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Small<lb/>pox was fully developed, and was of a confluent character—that would be the most dangerous character of the disease—it is not by any means a fact that in the treatment of small<lb/>pox when the disease is pronounced, no drugs are used—there is not a great difference of medical opinion as to the use of drugs when the disorder is pronounced—mild cases require no treatment except an abundance of fresh air—that is the most essential mode of treating. cases of small<lb/>pox—careful nursing and sufficient ventilation are two most important elements no doubt, but not the only ones.</p>

I am a baker at Evelyn Street, Deptford—I was in the shop parlour asleep—my wife came in—we had some conversation—I went to look for the prisoners with Bolton—in coming back to the shop we saw them in a porkbutcher's, about 250 yards from the shop<lb/>that was nearly half an hour after we left the shop—I watched them out, then I went into the porkbutcher's—I said something to a woman and came out again—I went to the station, leaving Bolton to follow them—I found two constables—we afterwards mot them together, and I said in their hearing that I would give them in charge for cheating my <hi rend="italic">Missis</hi>—both said "I have never been in the shop"—at the station they denied all knowledge of each other—I said "Very likely they have the peas in the bag"—they said "We have not any peas with us"—Bowers said "The lady is quite a stranger to me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of the Blenheim House School at Wimbledon—I had a pupil named Percy Malcolm John—he had been with me three years, and would have been 19 years of age on 18th December—he was placed with me by Mr. Chapman, his brother-in-law—he was paralysed in the lower limbs and unable to walk,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270136"/>
               <p>and there were for his use two wheel chairs, one of which was kept on the second<lb/>floor, where he slept, and the other in the basement, where he was during the day—in December two or three other boys occupied the same room with him—they were Bell, Hay, and another, whose name I do not recollect—it was the custom for one of the boys to carry him every morning from the second<lb/>floor to the basement for him to spend the day, and to carry him up again at night in the same way—on Saturday, 3rd December, he was carried down in the usual way to the basement—I saw him from time to time during the day, and with the exception of the paralysis in the lower limbs he was in perfect health and spirits—during the three years he was with me he was only attended by a doctor for ordinary ailments, for no serious illness—he was usually cheerful, but at times despondent, particularly when he saw the other boys enjoying a game; he was particularly fond of games, although not able to join in them—on Friday, 2nd December, he was not visited by any one—he in<lb/>formed me that he expected a visit—the letter produced is in the prisoner's handwriting, but I did not see it till after the death. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was read, and was as follows:</hi> "Nelson's Hotel, Great Portland Street, Lon<lb/>don, Dec. 1, 1881.—My dear Percy,—I had intended running down to Wimbledon to see you to<lb/>day, but I have been delayed by various matters until it is now nearly 6 o'clock, and by the time I should reach Blenheim House you would probably be preparing for bed. I leave for Paris and Florence to<lb/>morrow, and wish to see you before going. So I purpose to run down to your place as early as I can, for a few minutes even, if I can accomplish no more.—Believe me, dear boy, your loving brother, G. H. <hi rend="smallCaps">LAMSON. ")</hi> On Saturday, 3rd December, the prisoner called at five minutes to 7 o'clock in the evening—I cannot say how long it was since I had last seen him; it must have been some weeks—I knew that he was the deceased's brother-in-law, and that he had married one sister and Mr. Chapman the other—I saw the prisoner in the hall when he called, and at first I did not know him—he was very much thinner, and I remarked to him how much he had changed since I had last seen him—I took him through the drawing<lb/>room into the dining<lb/>room on the ground floor, where the boys usually see their friends—he said he had come to see his brother-in-law, and I sent for the deceased—Mr. Banbury, one of the pupils, carried him up from the basement into the dining<lb/>room and put him into a chair—the prisoner said to Mr. Banbury "I thought you would have been in India by this time," referring to his passing into the Army—the prisoner then said to the deceased" Why, how fat you are looking, Percy, old boy," and the deceased replied "I wish I could say the same of you, George"—Mr. Banbury then left the room—I asked the prisoner whether he would have some wine, and he replied that he would take some sherry—knowing his fondness for sherry I got a large claret glass from the waggon and poured him out some sherry into it—after a conversation upon several subjects, the prisoner asked me for some sugar, saying that these wines contained a large quantity of brandy, and that the sugar would destroy the alcoholic effects—I told him I understood the contrary was the case—I rang the bell for some sugar—Mrs. Bowles, the matron, brought a basin containing white pow<lb/>dered sugar—the prisoner put some sugar into the sherry, stirred it with his penknife, and then drank a portion of the wine—he had a black leather bag with him at the time and he took from it some Dundee cake</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270137"/>
               <p>and some sweets—he cut some of the cake with his penknife, and I took some of it and some of the sweets—the deceased took some cake and sweets as well—I did not see the deceased take any wine—the prisoner was eating the cake daring the whole of the interview—after talking for some little time upon general matters, at a quarter-past 7 o'clock the prisoner said "Oh, by the way, Mr. Bedbrook, when I was in America I thought of you and your boys; I thought what excellent things these capsules would be for your boys to take nauseous medicines in"—he then produced two boxes containing capsules from his bag, and passed one in the direction where I was standing, saying "I should like you to try one, to see how easily they can be swallowed"—after examining them I took one out of the box and put it in my mouth—I opened them the same as one would a pill<lb/>box—the box was handed to me open—it was hardly half full—the capsules were precisely like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—holding it in my hand the heat of my hand made it exceedingly soft, and I was able very easily to swallow it—the other box was immediately in front of him—I do not think the capsules were all the same size—while I was examining the capsule, which was empty, I saw the prisoner filling another with sugar from the basin in front of him, with a small spade spoon—I could not say where he took it from—he had the capsule between his fingers, and, having apparently filled it with sugar, he said" If you shake it in this way it will bring the medicine down to one end"—he then handed the capsule to the deceased, who was sitting on his right, about a yard from him, and said "Here, Percy, you are a swell pill<lb/>taker; take this, and show Mr. Bedbrook how easily it may be swallowed," or words to that effect—the deceased placed the cap<lb/>sule in his mouth as far back as he could to the root of the tongue, and with one gulp it was gone—I remarked" That's soon gone, my boy"—the prisoner then said "I must be going now"—I at once looked at the time<lb/>card to see the next train for London; it was then 7.20 or there<lb/>abouts, and I told him the next train left at 7.21, and advised him to go at once or he would miss it; I had previously asked him to remain a little longer till the next train, which was 7.50—he said "I cannot, because I have to catch a train at 8 o'clock at London Bridge <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for the Continent"—he told me he was going to Florence <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Paris—my house is close to the Wimbledon Station of the South<lb/>Western Railway, not a minute's walk from it—he stayed more than another minute, and I remarked that he would miss the train if he did not go at once—he said "I intend to go to Florence for a few months for the benefit of my health, and then return and settle down in England"—he then said good<lb/>bye to the deceased—I accompanied him through the drawing<lb/>room to the street door, and remarked to him that I thought the curvature of the deceased's spine was getting worse—he said that he did not think the boy could last long—I made no reply—he left the house at 21 or 22 minutes past 7 o'clock, leaving behind the two boxes of capsules; I placed them upon the waggon in the dining<lb/>room—the prisoner, within five minutes of the deceased swallowing the capsule, said "I must be going"—after he left I returned to the dining<lb/>room, where the deceased was—the cake and sweets were removed on to the dinner<lb/>waggon in the course of an hour, and I think the sugar<lb/>basin also—I had visitors that evening; two young ladies went into the dining<lb/>room where the deceased was, and played music and sang glees for ten or fifteen minutes—I left the room with them, but shortly afterwards returned; the deceased was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270138"/>
               <p>still there, and directly I got back he said "I feel as if I had an attack of heartburn"—I returned to my guests and left him reading some papers which the prisoner had left with him; I returned in perhaps five minutes, and the deceased said "I feel as I felt after my brother-in-law had given me a quinine pill at Shanklin," and he said he should like to go to bed—I gave orders that he should be taken to bed, and Mr. Bell, a fellow<lb/>pupil, carried him upstairs; that was between 8 and 9 o'clock; about half an hour afterwards I received a communication as to his state, and went up into his bedroom, and found him lying on the bed in his clothes, apparently in great pain and vomiting violently; I saw the vomit on the floor, on the bed, and in a basin—the matron and Mr. Godward, a junior master, were in attendance upon him—the deceased appeared to be in great pain, and was throwing himself about most violently—he complained that his throat appeared to be closing, and his skin seemed to be drawn up—I left the room for a time, leaving the matron there and Mr. Godward and one or two of the boys; I returned shortly to find that he was much worse; Dr. Berry had just arrived as a guest, and I got him to go and see him; Dr. Little was likewise in the house, and those two attended the deceased till his death, at about 11.30—I was in the bath<lb/>room the same evening and saw some of the vomit there and also on the floor, and a small quantity in the pan—I went to the police<lb/>station next morning and gave information to Inspector Fuller—before the deceased died an envelope containing some money was brought to my house for him—I do not know what has become of the envelope—I opened it inadvertently, and apologised to him for having done so—I gave information to Inspector Fuller next morning; he came to my house and I gave him the two boxes of capsules, which had been left in the dining<lb/>room—I had noticed that the boxes contained some white pills in addition to the capsules—the label produced, with the name" George Henry Lamson, M.D., care of H.F. Gilling and Co., 499, Strand, London, England," was lying at the bottom of one of the boxes; I gave it to Inspector Fuller, and the cake and sweets and a sample of sugar, and also the whole of it and the bottle of sherry—two of the deceased's boxes were searched, I am not certain whether on the Sunday or Monday; a small box of quinine powders was found; I had seen the box before in the bedroom and dining room and in the base<lb/>ment—the powders were given to Inspector Fuller—a box containing two pills wrapped in tinfoil was afterwards brought to me by the matron, and I gave it to the inspector—I had received a box similar to that by post from America from the prisoner with a letter; I have searched everywhere for the letter, but cannot find it, and I am persuaded that I destroyed it—it must have been about the beginning of 1881—the box contained from ten to twelve pills; the letter stated that the prisoner had met some one in America suffering from a similar complaint, and had derived great benefit from taking medicine similar to that forwarded, and he asked me to see that the boy took the medicine—after I received the pills I saw the deceased, who was in bed, and gave him one of the pills to take, telling him what his brother-in-law had said respecting it—I did not wait to see whether he took it, but next morning he complained of feeling very unwell—the box was lying on the bed, and he said he should take no more of the pills, and I took it downstairs—I was under the impression that I had thrown it away, till it was found contain<lb/>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270139"/>
               <p>pills coated in tinfoil in the same way, but how it got into his possession I do not know—I afterwards saw some wafers which were found in one of the boxes, and gave them to Inspector Fuller—on the day the deceased died I had all my meals with him, breakfast, dinner at 1.30, and tea—he had his tea about an hour and a quarter before the prisoner came to see him—I do not think he had anything after his tea except the cake—for breakfast he had bread and butter and coffee; for dinner stewed rabbits, onion sauce, potatoes, bread, and bread and butter pudding; and for tea, bread and butter and tea with its usual accom<lb/>paniments—he used sometimes to go to his brother-in-law's, Mr. Chap<lb/>man's, at Willesden, and also to the prisoner's at Bournemouth—at Shanklin also he stayed with Mr. Chapman—I never was a director of any railway or steamboat company, and I never told the prisoner that there was a bad boat on any particular night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As a rule either the matron or I gave medicines to the pupils, and they would be such as were prescribed by the doctor—I had noticed that the deceased's curvative of the spine was getting worse—I told the prisoner so, and he said he did not think the boy would last long—he had made that observation to me on other occasions—I did not know that the deceased contemplated spending his Christmas holiday with the prisoner, or that he had written to his sister to that effect—this postcard is in his writing: "December 3, 1881. Dear old Kitten,—We break up on the 20th, Tuesday. I will write and tell you by what train I intend to come.—Yours, &amp;c. To Mrs. G. H. Lamson, Tangmore Hotel, Tangmore, near Chichester, Sussex. "On the occasion of the prisoner's visit I told him I was glad he had not come the day before, as the de<lb/>ceased was undergoing a school examination, and he had generally been excited in his examinations—when the capsules were taken out of the bag the prisoner was sitting down—I was standing the whole time, and was above them—the deceased was on the prisoner's right, about a yard from him—when the prisoner put the sugar into the capsule he was sitting—I took one of the capsules quite at haphazard from the box, looked at it, and swallowed it—I said before the Magistrate "While he was taking wine and conversing I saw the prisoner filling a capsule with sugar which he took out of a basin with a spade<lb/>spoon"—I swallowed one that was empty—he had the capsule in his left hand, and I saw him take the sugar into the shovel in his right hand and put it into the capsule—the sugar<lb/>basin was directly in front of him—he said that any nauseous medicine could be taken in the capsule—the deceased sat very close to him—the quinine powders I had seen were in the possession of the deceased, and I was aware he was taking them—the pills when they came from America were 11 or 12 in all in the box, and the deceased only took one which I gave him—I took the box downstairs, and was under the im<lb/>pression I had thrown it away—I am certain I did not give the box and the pills back to the deceased—I never saw either again until after his death—I am not certain that the two pills found in the box were those which came from America—I said before the Magistrates that I could not recollect whether the letter from America said anything about the pills, but I have since remembered—the prisoner recalled my memory to the letter, and that refreshed it—I then recollected the statement that the pills had been prescribed for some person in America—there were directions in the prisoner's handwriting on the box—the deceased had suf<lb/>fered</p>

               <p>from paralysis during the whole time I knew him—he was always unable to walk—the dining<lb/>room is from 16 feet to 17 feet square—from the time the prisoner left until I returned to the room not more than two or three minutes had elapsed, and, as far as I know, during that time the deceased had been alone—after I had seen the prisoner out I came back, and remained with the deceased about 10 or 15 minutes, when I again left the room, and left him about 10 minutes—when I returned I found Banbury with him, and then it was that he complained of being ill of heartburn—there were only two boxes of capsules, and both were left behind—some two or three of the capsules had white pills or comfits in them—everything left behind was handed to the police—Mrs. Bowles was not in the room—we all partook of the cake and sweets, the prisoner, the deceased, and myself—the prisoner helped the cake; he cut it with his penknife—I can't say for certain how many of those that were left behind had the white comfit or pill in them; two or three—they were very much like the ordinary sweets, carraways or comfits—I said before the Magistrate that one capsule containing a white pill was left behind—I think they were placed on the dinner<lb/>waggon, and I found them in the same place, and gave them to the police—it was a well<lb/>lighted room—I first noticed the capsules when I returned with the doctors after the boy's death—I can't say who noticed them first; I believe I did; I mean in the box—several were loose and two or three were in the capsules—I can't tell in which box they were—I had not noticed the deceased ailing at all, except the curvature of the spine; that had not affected his general health—he was better this last term than since he had been with me.</p>

No special kind of sugar was asked for; I was asked to provide some sugar, that was all—I brought up the usual white pounded sugar—my brother-in-law, who was staying with me at the time, tasted two or three of the capsules taken from the box; not while the prisoner was in the room—I am quite certain that none were partaken of by any one else while the prisoner was in the room.</p>

I am matron at Mr. Bedbrook's school, and was so in December last—I knew the deceased, and saw him on Saturday, December 3—he was in perfect health and excellent spirits—on that evening, before the prisoner came, charades were being played by the boys, and the deceased took part in guessing the words—that was before tea, and I saw him after tea as late as 6.30—up to that time he was in good health and spirits—that evening I was told to fetch some sugar, and got some off the kitchen dresser—it was in a glass sugar basin with an electro frame, and had a spade spoon in it for the purpose of ladling it out—the sugar had been in use in the house for two days previously—it was what is commonly called "castor sugar"—I took it up to the dining-room and placed it on the table—the deceased, Mr. Bedbrook, and the prisoner were in the room—I left the room after taking the sugar up—half an hour afterwards I had a communication with respect to the deceased, and ordered Bell to take him to bed—I went into the dining-room—the de-ceased did not seem quite so well as when I saw him last, but he said nothing to me then—when I went into the dining-room I saw a capsule in Bell's hand—Bell took the deceased upstairs, and about 20 minutes or half an hour afterwards I went to see him in consequence of a communi-cation made to me—I saw him in the bath-room vomiting, he appeared</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270142"/>
               <p>in very great pain; he was taken into his bedroom—he was sitting is his chair in the bedroom when I ordered him brandy and water—he appeared in very great pain—I remember Dr. Berry coming up to see him; he was the doctor who usually attended the pupils, and was in the house that night—subsequently Dr. Little also came up—I remained with him till the time of his death—he remained in violent pain till he died; there was no cessation of the pain—he seemed to grow a great deal worse, and had to be held down to his bed—both Dr. Berry and Dr. Little were then present—I saw the deceased's boxes searched and the box of quinine powders found in his clothes-box, which was kept in his bedroom—I had seen that box before in the clothes-box—I do not know to whom the box of powders was given—I found the tin box con-taining the two pills in the deceased's play-box, which was usually kept downstairs in the clothes-room; but it was upstairs on the same floor when I found it—I do not know to whom the box of pills was given—after his death the sugar, which had remained in the dining-room, was given to Inspector Fuller—the sherry also remained in the dining-room, and it was likewise given to Inspector Fuller, together with the cake, sweets, and wafers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say before the Magistrate that the box was taken to the clothes-room before his death—if I did say so it was a mistake, as it was not brought up till after his death—before he died it was down in the cupboard in the lower dining-room—before the Magis<lb/>trate I said "I never saw the box of pills before his death, I cannot say how it came into the box"—I had seen the box of quinine powders—I never opened it—it might have been half-past 8 when Bell took the deceased upstairs—he was talking to Bell when I went into the room, and it was about half an hour after when I saw him in the bath-room—I had been at Mr. Bedbrook's 14 months while he was a pupil there—I had noticed that the curvature of the spine was getting worse—I was in the habit of conversing with him very often—I did not know that he had written that day to the prisoner's wife to say by what train he was coming down to spend his Christmas holidays with her—I knew he had spent his holiday from time to time at the prisoner's—I knew that he had been from time to time amusing himself with chemistry—usually speaking, it would be my duty to give medicine to the boys—I have given medicine to the boys on my own account, and also medicine prescribed by the doctors—if medicine was sent by the doctor, I should give it to the boys myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The deceased had not amused himself with chemistry during the last term, which commenced in September. The chemicals were kept in a cupboard on the first floor—I did not have charge of them—during the 3rd of December from the time he was carried down in the morning till he was taken up again at night, he had not been up to the, first floor—I was a good deal upstairs on the first and second floors attending to household duties that day—after his death I found this letter in his coat pocket.</p>

I was only a short time under examination before the Coroner—when the deceased was seated in his chair in a room and left to himself he could not get up and get anything from the other end of the room; he could not stir—he had a chair with which he could wheel him-self to any part of the same floor, but he could not get out of his chair to walk—it was a little higher than an ordinary chair, and he could get out of it and sit on the floor, and get back again—I never know him to get upstairs without assistance—he spent his last Midsummer vacation at the prisoner's at Shanklin—I can't tell you when they commenced—I have seen him doing very little with chemicals; but I have seen him making some sort of gas, nothing more.</p>

I had some chemicals in my house—they were kept in the cupboard on the first floor, the floor above the basement—it was fastened by a button within a few inches of the top—about 6 ft. 6 in. from the floor—you can reach it standing—they were principally acids used in making gases, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen—they were kept entirely for the use of my science master, Mr. Eastwick—the last term ended on 29th July, and the Christmas term commenced on 18th September, as near as I remember—during the term beginning 18th September the deceased did not use any of these chemicals, and none of the other pupils did—the deceased used them frequently during the previous term, both alone and in my presence—they were kept on the second shelf of the cupboard, 4 ft. from the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and registered medical practitioner, practising at Wimbledon—I knew the deceased Percy Mal-colm John, and had known him about a year and a half; I had frequently seen him before the 3rd of December—I had attended him for one slight illness in March, 1881, while he was at the school—it was a little skin eruption—in June, 1881, I vaccinated him—those were the only occasions—with the exception of the paralysis of his lower limbs his health I believe was generally good—on Saturday, the 3rd of December, I was at the school; Mr. Bedbrook met me as I went in at the hall door about 8.55—I was going as a guest—I went up into Percy John's bedroom at once; he was on one of the beds, and partially undressed; he was in great pain in his stomach; he complained of the skin of his face being drawn, also of a sense of constriction in his throat, and of being unable to swallow; he was retching and vomiting; the vomit was a small quantity of dark-coloured fluid—I asked him, very shortly after, the cause of his illness—that was all he said about his symptoms (Mr. Bedbrook had made a com-munication to me as I was going upstairs) I said "Did your brother-in-law ever give you a quinine pill before?"—he said" Yes"—I then asked him when—he said "At Shanklin"—I then asked "Did it make you ill like this before?"—he answered" Yes, but not so bad"—I then asked "Did your brother-in-law know that it had made you ill like this?"—he answered" I cannot say"—that, as near as I can charge my memory, was what passed—there was nothing in an ordinary quinine pill that could produce such symptoms as those I saw—I did not at that time form any opinion as to what the symptoms were due to—I had some white of egg beaten up in water and given to him—that was during the intervals of his vomiting—he was able to swallow partially—I had hot linseed poultices</p>

               <p>spots—I believed from what I then saw, and I have not changed my opinion, that that was the result of inflammation caused recently before death—the stomach contained three or four ounces of dark fluid—that was carefully preserved, Mr. Bond taking charge of it—the first portion of the duodenum was greatly congested, and there were patches of con-gestion in other parts of the small intestine—portions of the intestines themselves were taken by Mr. Bond, who also took possession of the stomach itself, as well as portions of the liver, with the gall bladder, both kidneys, and part or the whole of the spleen—the bladder contained three or four ounces of urine, which was drawn off and taken possession of by Mr. Bond—there was no inflammation in the peritoneum—we examined the spinal cord; the membranes were greatly congested—these were all the appearances I noted on the post-mortem examination—except the appearance of the lungs and the curvature of the spine, there was no natural disease—neither what I observed in the lungs nor the curvature of the spine had anything to do with the cause of death—there was nothing to account for death from natural causes—in my judgment I should say that he died from the effects of some irritant vegetable poison—the administration of an irritant vegetable poison would, I believe, account for all the appearances I noted at the examination—there are certain poisons known as vegetable alkaloids—aconitine is one of those—the appearances would be consistent with the administration of a fatal dose—I have not special knowledge on this subject—in my judg-ment as a medical man I believe those appearances might be accounted for by the administration of a fatal dose of aconitine—I never use aconitine in my own practice—I have been in practice about 17 years——I dispense medicines—I have none of that drug in my dispensary—I believe it is a very powerful poison—I have no special knowledge, I mean derived from my own experience—I received two pills and two capsules at the house from Mr. Bedbrook—they were long, oval-shaped pills—I placed the pills in the capsules and gave them to Mr. Bond at the same time I gave him the vomit.</p>

               <p>to think so up to the time of his death—I had formed no opinion of the cause up to the time of his death—at the time I had no suspicion of vegetable alkaloids—I came to that conclusion after the post-mortem examination, not before, and my opinion was based, not upon any personal knowledge of poisoning by alkaloids, but was formed simply from my general knowledge—I have heard of "Fleming on Aconitine," but I have never studied the work—I have not read books by Turnbull or Skey on vegetable poisons—my object in injecting morphia was to allay the pain and nervous irritation; the white of egg was to allay the irritation of the stomach—I should have felt justified in using the morphia for allaying irritation of the stomach arising from natural causes, if accompanied by intense pain, and the same may be said of the white of egg—I was with him altogether rather over two hours—I was absent 5 or 10 minutes during that time——before his death his remarks became wandering—I examined the spinal cord and the spinal curvature—the spinal cora was healthy, bnt congested—the existence of paralysis such as I found in the boy was not inconsistent with the healthy state of that part of the spinal cord which I examined—the existence of spinal curvature is not, in my opinion, con-sistent with healthy bone and healthy intervertebral cartilage—I did not examine the condition of the arteries in the neighbourhood of the curva-ture—I am not aware that there are many cases in which death has resulted from the effects of the pressure on the arteries in the region of these curvatures—I am not prepared to say that there are not reports of such cases—I cannot undertake to say that death did not result from some such cause as you have sketched out—I did not examine to see the effect of the spinal curvature on the position of the lungs or upon the position of the heart—in cases of spinal curvature the lungs are frequently much dis-placed—if they had been much displaced in this case I should have observed it—the heart, too, is in such cases frequently very much dis-placed—I say that the irritation of the stomach which I observed was consistent with poisoning by vegetable alkaloids, although I have never seen a case of poisoning by vegetable alkaloids—the apparent irritation of the stomach had not the appearance of a post-mortem irritation—I only judged from what I saw—it may be that after death the stomach often appears inflamed—I do not deny that there may be appearances of inflammation from the settling of blood in the stomach after death—I describe aconitia as an irritant vegetable poison, but I have no knowledge of it—Taylor, in his work on poisons, mentions marks which would correspond to what I saw in the boy's body—he does not mention any cases of poisoning by aconitine—I do not know of any medical test for aconitine—what I said with regard to the emptiness of the heart applies to the entire heart; it was nearly empty of blood, and flaccid—while the boy was ill in the bedroom the vomit was discharged into a basin at first—that was thrown away—that which was shown to me as leaving been vomited before I came was kept—there was an ounce or an ounce and a half of it—it was the dark-coloured fluid which he vomited just after I saw him which was thrown away—the vomit in the bath was collected by Dr. Little in my presence—I think he scraped it from the bottom and sides with a spoon, and from the floor of the water-closet—it was all put together—some poisons are absorbed into the system, and would be found there—I am not an expert as to vegetable alkaloids, and cannot say how the amount which does the work would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270149"/>
               <p>be calculated—in poisoning by vegetable alkaloids I presume that the traces of the poison which had done its work would be found in the system, but I have no special knowledge on the subject; I only suppose—I cannot come to any conclusion as to the amount of poison which had caused death where some of it had been rejected by vomiting—the finding any traces of the actual quantity that had caused death is a question for an expert; I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The deceased's remarks became wandering about ten minutes before his death—as far as I could see from the post-mortem examination, there was nothing in the condition of the curvature of the spine which could have caused death—nothing in the position of the lungs or heart attracted my attention—if either of them had been much displaced I do not think I could have failed to observe it—if death had occurred from pressure on the arteries, I should not have expected to find the symptoms of local irritation in the stomach—I know from my reading something of the recorded effects of vegetable alkaloids.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Merton Road, Wimbledon—on Saturday evening, 3rd December, I went on a visit to Mr. Bedbrook and was called to see the deceased in his bedroom—he was lying on the bed—Dr. Berry was there—the deceased was in great pain; he was retching, and complained of intense pain in the region of the stomach, and also of his skin being drawn up—I remained with him till his death—morphia was injected on two occasions, but he got worse as time went on, and ultimately died at 11.20—we thought he was suffering from the effects of an irritant poison—the complaints he made and the ymptoms exhibited, led us to that conclusion—I collected the vomit from the bath and from the floor of the water-closet and bath-room, with a spoon—on Tuesday, 6th December, a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made by Dr. Bond, Mr. Berry, and myself—Mr. Berry took notes, and they accurately contain what I noticed—I noticed on the surface of the stomach certain patches, which indicated that there had been intense irritation of the lining membrane of the stomach—they were, I should think, of recent date—the cause of death in my opinion was the adminis-tration of some poison.</p>

Littlefield, chemist, Ventnor," and written in ink were the words" Quinine powers"—there were twenty altogether; six large and fourteen small, numbered 7 to 20—all those things I took to the station and locked up, and after-wards gave to Inspector Butcher—on Tuesday, the 6th, I obtained the remaining half of the Dundee cake, and handed it to Inspector Butcher—on the 8th I received from Mr. Bedbrook a tin box containing two pills wrapped up in tinfoil or silvered-paper—I enclosed it in an envelope and left it at the station with Sergeant Trott with this report, to be forwarded to Superintendent Digby—I went to the house again on the 12th, and received the sherry in a decanter; it was placed in a bottle by Mrs. Bowles—she emptied out the glass sugar basin, and I took them both and gave them to Inspector Butcher the same day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have only had personal experience of poisoning by one vegetable alkaloid, strychnine—supposing the poison had been taken in a capsule such as this, a longer time would elapse before the symptoms manifested themselves, because the gelatine would have to be dissolved, if it is gelatine—the poison would be first received into the stomach, and then it would be absorbed and passed into the blood, and from the blood into the other organs—I do not know whether what remained in the stomach after death had any part in causing death—it may have caused some local irritation—it may have had some part in it, the vomiting and so on; it would cause irritation like mustard; it might have had some, but I should think a very small part in causing death—the greatest part in causing death was due to that which had passed into the system—I have seen no death from aconitine, and the recorded cases are very rare.</p>

               <p>never found it with any other alkaloid—I have 50 to 80 vegetable pre<lb/>parations in my possession, and have tasted most of them—in this par<lb/>ticular case the sensation lasted upon the tongue for four hours—with three<lb/>fourths of the liquid that I tested I made an experiment with the alkaloidal extract from a quantity corresponding to about 1 ounce of the urine, or one<lb/>third of the whole—I dissolved the extract and injected it beneath the skin of a mouse—the animal was obviously affected in two minutes, and from that time onwards it exhibited signs of poisoning, and died in 30 minutes from the time of administration—I made some experiments by injecting into mice a solution of Morson's aconitine, which I procured expressly from Allen and Hanbury—I dissolved it in the same solvent, and operated on mice in the same manner—its effect upon the mice was undistinguishable from the effect produced by the extract from the urine; they died from the same character of symptoms—the solvent itself, which was a dilute solution of tartaric acid, was used on a mouse, and found to be quite inoperative—the extract which I made from the liver, spleen, kidneys, stomach, and contents I retained—they all contained an alkaloid, and two of them gave a slight taste of aconitine—I then mixed the extracts 1, 3, and 4 together, and injected it under the skin of a mouse in the same manner, and it produced effects upon the mouse in nine minutes, and from that time onwards it exhibited symp<lb/>toms of poisoning, and died in 22 minutes—those symptoms were precisely similar to the symptoms exhibited when I injected Morson's aconitine—No. 6, the vomit, contained 10 fluid ounces, or nearly half a pint of a thick semi<lb/>fluid stuff—with that also there was spirits of wine—Dr. Dupre pointed out a mark on a bottle indicating 5 ounces of vomit, and about 5 ounces of spirit had been added—the vomit must have been solid—I examined the solid portion, and found that it consisted of pieces of fat, a very small quantity of muscular fibre of some animal, pieces of onion, a little starch, probably that of wheat, sliced candied peel, such as is put on the top of cakes, pieces of apple pulp, raisins, and some pineapple essence—there was just the odour of pineapple drops—I subsequently examined it again minutely and microscopically; to see whether I could find anything corresponding to the root of aconite or the root of horse<lb/>radish; I found neither—I made an extract from the vomit, and obtained an alkaloidal extract, which had an intense taste, but no trace of morphia or quinine—I applied some of the extract to my tongue, and found a very powerful result, such as I have previously described as the result of aconitia—the effects lasted in a severe form six hours and a half, when the severity gradually passed off, but the effect lasted very markedly for six hours and a half—I used a portion of this alkaloidal extract corresponding to 1<lb/>24th part of the vomit, and injected it into the back of a mouse—it was severely affected in 21/2 minutes, and the symptoms continued to the time of its death, 151/2 minutes after the injection—those symptoms were parallel with those of aconitia—in my judgment the vomit submitted to me contained a con<lb/>siderable quantity of aconitia—approximately I think I can give an estimate of the quantity; I can put a limit each way—it was not less than one<lb/>seventh, and probably not more than. one<lb/>fourth of a grain—there has been only one fatal case that I know of in which aconitine has caused the death of a human being, and the quantity that proved fatal, the quantity that actually caused death, was known not to be less than one<lb/>twenty<lb/>first part of a grain, not more than one<lb/>thirteenth of a grain—</p>

               <p>the pill<lb/>box, No. 7, contained two gelatine capsules, and in each was a gelatine<lb/>coated pill—I examined them, or rather saw what Dr. Dupre did; he operated, and I saw the results—they contained no poison——they were simple five<lb/>grain quinine pills—the sweetmeats No. 8 con<lb/>tained no trace of poison of any character at all—No. 9, the cake, contained no trace of poison—No. 10, the capsules, were simple gelatine, free from poison—the comfit, the sugar, and some loose pills in a box, simple quinine gelatine<lb/>coated pills, were free from poison—of the quinine powders there were six in larger papers than others—they contained a grain and a half each on an average, of disulphate of quinine, some con<lb/>taining one and one<lb/>third of a grain, some one and two<lb/>thirds of a grain—there were fourteen smaller papers containing powers, tied together in a bundle and numbered in ink from 7 to 20—they varied considerably in weight, the lightest weighing six<lb/>tenths of a grain; the heaviest one and one<lb/>eighth of a grain—the average weight of the 14 powders was very nearly one grain, 131/2 grains in the whole—Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, were disulphate of quinine, or ordinary quinine powders varying from six tenths of a grain to 11/2 grains—my attention was called to No. 16 by Dr. Dupre—it was a little different in colour, as were also two others, 17 and 19—it was an obvious mixture; there were two substances—I mean it was obvious to a skilled person—they were of a pale fawn tint, quinine being a peculiar pure white—it was more a difference in colour than shade—No. 16 weighed just under one and eight tenths of a grain—it was the largest—No. 17 weighed 88 grain, nearly nine tenths—No. 19 weighed 126 or one and a quarter grains—the powder in No. 16 looked as if damaged quinine had been put in, or quineta mixed with it—I tasted it—at first there was the bitterness of quinine, but that passed off, and in three minutes there was a very startling, sensation—the taste I thought was aconitia, but I had not tasted aconitia for years—the sensation lasted severely for three hours, then gradually went away after dinner—I saw the result of Dr. Dupre's examination—there was 83 grain of aconitia and 96 grain of quinine—I took about one fiftieth of a grain of No. 16 for experiment upon a mouse in the same manner—it was very ill in three and a half minutes, and dead in six and a half minutes; the symptoms being the same as in the other cases—I did not taste either No. 17 or No. 19—I cannot tell how much aconitia there was in them—I am convinced that there was aconitia in both from Dr. Dupre's experiments, but from the colour and appearance I should say the proportion of aconitia to the quinine was considerably less than in No. 16—with regard to the pills in the tin box, it is not usual to wrap pills in tinfoil in this country, nor to put them in a box of this kind—some pills become soft by exposure, but not quinine pills—those two pills were examined by Dr. Dupre and myself—I myself particularly examined one—I examined both partially—one of these pills weighed three grains; the other, which I more particularly examined, weighed two and three quarter grains nearly—I took it out of the tinfoil—there was nothing particular in the appearance—I cut it open and tasted it; it was most intense—there was at first the bitterness of quinine, and in about three minutes that passed away—I had cut out the smallest piece I could and put it on my tongue—Dr. Dupre, myself, and my assistant each thus tasted a portion, and some was taken for the microscope, and then we had taken altogether only 1<lb/>22nd part of a grain; that sufficed for the three of us and for the microscope also—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188202270164"/>
               <p>I felt the bitterness of quinine, followed by intense burning on the tongue, tingling and soreness of the tongue—the sensations were the same in character, but more severe in form than those I had already experienced—I injected some of it into the back of a mouse—in two minutes it exhibited symptoms of poisoning and was very ill, and it died in four and a half minutes—I came to the conclusion that there was 45 of a grain, or nearly half a grain, of aconitine in that pill—in the sherry I found no trace of poison—there was no trace of poison in the wafers—the urine, in my opinion, contained aconitia—that would show that poison had been absorbed into the blood, had passed through the tissues of the body, and become excreted—I found traces of morphia in certain of these extracts—I have heard the account of the injection of morphia by Dr. Berry during the last hours of the boy's illness—the traces of morphia I found were such as I should have expected to find from such injection—I should have expected to find it in the urine, probably in the liver too—many times a fatal dose could be administered in one of these capsules—I have put a grain of aconitine into one of those capsules, and here is one with half a grain to show how little space it fills. (<hi rend="italic">The capsules were handed to the Jury.</hi>) The taste of the pill lasted for seven<lb/>and<lb/>a<lb/>half hours, although a meal had been taken during the time—if taken in a capsule such as this, and swallowed, the taste of the aconitine would not, of course, be perceived in the act of swallowing—there is no specific or characteritic chemical test for aconitine—the tests are first the general chemical tests for an alkaloid, and I did discover an alkaloid: and then the physiological test; first the effect upon the tongue and neigh<lb/>bouring parts, and the general effect on the system if taken in any quantity—the other physiological test is that it will kill after a definite course of symptoms—I have no doubt that in the vomit, the urine, and in the sub<lb/>stances from the body submitted to me I did find aconitine—I have no doubt about its being aconitine—I heard the medical men describe the symptoms and the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—in my judgment, they are such as would be likely to arise in poisoning by aconitine—they point to a vegetable alkaloid principle, and more nearly to aconitine than any other—judging from the appearances on the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> and my analysis, I form the conclusion that death arose from aconitine—aconitine is not a medicine commonly used in this country for internal purposes—I have not known it used in any case—the British Pharmacopœia orders it for external use, but makes no mention of any dose—nothing is prescribed for internal use—it was formerly tried a quarter of a century or 30 years ago, but it was given up, because it was found to be so dangerous.</p>

               <p>whether there was any volatile alkaloid, which could be recognised by its particular odour; there was none, nor any volatile oil—I then dried it over oil of vitriol—it weighed 108, or rather more than 1<lb/>10th of a grain—it was of slightly crystalline appearance—I tasted it by putting a little fragment on my tongue—I reduced it subsequently with a solvent, and administered it to a mouse, but I had previously tested it for an alkaloid—I went through the same operation with the vomit twice, and the urine, with only minor shades of difference, as occasion required—the effect on the tongue was characteristic of aconitine, and of nothing else that I know of—I should not expect to find something of the same sort from veratria; I have tried that on the tongue, and there is a marked difference—I tried delphinia years ago; it is more like atropia; it has more of a bitterness—I do not recollect that delphinia is like aconitia—I do not admit a resemblance—English aconitia, Morson's, has no marked bitter<lb/>ness, whereas most alkaloids have a bitterness—it is more like a strin<lb/>gency; it is quite distinct—I think there is a bitterness about delphinia—it is different from pepperine or pepper, in which the burning comes on directly, and you get it at once—there is no special chemical test for aconitia—I do not consider phosphoric acid a test—I have tried it on aconitia given me by Mr. Morson, and on other specimens, and the phosphoric acid reaction is no doubt due to impurity—it is given as a test except by those who have studied it recently—Messrs. Gough and Wright have experimented upon it as well as myself—it was looked upon as a test until recently—I made several experiments connected with the case to see whether it is a real test, and it is not—I made experiments as a test with pure aconitia, but with no result—Flückner, in this work on the subject, gives it, but German aconitia does give that reaction; it is very different from English aconitia—I see no mention in the book of English aconitia—the date of this edition is 1879—the solution injected into the mouse was measured on each occasion—the quantity injected was three or four minims—the needle at the end of the hypodermic syringe was passed into the animal's back—in the case of the urine three or four minims represente 1 one ounce, and in the case of the vomit the twenty<lb/>fourth part; in the other cases the whole of the residue was taken—the mice were Albinos, pie<lb/>balds, and cinnamon coloured—they do not show signs of fear; you can handle them—experiments on animals must not be over<lb/>estimated—whether it is a recognised fact that alkaloids are to be found in the human body, more especially in the stomach, after death, independently of poisons, is a question still <hi rend="italic">sub judice</hi> among experts—it has been asserted that such is the case where the stomach or any other viscera has been much de<lb/>composed—I cannot say that it is not a fact; it is still <hi rend="italic">sub judice</hi>—I refer to what are called "cadaveric alkaloids," utterly irrespective of the administration of poisons—it is so asserted—Stas's test is for cadaveric as well as natural alkaloids—cadaveric, alkaloids have been described as producing the same effects as vegetable alkaloids—they have been described as producing the same effects, but I have seen none producing the same effects as aconitia—there is a test which distinguishes them from all natural alkaloids except morphia and veratria, and certainly from aconitine—that test was applied to those cases where no morphia was present—the test is the reduction from cyanide of potassium to the</p>

Dear Sir,—I sent you a telegram just before leaving my friends at Horsham, telling you I had written my cheque on the wrong bank, which was the case. I formerly had an account at the Wilts and Dorset Bank, but have since transferred my business to another house. The cheques are precisely the same colour, and as I left home in a great hurry I suatched up from my drawer what I thought was the right book, but I was mistaken. I had in my hurry taken my old Wilts and Dorset cheque<lb/>book, which contained a few blank cheques. I have not the right book with me, but have wired home for it to be sent me by return to Ventnor, where I return to<lb/>morrow or next day; I shall then immediately set the matter right with you.

She will come to London for a short time until I leave for the Continent myself. As I am therefore very anxious to yield to her wishes, and as it would render it impossible for me to bring her back with me if I went into the City to procure the sum I require for the journey, her account, &amp;c., up to the present time, I venture to ask you if you would be good enough to let me have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until my return with her in the evening (to<lb/>day). I should be very sorry to have to put you to any inconvenience, but I feel certain you will do this for me, knowing my parents, &amp;c., &amp;c. If I do not catch the 10.30 train from Victoria I cannot return to-day, as it is important that I should. I should require the sitting-room (No. 29) which my mother had while here. The bedroom I now occupy would be naturally sufficient for my wife and self, but if she wishes the child to come here as well I should require another room for her and the nurse. I shall ask you to kindly see that a large trunk be taken out of the left luggage room at Euston Station and brought here and kept in a safe place, as it contains a quantity of silver plate and household valuables worth a considerable sum. Mrs. Lamson wishes to have the plate, &amp;c., and some music contained in the same trunk for her own use. Excuse the very bad and illegible manner I have written this note, but my eyesight</p>

I thereupon take you into custody, and charge you with causing the death of Percy Malcolm John at Blenheim House, Wimbledon, on December 3rd"—he said, "Very well. Do you think bail will be accepted? I hope the matter will be kept as quiet as possible for the sake of my relations"—I said, "You will now be taken to Wandsworth Police-court, and when before the Magistrates the question of bail will rest with them"—I con<lb/>veyed him in a cab to Wandsworth, and on the way he said, "You will have my father here in a day or two. I hope it will be stated that I came to Scotland Yard voluntarily, and that I came from Paris on purpose"—I said, "Certainly"—I searched the prisoner at Wandsworth Station and found two letters, one signed "J.

The throat becomes painfully tight, with a sense of strangling, distressing retching, vomiting and purging, and pains more or less severe in the stomach and bowels ensue, and those are succeeded by a quick and throbbing pulse, oppressed breathing and panting, a tottering gait, as if the patient were intoxicated, alarming weakness, sinking, and death. Sometimes there are convulsions more or less severe, acute pain, causing plaintive cries, with stiffness of the limbs. The several poisons of this class vary much in the violence of their effects."</p>

I first came to this country with sewing machines in 1876; I described them from the commencement as "Singer's machines" and "Wheeler's machines"—I was restrained from selling them as "Singer's machines" until the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment; I don't know whether the matter is still awaiting the House of Lords—the prisoner had no capital; the only arrangements I made with him are here—I did not arrange that when he obtained cash I was to get cash, and that when he was obliged to sell on credit I was to wait until he got the money; the bad debts were not to be all his—no arrange<lb/>ment was arrived at about bad debts being borne by him—it was arranged that Mr. Rubenstein was to be security for him—his salary week by week is entered in the cash<lb/>book—this document of 16th March is not in my writing; it was written by my orders—this letter was written by my firm. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to the prisoner, stating that a machine had been sent to him, and an agreement prepared for Mr. Ravenstein to sign. Another letter, of</hi> 16 <hi rend="italic">th March,</hi> 1881, <hi rend="italic">from the Company to the prisoner was put in also, mentioning Mr. Ravenstein as his security, and stating that they would give the prisoner all credit which he might require, and that if he paid the company before six months expired he would be allowed</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent. interest, paying the cash and keeping the profit for himself.</hi>) On 18th March the goods value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were sent to him, and other goods on other days on the terms mentioned in the agreement; the letter just read embodies the agreement—the first agreement between the Company and Mrs. Edwards was executed, and under that there was to be a salary paid; that is an entirely different agreement from the letter; there was no alteration in my mind, but I was advised</p>

               <p>that the only way was to have a master and servant agreement, and I told him so in April—the agreement was made before he went to Brighton—he was not selling my machines there; he was quite indepen<lb/>dent of me—he came back finally from Brighton on 19th August—he had nothing to do with me while at Brighton except in this sense, that the agreement was made—I must have had a conversation with him about the agreement when he came up because here are his pencil marks on it, scratching out his name and putting in his wife's instead—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week which was his wife's salary was to be his salary afterwards—I had nothing to do with the stamp, but no doubt it was a form which was in the office, and I used it; it bears the date of March 12—this entry, "Personal expenses half," means his salary, and here is another place, "Personal expenses 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," in his own writing twice over—I do not only suggest that it is his salary, but it is the word "half" shows the agreement—the persons who had to be fed will appear by the cash-book; there were two Miss Cruikshanks, the prisoner's wife, and two Miss Bagwells, but the Misses Bagwell were not paid—it was their own choice—I had nothing to do with the sisters-in-law—when he engaged Miss Cruikshank he mentioned her salary, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I protested against it as not being sufficient—he said she lived with her parents, and it would be sufficient—I would have paid her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner and his wife were in the same agreement—their salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they lived on the premises—she received a salary on account of her husband when he was at Brighton—one little girl, a Miss Bagwell, was there as an apprentice—there are no indentures—I first saw her about March or April, when the prisoner sent her to me to be instructed in the use of the machines, and she remained there till the prisoner was charged—this letter comes from my firm.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I know that he has been in the employ of the Singer Company; they have offices at 39, Foster Lane, Cheap<lb/>side—there was litigation between that Company and myself before the Company was formed; it began in 1878—there was a decision in their favour in 1879, and a decision of the Court of Appeal in my favour in 1880—Mr. Hooks was not acting as my solicitor in that action, but he was in other matters—by the master and servant agreement an arrange<lb/>ment was made about making invoices due six months after date—no such account current as that was delivered to the prisoner—there was an arrangement that half a year's interest was to be charged if paid before; he was to get credit for the interest—there never was an invoice or bill of parcels of that kind—Mr. Ravenstein never became security under any other document—that arrangement was never carried out—it was after March 30th that I saw Mr. Rooks, and in consequence of that I came to the agreement where the wife's name was used—I can't say whether the agreement with the wife was signed before or after this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was received—that is a letter threatening Edwards from the solicitor to the Foster Lane firm that if he entered into our employ in any shape they would enforce the covenant—this agreement of his being a customer was never carried out—I never asked him for payment in any manner—the whole weekly expenses were carried out against me, and he came up twice a week from Brighton to assist—it was intended from the first that</p>

               <p>he should be my servant, but he could not appear so openly; there was no change in his position with regard to the Company from the time of the agree<lb/>ment with the wife—we saw these long bailee agreements when he was away; we have seven or eight smaller forms of agreements in his writing in which the machines are described as the property of the Loog Company; the bailee forms were need with our knowledge, because he handed them to us—they have his name as the owner, because he was our bailee—he always had to bring us the agreements every week with the return sheets—the earliest date of these memorandum sheets is March 2, and every machine from that date which went into his possession was registered by its number—the invoice is merely a receiving note, although it is on one of our invoice bill heads—Miss Cruikshank and Mr. Townsend's agree<lb/>ments are printed forms by which they entered into the Company's service, and the prisoner was aware of them—Townsend's is dated 14th Septem<lb/>ber at London Wall—it is signed in the prisoner's presence—he agrees to enter the service of the Loog Company—I filled it up in his presence—it was only in September that we began agreements; after the first two weeks my clerk went there for the cash sheets, and after that they had to send them in, which they did regularly—I kept a register of the persons who were paying on hire, and what were the actual returns of the money paid—the office boy, Hutton, is charged for, and so is porterage, and Christmas presents to scavengers—I keep a number of these memoranda of machines; this is Redfearn's, and here is a memorandum in the book of Redfearn's transactions—the fact of its being let for hire to Redfearn was known to me, and the money was entered for it in the weekly cash account, and the number of the machine is in the invoice—I found all the entries posted regularly in the ledgers of the depot with the information of who Redfearn was, and why he should be trusted in his weekly payments, or in the cash<lb/>book—I found Gearing's name in the ledger; he is a pawnbroker in Walworth Road, and was appointed agent for us—he has two of our machines for exhibition—there is no entry in the books of the depot of two sewing machines sent to Gearing—the letter from the House of Correction refers to his improperly letting Gearing have machines—I found them at another pawnshop in Exmouth Street, Clerkenwell; there is no memorandum of them—they are returned to us as sent to Gearing, but there is no notice of them being sent to Exmouth Street—this letter of January 3, 1882, was written before the agreement with Mr. Edwards was signed; it refers to the position of matters between me and him. (<hi rend="italic">Two letters upon this subject were here put in, one from the prisoner and one from his wife.</hi>) In consequence of one of these letters I sent money for the gas company which was due—I had no communication with him referring to matters of business in consequence of these letters—I had instituted inquiries about some missing instalment books, but had not made any inquiries of the prisoner personally.</p>

In the beginning of January last I commenced keeping observation upon 19, Warple Way, Wandsworth—I have seen persons go in and out once or twice, and I instructed others to watch—on 31st January, about 6 p.m., I went there with Inspector Shaw and other constables—Shaw and I went in first, followed by four or five officers—a little girl came out and we popped in, when we saw the door on the jar—we went into the ante-room at the top of the stairs—Shaw went in first; I followed him—Grey and Cummings rushed past me—I saw Greenwood in the act of getting up from a table or from a box that was set up endways and used as a table—I saw a row of half<lb/>crowns lying—I afterwards counted, and found 101 counterfeit half<lb/>crowns and 80 florins—I saw a bright fire burning, and batteries and a naphtha lamp, which was burning, and a number of jars at the back and plaster<lb/>of<lb/>Paris moulds—we counted and brought away 100 broken and 19 unbroken moulds—I saw a quantity of metal, and the ladle produced was just taken off the fire—one ladle was full of molten metal—there was metal in the ashes of the fireplace, and a little block of metal near the mould; it had just been poured out of the ladle on to the block—we burnt our fingers—we found also a quantity of copper wire, some sheets of glass, and iron bands such as would go round these moulds in making them—a quantity of plaster<lb/>of<lb/>Paris, some mixed ready to pour into the mould, and a bag of sand—candles were burning—a thick blind was at the window, so that no one could see from the next house, and a sheet was across the door, so that one would not see them at first—these moulds for half<lb/>sovereigns and the two coun<lb/>terfeit half-sovereigns were found as well—Shaw took charge of Green<lb/>wood—Jones was brought in by Boswell about 10 minutes afterwards—I said to Jones "You are the landlord of the house?" he said" Yes"—I pointed to the coins which we had not touched, and said "How do you account for all these counterfeit coins which you have in this way?" he said" You know you have got us all right, what is the good of saying anything?"—I told the officers to search him; one took hold of each side; a purse was handed to me—I opened it—I counted 10 coins over to him—I said" I can see these have been used as patterns for making the moulds"—six half<lb/>crowns had been used as patterns and four florins—five shillings were also in the purse which had been used as patterns, also 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—I pointed out that this money had been used, and</p>

               <p>Jones said "All right" a second time—I searched every room in the house—Jones's wife and two or three little children were in the house—Mrs. Jones showed me something, in consequence of which I did not take her into custody—I had seen Greenwood and Jones go in and come out of a public-house kept by a Mr. Hill.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOHEGAN</hi>. There are four rooms and the ante<lb/>room in the house, two floors—another man was brought to me with Jones—he was detained till 12 or 1 at night—he was Jones's nephew—Mr. Eedwood is the landlord—there were seven half<lb/>crown moulds, about 12 florin moulds—some were double and treble moulds—I made a list at Wandsworth Police-court—I remembered when I made my note that Jones said "All right" when I said the coins were used for patterns—when my evidence was read over the Clerk said it was quite sufficient—we gave it as short as we could—the public-house is 150 or 200 yards from the coining place.</p>

I saw Greenwood as he was getting up—I did not see him sitting down—I know nothing against him—the ground<lb/>floor was roll of shavings—there were one or two mattresses there—there might be four—they appeared to be finished—I saw no workmen's tools; I did not search for them—I saw a barrow outside the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I could not say whether it was half a crown or a two<lb/>shilling piece that I found in Greenwood's hand—if I said at the police-court it was half a crown that is correct—he did not show it to me; I had to open his hand—he showed his hand to the Magistrate—there might have been a pair of mattresses in the room—I did not give him any beer at the station—I did not say I had seen him at work at the shavings—I was not present when any beer was given to him—I do not remember finding a railway-ticket on him—I found no tweezers—he gave a correct address to Goddard.</p>

I was with the other officers—I saw them go in the house—after that I went to the Princess of Wales public-house, about 300 yards from No. 19—I saw Jones there—I know him personally—I called him outside, and said "I want to speak to you"—he said" Yes"—I said "You know me; let us go down to the house"—when we got to the house I told him I was a detective officer, and that other officers were in charge of his house—he made no reply—I searched him—I found a purse, which I handed unopened to Chamber<lb/>lain, who opened it and drew my attention to some coins that were inside—I had watched this house and the prisoners too since the early part of December—I know the other prisoners, except Cummings—I have seen them go in and out of No. 19, Warple Way, about a dozen times—I have seen Jones and Greenwood together—they have come out of the house—I have followed them to London—they entered the railway<lb/>station apart, and one of them fetched a cab and they drove to another railway<lb/>station—I followed them to a house in a small street in Soho—I had not seen them go the whole way to London before; they used to break off—I have seen them when they have got there—I have seen a mattress up against the window in Warple Way which any one at a distance would take for a blind—if the mattress was not there you could see into the room—I have not seen any mattresses taken away from the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I paid it at the shop over the counter——I took no receipt—I considered it a cash transaction—I saw you put it in the till—no one else was in the shop—I know Hilton—he has said he saw Mr. Grub pay moneys, and I understood him to say he had seen moneys paid into the till that had been received from Mr. Grub.</p>
