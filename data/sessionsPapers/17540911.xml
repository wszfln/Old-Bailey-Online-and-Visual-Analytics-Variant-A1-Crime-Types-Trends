The prisoner dropp'd the violin, and I took it up and would have given it him, but he denied it being his property. The mob carried him to Mr. Duke's shop, and there I saw a violin produced, but whether it is that which fell from the prisoner I can't tell.</p>

The prisoner lay out of my house that night. I had a suspicion of him, and inquiring about for him, he was taken between eleven and twelve that day in Monmouth Street. I was sent for to him in St. Giles's Round-house, and he owned to me he broke the chest open, and took away the money.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for to Monmouth Street to take the prisoner into custody. I brought him to my house, and upon searching him in my back kitchen found two 3 l. 12 s. pieces, two moidores, three guineas, three gold rings, a silver pocket piece, three silver buckles, and to the best of my knowledge 17 s. 6 d. in silver. Produced in court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can't swear to the money, but the rings and buckles are my property, and were in my chest before it was broke open.</p>
               <p>Flannegan. I sent the prisoner to the Round-house, where the prosecutor came, and I heard him own to his master, that he broke open the chest either with a poker or tongs, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about taking the money and rings?</p>
               <p>Flannegan. I did not. I had other business, and so went away, leaving them together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dorton. I live in Monmouth Street. Mr. Pitten came to my shop and asked me if I had seen such a person, describing the prisoner. I said, I had not; he desired me, if I should, to stop him, and send him word, saying, he had been robbed of upwards of 40 l. In about half an hour after he was gone the prisoner came into the street, and I followed him into a shop where he went in; he had another young fellow along with him. I got another person to go in with me, and said to the prisoner, Young man, I believe you are the young man who have robbed your master of 40 l. He said, he believed it was not above half the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Dorton. He was very sober. The other person with him asked what was the matter, and upon my telling him, said, he was afraid he had done some such thing, and that he had lent him a guinea to buy him a coat, which he returned to me. We sent for a constable, and the prisoner was taken into his house and searched, and the money and things found upon him as the constable mentioned, including the guinea that was delivered to me by the other person. He was put into the Roundhouse, and I sent for the prosecutor, who came, and asked him how he came to do so. He answered, he could not tell. His master asked him what he had done with the rest of the money, and he said he had been in a very disorderly house, and had spent it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been drinking, and know nothing how I came by the money, but I am sure I did not break the chest.</p>

             Clark. This tankard was brought to me; (I am a dealer and chapman) and offer'd to sale the very same night a little before nine o'clock. I have seen both the prisoners before. Taylor came to me at my window, and said he had got a friend that had a silver tankard to sell : I asked them both to walk in; then Fletcher pull'd the tankard out and gave it into my hand to sell it to me. I ask'd him what he ask'd an ounce for it; he said 5 s. and insisted upon my buying it that night. I said I never buy any thing by candle light; I stop'd it and lock'd it up, and said I would buy it by day-light if I could, and would give them more than they asked. The next morning Taylor came and demanded the money for it; I refused paying the money and sent for an officer; but before I sent for the officer he told me Fletcher was either gone or going on board a vessel at Gravesend; then the officer came and I gave him charge of Taylor; then he directly said that Captain Fletcher (the Name he went by) was over the way in some court. Then I said to the constable, Am I safe to keep Taylor till I take Fletcher? he said, yes; then the officer went with my maid, and she shew'd him Fletcher, and he took him, and they were both carried before alderman Cockayne at the Mansion-house; there I carried the tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Clark. Fletcher confessed the thing and was sorry for it; I can't say his exact words. Taylor said, he met Fletcher in a place in Bishopsgate-street and he persuaded him to come to me with the tankard. The tankard produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. from Taylor. Did you ever see the tankard in my hand?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>

               <p>I used to go to the prosecutor's house to see a friend from Norwich; I had been there that night and went away about six at Night. I returned again about seven upon the key. Going away I saw this tankard standing under the gateway, I took it, and being a little poverty-struck (or I should have advertis'd it.) I met my brother-prisoner in Bishopsgate-street; I asked him where I could sell it; he said, let us carry it to Mr. Clark, we did, and he stop'd it.</p>
               <p>Taylor's defence.</p>
               <p>I did not know that the tankard was stolen.</p>
               <p>To Fletcher's character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bradley. I have known Fletcher about three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He has spent 14 or 15 hundred pounds; he has been too and again at my house; I never knew any ill by him.</p>

I lifted up the bd on the right side to look out and bid him go on, and there saw the prisoner on horseback with a pistol pointing in at the window. His hand shook very much, and I expected by the motion of it the pistol would have gone off every minutes. He said, Deliver up your money, or I'll How your bins out. I was taking off a bracelet from my right hand, and told him at the same time that he should not have it; the spring being very difficult to undo, I could not get it off in less than two or three minutes. Then I put my hand into my pocket, and took out a blue silk purse and gave to him. I think there were nine guineas in it, but I can swear to eight. A gentleman, Monsieur Debreau, whom I was carrying to shew him Windsor, and who is since returned to France, gave him, as he thought, about 26 s. He took up a pistol, and was very angry with me that I would not let him shoot the prisoner. I asked the prisoner how long he had been of this business; he said that was the first time of his robbing on the highway, and he must have been arrested if he had not done it. He said, he hoped I'd do him no harm, but I told him I should do as I thought proper as to that. I had an opportunity to examine his horse in this time, and found he was lame. As he went off he turned down into a lane on the right hand. I called to my servant, and told him I thought it was easy to take him. We stopped and I got out of my chariot. We saw a coach and fix with some servants on horseback coming, which was Sir Kendal Clayton's. When they came up I told the gentleman I had been robbed, and desired he'd let his servants go to help in taking the highwayman. He consented to it, but there was no horse for my servant to mount; till a young man happening to come upon the road on horseback, I begg'd he'd lend me his horse, which he did. My servant mounted him, and went after the other two servants. I went on to Cranford Bridge and ordered my dinner, and in about a hour from the time of the robbery was brought in at Cranford Bridge Bridge was asked what could induce him to vous a practice. He and, he had three children in necessity, and begg'd for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you in ?</p>
               <p>D. Quane. He did instantly, and said, I could but take away his life. I answered, we did not intend to do any thing more with it. Then we took him to Justice Birkhead, where he was searched, and denied having the purse. I said, how can you have the impudence to deny it? be honest once in your life before you are and tell me what you have done with it. He said than he had put it under his saddle upon his horse. But I should have told your Lordship, that going with him to the justice's he pretended to faint, and tumbled from his horse. There was a soldier in a chaise. I desired him to take him into his chaise, which he did, and this soldier being at the justice's. I desired him to go to the stable and see for the purse. He went, but whether the soldier play'd a trick upon the highwayman or not, I don't know; but he brought me the purse empty.</p>

            . I am footman to the prosecutrix. On the 18th of August last, between three and four in the afternoon, I was behind the chariot on Hounslow Heath. I first saw the prisoner at about a hundred yards from us. When he came pretty near he looked round me and went past the chariot, and peep'd in; then he sell back five or six yards. I kept a very strict eye upon him, and saw him put his hand into his right hand coat pocket, and saw the end of a pistol coming out.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110008"/> Then he rode up to the chariot and called to the coachman to stop. The coachman said, ha! Stop, said the prisoner. The coachman seeing the pistol, stopped. My lady looked out, and the pistol was presented to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the chariot was the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Robertson. He was within two yards of it then. He said, Your money. My lady said, ha! Your money, said he, directly, or I'll blow your brains out. My lady said, Very well, you shall have my money. I saw her give him a blue purse, and saw gold shine through it, and some silver given him afterwards. After he had received it he put that and the pistol into his pocket, and rode on half a mile a little distance from the chariot. When he got between the two heaths he turned down on the right hand side towards Butchers Grove. I begged of my lady to let me have one of the pistols out of the chariot to go and pursue him. I saw a coach and six coming behind. My lady desired the gentleman to let me have a horse to pursue. He was not willing to that, but sent his two servants after the prisoner. A young gentleman coming by, my lady begged of him to let me have his horse, which he did. I mounted, and taking a brace of pistols, followed. I found in about a mile and half that the two servants had stopped him, I rode up with a pistol, telling him, if he did not resign I would blow his brains out directly. He said, he had resigned. Then we tied his hands, and took him to Cranford Bridge to my lady. After that we went back to Hounslow to the justice, and there he owned where the purse was. Mr. Clayton's servant and a soldier went to see for it, and I saw the purse taken from under the saddle of the horse, as I had hold of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner again, are you certain he is the man?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I am sure of it, my lord.</p>

            . I was driving the chariot with my lady in it on the 18th of August, and aboat the middle of Hounslow Heath the prisoner came to us. He first came opposite to me, then drew his horse back, and then came up again, biding me stop. I said, ha! He said, stop coachman. I stopped, and my lady putting her head out at the chariot door, he said, Your money, madam. He had his pistol in his hand, cocking it at the time. I saw the money in a purse delivered to him. He put it in his pocket, and was going on, but turned back and said to the gentleman in the chariot, Sir, I hope you will not hurt me; for it was necessity that drove me to it, and if I had not done this I must have gone to prison. He rode on about half a mile before the chariot, and at the first turning on the right hand he struck off. Then we stopped and my lady got out of the chariot, and Sir Kendal Clayton coming by with two servants - .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that did the robbery ?</p>

            , it was his coach and horses, not Sir Kendal's. As we were coming almost to the eleventh mile stone upon Hounslow Heath some people on foot told us a lady had been robbed, and said the man might be soon taken. We went on and saw the chariot and the lady standing by it; my master stop'd his coach to see what was the matter. We were told she had just been robbed, and were shewn which way the highwayman was gone. They desired my master's horses to pursue, and he accordingly ordered me and my fellow servant to go after him. About half a mile down the lane we found the prisoner dismounted standing by his horse, and seized him directly. We asked him if he had not robbed a lady in a chariot. He said, he had, and that necessity drove him to it, and begged we'd let him go. I said we must take him to the lady at Cranford Bridge, which we did then, and before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing there ?</p>
               <p>Carlton. He did not deny but that he took the money, but he did not know what he had done with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going down to Reading. The day being very hot, I denied at Brentford, and stopp'd at three or four places besides, and drank some cyder mixed, what we call on board shangaree. I found myself in liquor, and going down this lane thought of easing myself, and got off my horse. I hope you will consider, whether, if I had been guilty of so great a crime as laid to my charge, I should have been so stupid as not to have got off at that time. One of the men said, he'd blow out my brains if I did not surrender, saying, I was the man by my coat and horse; I had three pistols cock'd to my head at once. The reason I had a pistol in my pocket was, because I had been confined in a mad house three times, and was told I should be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110009"/> taken and put in again; so I carried that every day to defend myself.</p>

I asked him to drink with me; we had another pint brought, and put into the tankard, and after that another, which we drank out of a pewter pint mug. Then there came in a young man to enquire for a person, which, I believe was there. I asked him to drink, he said, yes. In about half an hour after I shook hands with the prosecutor, and said, God bless you; he said, will you call again another time? I said, when I come that way I will. The young man went away with me; he is at present waiter at the Queen's Hand, in the Old Bailey, he went into the, and I into Mr. Lock, where I lodg'd; going in, a gentleman called, Hip. Mr. Verity, it was one Mr. More: he said, he should be obliged to me if I would take a tankard and keep it for him till eleven o'clock, then being it to him at the Horshoe and Magpie, in Clare-Market, saying, he was going farther, so I took it and carried it up to my lodging room.

She said, they were in Skinner-street, at one Wells's, a Pawnbroker; she went there with me, and asked for them herself; the pawnbroker told her to bring her mother. I desired the pawnbroker to let me have them, but she would not. I said, I'd pay for them, still she would not, but said, if they were such things she would deliver them at the Old Bailey. I charg'd the constable with the girl, and went to the pawnbroker again; she would not let me have the plates; then I got a warrant to search her house; we search'd a good deal, but could not find them, at last, by persuading her, she sent her girl into the cellar, who brought them up (thirteen plates produced in court, and depos'd to) the girl confessed before the constable and two or three gentlemen, that she stole them from my kitchen.

On the 27th of July a neighbour of mine came and told me if I would look about I should miss some lead, and that the two men that stole it were at the Sun Alehouse, in Clement's-Lane. I went to the place, and found the lead was missing near the side of a still, then went to the alehouse, and found Lightholder there, and charg'd him with it. the other was run away. Lightholder said, if I would be favourable to him he'd carry me to the place where he had sold the lead.</p>

I took it away, sent for a constable, and took the woman and Lightholder to Justice Fielding's; there was Justice Bedwell; when I came there Everard was there also. They both confessed they stole it in my hearing before the Justice; the woman had owned before she had bought it of them for 13 d.</p>

               <p>Reading. I believe the woman is more to be than they, and if it had not been neighbours desiring me to prosecute her, I not have done it.</p>

On the 27th of July in the afternoon about four o'clock, I was standing at my I saw the two prisoners go by me, and Lightholder had a tool bag on his shoulder, he it the other; shoulder, it seem'd to be pretty heavy, I followed them to E. Shepherd's house, there I heard them throw it down in the shop, without asking any questions at all. I saw them come back again empty, putting money into their pockets; then I followed them to the Rising  there they call'd for a pint of beer; I asked the landlord where hey work'd; he said, they work'd at one Mr. Barnard's, a distiller, in Clare-Market: thinking it was Mr. Barnard's, I went there, and he informed me it was at the next door, at Mr. Everard's. After that I went to the woman's house, and there we found the lead, 30 pounds. We took Lightholder and the woman before the justice, and when we came there, the other prisoner was there; they both confess'd it, and the woman said she gave half a crown and two pence half penny for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the men the look of thieves ?</p>
               <p>Eliot. No; they were journeymen carpenters.</p>

               <p>Eliot. Because lead lies closer than tools.</p>

We went on board a ship at King James's Stairs. He handed down two pieces of tow-line to me, about three fathom of them both; then we went on board capt. Simpson's ship, there he took down the tow-line of the forecastle, I believe about sixty fathom; we put it in the boat, and carried it down to

About half an hour after ten o'clock last Tuesday night, Mrs. Lee sent her daughter for me to go and take a thief, who said her mother was in custody for receiving some stolen rope, and if I would go and take a man up, it might be a means of clearing her mother. I took him, but he would not make a voluntary confession. He mentioned this evidence as being concerned with him; so we went and took him, and he was admitted evidence against the prisoner. The prisoner owned the stealing the rope out of the ship, and said it weighed eight hundred three quarters, for which they were paid, and fourteen pounds they were not paid for. The rope is in custody of a headborough at Limehouse. The evidence has given information of several other facts committed.</p>

She said, Yes; are not you a chairman? I said, I am in the winter time. She begged me to give her a pint of beer. I went to the Wheatsheaf and gave them a quartern of gin, they chose that. The other said, Give us another quartern, that will serve us all night. I did, and then came out, and at the door the prisoner said, Will you not give me a buss before you go? and held me: I gave her a buss to get shut of her. In the mean time came a man with a knife and held to my belly, and said, If I stirred or resisted, he'd rip me open. This woman had hold of me at the same time. She took out my watch, and 5 s. in money.</p>

               <p>Dobbins. I did. I had it in my pocket when I was in the house. They all three went away towards the fields. I advertised the watch. At last a man brought the watch on the Monday morning. The constable advised me to take the man that I was to give the reward to before the justice; there I paid the reward. The justice said he'd give me the watch when I found the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man that brought you the watch?</p>
               <p>Dobbins. Yes, his name is Stevens; he took his oath he found it in Oxford-road. On Monday the 19th in the evening, I went to the house where I had been robbed, and near there I found her. She would not confess taking the watch or money, only said she was in company.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the watch?</p>
               <p>Dobbins. It cost me 5 l. new; to be sure it is worth 4 l.</p>

            . On the 17th of August last, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, I was on the marsh wall, by the mill, at <placeName id="t17540911-24-crimeloc138">Poplar</placeName>

               <p>Q. What place is it? Is it a lone place, or among houses ?</p>
               <p>Foster. There are no houses, it is an open field. I had two calicoe curtains in my hand belonging to Mr. Crush; the prisoner met me and stopped me. I was going over the water. He told me I could not get a boat there. He took me in his arms, and carried me into the rushes, betwixt the river Thames and the bank, without saying another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110016"/> word to me; there he used me in a very indecent manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue there?</p>
               <p>Foster. I believe about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you both come out of the rushes together ?</p>
               <p>Foster. We did, and went to Mr. Crush's house, about a mile from the place.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he walk with you before he took any thing from you?</p>
               <p>Foster. About ten yards. He asked me for my bundle, and said he'd carry it for me. He threw me into a ditch at getting over a stile, my bundle fell out of my hand, and he picked it up. After that I asked him for it; he said he would carry it, for he was afraid it would tire me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you ask him for it after he picked it up?</p>
               <p>Foster. It might be about ten minutes after he picked it up. When I got him to Mr. Crush's I bid him come in, and he would not, but went to the door, and offered to pull me out, and then ran up an alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with any body betwixt the rushes and Mr. Crush's house?</p>
               <p>Foster. No we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to Mr. Crush's ?</p>
               <p>Foster. It was about half an hour after eight. As soon as I got into the house, I made complaint in what manner he had used me, and that he had got the curtains, my handkerchief, and 3 d. in money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he by the money?</p>
               <p>Foster. He asked me for my money, and I refused him. He asked me again, and I gave him three pence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Foster. This was just after he took me out of the ditch; my handkerchief was tied round the curtains. They went and took him with my Bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>Foster. No, never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pistol he had ?</p>
               <p>Foster. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike you?</p>
               <p>Foster. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him when he took the things ?</p>
               <p>Foster. I said I'd treat him if he'd go into the town. I did it to take care of myself. He said he thought it would look odd for me to treat him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Foster. I live servant with Mr. Crush's sister in East-Lane, Greenwich. I had never been of that side of the water before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he throw you into the ditch?</p>
               <p>Foster. When he came to the stile, he fell into the ditch and pulled me in after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wet or dry ditch ?</p>

               <p>Foster. It was a very muddy ditch, and we were both very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he fuddled ?</p>
               <p>Foster. Really I can't tell, for I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you see the miller as we went by?</p>
               <p>Foster. There was the miller at his gate; the prisoner said to him, Hallow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call to the miller to assist you?</p>
               <p>Foster. I did not. I thought he might be as bad as the other, and I was willing to get the prisoner to Mr. Crush's house.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did I not ask you to go in at the first publick house to drink?</p>
               <p>Foster. He asked me to go in at several alehouses, but I would not. I said, I would go to the farthest end of the street before I would drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the street?</p>
               <p>Foster. It is a pretty long street. He came singing and whistling along the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Crush's house at the end of the street?</p>
               <p>Foster. No, it is past the middle of the street.</p>

I keep the sign of the three Foxes in Narrow-street, Ratcliff. My wife made her sit down and eat some bread and butter, and drink a dish of tea; after that she went away, the way she has here mentioned, for Greenwich, with the curtains. She came back to my house crying between eight and nine, and said she had been stop'd and used ill. I asked where the man was that stop'd her. She said he was gone up the street. A person looking out at a window, said he was gone up the court. I took a man with me; it being no thoroughfare; I found the prisoner betwixt a shed and a necessary house at the upper end of the court. We seized him and took the things from him. He said he did not design to run away with them.</p>

               <p>Hone. No, I did not. The girl said, he threw her into the ditch, and she dropped the bundle and he took it up. And that he had asked her for it twice before, and she would not give it him.</p>

            . I did keep the Foxes, the house now Mr. Crush has. The same night this man was taken, I was there, the girl came into a box, and asked a man to come in and drink a pint of beer, seemingly in a civil manner; no man coming in, the girl said, the man had got her bundle; she was ask'd what man; she said, she did did not know, but he was a taylor. Mr. Crush and other people went out and up the court, and brought the prisoner in. The girl declared before the justice, the man did not take the bundle from her, but as he was helping her over the stile, they both fell down, and he took up the bundle, she ask'd him fol it, and he told her he'd carry it, fearing it should tire her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say she consented to his carrying it?</p>
               <p>S. Powers. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say he would not give it her?</p>
               <p>S. Powers. No, she did not, and she said, he said he'd take her to a lodging. She answered, which way will you get a lodging? he said, he'd pawn his coat; she said, no, how sadly you'll look without a coat, we had better pawn the bundle. First of all she said they were down in the rushes, and she spit; he said, d - n you, do you spit at me; she said, no, but she was very dry, and wish'd he'd go and get some beer; he said, he had no money, have you any? She said 3 d. he said, give it me, and I'll go and get some beer; she gave it him; he asked her to go in at several alehouses going along; she said, no, she would go to the end of the street if it was ever so far.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mr. Crush's house from the end of the street?</p>
               <p>S. Powers. It is pretty near the end of the street.</p>

               <p>William Adkins. Betwixt 6 and 7 o'clock on Sunday morning, five weeks ago, I proposed to meet a friend of mine at the Red Cross; I went in and there saw the prosecutor asleep in the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with him before?</p>
               <p>Adkins. No. I called for half a pint of cyder, there I saw the prisoner sitting by the prosecutor, and there was another man sitting by the prisoner (they were both soldiers.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of them near the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Adkins. The other man was close by him, and the prisoner was on the other side of a narrow table. I saw him put his hand over the table, and put it into the prosecutor's breeches pocket twice, as he was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide was the table?</p>
               <p>Adkins. It was about eighteen or twenty inches wide. I said to the prisoner, friend, you are doing a wrong thing, to a man that is asleep; he said I had no business with it. The second time I saw him take out four, five, or six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the money?</p>
               <p>Adkins. I saw it in his hand. I am sure there were four or five, if not more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with it?</p>
               <p>Adkins. He put it in his pocket, and the man on the other side, said, let me give you 2 s. 6 d. for that half crown, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take that half crown?</p>
               <p>Adkins. No, I did not, I saw none but shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other people in the room?</p>
               <p>Adkins. There were a man and a servant maid there at the time, she was cleaning the room, there was no body but myself took any notice about it. I said to the man, when he awaked, pray, Sir, how much money have you in your pocket? he said, what is that to you? I said to be sure it is nothing to me, but I saw that man (meaning the prisoner) take some money out of your pocket. Then he said he had four or five and twenty shillings in his pocket, he put his hand in and said it was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket did he put his hand in?</p>
               <p>Adkins. His left hand breeches pocket; the same pocket which the prisoner put his right hand into, and take the money out. I desired him to give the prosecutor his money again, but he would not. Then the prosec utor desired I would see him righted. We took him before the justice, there he was searched, and five or six shillings was found upon him. He said two of them were his own, and that it was the first fact he had ever committed.</p>

               <p>I was coming from my quarters that morning, and saw the prosecutor, a soldier, and two women, who had been drinking together all night in Covent-garden; they asked me if I would go and drink share of a dram; I went along with them, we had half a pint of gin: one of the women that was along with them, said, they had had seven or eight pots of drink. They then went from thence to the Red Cross at Charing Cross; there the prosecutor fell fast asleep, and when he awaked he said he had so much money in his pocket on Saturday night, but that he had been with some vile women, and could not tell what was become of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Are you very certain you had this money in your pocket when you went to sleep?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor Yes, I am, for I counted it while I was in that house.</p>

               <p>Lion Toby. I am constable. This evidence brought the prisoner to my house, and gave me charge of him, and said he had offered a silver chas'd milk pot to sell for 3 s. 6 d. I asked him how he came by it, he said his uncle gave it him, but could not tell where he lived. After that he said he found it on a dunghill, I think somewhere near Croydon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in the country about eleven miles from London, I found this mug. Coming by Aldgate there was a Jew standing, who asked me if I would sell it, I said yes: then he said come along with me, and carried me to a publick house, where I gave him two pints of beer. Then he went out a considerable time, and came in again, and said he would go and weigh it. After that came in this man, and a man that had it in his hand flung it away, they took it up and secured me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Joshua. Was there another man with him?</p>
               <p>Joshua. There was, but he ran away, and the prisoner was going to run away too.</p>

On the 10th of July having missed several things, I suspected the prisoner, and desired Susannah, Le'ban to search her box, she did, and found several things there, a shirt, a child's apron, caps, a linen frock, and such things. Produced in court and deposed to. The prisoner was recommended to me by one Morgan, who keeps an intelligence office in the Minories; on the 20th of August, and on the 22d I had a mohogany table drawer broke open with sixteen or seventeen guineas in it. After these several other things were found upon her. She confessed she had given the money to Mr. Morgan. We took her before Mr. Alderman Chitty, and there she confessed the taking the things mentioned in the indictment, this she did before three witnesses, and she went and fetched the thing with, which she wrenched open the table drawer, which was a tool I use, being a bookbinder, called a fillet. Produced in court.</p>

               <p>Barbary Tomlinson. I live in Paradise Row, Brook-street, at the house of Mr. Sharp. I was Mr. Taaft's servant, and discharged when my lady went abroad; he lived at that time in <placeName id="t17540911-30-crimeloc170">Hanover-square</placeName>

               <p>Q. When did you see the counterpane last ?</p>
               <p>B. Tomlinson. I remember seeing it about a month before the servants were discharged. She said she would fetch it again in a quarter of an hour's time: she gave Mr. Finlesson and I directions where to find it, which was at Mrs. Strutton's, at Walthamstow. We went there, but there was no such name in the parish. After that she said it was at Ealing, that her husband had got it there. And after that she said she had cut it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it?</p>
               <p>B. Tomlinson No, we never did. The constable opened her box, and found the towels and 3 napkins in it, and a tea cloth.</p>

I and a person in possession looked over the goods and found a crimson mohair counterpane missing; I desired the person in possession to make diligent inquiry about it. After which the prisoner was taken up and brought to Mr. Taaft's house. I happened to be there. I asked her what she had done with the counterpane, she denied taking it for a little time, and at last fell down on her knees and owned she had it, and that it was at Walthamstow, and gave us directions in writing where to find it, but when we came there, there was no such person to be found as she directed. I understood there were two boxes of hers at a chandler's shop, I got a search warrant and went with the constable there and took the boxes away, and carried them to Mr. Taaft's, and opened them, and desired Mrs. Tomlinson, my lady's maid, to be present, because she knew the things; there were these other linen things found, which had Esq; Taaft's name upon them.</p>

               <p>A. Bowman. With a neighbour in the next room to me, for me to take care of for her. When I came home and had seen the counterpane, I went to her and asked her how she could leave it there, and told her I could not sleep in quiet in my bed unless she took it away. My brother-in-law was then with me, and I desired him to take and carry it to her master Taaft's house; which afterwards he told me he did. She was servant with Mr. Taaft then.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain whether the person that married them had or had not a gown on?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110024"/>Russel. I believe he had a gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout is this house, where he was married ?</p>
               <p>Russel. 'Twas in Fleet Market, near Fleet Street, on the right hand side as you go from Holbourn, three or four houses from the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been to inquire at any house for a register of a marriage with that woman ?</p>
               <p>Russel. I did go by the desire of the mother about a month after they were married, to the same house for a certificate; but they would not let me have one under nine shillings. They thought she had been an heiress, and wanted a good deal of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been lately ?</p>
               <p>Russel. No, upon my word I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Mr. Beech ?</p>
               <p>Russel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer money to a man to insert the register of the prisoner and Mrs. Mills ?</p>
               <p>Russel. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer a guinea at any time?</p>
               <p>Russel. No, I never offered a farthing after that first time that I told you of.</p>
               <p>Mary Jennings. I was married to the prisoner at the bar in the year 1753 at May Fair Chapel by Mr. Keith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with him afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I did near a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you worth any thing in money or effects at the time you married him ?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I was worth about 74 l. at the time. I went and received it at the Bank after I was married, and bought me some goods; the rest of the money we spent. I had a little house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any children by him ?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I had a child by him, of which I lay in within these three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know before he married you that you was intitled to something?</p>
               <p>Jennings. Yes, I told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Russel. What was the ceremony that was performed?</p>
               <p>Russel. I believe they were married as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been married ?</p>
               <p>Russel. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same as performed then ?</p>
               <p>Russel. To the best of my knowledge it was in the same manner as mine word for word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a ring?</p>
               <p>Russel. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say he'd have her, and her say she'd have him?</p>
               <p>Russel. I did.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Oroonoko. I have been in England these four years, and have always gone to church.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been instructed in the christian religion?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe in God?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. I do, and his son Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you instructed in the christian religion ?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. From the pulpit, but I never was christened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. Yes, I do, and should think myself obliged to speak the truth, or I should not go to heaven.</p>
               <p>He is sworn.</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. I am servant to Mrs. Hughes, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110026"/> with her when she was robbed. The man who robbed her had a mask on, but he passed by me twice without it. I had taken notice of his horse, and observed his great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at Mr. Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. I did. He is the man that passed by me in Ealing twice, and he is the man that robbed my mistress with a mask on. I am sure he rode the same horse also.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you had seen him ride by that your mistress was robbed?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. 'Twas about a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe of the horse?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. I observed he had fine legs. When he passed me the second time I looked the man in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken ?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What coat had he on before the justice?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. He had the same great coat on that he had before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse after that time?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. No. But I knew him again when he came to the chariot side. I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you saw him at Justice Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Oroonoko. 'Tis about a fortnight ago.</p>

            . The prisoner came our shop and offered this watch to pledge. [producing a metal one.]. He asked 36 shillings upon it. I shewed it to two or three gentlemen that came into my shop, and we talked about the dial-plate; it was a remarkable one, and instead of the twelve figures on it, there were the letters

            . While we were talking the prisoner went out, and left the watch behind. After that he sent me a letter and gave me descriptions of the watch, desiring me to send it by the next post.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at this watch. Do you know it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have wore it three or four years. 'Tis my son's, and his name is round the dial-plate. This is the watch I was robbed of.</p>

               <p>Thomas Alderidge. I remember seeing the prisoner at Ealing last April, but can't say the day; I know it was the day. Mrs. Hughes was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him there?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. I had. He asked me what house that was; I said, Captain Hughes's. He asked me whether he was in town, and whether they entertained any company there; I said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. 'Twas about three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this was the day Mrs. Hughes was robbed?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. Because the coachman told me that day they had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on horseback, or on foot?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. He was on horseback, but I can't remember the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a great coat on?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. No, he had not. But he had one buckled behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. Yes, I saw him at Justice Fielding's.</p>

               <p>Q. What colour was his coat that was buckled behind him ?</p>

               <p>Q. What was the colour of the coat he had on?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. 'Twas a dark blue grey. I think a close-bodied coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him when you saw him at the justice's?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. I did by his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember him so well?</p>
               <p>Alderidge. Because when I heard the coach was robbed, he was not then out of my memory.</p>

            . I remember that the day in the evening of which Mrs. Hughes was robbed I went into the King's Arms at Ealing between six and seven o'clock; there I saw the prisoner. He had a great coat on. He asked me where I lived, and who I worked for; I answered; that I worked for every family in the town. He said, Do you work for Captain Hughes? I answered, that I did; to-which he replied, that he knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Moley. I believe he got upon his horse to go away betwixt six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the horse?</p>
               <p>Moley. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he ride?</p>
               <p>Moley. Towards Brentford, and Mrs. Hughes's chariot was gone that way before. He asked, whose chariot it was, and I said, Captain Hughes's. I met the chariot in the lane after it had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a great coat on when he went away ?</p>

            . I am collector at the turnpike at Highgate. On the 28th of August last one Mr. Brown a quaker, from Luton, in Bedfordshire, rode up to me, and said, I beg you'll shut the gate, for this man coming with horses, I suspect has stolen them, for there was another man along with him, and he is run away, his name is Clemonts, and there were 5 guineas offered for the apprehending him from the town of Luton, the prisoner came up soon with the horses.</p>

               <p>Pickford. The black one has no white about him, he is a little hollow in the back, with slouch ears; the brown one has a star in his face; the man was upon the mare, and they were tyed together with pieces of cart-rope. The prisoner wanted to go through; we stopped him, and told him he must not go any farther. for we suspected the horses to be stolen; he said, he knew nothing of the man that we told him ran away, but said he was coming down Barnet-hill, and that man was coming with the horses; he asked the man to let him ride as far as Hygate; we said, it was very particular for the man to let him ride on the saddle, and the owner to ride on the bare back.</p>

            . I am constable. On the 28th of August, a little after 5 in the morning, a man came and knocked at my door, and said, there was a man and some horses stopp'd at the Gatehouse supposed to be stolen : I got up and went there; the last evidence charged me with a mare and two horses; I ordered the Ostler to take care of the stable; then I was shewn the prisoner, and charg'd with him, whom I took down to my house, and sent word to Justice Cross that I had got a man for horse stealing; he sent word for me to bring the man to him, I did, and he examined him, and he was committed to New prison. The prisoner said before the Justice, as he was coming from Barnet, he overtook a man with these 3 horses, and desired the man to let him ride, and he let him ride upon his hackney; I said he was a good-natur'd man to let you ride upon the saddle, and he on the bare back; he said he could not ride on the bare back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work in Old-street ever since the Sunday before Whitsontide, my mate was taken ill, and could not work, and I went into the country to see for a mate to come to work with me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110030"/> coming along down Barnet hill I met a man with these horses, I asked him to give me a cast to London; he said, Yes, I should ride if I would give him some beer. I called for a pint of beer at the Mermaid and changed 6 d. He went down the hill before me; there I overtook him. He asked me which I would ride, and was going to help me up on one. The horse tossed up his leg, so that I dared not get upon him. Then he said, if you please you shall get upon my little nag, and I'll ride him. I got upon his nag, and he on the other horse, and before we got to Highgate he said he wanted to ease himself, and gave me the lead horse in my hand. There were three gentlemen coming down the hill; he said he did not chuse to turn himself up in the road till they were gone by. Then he was going to let his breeches down, but started and made a move to go away. The gentlemen followed him, and he went in at a little hunting gate upon the right hand coming from Barnet. I stood to see what was the matter, a man said to me, Young man I'd have you take these horses up to the turn-pike and deliver them there, for I suspect they are stolen. I took them to the turnpike and stopped; but before I came there a man went to the turnpike, and ordered the man to take care of these horses, and he had as good also stop me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pickford. Tell particularly what the prisoner said when he came up to the gate?</p>
               <p>Pickford. He said he knew nothing of the man or the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he want to go through?</p>
               <p>Pickford. He did, and when I was for stopping him, he said, What is the meaning of it, we paid at the other gate? He said but very little for himself.</p>

               <p>Q. What part was broke?</p>
               <p>Prestage. There was a pane of glass (which had a crack in it and a bit of paper stuck upon it ) was taken out of the casement to a lower window.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you find it to be broke?</p>
               <p>Prestage. My house is out of town, by the main road. I went out and locked the door, and left no body in it, and did not return till between seven and eight in the afternoon, but my wife came home between twelve and one. When I returned she told me she had lost the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lose?</p>
               <p>Prestage. The sum was upwards of 40 l. but we can't tell justly how much. It was taken out from the bottom of all our wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chest locked?</p>
               <p>Prestage. It was, and the key put into the drawer in a chest of drawers that stood by.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the drawers locked?</p>
               <p>Prestage. No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things did you lose?</p>
               <p>Prestage. I take no account of them; my wife can inform the court about them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the money last?</p>
               <p>Prestage. I saw the bag with money in it the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Prestage. She worked for me two or three days before this. She worked for me five days in all. When I missed the things, I searched for her but could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect her?</p>
               <p>Prestage. We searched for any body that we could find. William young came to my door on the Monday morning, about four o'clock, and called me up, and told me he could tell me where she was that robbed me. He directed me to Brentford. I went and called at every house, publick and private, till I came about half way up it. I met a man there, who said he saw the prisoner that morning at Brentford Butts about 3 o'clock. Then I got intelligence she was in a publick house with three men. At last I found her in the Red-lion tap-house at Brentford. I ordered a man to go and fetch a constable; after which I took her to Justice Burkhead, there she was search'd, and 33 l. 18 s. 2 d. 1/2 was found upon her, and some linen. (He produced the linen bag.) This bag the money was in, in the chest; the money was found upon her in this bag. I am positive to it; it was given me about four years ago. Here is a mark upon it by which I can know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any linen found upon her?</p>
               <p>

               <p>M. Prestage. A pane had been formerly crack'd, and we put a piece of paper over it to keep the wind out. The casement was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come back?</p>
               <p>M. Prestage. I came back by 12 o'clock. I found the key as usual where my husband and I used to lay it. The door was locked. I unlocked it, went in, and found the pane with the paper on it was taken out, but the window was hasped again as usual. The broken pane was just by the hasp. I began to look about to see what was lost. I looked into my drawers where my keys of my chest were, I missed a hood, a handkerchief, caps, and I can't tell how many things. I left them all upon the keys in the drawer. I took the keys to look into the chest, and my money was gone. There was upwards of 40 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the money last?</p>
               <p>M. Prestage. I had the bag and money and all in my hand that morning, and put it at the bottom of the chest under our cloaths.</p>

            . I shew'd her 3 pieces, a 36 s. piece, and two Guineas. I had not received the money above an hour, and had laid that money on the top of other money. I saw nothing extraordinary then to swear to in that piece of money, till she shewed me the nick upon it; then I took and mixed it amongst several pieces of mine, and she picked it out from them. I dare say she would pick it out from amongst a hundred.</p>

            . I am commander of the vessel called the Concord. I was at Maryland about the latter end of June last, there was great scarcity of men in all parts of Virginia and Maryland; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110033"/> wanted hands, and applied to all people there to get me men.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you want?</p>
               <p>Carron. I wanted five.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of this scarcity of hands?</p>
               <p>Carron. Most of the ships had their men pressed for the king's service. One Steward, a master of a ship, offered me the prisoner, he was the prisoner's master at that time; he sent him on board my vessel, for which I was to give him a valuable consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. When you set sail from Maryland, did you touch at any other place till you came to England?</p>
               <p>Carron. No, I did not. I was under an absolute necessity of coming to England when we set sail with the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he put on board your vessel?</p>
               <p>Carron. It was on the latter end of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner express a desire of returning again, in obedience to his sentence.</p>
               <p>Carron. He said he wished he could get back again, in consequence of his former sentence.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Maryland was you in when you took him on board?</p>
               <p>Carron. We were in Tucksant river.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that up land?</p>
               <p>Carron. It is thirty miles from the mouth of the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain his master sent him on board?</p>
               <p>Carron. I am, the mate brought him in his boat, from out of ship that lay above me in the river.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know his master gave him orders to come on board?</p>
               <p>Carron. I believe the mate dare not have brought him without his master's orders; but he sent his mate to me, understanding I wanted hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk with the master about it?</p>
               <p>Carron. No, I never spoke to the master. I knew the mate, and likewise knew that he was Captain Steward's mate.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that?</p>
               <p>Carron. The mate told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does that ship trade?</p>
               <p>Carron. It trades from Maryland to London.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in the Tucksant river?</p>
               <p>Carron. I believd he had been in the river about a fortnight, but I cannot say justly as to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her arrive?</p>
               <p>Carron. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner was on board when she arrived?</p>
               <p>Carron. I can't tell that, I heard the mate and prisoner too say he was on board that ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the transport ship?</p>
               <p>Carron. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the captain of the transport ship?</p>
               <p>Carron. I do, his name is Dobins.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the owners of this ship?</p>
               <p>Carron. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other prisoners on board this ship, exclusive of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carron. I can't tell that, I never understood that there was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is a vessel going from the port of London to Maryland ?</p>
               <p>Carron. We count 6 weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you set sail for London ?</p>
               <p>Carron. We weighed anchor July the 4th:</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get down to the mouth of the river?</p>

               <p>Carron. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express a desire not to go with you before you got down to the mouth of the river?</p>
               <p>Carron. I can't say he did; but he frequently, when he was at sea, expressed a desire of going back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know he was a transport from England, at the time you took him on board?</p>
               <p>Carron. Really I never considered that.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had insisted to go on shore while you lay in the river, could you have hindered him?</p>
               <p>Carron. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to give for him?</p>

            . Souch came and said to the prisoner, if you do not fight I'll kick you about; the deceased was very much in liquor at that time. After that they agreed to fight for a crown on the Tuesday night, to meet at 5 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How to fight ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. To fight with fists. On the Tuesday morning the deceased called me up. We saw old Mr. Souch, he wanted them to make it up, the deceased said it was best: the old gentleman said he'd give them a dozen of beer to shake hands and make it up. The deceased and I worked together till half an hour after five, then he said, now, let us go and drink together, while we are friends, do you know Mr. Souch is to give us a dozen of beer, so we went to the Bull together, there was one Gilbert there, who said, I believe there will be a battle now, for I see one is come. The deceased said I am come to drink part of this dozen of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the battle ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. No, I never saw More there. I left them; but I saw the deceased after he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him dead?</p>
               <p>Tompson. About twelve minutes after I left them, in a field behind the Bull Head.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the deceased for health before they fought?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He was a very healthy man at other times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks upon the deceased's body?</p>
               <p>Tompson. No, I did not.</p>

            . I was going by the Bull Head last Tuesday was seven-night, and saw the prisoner and deceased strip to fight, betwixt 5 and 6, as near as I can guess, I heard they were to fight for</p>
               <p>Q. Who said so ?</p>
               <p>Eagle. I heard them both mention it. They set to and fought for eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who struck the first blow ?</p>
               <p>Eagle. They made many offers to hurt one another as much as they could. There were a great many blows, and a great many falls.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they fight with?</p>
               <p>Eagle. With their fists. More had the best of the battle at first, but Whittman had the best of it at the middle, till after a fall or two the misfortune happened. They both fell down together, and both struck at one time. I lifted More up, for he had chose me his second, but Whittman never arose more.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they fall?</p>
               <p>Eagle. They both fell on their sides. More was very much beat, and very weak.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Whittman for health before they fought ?</p>
               <p>Eagle. He was a very healthy hearty man before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any grudge between them?</p>
               <p>Eagle. I did not hear of any. They had been fellow servants together, and went with much good humour, shaking hands before they began, and saying they would drink together after the battle was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased after this?</p>
               <p>Eagle. After he was laid out the next morning I saw him, he was very black down the left side, and was very much bruised.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that happened by the blows, or by the fall?</p>
               <p>Eagle. I suppose by the blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the face?</p>
               <p>Eagle. I observed nothing there but a little bit of skin off his lip.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the head?</p>
               <p>Eagle. He had no bruises about the head, but his sides and arms were black.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Eagle. I believe he died of the wounds he received from that man, but the prisoner seemed, by outward appearances, to be more hurt than the deceased after the battle was over.</p>

               <p>Q. Which agreed to that ?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. They both agreed to it; they fought about ten minutes with their fists, and had blows<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110035"/> on both sides. I believe they were down four or five times each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the last blow struck?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I did not, but heard somebody say the man was dead. I went to fetch some water for him, but he was quite dead. On coming out of the field I saw the prisoner cry, and heard him say he was very sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the body?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I did, and that night there were but little signs of any thing, but the next day, about twelve at noon, he looked very black on both sides and his thighs; the bottom of his ribs looked very green. I don't know whether it was occasioned by the falls or blows.</p>

               <p>I ha d been at London on my master's business. Coming home the deceased sat at the door and said, You are d - n'd proud, that you will not speak to poor folks. I said, I could not stay, but would come presently. I went and came again, and he asked me to drink. I said, I would with all my heart, if he had been at another house, but I had swore I would spend no money there. I went home and fetch'd my supper and came again. He then got off his seat and said, Are not you a blackguard scoundrel, you deserve to be well lick'd. I said, I don't want to wrangle and quarrel with you, come another day and I'll fight you, but this is Sunday night. He said, D - n you, I'll fight you for a guinea or two, and aggravated me much. I believe, if it had not been for my master, I should have been abused by him and his brother. Then my master said, I should fight, so we put down a shilling each to fight on Tuesday. Upon his coming then he was not for fighting, but his brother put him on. When he went into the field, I said, William, do you intend to fight me? He said, As long as I have life in my body. Then we stripped, and shook hands. I said, I hoped there was no malice between us, and he said, no.</p>

            . I was at the gate, and heard the prisoner and deceased quarrel. I stepped over to them; the deceased challenged the prisoner many times before he would fight him, but afterwards they would have fought that night if something had not prevented them, and upon this they put it off till half an hour after five on Tuesday. When the time came he asked me if Will Whittman was come, I said, no. I said, You shall not stir out of the door till he sends for you. Then there came a person and said that he was come. Then he went out, and going into the field they stripped to fight. As to the battle, I thought it was very fair, the prisoner had rather the worst of it till that blow by which the man dropped.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that blow fall on the deceased ?</p>
               <p>Souch. As far as I could perceive, it fell somewhere about the ribs.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know that it is your duty when people are exasperated, to make up the matter ?</p>

On the 21st of May, between the hours of one and two in the morning, I was in bed with my daughter in a parlour, my little dog barked, I heard something padding, presently I heard a violent wrench, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110037"/> called and said, You villains, are you going to rob me? After this they were still, then I heard a second noise, that was a pane of glass taking out at the window. I had four glass bottles stood on a table under that window when I went to bed. I heard them rattle, and called out a second time, What, you villains, are you still there? I am coming this minute. Then I laid still a little longer, and heard another noise, when I jump'd out of bed; and as I passed through the second room to tell another person, I heard them run away; then I went back and sat down in the parlour till I thought all was safe; I then opened the door that looked into the room where the bottles stood, and saw the window shutter was down; then r shut the door again, and fastened it, and sat down till I heard the watchman come by; I called him, and then went into the room and missed the four bottles. There was a bottle of cherry brandy, another of other brandy, one of geneva, and another of geneva bitters, all gone. The watchman told me he had seen three men over-against his stand drinking out of a bottle, but he knew none of them. About five weeks after, a man came and asked me if I was not robb'd about ten days before Whitsontide, and said he had got six fellows in Tothill-fields bridewell, and one of them is admitted evidence, he had confessed two robberies, and one of them was robbing me of four bottles of liquor, and desired me to come to Justice Fielding's; I went, the prisoner and evidence were there, but I knew nothing of them, for I saw no body.</p>

            , and I are night-men; we went all three together one day to the prosecutrix's house about 2 o'clock to see how the house stood; knowing her to be a widow woman that keeps a publick house we thought there were no men to oppose us; we concluded to break the house as near the bar as we could. We went from the Castle in Leicester-street, by Lickapont-street, the house we used, and got to her house about eleven at night, we thought it too soon to attack it, so we went to Holloway; we got to a farm-house, and thought to break that open, but it was too fast for us, so we went into a place and took a game cock and hen, and killed them. Coming back we met an elderly woman just by Islington church, Simms knocked her down and took from her one shilling and ten pence farthing, and an apron, which we sold for a shilling; then we came to Mrs. Parr's house, I pull'd three or four times at the window shutter, it would not come out, at last it did; after that the prisoner broke the glass, we took out 4 bottles of spirituous liquors, I took out one of them, and Simms three; then we broke the sash of the window, with an intent to get in, but some of the glass fell, and the prosecutrix struck a light and call'd out Thieves. We had a pistol and cutlass with us. There was a soldier in the house, we agreed the first man we saw to shoot or cut down, believing there was but one man at most, but the woman made such a noise we were forced to go away, knowing the watchman was very nigh; we went through the church-yard, and took a bottle of cherry brandy, and drank to the watchman, and bid him good night. We got to Leicester-street about 3 o'clock.</p>

            . On the 1st of August, between twelve and one o'clock, I was going with the prosecutor to shew him his way home, and we went in to drink at a house where I used to work. He went out and was sitting down on the bench very sick, I sat down by him. The three prisoners came round him, and all struck him on the head several times. To see whether he would speak Ball took him by his two shoulders, and pulled him from the bench upon the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to them upon this usage?</p>
               <p>More. I said nothing to them till I saw they were robbing him. The two youngest were at his pockets, but I did not see them take any thing. Seeing Ball take his watch out of his sob, I knocked at the door, but they did not open it, although the candle was not out, and I called out as loud as I could to Mr. Stevens, the man of the house. I said to Ball when he was taking the watch, You have robbed the man of all you can, don't take his watch. He said, What need you care? you know nothing of the man, when we have robbed him you shall have part of it; this was before I called out for help. As the watchman came, Ball gave me the watch into my lap, and said, If you belong to the man take the watch, you bitch, blast your eyes. I clapped it into my bosom, and they ran away. As soon as the watchman came up, I gave him the watch, with some halfpence and a key, which they had flung into my lap.</p>

            . I am a watchman; beating my rounds I heard a noise in Church-lane; going towards it Ball met me, and said, A good morning to you. I said the same to him. I went a little farther, there lay the prosecutor on the ground. He said he had been knocked down. This evidence was by him. She gave me the watch, and said she had been used ill in taking his part; and she also gave me a knife, a key, and a bit of snake-stone.</p>
               <p>Jos. Gaul. I was officer of the night; my watchman informed me he heard a noise, we went and found the prosecutor. The three prisoners were taken and carried before Sir
