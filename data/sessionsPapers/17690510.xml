            . I live in Moorfields, and work for Mr. Chamberlain, at the corner of Milk-Street. I came to his shop with some work on the 21st of April. My master was gone out, and I was desired to stay. I saw the prisoner come by my master's shop, and go as far as Bow Church. He crossed the way. There was a Jew with him. They came up as far as the corner of Bread-Street. Mr. Ewer's shop is at the corner of Milk-Street, Cheapside. The prisoner left the Jew, and went and looked into Mr. Ewer's shop, and he also looked in at the window. I was there at the threshold of Mr. Chamberlain's door. Then he went a little beyond it, came up again, went into the warehouse, and took a piece of linen from off the bench, put it into a bag, threw it on his left arm, and came out and went down Bread-Street. In about ten or twenty yards walking he gave it to the Jew, who put it under his left arm bag and all. I desired a person to watch them, while I went and told Mr. Ewer; in the mean time they got off.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same person that took the linen?</p>
               <p>Meymott. I am sure he is. I had seen him four or five times before on different days; but I never changed a word with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>This evidence does this all out of spite, because I went on board the Pembroke, and took an acquaintance of his with me. In going down to Portsmouth I ran away, and did not go to the ship with him. Then the evidence went to a bawdy-house, and told the old bawd of it, and she advised him to do this.</p>
               <p>Meymott. This is every word false. I know nothing of what he has been saying.</p>

            . I am a milk-woman, and live in Titchbourn-Court. I think it was on a Tuesday night, in April last, as I was going for a pot of beer, between eight and nine o'clock at night, that I saw a man in the entry of the prosecutor's house. I thought it was the man of the house at first; as I came up close to the door, I saw it was the prisoner Best. I said, What brought you here? he made no answer, but turned his back to me. The other prisoner put his head out of Mr. Saunders's room door, and said to Best, God blast her! what does she want there? I went on, and ordered my beer. When I came back, which was in two or three minutes time, I saw only Best in the passage. I went to my own door and stood there a little. I then saw a woman standing by the gate-way, about nine or ten feet from Saunders's door: she jumped from thence and went on the inside the door of Saunders's house. She put something in her apron: Best and the woman went away together, and Sykes followed with a parcel under his coat: I cannot say I know the woman, but to the best of my knowledge it may be the prisoner; tho' I cannot swear positively to her: she had a hat on that covered her face.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the men at the bar?</p>
               <p>C. Keith. I have known them above a quarter of a year. I have been in their company. I have seen them several times in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's. They lodged at a chandler's shop there, where I served the people with milk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Saunders or his wife that night?</p>
               <p>C. Keith. I did not. I go out very early in the morning, and do not come home till late at night. I told Mrs. Saunders of it the first time I saw her, which was in two or three days after. I went to tell her the next morning, but she was not up. I was forced to go and serve my customers, and when I came home again she was not at home. I told it to a needle-maker that lives next door to me the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what kind of things the woman had in her apron?</p>

I went with one of Sir John's men; we found the mug in Angel-alley, Long-Acre, up two pair of stairs, in Carryl's lodging-room, between the sheets of her bed, with the bottom taken out. ( Produced and deposed to.) Medley was apprehended and committed to Clerkenwell Bridewell. I went there to him; he confessed he took it, and said he was drunk when he took it. The mug cost me four pounds, three shillings and six-pence.</p>

After he had drank the beer he never paid for it; but put the pint under his jacket. I saw him do it as I was serving a customer with a pennyworth of gin; but I did not think he intended to go away with it. He got off with it.</p>

We met a girl in the court: when I spoke to her, she ran back and said, O Whinny, what have you done! Here is this silver pint mug come to light! I said, I imagine the mug is in the room. The man that belonged to the room took his hat and walked out. I turned up the coverlid of the bed, there lay the mug. I saw the prosecutor's name upon it. He took it in his hand and said it was his proper.</p>

I went in and found they got in at a window between fourteen and fifteen feet high. They got upon a post where his Excellency goes in at, and from thence in at a window. I observed on the inside the part where they had trod was dirty, which made me think there must be more than one; and as it had been robbed three times, it gave great suspicion of people in the yard. (There are three noble families in the yard.) This lay dormant till the 21st of April; then a person came and told me that Stapleton was a man concerned, that he had the surplice, which contained ten yards of muslin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100007"/> and had given it to these girls at the bar.

               <p>C. Chambers. He came behind me. He had spoke to me a little before. I met him about three weeks after with the breeches and waistcoat on, by the Alms Houses in St. Giles's. Said he, What do you want with me? I took him by the collar, and said, Let me have the things. Then he knocked me down, and said, You b - h! She is my wife, and said I was dead-drunk, and he wanted the key to go home; so he got away.</p>
               <p>Richard Row. I was the constable. I took up the prisoner on the ninth of April, for breaking open a house. I hearing he had robbed this woman, I asked him what he had done with the clothes; he said he had got the breeches on, and was willing to pay for the things.</p>

After she swore the robbery on me, she never served me with a warrant, but wanted me to give her half a guinea.</p>

I came home on the Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100008"/> morning. I met a gentleman at the Salutation at Billingsgate to receive my money. I took this young fellow at the bar with me. After that I saw some young fellows in St. James's park tossing up; one of them had this watch: he asked two guineas for it; he said it was Pinchbeck. I gave him that for it. After that he called me back, and said he had got a seal to sell. and shewed me a white stone seal: I bought it of him for two shillings. The same afternoon I went to the gentleman's shop and asked him if the seal was gold; he tried it, and said it was, and gave me ten shillings for it. I returned home and put that seal to the watch that is on it now. On the Monday morning my money was all spent. I lived with a young woman that made me spend all my money; then I went to sell the watch: they took us both and carried us to prison.</p>

            . One Friday, as I was going over St. James's park, I met with the prisoner Gray. There were people tossing up. A man asked Gray if he would buy a watch; he gave the man two guineas for it, and after we had gone down part of the walk he called after us, and asked Gray if he would buy a seal; he bought it for two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Shave. It was on a Friday about a fortnight or three weeks ago: I cannot tell justly the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Gray doing there</p>
               <p>Shave. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him there?</p>
               <p>Shave. No; he was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Shave. I am a butcher. I was carrying some meat through the Park.</p>

The prisoner said, If I continued to make any noise or resistance, he would blow my brains out. The others searched my pocket and took my watch, with a shagreen case, metal box, two guineas and a half in gold, and two or three shillings in silver. They went away directly.</p>

               <p>Smith. It is about three or four hundred yards distance. Sullivan put a pistol to my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Smith. I had never seen him before. Another of them put a pistol to my head; the other squatted down and took my silver buckles out of my shoes. They asked for my watch; I said I had never a one; then they demanded my money; I put my hand into my pocket and gave Sullivan about fifteen pounds; there was a nine shilling piece and a thirteen-and-sixpenny piece, guineas, half guineas, and quarter guineas. Then they left me. The next morning a girl came to me and asked me if I had been robbed; I said, Yes. Said she, Do you think you should know any of the men? I said, Yes. Said she, The man that was along with me was robbed of his watch and seven guineas; she said she was sure she knew one of them, for that she knew him before; his name is

            . It is not tw enty yards from Plough-Alley. I was coming home from Mr. Cornwell's, the Watermens Arms. I was afraid to come alone, and the gentleman came along with me. When they were taking the buckles out of his shoes, I said, Do not take the buckles out of his shoes, I think you have got enough. The gentleman that was with me was the mate of a ship; he is gone to sea; he was afraid he should lose his ship. He was robbed before Mr. Smith was. This was a little after eleven o'clock at night. I said to the mate afterwards, I know one of them, he was a bailiff's follower (meaning the prisoner); but I did not know his name.

I went there. Lion soon came in and said, Here is my partner, meaning me; then Cook went with us to Lion's house. The cloth was laid upon the table and opened; we looked at it.

               <p>Key. I was deputy-keeper of the Poultry Compter twenty years, and have been pretty much used to such sort of gentry. I then asked him where he made it; he told me he made it at Kensington, and that there were about five or six-and-forty yards more of it of different colours. I then pulled out my staff and took him by the collar, and told him he must go along with me. Then I went and took Morris, and put them both in the Compter.

Then Morris said it was as much Cook's as it was his, for they made it together. I advertised it, and went and enquired at Kensington, but could not find an owner. It is superfine black cloth. ( Produced in Court.) After that Morris said he was a watchmaker, and had made a watch for a man that came to four pounds ten shillings for this cloth, and the man was gone abroad.</p>

            . Mr. Lion came to me some time in April, and said there were two men had brought some cloth to his house to sell, and that he did not care to but any more. We agreed to secure them. He sent me to the Raven and Ship in Leadenhall-street; there were the two prisoners drinking with two women; then in came Lion and Keys. Then he and Keys went out with Cook and left me to take care of Morris. I heard Cook say they got it at Kensington. The rest of his evidence as Keys had said before.</p>

               <p>On the Monday night before I went through a house in Red-Lion-square, Holborn, where was Morris, and he asked me whether I could make half a day, saying, he had some cloth that he had of a gentleman on board a ship, and if I would go with him he would pay me what he owed me; he came to me the next morning, and we went to the Ship in Leadenhall-street, and spoke to Lion and asked him if he would buy any cloth. Lion said, it should be very safe if he would leave it there while he went to the synagogue. We left it. Lion came again in about a quarter of an hour, and these two gentlemen were there: he desired me to come along with him, so I went with him to his house. Then he said, he must turn his wife and children out, as he did not care<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100012"/> to let any body be in the room. Then he asked me what I asked a yard. I told him it cost the young man twelve shillings a yard. He said it was very coarse; and first bid me four shillings a yard, then four shillings and sixpence. Then Keys took me by the shoulder, and said he was an officer, and pulled out his staff; he took me to the Compter, and the next morning before Sir

I thought I felt one of them picking my pocket, so I turned round, but they then walked off. I felt, and told Mr. Jackson they had picked my pocket. We pursued them down by the side of Fleet-market. When we came close to them, they made a full stop, one said to the other, We have gone past the house. I said to them, You have been kind enough to pick my pocket. They said they had not. I said, I look upon it you have. They declared they had not, and said they did not know what we meant. One of them said, D - n my eyes, let us go, don't let us stop for them. I said you shall not go from me till I have my handkerchief. I said to Mr. Jackson, Do you lay hold of one, and I will the other, and we will take them to the constable; which we did, but going along they resisted so much, we thought it dangerous. We took them in at the Angel alehouse by the side of the Fleet market, and desired a gentleman to search them. He did, and found only one handkerchief upon one, and four upon the other, neither of them mine. In the mean time, a little girl picked up a handkerchief under the table, and said, Is this yours? I took it into my hand, and said it was mine. I said, This could not come here of itself. Then they dropped a little of their impudence, and were not so violent as they had been. I got a constable, and they were taken to the Compter, and the next day before Mr. Alderman Harley, who committed them. (The handkerchief produced and deposed to.)

I took a phial of stuff of the boy, and delivered it to Mr. Green; he took and looked at it, and said, I hope this will do my cold good. There was a woman in the house saw me give it him: as soon as he had it, he put it down and went out; then I said I would take the bottle up, and put it on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He lodged at our house during the time the other clergyman was gone to Oxford. My master came home about a quarter before eight, and being very cross with me for keeping the young woman to rock the cradle, he sent her home. Mr. Green knocked at the door at a quarter past nine. I took the child up from the cradle, she being just awake, and I went and opened the door. Mr. Green came in, and said, Will you light me a candle? I did. He said, Was I alone? I said, Yes. Said he, Have you not a sweetheart with you? No, said I, I don't want one; then he put his arm round my neck and kissed me, and at the bottom of the stairs he put his candle down, and followed me into the parlour. He said, Will you lose your ma idenhead? No, said I. He then took my candle out of my hand, and said, I want to look at this room; and put his hand about my waist, took me to the room door, and flung the door open. I got from him. He came and fetched me and flung the door open again, and took and carried and flung me on the bed with the child in my arms. This was a back room upon a ground floor. As I fell, the child lay on my arm all the time. He pulled up my petticoats, with the other arm cross my breast, the child scrambling, and that and I kept making a noise. He bid me hold my noise, and he would give me a guinea. I said, No, Sir. He said, By G - d you shall. And he ravished me without my will or consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I did resist as well as I could, and called out as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell what he did to you.</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He ravished me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100014"/>Q. In what manner.</p>
               <p>No Answer.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell in what manner he did it.</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. With his tool he did it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by that?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. If you will tell me what to say in a proper manner, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it something belonging to him?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. Yes. He pulled my petticoats up, and lay with me. There came wet from him, and blood from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell this story to the Justice?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the house besides you and he?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. No, there was not. My master was gone to fetch my mistress from the play.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He lay with me some time. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ravish you more than once?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After that was over, what did he do?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I went out of the room immediately, and he followed me into the fore parlour; but whether he went up into the study or not, I cannot tell: he put the candle out at the bottom of the stairs, and went out I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Which came home first, your master or mistress?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. Master came home first. Mistress came through the tavern to order a pint of beer. I was crying when he came home, which was about a quarter before eleven, or a quarter past. Master lives near the Three Tuns tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner come home?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. He came home again between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you mention this to first?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I first spoke of this to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any body lives in the houses joining your's?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. The house that joins our house on one side was empty, the house on the other side was not, but they went round to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I have lived there about two months. The prisoner did not lodge there when I went first.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged there?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I cannot tell whether he had been there a fortnight, or three weeks. When mistress came home, which was not a quarter of an hour after my master, she said, My dear, the child looks very poorly; has the child cried? I said, Yes. Said she, I hope you have not hurt her? I said, I cannot tell whether I have or not. Master said she had been kept up past her hour. What is the matter? said, she; are you afraid of staying alone? I said, The good parson has been here, and has been as rude as the devil. Mistress sent me down for the supper. I staying some time, mistress came down after me, and asked me, what I was crying for. (I was crying.) I told her the parson had used me very ill. Master called for the supper to be brought up, then no more was said, till I was warming the bed for my mistress; when she said, Has Mr. Green been in the parlour? I said, Yes, madam, and in this room too. Master came into the room, and there was no more said that night.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not tell your master and mistress both?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. I did not want to tell my master, but I told my mistress all the next day. When the prisoner went out, I went to the door, and asked him what he thought of a lawyer's letter? He said, For what? I said, You know for what, and you shall be sure of it. He went out, and said no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you first see your mistress in the morning?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. It might be about half an hour before breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell her of it then?</p>
               <p>E. Jervis. My master came by then breakfast was ready.</p>

            . I am the mistress to the girl. Mr. Green gave me a ticket to go to the play of The Fair Penitent, the 19th of April. My husband saw me there, and then returned, and came again to fetch me home. I stayed till the play was over. When we got home, it was about a quarter of an hour after eleven o'clock. I went through the tavern to order a pint of beer, so my husband was at home first. The first thing he said to me was, My dear, the child looks very pale. I said, It is for want of sleep, being kept up past her hour. The girl was walking about. I asked her, whether the child had been cross; she said it had cried for a quarter of an hour, and she wished the girl had stayed that I sent for. Her master said, Was you afraid to stay alone? the maid said, No. Said I, What has been the matter? she said, The good parson has been at home, and he has been as rude as the d - l. Said I, Have you hurt the child? she said she could not tell. Her master said, Has he been at home and been rude? has he hurt the child? I shall send him a lawyer's letter to make him ashamed of himself. The girl was sent down to get the supper ready. She staying some time, my husband took the child, and I went down after her. I found her crying, but had no suspicion of such a thing then. I was asking her something, and her master having occasion to get up early in the morning, he called; so nothing farther passed. When the girl was warming the bed, I said, Has the parson been in the parlour? she said, Yes, and in this room too. Her master coming in, I think she said no more that night. The next morning I got up between seven and eight o'clock, when the prisoner was going out, but the girl stepped after him (this was something before eight ) and asked her what he should think of a lawyer's letter; he said, For what? She said, You know for what, and you shall be sure to have one. He opened the door, and went away, and slapped the door too very hard. That is all I saw or heard between he and she. Soon after she went to fetch the child. Then my husband came home to breakfast, when she being sent down for something out of the kitchen, she stayed a great while. I said to my husband, I do not know what the parson has done to the girl, she does nothing but crawl about. I followed her down, and found her crying, and she cried best part of that day. After breakfast, she was in the kitchen, I think, washing some things; when I began asking her, thinking to have the whole affair out, what she seemed so uneasy about. I asked what Mr. Green had done to her, and what she meant by a lawyer's letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hear your husband say he would send him a lawyer's letter, and make him ashamed of himself?</p>
               <p>M. Rodenburst. She did. I thought it might be only pulling and hawling her about, as young persons do. She told me he had flung her upon the bed. I said, I hope he has not laid with you! she said, Yes, but he has, and cried. I said, Sure he has not ! she said, Yes, but indeed he has, and she would have justice done her, if it cost her her life. I was so much shocked, I did not say much then. She then told me the manner how it was done. She told me, that about a quarter after nine that evening she had taken the child out of the cradle, at which time Mr. Green knocked at the door, and letting him in, she went to the bottom of the stairs and lighted his candle, which generally stands there for him: he followed her into the parlour, gave her a tap at the bottom of her stays, took the candle out of her hand, and said, Let's see this room. Then he went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100016"/> my room, put the candle out, and took and dragged her into the room. She got out again, but he again took her up, with the child in her arms, carried her in, and threw her upon the bed. I asked her if she made any noise; she said she did, as much as she could, and the child cried and screamed prodigiously all the while, but he had his arm somewhere upon her breast.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a married woman, did she describe the manner of his laying with her?</p>
               <p>M. Rodenburst. She did, and in the same manner as she has now; as men have conversation with women, and said it was against her consent.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the next house to you?</p>
               <p>M. Rodenburst. The next on one side is empty, that on the other side is a china shop, you must go round to the door. There is a high brick wall between, higher than I can reach a great deal. That house and ours are both double brick houses; and ours is lined with wainscot. I was never in the other house. The girl told me the apothecary's boy gave her a phial for Mr. Green, and that there was another girl in the house at the same time, whom I sent for to rock the cradle.</p>
               <p>Q. What excuse did Mr. Green make for himself?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rodenburst. He said he knew nothing of it; he was never in the house from about eight till half an hour after one in the night. This he said on the Monday before Sir

               <p>On her cross examination she said, according to her judgment she believed Mr. Green did lie with the girl, and against the girl's will; that although there are children in the next house, she never hears any noise there from that parlour; that the mother, of the prisoner first applied to her to know the girl's character; that the mother was in a violent passion, and began to quarrel with her, and that she told her if she had sent in a peaceable manner, she would have directed her to her own father and mother, with whom the girl had lived eight or nine years; and that there was an officer that came with the mother, who dragged her about and used her very ill. Being asked what was the girl's character, she said, she had known her about fourteen years, and never knew any harm of her nor the girl's friends, and that she was a sober, honest, modest girl.</p>

            . Yes. The first time was on a Friday in the afternoon, about five o'clock, the next on the Friday evening, when Mr. Green was brought there; and on the Monday when she was bound over to prosecute. She never varied in any circumstance. Sir John particularly requested her to be cautious what she said, and told her what would be the consequence here and hereafter, if she should charge him wrongfully. On the first examination, Sir John did not inquire so particularly into it, but granted a warrant on suspicion, not knowing then how it would turn out, and so give Mr. Green an opportunity to defend himself. He committed him on suspicion; had he committed him absolutely for the fact, he then would have bound the prosecutrix over to prosecute. On the Monday, when Mr. Green was examined again, then the detainer was sent against him for the fact, and she was bound over. There were no material difference all the three times, the circumstances were the same she has said now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Lee. On the Friday night two persons came with him; they said they were ready to swear that he was not out of their company some hours that night, but afterwards they would not swear, for that they said he was some little time missing. The prisoner said he was never in the girl's master's house from eight o'clock; but on the Monday he said he had been in a mistake, for he received a bottle at the tavern door of an apothecary's boy and carried it home, and went back immediately.</p>

We bought a lobster, and some salmon, and supped there together; just as we had done, and the things going to be taken away, Mr. Freemont came in; we had never parted company till he came in; then we had some new cheese and raddishes: after that we had a bottle of wine between us.

            , I examined the prosecutrix. I could not discover any reason to imagine that she had lately had any violence offered to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there might not be marks of violence remaining, if an injury had been committed upon her at the time she mentions?</p>
               <p>Dr. Bromfeild. On a person of her age it is very difficult to say. I asked her how long the gentleman was with her; she said a quarter of an hour. She having spoke of a child being in her arms, said I, You laid the child down, I suppose. No, said she, the child was upon the bed, and I kept it on my arm. I said that is very extraordinary, for you might have laid the child down, and with that hand and the other you might have resisted the force offered you. I also said to her, How came you to keep it on your arm at such a time, and under such circumstances, without laying it on the bed? she said she must take care of the child, or to that effect.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you not asked by the Justice about the symptoms? Did you not say, in five days time that they might go off, and there be no appearance?</p>
               <p>Dr. Bromfeild. I do not recollect that; but I suppose in general they might go off in that time.</p>

The prisoner came into my shop, I think on the 11th of April, about a quarter before ten in the morning; I was in a room behind the shop. I got up to go to serve him, thinking he had been a customer. When I got into the shop, I saw he had a bundle in each hand tied up in paper; they were stockings; I saw my husband tie them up. I said, Sir, don't serve yourself, we will serve you. He immediately went out, and I followed him; he ran, and I called, Stop thief! A man came up and laid hold of him, the prisoner throwed the bundles away. They were taken up, and them and he brought back into our shop. ( Produced in Court, and deposed to.) Eight pair in one bundle and ten in the other.</p>

The other man, who was taller than the prisoner, held a pistol to me, and told me to stand several times. I asked them what they wanted. It shocked me at first; after I recollected myself I stood still. That man said to the prisoner, Search him. The prisoner came up and searched me. I said, I will give you my money, if that is what you want; you have no occasion to rifle me. He put his hand in my right-hand breeches pocket, and took out four shillings in silver, and from my left-hand pocket he took out a guinea; then the other man that had the pistol said, Now feel for his watch. The answer I made to him was, If you must have the watch, I will give it you; here it is. I was going to take it out, but instead of that he took it out himself. Just as they had got it, a man came up, I t hink it was a brewer's servant; then they ran down towards the water-side. I told the brewer's servant I had been robbed. He and I ran after them. They jumped into a boat, and away they went. I saw them as far as Horse-Ferry, Ratcliff-Cross, by the light of the water. I saw the prisoner again at Sir

I think it was the 28th of April the prisoner came to me and said he had got something for my wife; (I knew him before;) he said it was a watch. He shewed it me, and offered it me for two guineas. I was not for buying it. Then he said he would go and pawn it; I then said, I will lend you two guineas upon it, and if you bring me the money again in a month's time, you shall have it. I then was thoughtful he had stole it. He left it with me. Soon after I saw it advertised. I knowing he was bound over to give evidence against people in Surry gaol, and as I knew not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100023"/> where to find him, I got him to come within Bridewell, I turned the key upon him, and desired to know how he came by it.

I called him to drink part of my pint, knowing him. There was a young fellow asked him and me too if we would buy a watch; it looked the colour of gold. I had it not in my hand. I observed the gilt was off at the bottom of the case. (He takes the watch in his hand.) This is the very watch. The man seemed to be quite a stranger to each of us.

I am servant to Mr. Keyte, a pawn broker, the prisoner brought these two spoons (produced in Court and deposed to) to our shop the morning that he fire happened and said he was sent with then by Mr. Brown, and wanted half-a-guinea up them. I had heard there had been a fire at Hungersord, so I asked him if he had been at it. He said, Yes. I said, I hoped he had not taken them; he said, No, he had not. I stopped them, and sent for Mr. Brown. He came, owned the spoons, and took them away. A little time after he came back with the prisoner, and there were four more found upon him.</p>

               <p>I went to see a friend of mine at Cherry Garden Stairs, at the corner of the street where the prosecutor lives. I met a man that I was acquained with; we went into this house to drink. We had two tankards of beer, and a paper of tobacco. I came out after I had paid for one pot. Coming down the street, I met the man again: he asked me whither I was going; Home, I said I was. He said if I would take that thing home for him, he would be obliged to me. I said if it would be no way cumbersome, I would. He took it out of his pocket, and said he was going down to Leverpool, and would carry it to his mother there. I took it, and at the corner of Halfmoon-Street I met the prosecutor; he stopped me and called me thief. Then it came into my head that it was stole, so I ran away, and dropped it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When he came into my house he had a man with him, named Dunn, whom I have known five or six years. The prisoner went away before him.</p>

               <p>Hynam. My parlour, which I always sit in, was fast, which I left about half an hour after ten at night. I am always the last up in the house. I had an apprentice which lay in the shop. When he heard the shutter fall into the room, he got up, thinking the cat had thrown something down. He saw a man with a dark lanthorn, and he was so struck, that he ran and hid himself in his bed again. This he told me was about four o'clock. The shutter was thrown into the middle of the room from off the hinges.</p>

            . On a Saturday, ten minutes before six in the morning, the prisoner and another man came to my house. The man said he had got some plate. I said, It is my sabbath, therefore I cannot touch money to-day. If you leave it with me, I will go and weigh it, and pay you in the morning. After they were gone, I went to Mr. Lazrous and Mr. Keys, and let them know that such things were at my house, and asked what I should do. They said, Leave the plate at home, and when they come, we will come and take them. At night the prisoner came, and I gave notice to them. I put the spoons and salts in my pockets, and went over to an alehouse and shewed them to them. I told the prisoner I would not pay him, without the other, his companion, was there. The other man never spoke a word to me.</p>

            . Mr. Lyon came to me about two months ago, and said he was linked in with a parcel of thieves, who came to his house with stolen goods; and as he was an old man, he was afraid of being transported fourteen years. He advised with us what to do. We advised him to stop thegoods, and come to us, and we would assist him. He came one Saturday, about ten or eleven o'clock, and said, there were a couple of young fellows that had brought some plate, and had left it in his custody. I took him to Mr. Keys. They were to come to fetch the money. He agreed to give us notice. He came at night to us and agreed to give us a call. We went to his house. The door was upon the jar. The silver was all there, the prisoner and Lyon were agreeing, they talked of four shillings and four shillings and six-pence. Keys secured the prisoner, and the plate. He desired me to stay there, and he would go and see for the other thief. The prisoner said, Do not take the plate, for where that goes I must go. Keys came back again, but the other person got off. (The plate produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

The Justice ordered it to be taken off. The prisoner owned he had pawned the other shirt and neckcloth. I went as he directed me, and found them. ( Produced in Court and deposed to.) He owned he had sent my coat to pawn by a man who had sold it out and out.</p>

I sent the boy in the shop for an officer. The prisoner said, You may keep the watch, but I shall go. He went away, and went down Strutton-ground, and I after him. He walked till he came to the bottom, where there was another man waiting for him. They looked back, and saw me, and immediately they ran towards Tothill-fields Bridewell. They found I got ground of them; then they parted. The prisoner asked me what I wanted with him; he then was walking on. I then went immediately to Mr. Wright, at Bridewell, and said, Here is the watch, and there is the man; pointing to the prisoner: Then he, I and another person went and took him upon the Green. He made some resistance. We took him into Bridewell. There we examined him. He was very resolute. We found this pistol loaded in his pocket ( producing a flat pocket pistol): He said, he bought the watch of a journeyman baker.

            . I keep the Red-Lion alehouse, Christopher-yard, Southwark. I have known the prisoner three years. I never saw Lambden but twice in my life. He came to my house the 14th of last September, and asked if I could lodge him. About ten minutes after that, the prisoner came in. They drank together, and then they and two others went all up stairs and lay in one room, where were two beds. I do not know whether they were bedfellows or not; they both lay in one room. I saw Lambden and the prisoner together. Also on the 16th, Lambden had about a pound and a half of beef-steakes dressed in my house. The prisoner was in my house before he came in. Lambden asked him to eat with him; he did, they had a pot of beer and a glass of brandy. This was the very same Lambden that was tried at Chelmsford. I was also there upon the trial.</p>

             to pawn for him. I lit of him promiscuously in Westminster. I innocently went to pawn it, and the pawnbroker stopped it. He asked me how I came by it. I said, I had it of a young man to pawn, who was at the door, at that time. When the man said it was advertised, and shewed me the bill, I went out of the shop to the young man, to clear myself, but he was gone up the street. I followed him, and the pawnbroker came after me. I told Lambden I was stopped with the watch, and begged of him to come back. He ran away directly. I never ran, I walked away. I lived with Mr. Hobbs's father at Stanmore.

I told him I would go round Leadenhall-street, and perhaps we might meet him coming up St. Mary Axe. We went together. I saw a man as he had described; he said, That is the man I seized him, and charged him with taking my handkerchief; and drawed him a little forward. While I was speaking to him, somebody said, He has dropped your handkerchief. I took it up, and put it in my pocket. (Produced and deposed to.) It was dropped close by the place where I first seized him. I asked him if he would go with me before my Lord Mayor, and told him I would give him a coach, and go with him. He said he would not go in a coach, but desired I would deliver him up to the mob. He went on his knees, and said he was innocent. Then I sent for a constable; when the constable came, he desired to have a coach. Then I said he should walk on foot. I took him to the Mansion-house, but my Lord Mayor not being there, I took him to Guildhall; when Mr. Alderman Crosby examined him, and committed him.</p>

As I was going to take him, my coat buttons hit against a chair; he heard it, and threw the raisins on the table again. Then he stopped behind the crane room, and staid there some time. I having no body to assist me, I was afraid to take him by the water-side.

               <p>Long. When I came back from carrying the prisoner to the Compter, the frail of raisins was gone from the table, and it was found in a boat. A man, called Battersea Jack, was coming with his sculls, and I said, Is this your boat? He said it was. I said, How came that frail of raisins in your boat? He said he did not know. I went to call the constable and watchmen, then Battersea Jack had put the frail out of his boat into a luggage boat, and was going away. I said, You had better come back, or I shall send for you. He did. I took him also before a magistrate, but not bringing the person that saw him put the frail in his boat, he was discharged.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Marshall. I am wife to the prosecutor. The woman at the bar came into our house on the 8th of April, the moment she came in she took a pewter pint pot from off a bench, and put it under her apron; she turned about, and saw me, then she called for a half-penny worth of gin. I asked her what she had under her apron. I turned it back, and there was one of my pint pots in her hand; she let it fall, and ran out. I caught hold of her cloak, it gave way; she fell down in the passage, and another pint pot fell from her. She got up and away she ran, and I after her, and called Stop thief! she was stopped, and by shaking her about, the rest of the pots mentioned in the indictment were found upon her. Two pint pots, a quart pot, and a half-pint pot, besides my own; one of them had a string tied to the handle. By the names on the pots we let the owners know. (The pots produced in Court.)</p>

Mr. Thorpe and I were discharging the coach, but seeing the prisoner take Mr. Thorpe's handkerchief out of his pocket, I spoke to Mr. Thorpe and ran after the prisoner, and said, You rascal, you have taken this gentleman's handkerchief out of his pocket. He took and flung it over my head, and it rested on the pole of the coach. There was another person with him, but he ran away.</p>

             came and clapped me on my shoulder, and said, Countryman, how do you do? I turned round and said, I do not know you. She said, Did not you come out of Staffordshire? I said I did. She said she had some friends in Staffordshire she wanted to have some talk about, and wanted me to go in and drink a pot of beer. I said, Come with me, we can go into any of these houses here. No, said she, there is no good beer here; come along with me, and we will have a pot of as good as any in town. I went along with her. She took me to a house where there was a little woman in it. (I never was there before.) It was <placeName id="t17690510-32-crimeloc211">near Black-Boy-Alley</placeName>

Smith came in and said, How do you do, countryman, how does all friends in Staffordshire? One of the women said they will not trust for the beer, without they have the money. I took out my purse, and gave Smith a shilling, and desired her to bring me change. As soon as she went out of the door and pulled it too, the woman of the house said she would go for the beer. She went out, and pulled the door after her; then Mary Harris up with her hand, and struck me cross my breast back-handed, as I was sitting on the bed; then both the prisoners seized me. I hallooed out murder as fast as I could. Harris seized my right arm, and held it down upon the bed. Smith catched hold of my mouth, and said, Blast your eyes, what are you hallooing out! I put my hand up to break her hand from my mouth. She catched fast hold of my arm, and put the other hand down to my left hand breeches pocket and took my purse out with ten guineas in it and a ten pound bank bill. It was a yellow canvas purse. Then Harris ran to the door, and catched the door in her hand. I jumped up after her, and as she was going out I caught hold of her. She struck at me. I put my head on one side, and the blow came upon my breast. She pulled the door too, and caught my hand between the door and the door frame. The other prisoner was got into the street, but I held Harris, and would not let her go. I held her there and hallooed, Is there no good Christian who will send for a constable? There was a woman in the alley said, Have you got any money? I said I have got no money, but I will pledge my watch for money, if any body will but assist me. Harris said, D - n you, you dog, if we knew you had got a watch, we would have had that and all. The little woman that pretended to go for the beer, she came in the mean time, and threw the beer in my face two or three times. Then she went into the house, got a candlestick, and came out and struck me with it several times in the alley. I held Harris all the time. She said she would go into her own house. I let her go in, and put the door too. They had got a black woman in the house, they brought her to me, and said, There, take the D - l. Harris wanted to get away. I caught hold of her again, and held her till the constable came. They struck him with a candlestick several times. A woman in the alley ran for a constable. I do not know but, if it had not been for that woman, they would have murdered me. Harris and the woman that fetched the beer were taken at last, and put in the Compter. The next morning, being Friday, the other prisoner Smith was taken in a house hard by where they robbed me. I knew her again by a cut a-cross her left arm, and a mole under her left eye. I took notice of her when she called me countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your purse or money again?</p>
               <p>Shatten. No, I never did, nor my 10 l. bank note neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Shatten. I was as sober as I am now. I was going to the White horse in the Fleet-market to my quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by that money?</p>
               <p>Shatten. I had sold a horse for thirteen pounds, on the Tuesday before, and I received a ten pound bank note, and three guineas, and the other money I had in my pocket made the money up ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any familiarities between you and either of the prisoners?</p>

He said he had a watch: then one of the women said, If we had known you had a watch, you should not have had it so long. That was either Harris, or the other woman that is not here. They strove hard to get away. The man said he would lose his life before they should. They desired him to go into a room. They then brought a black-a-moor to him. There was a young man came to assist, but they broke his mouth, and made it all on a gore blood, and used the prosecutor basely. The young man went out and fetched a constable, and Harris and the other woman were secured. The next morning Smith came into the neighbourhood. They were looking for her.

               <p>Harris's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had been out on the top of the alley for some tea and sugar, and coming down the alley, this Mrs. Wilder's daughter was quarrelling. I laid hold of her, and kept her from fighting. I said to Mrs. Wilder, Are you going home? She said, No. When I came to the door, there they cried fire and murder ! I said to a man, What is the matter? He said, The man says he has been robbed. Said I, By who? He said he did not know, but it was in my room. I went in, and when I came out again, the man laid hold of me and said I was the person that held the door while the other robbed him. He held me sometime. There came another woman, then he let me go, and said she was the person. She got out of his hands, and he laid hold of me again. I gave him a push with my right hand on his shoulder, and desired him to let me go in at the door, and not to stop me in the street. He let me go in. I desired the boy that was there to go about his business, and another woman that was by struck the boy. As to any money, I never saw no money at all.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw the man till the time he took me. That night I went up to Lambeth, and they came after me the next day. When I came home, they said I had been charged with robbing a man. I went there and said, What do you want with me? and they took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. This prisoner speaks of another woman that you challenged.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was another woman that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100031"/> went for the liquor, she that struck at me with the candlestick. There were four women taken up, the woman that went for the liquor, a black woman, and the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Williamson. I believe the prosecutor would have been murdered, had it not been for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was this done in?</p>

I missed them about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening; some out of a closet, and some in a basket on the table. The door had been forced open. I got the crier to cry the things. Afterwards William Salmon came and informed me he suspected the persons that did it, and one the 16th, he sent for me, and informed me the three prisoners had been at his house, and were gone to Tothill-fields Bridewell. He and I went and met them coming out. We stopped them. We found a neckcloth on Thomas Jones's neck, which my wife has swore to. They made great resistance.

She took two pair more; then I asked her if she would buy a pair, and was coming round the counter to stop her before she got out of the shop. She got out, but I stopt her, and brought her back, and sent to a neighbour, who searched her, and found three pair of our buckles upon her. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

I saw in the passage the entrance from the street door. I saw the bags lying in which the plate used to be kept, and likewise a great coat of mine lying by. There were two candles there, but they had gone out. The wainscot was burnt in two places. They had been set against the wainscot. I then went into the fore-parlour, and observed one of the window curtains was partly cut down; then I went into the back-parlour, and observed some things had been taken from thence; and from a room behind that they had taken some things. All the doors were open. Then I went down into the kitchen, and found the dresser had been on fire, and a place on it burned bigger than my hat. There were the remains of a mahogany bottle-stand, some writing-paper, and a mahogany tray, partly burned. I found my kitchen, window broke; they had wrenched out the staple of the iron bar, that keys within-side, and forced the window open, and so got in at the casement. In a closet by the kitchen fire there was a wooden box, in which were some wax and paper; they had attempted to set that on fire. I found part of a candle in it. My servant told me there was some linen lost. I found there was some lay tumbled about the room. I went to my attorney, and as soon as I could to Sir

I was told the prisoner had been in custody that night, but had made his escape out of the back door. Then I went to Sir John again, and he ordered bills to be distributed about to Hackney-coachmen, with a guinea reward. On the evening following, the constable came and told me he had got the prisoner again. I went and saw him in the watch-house on Tower-hill. We took him to Sir John, who committed him to New Prison. The next day I went with a friend that understood French to him in prison. I there saw the prisoner had on a ruffled shirt and stock of mine. They were striped muslin ruffles, with the them worked with a little ornament; he had likewise a pair of my silk stockings on, and a pair of my buckles. We had conversation with him for near two hours. I examined the marks on my stock and shirt. He told my friend in French, that they were my property, as my friend told me, for I cannot speak the language. He told us his lodgings were at the Cock and Bottle, at the corner of Green Lettice-lane, Cannon-street; and that in a locker in the window, which was locked, I should find my linen, as also that I should find a box of tools to deface the marks in plate. I took a search-warrant from my Lord Mayor, and went. I found his chamber door locked. I got a smith to break it open. I then had the locker broke open; there I found my linen. I had the closet door broke open; there I found the largest claw-hammer that ever I saw; and a very large knife, such as butchers kill hogs with, and a box of tools. I found a razor case, with a razor, hone and strap, my property. We examined his clothes, and in (I think it was) the side pocket of his breeches there was a very long and strong picklock; and in another pocket (I think the waistcoat pocket) I found the key of my compting-house. I found also a pair of new leather breeches which I had missed; and a pair of steel buckles that belonged to the straps of my boots. These things are all in the custody of the constable here. He acknowledged his having erased all my arms out upon the plate.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 28th of April, when I came down stairs in the morning, about seven o'clock, I found the house had been broke open. I was called down by my fellow-servant, who had opened one of the windows, and found the house all of a smoak. I went down into the kitchen, and found the dresser all on fire, which I put out as soon as I could. Then I examined the kitchen-window, which I found had been broke open, by wrenching the bar and staple. The casement was open. My fellow servant and I observed there had been the mark of a foot upon a very small piece of a brick, which had pressed it to a powder. We found there had been fire set to a box in a closet in the kitchen, which had burned a great hole<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100036"/> in it. Going up stairs, I found the bags that the plate usually were put in, with master's great coat lying by, and two wax candles, which had been lighted, lying by the wainscot in the parlour. They had cut down part of one of the curtains. We examined all the knife cases for spoons, which I knew I had put down the night before; they were then left all up; they had opened and examined every thing in the room. I missed all the plate but the coffee-pot. Then I went and acquainted my master with it. I had locked the street door and bolted it, and put the chain up; and a door that goes out into the area over night, and I found both had been opened, when I came down. The clock struck twelve just as I got into my room, when my master sent for me to see the plate. I chose out his plate from other plate, and swore to it. Spoons, waiters, a large rummer, snuffer pan, mugs and several things. I am very well acquainted with the plate, having had the care of it a great while. I saw a pair of yellow metal buckles in the prisoner's shoes; I know them to be my master's property, having cleaned them several times. The razor-case I know to be my master's property; but there were not all that was lost.</p>

            . On Friday was sev'nnight, about eight in the evening, I was in my lodgings. There came Solomon, a Jew, up stairs, and asked Mr. Pelthorp, who was with me, where he could find a constable. He recommended him to one; in about a quarter of an hour, he come down with the prisoner and about four Jews. Solomon, said I, What are you going to do? This man seems to be well dressed, he cautious. Solomon lodges at Mr. Pelthorp's house. I said, I understand a little French, give me leave to ask him a few questions. I asked him what country he was of. He said from Paris. I asked what business. He said no business. He was, as I understood, an attorney. I asked him how long he had been in England. He said about twelve days. I asked him where he lodged. He told me in a street behind the Royal Exchange; but did not know the name of it. I told him, he being an utter stranger in this country, I would show him as much friendship as possible; and if he could bring two or three gentlemen to be bound for his appearance, I dare say he might be let go. There was a bag of plate which he had brought. I opened it, and saw that the arms were all erased out; which gave me a suspicion that it was stolen. I asked him whether it was his private property, or whether he had lent any money upon it, or whether he dealt in plate and had bought it. He told me, he had lent a Frenchman that came from Paris, that he knew, an hundred pounds upon it. I asked him whether that was at his lodgings, or at the Frenchman's lodgings. He told me, he had lent it him in St. James's Park. I sent for a gentleman that lives next door but one; he saw the plate. I tied it up, and delivered it into his care. The prisoner said, Solomon had offered him sixty-two guineas for it. The constable said, he must take Solomon in charge as well as the prisoner. Solomon asked the landlord if he would be bail for him. In a little time he said he would. The prisoner asked for a little water to drink. He went backwards, and out at the back-door, and ran away. He was retaken on the Wednesday in the afternoon by the constable. Then I searched him, and took a flat candlestick and snuffers out of his pocket, in the watch-house by the Victualling-office. I believe they are white metal, what they call tooth and egg. I took a gold watch from him, which I delivered to my Lord Mayor, and two pair of silver buckles, one knee-buckle and four keys. None of them belonged to the prosecutor but the candlestick.</p>

             brought the prisoner to my house last Monday was a week. The prisoner asked me if I would buy some plate. I asked him if he had it in his pocket. He said, No; but he would go and fetch it. He desired me to give him a direction where to meet with me. I gave him a direction to the Holy Lamb, Cruchet-Fryers. He came there in an hour's time, in a coach. I went out to him. He said, he would not come into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100037"/> public-house, but he would go along with me to my house. When he came to my lodging, he had a bag of silver, which he put upon the table. I asked him the price, he said he could not tell till he had weighed it. He would have me go and fetch scales to weigh it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what language did you speak to him?</p>
               <p>Solomon. In the French language, I was born in France. I borrowed a pair of scales and weights. The plate weighed sixteen pounds weight, sixteen ounces to the pound. I asked him the price. He asked four guineas a pound for it. I offered him three guineas and a half a pound. I agreed for sixty-two guineas for the whole. I said, I would go and fetch the money. I saw the names were all filed out. I told the other Jews with me, in our language, to take care of him while I fetched a constable. The prisoner suspected something, he desired me to stay, and said, if I had not the money in my pocket, he would take my note for the whole tote. I said, I have no occasion to be trusted, I would go and fetch the money. I went and got a constable. We went and took him in my room, and brought him into the shop where I work. We went for paper to seal the plate up, and in the mean time the prisoner made his escape out at the back-door. The constable took the plate, and carried it to the parish-officer; there it lay all night.</p>

            . I am constable. I went to search for the things along with Mr. Kellet at the prisoner's lodgings, at the Cock and Bottle, Green Latice-Lane. It is a public house. We enquired for the room he lodged in. The woman of the house went up and showed us. The door was locked. We went for a blacksmith, who opened it with a chissel. Then he opened the window-seat. The first thing we pulled out was this handkerchief, (producing a silk handkerchief ) which Mr. Kellet owned, and eleven shirts with his name on every one of them, and about twenty-six or twenty-seven stocks, a pair of buckskin breeches, a pair of under-stockings, and a pick-lock. We found a key in his coat pocket, and another in his waistcoat. I went with Mr. Kellet, and found one of them would open his compting-house. I found a large new claw hammer, a handle of a chissel, a chissel, a razor-case, hone, and strap; and the woman of the house delivered a parcel of tools to me a day or two after. (All produced in Court; some of the tools proper to take out engraving, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the shirts, stocks, razor-case, and breeches; the latter being remarkable, having three buttons on the waisthand: the handkerchief I believe to be mine, but will not swear positively to it. We have two keys to my compting-house, that used to hang upon a nail; one of them has been missing from that night. This key here produced I believe to be the same; it fits the lock, and the wards are the same as the other.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Cock and Bottle, the corner of Green Lattice-Lane. The prisoner lodged there. I believe he had lodged there about twelve days. The gentleman came to search for things in the prisoner's room. He shewed me a shirt that he had on, that corresponded with the marks of the shirts he found in the prisoner's room. Nobody but the prisoner kept the key of his room. I was in the room after they had searched, and in a box in the closet I found these tools, ( here produced) which I delivered to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner was on the 26th of April, at night.</p>
               <p>S. Grose. That I cannot tell. Sometimes he came home at nine or ten at night, and sometimes he used to be out all night, and come home in the morning about six o'clock. He lay out several nights. He always locked the door when he went out. I had been but a fortnight in the house. He was recommended to us by the person that went out when we came in.</p>

What! said I, could you not buy it cheap enough? I did not like to trust myself among a parcel of Jews alone. I said, Lay down a shilling for a man, and I will get somebody to go along with you. We went to his apartment. The plate was put in a sack. The Jew gave charge of the prisoner. The prisoner wanted a little water. He went out backwards. I had never been in the house before. He got out out at a back door, and got off. Two days after, in the evening, I was going upon other business, and met him in the Strand, and took him again. I put him in the watch-house.

             takes up several of them, and deposed to them as the prosecutor's property by marks and bruises that he had before observed upon them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot make my defence of my own head directly, but beg leave to read the extract I have prepared. (He reads, which the interpreter spoke in English after him.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Being ignorant of the custom and manner of trade, and the laws of this country, I am extremely at a loss to know how to make my defence, yet I will begin, by your leave; though indeed I am very ill, and that makes it more out of my power to make it in the manner it should be if I was in another situation. The effects found in my possession I had of two gentlemen, the one named Boiae, and the other St. Mate. I fought for some gentlemen of my own country, that could speak French; and I was told. if I took a walk in St. James's Park, I should find enough. I went there, and met with these two gentlemen, who had been a long time in England, and who have made me the tool of their villainy. I arrived in England on the 12th of April last, at ten in the evening; and these two gentlemen having met me in the Park, they asked me if I was a Frenchman, and if I would give them leave to take a walk with me; which I accepted with pleasure. They looked genteel, and I opened myself very freely to them in our conversation. We knew one another, having seen each other at Paris, which endeared them more to me, and I made some indiscreet confessions, such as my having French money about me, which I had not converted, or changed. I asked them where I could get guineas for Louis d'ors; they promised to serve me on that occasion, telling me I should not be uneasy about it; which I accepted with pleasure. They seeing I could not speak the language here, and that I was unacquainted with the custom of the country, it appears they resolved from that moment to make me the victim of their misconduct. They engaged me to dine with them, but I cannot tell where, yet I can describe whereabouts, because I have very often lost myself in London, from not knowing the streets. As I was at dinner they offered me to accept two bills for my French money, amounting together to the sum of two thousand six hundred livers, provided I would give them the value of them in cash; they being upon their departure for France, and were only detained in London by the trouble they were in to finish their business immediately to pay their debts. These gentlemen said it would thereby do me a great service, and do themselves a great benefit, because I should change my money without losing any thing, if I would comply with their request. I refused that offer, because the bills were wrote in English, and I knew nothing of it; and farther, as they were going to depart soon, I did not know where I could get my record against the indorsers, in case they should not be paid when due; upon this they did not insist upon it any more. When dinner was ended, they offered me to go to the play, which I refused, saying, if I went there, I should be late in the night, and was not well, and that I rather chose to go home than lose myself in the streets of London. I told them where I lodged, and gave them directions on a bit of paper, which I had wrote before, and kept in order to find my way where-ever I should go. They brought me back part of the way. I parted with them desi ring them not to come farther, but to come and breakfast with me as often as they pleased. The Sunday following I went out, and took a round in the Park. I met one of them about Charing-Cross: he asked me where I was going; I said to the Park. He told me a place near the King's palace, where he would meet me about two in the afternoon, with the other gentleman. I said I should be glad to see him. He said they had something interesting to tell me. We parted, and I waited for them till about four in the afternoon in the Park, but did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100039"/> not see them. I was some time after without hearing of them, but about ten or twelve days after I met one of them upon the Change. I told him I met him apropos, and was extremely glad to see him. He desired me to go to his house, having something to tell me. He brought me into a small public garden, near the Royal Exchange; I cannot recollect the name; he there renewed this to me, and told me his distress, which moved me extremely, as being of the same country. He said, Since you will not accept our bills, and will not trust us, we will make you another proposal, which I am certain you will agree to. They asked me the sum of two thousand two hundred livres, which makes ninety-two Louis d'ors, and said they would give me effects to the value at least of that sum, and which I might dispose of the day after to-morrow, as any thing belonging to me, in case they did not remit me the money which they had promised they would do: but they said they must have money, else they were in the most imminent danger of being arrested, and brought to prison for debt. They insisted upon it; that their departure for France was extremely necessary to be soon; and that a delay was very disadvantageous to them. I asked them what goods they were; they told me it was plate, and golden buckles; that they were not goods for gentlemen, as they were not real gold; and that they had got linen and other effects. I promised them to do all that was in my power to oblige them, and if the effects were worth that sum, I would take them. Having passed my word, I gave them directly on account twelve Louis d'ors, which they told me they wanted immediately: the same evening they came to my lodging, and agreed to bring me all these effects at seven in the morning, which they did by the time appointed. I was at the door in my bed-gown: they came loaded with the plate and linen, and delivered them to me. I desired them to come up into my room, which they refused: they asked me for eighty Louis d'ors, which was the remainder of the sum we agreed for. One of them was going to settle the affair, the other went to fetch scales to weigh the plate, and said he would come back. I took the sack and bag into my room under my bed-gown at two turns, and delivered them the money. I waited a long time for the scales, but heard no more of him. At twelve o'clock I began to be very uneasy. Then I opened the sack, and found the plate in it; the same that has been found in my possession. I was not less surprised to find in the other bag linen, wearing apparel, and things which I did not expect. I discovered a key, which I took and put into my pocket, being resolved to remit that to them, the next time I should see them, because I thought it belonged to them. I found in the bottom of the bag, files, a hammer, and other tools that have been produced here. The disappearing of these people made me reflect bitterly upon my imprudence. I saw I had been deceived. From that very moment I sought an occasion of getting rid of these effects, which I would not keep in my possession, suspecting them, particularly as the plate was defaced, I did not know whether it was of the English stamp or French, or what sort of plate it was. I took two spoons, in order to shew to a silvermith, which I did, and asked him if they were of the English stamp or not, without telling him I had a great quantity. I told him it was only for his advice, and that I suspected something, as the arms were defaced. In the conversation, I asked the man, who could talk French, in what manner I could get rid of such plate; he replied, The only way was to sell it among the Jews; they were the only men that could make such bargains. Having lost ninety-two guineas, made me think the best way to recover myself as much as possible was to sell it. The next day I saw a man that looked like a Jew; he asked me if I wanted to buy some stockings. I refused. On the Monday following I met the man again upon the Change, when we agreed that he should sell this plate. He shewed me a public house where I might find him. I took coach and brought it to him; he offered me a bill of three hundred and odd livers upon Paris for that plate. After he had weighted the plate, he told me he was going to fetch the money. He was a long time before he came back, and left me with other Jews. When he returned, I was much surprised when he told me he wanted to arrest me. All this was to frighten me, to get possession of the plate. I made some difficulty to go with them, for if there was any suspicion about it, I thought I should be arrested. They told me there was no other way of getting rid of the affair, than to accept a bill of three hundred livers upon Paris, and they would take the plate upon themselves. Then they proposed to pay me forty guineas at eight days, after they had sold the plate, which they could not do in this city. All these proposals seemed unreasonable, and I rejected them. Then they wanted a constable. I did not know the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100040"/> meaning of it; I was frighted; I looked upon the whole as an artifice of deception. There came a gentleman, who has appeared here with a stick, who told me I must go with him, which I accepted. They had a great many people in the house; they all spoke English, so I could not understand what they said. I began to be frighted; I went out at the back-door, which stood half-open. I took care to run; for I thought I had nothing to fear, but to lose the silver and the money I had given upon it, which these people were willing to appropriate to themselves. I did not look upon myself as a criminal. I remained in London in the greatest security, and I was arrested in one of the popular streets in London, the Strand, and brought into a place where I was exposed to the insults of the most depraved mob. All my defence I had to write yesterday night, because I have been teased and vexed every day by people that came by way of giving me advice. I will not take upon me to say my prosecutor was to blame, but I believe these things were contrived among the Jews. At last I have discovered that these people were all Jews. They would come and say they wished me joy, that I should not be judged this sessions, I should be next sessions, in order to bring me to trial without defence or assistance.</p>

            . I live in Guernsey. I have seen the prisoner several times walking about in the town there. On the 9th of April, I failed for England; he happened to be on board with me. He being a stranger, we landed at Southampton. He asked me how I should come to London; I told him in the coach. He took a place in the same. When we were on Hounslow-heath, a lady said there were not so many robberies there as usual; but a person said there had been many robberies committed there. The prisoner said, he had but a few guineas in his pocket, but should be very sorry to lose his gold watch and ring. I understood he had some value in his portmanteau. When we came to town, he said he had been at Paris with Mr. Lynch's son, and he was come here for a month or six weeks to see London. I had two of my brothers came to meet me at the inn, where we arrived on the 12th of April. We took him in the coach with us, and my brother conducted him to the Cock and Bottle, where he lodged. I knew nothing of him before, only by seeing him in the street in Guernsey.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. On Wednesday, the 12th of April, I went to the coach to meet my sister, my father having received a letter from her, dated from Southampton. The prisoner was at the inn; he got into the coach and came with us. After I left my sister, I went with him to the Cock and Bottle. I told the people I knew no more of him than that he came in the coach with my sister; that he looked like a gentleman; and my sister told me he behaved as such in the journey. Mrs. Wilson lived then in the house. Mr. Grose was not come into the house then.</p>

            . Croix. I am a native of Guernsey. The prisoner and I landed out of two different boats at Southampton. I never saw him before; this was on the 10th of April. I came up in the same coach with the young lady and he. I happened to be at the Captain's when he came to pay for his passage; he said, he had no guineas, nor no silver; therefore he offered Louis d'ors. When we came to Hounslow-heath, there was some talk about highwaymen; he seemed to be startled, and said, Will they meddle with my portmanteau? He said he did not matter, if they meddled with nothing but what he had upon him. I never saw him from that time till this morning.</p>

            . My father is a merchant. I am with him. I knew the prisoner about three years ago in Paris, and was particularly acquainted with him there about a year. His family are in a very good way; his father is a man of fortune. He was brought up a gentleman, and always appeared so. I left that academy between two and three years, and have not seen him since, till in London. I take him to be between twenty and twenty-one years of age. He has been to see me in town, and dined with me six or seven times.</p>
