                  </hi>. I am one of the Registrars of the Shore-ditch County Court—on 11th March a plaint was heard of Levestque against Hudson—I produce this judgment—under that a judgment sum-mons was issued, but it was not served personally—I know the defendant as very often being a witness in the Court during the five months I have been there—he is not an official process-server, but issues process for parties. (<hi rend="italic">The summons was read, and was for 1 l . 0 s. 9 d ., the balance of a debt, and the prisoner alleged that he had personally served it.</hi>) Personal service is required—I administered the oath to the defendant, who said that he had made personal service—it was not signed in my presence that was done before it was brought—the defendant did not appear upon that, and an order of commitment was made, dated 1st June—on 7th June a notice was served by the defendant's father for the purpose of setting aside the judgment—that name on before the Judge on 10th June—I then heard the defendant's father say that his son had not had the summons—the Judge then put a question to La Dell, and he then admitted that he had not served it personally—the Judge then rescinded the order of commitment, and sent the matter on to the Public Prosecutor.</p>

Hudson</hi>, 73, <hi rend="italic">Bishop's Road, Victoria Park, E." containing a summons.</hi>) My son was not at home at the time, he was travelling in the country—finding it was a registered letter I opened it, I open all his letters, and found it contained this judgment summons, but I never gave it to my son, and he never saw it—my son being from London, I went on 7th June to the County Court for the purpose of setting aside the proceedings, and on 10th June I attended before the learned Judge, Mr. Prentice—the prisoner I think was there—I explained to the Judge that my son had never received the summons, and produced the letter to show it had been sent by post; then the prisoner admitted he had not personally served it—up to that time my son had not seen it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My son is not here to-day—I have not seen him for the last six months; probably he has not paid this money—when the prisoner first came to me I told him my son was not at home—he was in London on the first day I think—he called again a day or two afterwards and asked again if my son was at home—I think he was in London at the time—I did not know what he came for, or whether he came for a debt of my son's—I had seen him besides the two occasions, and before the registered letter arrived, and he told me that there was a judgment summons against my son, and if he didn't pay he would have to go to Holloway—I also met him in the Hackney Road before the letter arrived—I knew that he was acting for the plaintiff against my son, but knew nothing about him being in danger of being committed to Holloway—the prisoner said "You had better give your son the summons," and I said "You had better give it to him yourself."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Spencer, Turner, and Co., drapers, of Lisson Grove—we are the sole prosecutors in this case, and have undertaken it upon our own responsibility—on 12th August Nutt called on me, and filled up this form. (<hi rend="italic">In which he called himself Walter Nutt, of 15, Great Chesterfield Street, aged</hi> 26, <hi rend="italic">single, and stated that he was last employed at Halls, of</hi> 22, <hi rend="italic">Brixton Road, from 27th February to 5th July; that he left there by his resignation, as he wished to relinquish travelling, and that his previous employers were Allison and Co. of Regent Street.</hi>) As the result of that form being filled up by him I sent the paper to Hall, saying on the fly-leaf that we had been referred to him for a character, asking him to say if it was correct, and to sign it and return it—Hall had nothing to do but to confirm Nutt's statement, and send it back if it was correct—he sent this letter, dated August 12, 1886, 22, Brixton Road. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had received from Allison a good character of Nutt, and that during the time he was with him he found him as described, and was satisfied with him; that he left him of his own accord saying he wished to give up travelling.</hi>) That was accompanied with the written document which Nutt had filled up, stating he had been with Hall from 27th February to July, 1886—I believed that was the last situation he had filled—I heard nothing about Spence and Co., or Bushell, or Gray and Baker—I knew nothing about his being tried and acquitted—he entered our service, and was with us from August 12 till the summons was taken out on 18th September, when he was discharged—I made a complaint to him about 14 days or three weeks after he entered our employ—I made further inquiries, and in the result I took out a summons and Nutt went before a Magistrate—I did not know he was married, nor that he had been William Peek Nutt a month before.</p>

               <p>asked him where they were to be seen, whether they were at a public wharf—he said "No, they were not"—I said that I could not deal with him unless they were put at a public wharf and open to public inspection, because I couldn't buy them by seeing one skin, I wanted to see the bulk—he then asked me if I knew of a public wharf to take them to—I took him to the office of Messrs. Wright Brothers, the owners of the New Sun Sufferance Wharf, and introduced him to Mr. Wright, and I heard an arrangement made between them that these bales of goats' skins were to be sent to their wharf—he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a skin for them—I left him with Mr. Wright, and he shortly afterwards came to my office and asked me for a form of order, and wrote this out.

I carry on business at 10, Chequer Street, St. Luke's, as a colonial merchant—I formerly carried on business at 5, Leadenhall Street, in the boot and shoe trade—on 31st August Barker, who I had never seen before, was introduced to me by Mr. Drummond, and spoke to me about the sale of some goat skins; he said he had 1,700, and there was a sample of them in George Yard; that is in Fenchurch Street, and belongs to Mr. Drummond—I went and looked at it, and took possession of it, and afterwards arranged to sell these goats' skins for Barker—ultimately I went to Messrs. Pearce and Co., of Bloomsbury Street, and the skins were sold to them, subject to their approving of them—afterwards Barker said there were not 1,700, only 710, and I wrote this letter to Messrs. Pearce correcting it—I was to have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a skin for them—Barker after-wards brought the dock warrant so that I might deliver; I only acted for him—immediately on my receiving the warrant I took it to Messrs.

I have got a wife just confined at home"—on the way to the station he said, "A man over at the public-house gave them to me to sell for him"—they were both charged at the station—Davis said that Rockman had given him the coats to sell for him—Rockman said that he made the coats and bought the pieces in the Lane, and gave them to Davis to sell.</p>

I live at 6, Alfred Place, Bedford Square—on 30th August last, between half-past 8 and 9 o'clock, I was passing through Russell Street, Covent Garden, and was tripped up from behind by somebody, and in falling my head was struck in some way, and I was rendered partially insensible for two or three seconds—I then found myself lying on the pavement and a man's hands about my waistcoat—I got on my feet and held McLoughlin by the collar, and called for assistance—Joyce then came up and helped McLoughlin to extricate himself from my grasp—I afterwards I found I had lost from five to seven shillings out of my waistcoat pocket—I did not see Mr. Glennie till I was at the station—the prisoners succeeded in getting away from me, and I identified them at the police-court a few minutes afterwards—I do not know the Grapes public-house; I was not there that evening—I had not seen the prisoners before I was assaulted.</p>

I am a confectioner, of 290, Strand—on 30th August, about 9 o'clock, I was in Russell Street and heard a cry of "Help! help!"—I went to the spot, and saw the prosecutor holding McLoughlin by the throat, and crying "Help! help!"—I asked him what was the matter, but he was in such an excited state he could not. answer me, and I found afterwards when he was at the station that he</p>

E."—it was drawn on the District Bank of London—I enclosed it in a letter addressed to Toler and received this letter from him enclosing another cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the same bank, dated January 1st. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he enclosed another cheque for</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in lieu of the one which has not been paid, and that he had overdrawn his account but would take care this one was paid.</hi>) It was passed through our bankers and returned dishonoured—I communicated that fact to Toler and wrote to him repeatedly in respect of it; these five letters are some of the com<lb/>munications—a third cheque came, dated 26th January, for our presenta<lb/>tion, upon the same bank—I presented it personally and it was returned to me dishonoured; one of the letters requested me to present it person<lb/>ally—I have not received a penny on the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; I believed it to be a good one when I received it.</p>

I keep the Foresters' Arms, 220, Vauxhall Bridge Road—on 11th February Toler and Bryant came to me—I had known Bryant as a customer and I may have seen Toler before; I am not certain—after some conversation on 11th February Bryant produced a cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., drawn in favour of E.

                  </hi> I am of Dutch birth—in September I was in this country anxious to get employment—I understand French and English—I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph:</hi> "Young person wanted understanding French and English and knowing London. Apply between 4 and 5. A. R., 9, Arundel Street, W."—I went on the same day and found it to be the International Hotel—I waited until other applicants had been seen, and then I was introduced to the two prisoners—Zand asked me if I knew English; the con<lb/>versation was in French, and occasionally they spoke in Russian between themselves—Zand told me he had come to London with his friend to start a business, but he did not know English, and it was very difficult, and he wanted someone to act as interpreter and do English correspondence—I was engaged at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a month—Zand raised an objection to that amount at first, and spoke to Kalnoky, and then he turned to me again and said "You can have it"—it was arranged I should begin work next day—when I got there they told me it would be necessary for the business to have an office in the City, and I was to go and look for offices and interpret for them, but we only saw one—I then saw an advertisement of a furnished house, and went to Brixton and saw Mrs. Brittan, at 3, Tralawney Road, and it was arranged to take that house for four weeks at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Kalnoky gave the money to Zand, but I don't remember whether Zand gave it to Mrs. Brittan—they then proposed that I should take up my abode with them, but I objected unless there was some female servant, and I asked Mrs. Brittan to obtain the services of a respectable old servant, and took up my quarters there on the Monday—on Tuesday, 20th September, we went to Messrs. Waterlow's, and found a gentleman in the shop who could speak French, and Zand spoke to him; Kalnoky remained in the cab—we then went to Copperfield and Masson's, printers, of Newgate Street—Zand went in with me and asked Mr. Burgess if he could print circulars in French; he objected, but finally he said he would provided the proofs were corrected—Zand went outside and came back with Kalnoky, and then 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit was paid—they told me they had to write the manuscript—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Zand's writing—they took the manuscript to the printers themselves, and the printers sent the proofs, and the prisoners asked me to write a letter to the printers, which I did—on 22nd or 23rd, while I was out, Zand went away to Paris; he said he was going to fetch his wife and children—on Thursday, 7th October, I called at the printers and saw the circulars, and called again with Kalnoky on the 23rd to fetch them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—we took them to the General Post Office <hi rend="italic">Poste Restante</hi>—he had about fifty envelopes in his pocket ready addressed and stamped—I had addressed about six of them—a</p>

When the circulars were being printed Zand did not tell me about the system of getting money—I never saw Zand again after he went away—during the time I was with them they always treated me like perfect gentlemen, and I trusted them; that was the impression I got from their conduct and way of life—I don't know how many applied for this place, there were three waiting when I arrived, and two were speaking with them at the time, that is five—I thought something had happened with them when Zand left, I felt there was something wrong—he told me a long while afterwards that he had had a letter, and that his best friend, Zand, who he had known for five years, had also turned his back on him—I never sent any letters to Zand in Paris, but they corresponded.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 79, Beak Street, St. James's—I am superintendent of the road sweepers employed by St. James's Vestry—on Saturday night or Sunday morning, 26th September, about a quarter past one, I was in Regent Street superintending the sweeping and removal of the dirt, near Argyll Place—I was conversing with Mr. Culverhouse, who contracts for the removal—I saw a brougham approaching me very rapidly on the near side of the road from Oxford Circus; the driver was beating the horse—as he passed me I saw him rise, and by the play of his arm he was still flogging the horse—I did not witness the accident; the sweepers were out of my sight, but I knew where they would be, and I ran, keeping the brougham in view, until I heard screams and a great shouting, and then something seemed to impede my view, and on coming near Glasshouse Street, where I stopped running, I saw a number of cabs and the brougham—I then went back and saw Preedy lying prostrate in the road, partially supported by two of the sweepers—he was a very aged man, I should say over 70—he was quite insensible, and appeared to me to be dead; there was some blood across his forehead—it was a dry, clear night, no fog; there were gas lamps—there is a refuge for foot passengers near where I first saw the brougham, but not near where Preedy was lying—there were two street sweeping machines some distance ahead, by Swan and Edgar's.</p>

I am one of the house surgeons at the Middlesex Hospital—Preedy was brought in there on Sunday morning—he was unable to walk, and in a semi-unconscious condition—he had received injuries from which he ultimately died on the morning of 14th October—amongst those injuries was a fracture of the skull, and some broken ribs, and a broken collar-bone, and a broken leg—there was also effusion on the brain from the crack in the skull; that would prevent him from giving any intelligible account; he was never more conscious than to ask for food and that kind of thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a theatrical agent—the prisoner has driven me for eight or nine months, and is thoroughly steady and sober—I never I allow him to drive me fast, if he did he wouldn't suit me again; I gave him particular orders to drive me slowly, as my health would not permit him to drive fast—during all the time he has driven me he has shown himself a careful driver—on this night I was in my brougham, and my attention was called by hearing somebody shout—at that time he was not driving more than seven or eight miles an hour at the very utmost, I do not think the horse could do more—I do not remember the brougham being stopped, he stopped it himself—I looked out of the window and said, "What is the matter?" and told him to stop—he said, "I will as soon as I can," or words to that effect—he stopped the horse within a second or two, and the horse was almost on its haunches, pulling it up so</p>

               <p>quickly—it had been raining all the evening, and I noticed particularly that it was slippery; Regent Street is in a fearful state—it would be impossible for the prisoner to stand up on that brougham; the board is very narrow, and if he was driving fast he would lose his equilibrium—he was sitting down when I looked out—he stopped towards the lower part of Regent Street—I cannot speak as to how the accident happened—the prisoner is a hard-working, industrious young man, and supports his mother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was inside the brougham—I could not say whether he was flogging his horse or not—Bayswater was my last halting-place before this—he had been out all the day, and the horse was naturally tired—I took the words "I will as soon as I can "to mean that the horse must have received some fright, and it being slippery he could not pull up.</p>

I will bring you out the corals"—the prisoner said "I have no business with, send me out the man from whom I have purchased the corals—the prosecutor came out, and they had a dispute, and I said to my brother "Let us go home, and I will see about it tomorrow"—we then went home—before doing so there was a crowd, and some screaming—Lips<lb/>chitz was making the outcry—I was not struck on the head—the prose<lb/>cutor has not threatened me at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not go in the same boat with the prosecutor and the prisoner to the ship—I was, there when the others arrived—the four men heard the conversation, and were present when the box was opened—all four were there; it was between decks—I went away first from the ship with the boy that brought the box for my countryman—I left him there—I did not see what became of the box after it was opened—when the prisoner and prosecutor came back to the shore they had left the box on the ship; I don't know why they did so—they said they only came back for the box of corals that was left at the lodgings—they arranged to leave the box on board the ship, come back, and fetch it with</p>

                  </hi>. I have pleaded guilty to this theft of a case of cigars—on 1st September I was a carman in the employ of Fardell and Co., contractors, of The Crescent, Minories—on the morning of that day I received instructions to take a Yarmouth cart to the London and North-Western Railway at Aldgate, and fetch a case of cigars, and then take it to the London and St. Katherine's Dock Company—I went there and signed the receipt in the ordinary way, left the station about o'clock, and went from there to Hoxton, and stopped at the top of Ivy Lane; Davis was with me then—I had met him before I went for the cigars to Aldgate; I went home to my breakfast before I went there, and I then met Davis, and asked him if he would come for a ride, and he got into the cart and went to the London and North-Western Railway, at Aldgate, with me—I went to the Unicorn public-house, at the top of Ivy Lane, and from there I went to the Camel public-house in Philip Street, Kingsland Road; that is in the immediate neighbourhood of the other public-house—I there had drink at Davis's expense; it was then about a quarter to 12—Halley, whom I knew, came into the public-house, and we drank together, Halley paying—he called me outside and said "What have you in the case?"—I said "They are cigars"—the cart with the case was then outside the public-house—he asked me to show him the shipping-notes, those I had got from Mr. Fardell's office—I showed them to him; he told me to get up in the cart and he, Davis, and I jumped up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188611220062"/>
               <p>and drove away—I drove a little way and then I asked Halley to take the reins, while I put my coat on—we drove to the Loggerheads, at the back of Shoreditch Church; we reached there about half-past 12—Halley went inside, leaving Davis and me outside—he came back with Lewis, the landlord of the house—they came up to the cart and looked at the case, and then went away for about 10 minutes, and then they came back—Halley asked me for the notes, which he gave to Lewis, and after another five minutes Halley asked me to fetch the case inside—I got it on my back and Halley helped me take it into the Three Loggerheads into a little tap-room on the left—we went in by the bar entrance—I put the case on a table, and then Halley opened it with a hammer and chisel—Halley looked inside, and I went to do so, but the prisoners told me to go away, and said there were cigarettes inside—Halley told me to go away for three or four hours, and Lewis gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give me—Lewis said in the presence of Halley and his potman that they would get the case burnt and put the cigarettes in ginger-beer bottles—Lewis's pot<lb/>man was there all the time. (<hi rend="italic">Pettitt was called into Court.</hi>) That is the man; he came into the little room when we took the case there, and I believe he burnt the case, though I did not see it—I went outside and had a drink with the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that had been given me—I had had a drop of gin before that—then, about half-past 1 o'clock, I and Davis got up in the cart and drove away to the Cambridge Heath Road, where we put the nose-bag on the pony and came away, leaving the cart with a case in it in one of the turnings there—I never left Davis all the afternoon—at a quarter to 5 o'clock we were in the Unicorn, at Hoxton, having come there from the Loggerheads at 4 o'clock—we went back to the Loggerheads at half-past 5, where I saw Lewis behind the bar, and Halley came in just as I did—Halley gave me a sovereign; we were both just inside the public-house, and Lewis behind the bar, where Davis was having a drink—Halley said "Will you give me five shil<lb/>lings to give Mr. Lewis, because he said he could take a cab and fetch a man to buy some of the stuff, the cigars"—I gave five shillings to Halley and he gave it to Lewis, who went out and came back in about half an hour—I, Halley, and Davis stayed in the house during the half hour—Lewis came back in a pony trap with another man, and then Halley told me to go away for a couple of hours—I did not go away, but stayed in the bar with Davis for about three hours—Halley and Lewis went inside—about 7 o'clock Halley came into the bar, and asked me and Davis to go for a walk with him—we went as far as the Kings-land Road together, and then Halley gave me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a public-house in the Kingsland Road, at the corner of a yard by a police station—we had drink there which Halley paid for, and then he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns in the bar of the house—he said "Give me a bit for the man that fetched me to you"—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one of which I changed for drink, and he said that was not enough—I gave him no more—I did not return to my employment—on 3rd November I was taken into custody—the story I have told to-day is true in all respects—before I left the Loggerheads, Lewis told me to give his barman Pettitt a bit of silver for burning the case, and I gave him half-a-crown—that was the last occasion of my being at Lewis's that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Davis about eight months; I don't go with him much; he is not a friend of mine—I met him on 1st September</p>

               <p>by accident, and told him I was going to the railway station to get a box of cigars, and he then got up and went with me—the case of cigars weighed about 254 lb.; I did not weigh it—I had been at Mr. Fardell's about seven months—the case came down by crane into the cart at Aldgate—Davis saw it lowered—I knew it was a case of cigars; it was described on the order—I know Andrews; he is not a friend of mine—he went to fetch Halley; I did not know he had gone for him before he went to Halley—I saw him standing outside the Unicorn that day talking to Davis—I don't know if he is a friend of Davis's—I knew him before from being in the Unicorn—the first thing I did, having got the cigars into the cart, was that I said to Davis "Do you know where to sell these cigars?"—we did not make up our minds to sell them before we got to Hoxton, but after we got the cigars, I and Davis agreed to take them and sell them somewhere—I did not know at that time where to take them to—I made the proposition to sell them by saying "Do you know where to sell these cigars?"—he said "I will soon find somebody"—I only said it as a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> at first; I did not mean it at first—Davis took it in earnest, and said "I can soon find some one"—I said I did not know nothing about it at first—Davis did not lead me into it—Andrews was not examined before the Magistrate—he did not get into the cart with us; he went away, and came back in about a quarter of an hour with Halley—we were then at the Camel—it was a pony in the cart, and the cart had Mr. Fardell's name and address on the outside—it was about half-past 12 when we got to the Loggerheads first—Davis held my hat while I and Halley carried the case in—it was pretty heavy, and took two men to lift it—it was opened then and there in the tap-room in broad daylight between 12 and 1—I saw plenty of people about—there were not any in the bar of the public-house—Davis did not come into the tap-room—I believe it was the tap-room—I had spoken to Halley before at the top of Barton Court in Hoxton—I did not know he was in the service of Lewis's father at the Duke of Gloucester for years—he said they would get some one to burn the case out of the way—up to this time I had received no money, and nothing had been said about money—I handed over the case without making any arrangement as to what I was to get, and Davis the same—I had one other case in the cart: a case of perfumery spirits—I and Davis aban<lb/>doned the cart and the property in Cambridge Heath Road—we had been at the Loggerheads about an hour and a half, and the cart had been waiting outside the whole time; I had put the nosebag on the horse—after abandoning the cart I went to Davis's house in Ivy Lane—I got the sovereign about half past five—I am sure I was at the Logger-heads from about half past five to seven—I cannot tell the exact time, I believe it was from half past five to seven—when I got the sovereign nothing was said as to what I was to have in addition—I cannot give the name of the public house where I received the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is the first public house by the police station, on the left hand side in the Kings-land Road, by the corner of a yard—I changed a sovereign there in the presence of Halley and Davis—I was at Fardell's before for about eighteen months, and then I went on a schooner round the coast—before that I was at a job in Commercial Street, going about with a barrow, taking goods out; it was an honest job—I once stole 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my master's shop; I was then at Anderson's, a tarpaulin place—that was about</p>

               <p>two years ago, it was the first time I stole—I was sent to prison for three months for stealing the money—I did not know Davis then I am sure of that—that is the only time I have been convicted—I live at home; I have got a brother seventeen or eighteen—I am twenty—I believe he is at home, I don't know—he was at home in September, and in employment—I believe he has been in trouble for gambling, only for that; that is all I know—this is the first time I have been examined—I pleaded guilty and offered to give evidence—I don't know if I expect to get a little off by giving evidence—my brother did not get six months for fraud, I am sure of that—Davis is in no employment—he is a coster-monger.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nothing was said about the sign of the public house in the statement, and Halley identified it by saying "Yes, that is the public house kept by my governor's son," that is the prisoner Lewis—until that time I had not heard of the name of the public house—Halley said "I don't know nothing about it," and also, "I don't understand it"—the police searched the Loggerheads from top to bottom; that was about two months afterwards; nothing was found—that was the only house searched to my knowledge.</p>

I am a costermonger, of 34, Ivy Lane, Hoxton—I know Castle—I saw him on Wednesday, 1st September, about 9 o'clock in Hoxton—I rode in his cart to Aldersgate Street railway station to fetch a case, and a case of cigars came down—there was another small case in the cart—he said he was going to drive home to get some money for dinner, and he drove to the Unicorn public-house, Hoxton—he then want to get his money, and I saw him again at 11 o'clock at the Unicorn, opposite Ivy Lane, and he said "Do you know where to sell this case of cigars?"—I said "No, and I don't want to know"—we went into the Unicorn and had two or three drinks, and then left there and went to the Camel public-house in Philip Street and had a drink; that was about 12 o'clock—Halley came in there about five minutes past 12 while we were drinking, and then Castle had a drink with him and with me, and they went outside together, I remained inside; they came back again and</p>

               <p>drank up their drink, and then both jumped up in the cart—Castle called me, and said "Come for a drive," and I got up and we drove to the Three Loggerheads at the back of Columbia Market—Halley went in there, and remained two or three minutes, and then came out with Lewis; I had been standing by the pony during that time, and Castle was in the cart—Lewis looked at the case of cigars, and then Castle gave him a piece of paper, but I did not hear what was said—Lewis then walked up to the corner of the turning, and stood there a few minutes, and then went into his public-house—Halley said "All right" and Castle carried the case of cigars into the Three Loggerheads, and put them in a little room on the left hand side as you go in—Castle then came out and put on his hat, and then I went with him into the bar, and we had a drink together; I didn't see Lewis there then—then Castle told me that Halley had told him to come back in two or three hours' time, and we two left in the cart, and drove to a public-house at the top of Columbia Market—this was about 2 o'clock; I then left Castle, and did not see him again till a little before 5, when I saw him outside the Unicorn public-house in Hoxton—we left there, and went round to the Three Logger-heads and saw Halley, and he and Castle had a conversation which I did not hear—I then saw him call Castle out and give him a sovereign, and I saw Castle change the sovereign afterwards—we stopped there till about half-past 6, and then Halley and I and Castle went to the first public-house past the police-station in the Kingsland Road, I do not know the name of it—we all three had drink there, and then Halley called Castle away from me as we stood at the bar and gave him some money; I heard the jingle of money passing into his hand, and Castle told me it was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we left together about ten minutes to 7, and then separated—I saw Castle again that night about 8 o'clock outside the Variety Theatre in Pitfield Street; we had a drink, and then I left—I met him again about 9 o'clock at the corner of James Street, at a beer shop; we had a drink together, and I borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of him to go to market.</p>

in for penal servitude , and I will tell; "I merely said "I am in for it, and I will tell you," I did
not mention penal servitude—I told him "About o'clock last Wednesday week I saw Dick Castle in Hoxton, with one of Fardell's carts with two cases in it"—I was excited then—I was after-wards taken as a witness, and I then said when examined on oath, "On Wednesday, 1st September, I saw the prisoner Castle; he was then driving a pony and Yarmouth cart in Ivy Lane; there were two cases in the cart; that was eleven o'clock; he said to me 'Will you come for a ride,' &amp;c.?"—I did not say a word before the Magistrate that I had gone to Aldgate to fetch the case; I didn't think of that—it was after I had heard Castle's statement before the Magistrate, in which he said that I was with him, that I first mentioned it—I didn't think it was necessary to tell I was with him when he got the case—Castle first spoke in the cart about selling these cigars, he said "Do you know where you can sell this case of cigars?" and pointed to the case in the cart—I didn't know at that time that he intended to steal it and make</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker at 168, Brockley Road—on 19th October I passed Mrs. Hoyle's shop several times—I saw Waits loitering about there on the pavement—subsequently I heard a cry of "Stop them"—I ran up from my workshop and saw two men going down Malpas Road; I followed, but could not overtake them; I did not see their faces—as they ran down Malpas Road one of the men jumped into a cart—on the morning of the 20th I was taken to Brockley Police-station, where I recognised Waits among 18 to 20 men—I have no doubt he is the man who was loitering about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 225). On 25th October I was with Beale in Union Street, Borough, about 5.45—we were in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner standing under a lamp rubbing something between his finger and thumb—he went into the Albion public-house, and came out and looked round—I went under the same lamp—he then leaned against a fence at the corner of Bath Terrace—we went across to him, and I said, "What is that you had rubbing in your fingers and thumb just now?"—he said, "Nothing; what do you think?"—I said, "We are two police constables, and we are going to see—I seized his left hand, and he immediately put both his hands in his pockets—I seized his left, and Beale his right—after a desperate struggle I got his left hand out of his pocket, opened it, and found this parcel containing six counterfeit shillings separately wrapped in paper—Beale took something from his right hand which I did not see, and said, "This is a bad shilling"—he said, "Why don't you go across to the paper shop and get the other man?"—I had not seen any man with him—we took him to the paper shop, but there was no man there—on the road to the station he said, "A man whom I do not know gave me this parcel, told me to hold it, and said it was a parcel for my <hi rend="italic">missis"</hi>—he gave his correct address at</p>

I was with Chick, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner rubbing something under a lamp—he went into the Albion, and came out and went under the lamp again—I crossed over to him, and saw something bright in his hand—we both laid hold of him, and Chick took a packet from his left hand while I took a shilling from his right and put it in my mouth and said, "This is a bad shilling"—he was very violent and said, "Why don't you take the other man?"—I said, "Where is he?"—he said, "Over at the paper shop"—we took the prisoner there; the shopkeeper examined his till, but found no bad money—I said, "Has a man been here lately?"—he said, "I think not"—the prisoner was taken to the station, where I found a good sixpence on him—I went back to the fence where he had been standing and picked up another bad shilling with teeth marks on it, and wrapped in paper—that was where the struggle took place—it is not true that I was at the Crown the day before and got bad money and put it on the prisoner—I have not been into the Crown for years—I knew the prisoner previously.</p>

These six shillings are counterfeit, so is this one in yellow paper—this one found by the fence is also bad, and from the same mould as one of the six—counterfeit coins are rubbed over with lamp black to give them a tone, and paper is put between them to keep them from rubbing, and the lamp black is rubbed off before they are uttered.</p>
