I beg you will not dis<lb/>appoint me, as if I do not have them posted to-morrow morning it will be too late—it is something connected with the police. I wish I might be fortunate enough to get it. Mr. Young called last night about some letters. I solemnly declare that I have no letters or papers belonging to either you or he. I never read a letter of yours in my life, although you may suppose so. I trust you will send me these papers in the course of the day. Yours truly, P. Fraser." On receiving that letter I was about to send the desk by the porter, but I first examined it, to see whether he had any letters addressed to me, and found this pocket-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing nineteen pawnbroker's duplicates—there are five here now—I sent to one of the clerks and made a list of them, which I handed with the pocket-book to Mr. M'Gregor, on his coming to the City from the country—the desk was unlocked—the desk was locked when he left, and the next day I saw it picked by a locksmith, and it was partly examined by Mr. M'Gregor—it was then put into an enclosure under one of the counters in the inner warehouse—it was not locked—other persons could have access to it if so inclined—it was left there from the 4th to 26th—this is the desk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pocket-book was here in a secret part, a little out of sight—it is not a secret drawer—I cannot swear that it was there on the 4th—the papers in the pocket-book now, and some others, were in it when it was found—this letter, directed "Thomas M'Gregor, Esq.," was not; it was one that Mr. M'Gregor has received since—I cannot say whether this envelope, directed "Paul Fraser," was there—I do not recollect any in his own handwriting being there—I have never seen him use the pocket-book—my master does not sell ready-made coats, but be sells doeskins, and the prisoner had access to them—there is no mark on this piece of doeskin, but it is similar to what my master sometimes sold, and these two patterns were made in Yorkshire expressly to his order—the style of weaving is different from that of the other doeskins of the same sort—these we call crape doe<lb/>kins—the others are a little different—no other house deals in goods of this description—I swear it has been part of my master's property—I did not myself miss any property from the warehouse—I cannot speak to the coats.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service as warehouseman, and was so in May and June—he was not the housekeeper at that time—I deal in scarfs—this scarf produced is of a quality that I have been in the habit of keeping—I am not myself able to say whether I have missed any—I believe I am the only individual that has this sort of table-cover except the manufacturer—it is a peculiar article, made for the China trade, and I bought it as a job lot—it is not a thing we generally deal in—it is made of a sort of ladies' cloth, and was imperfect in the die, and it was afterwards printed into table-covers, and was cut into various lengths—it is the only lot of table-covers I ever had in my stock—it is not an article that would be found in any warehouse in the City—I can confidently say that the same article was never made before—it was not properly made for table-covers—these cloths have a very great peculiarity; they have got black stripes in the list, which are called Spanish stripes—there is a great deal of similar cloth, but not made for table-covers—the cloth itself is peculiar, and the printing it for table-covers is an additional peculiarity—I have not the slightest doubt that this is part of my property—I did not print them myself—I bought them of the manu<lb/>facturers, as a job lot—my number happens to be on the waistcoat-piece—it is a piece of the quality that I had on my premises—there are two marks on it that I can speak to; my own mark, and the mark of the party from whom I purchased it—he is considered the manufacturer of it, inasmuch as this is a registered article—the material was manufactured in the north of England, and afterwards printed at Crayford, in Kent—the peculiarity of the printing is so well known in the trade, that if it had never been in my shop I should know whose printing it was—we enter everything by progressive numbers—this number is 919—that is my number—the number of the party from whom 1 bought it is No. 1, and a figure 8 after it, which would denote eight yards—that is not my writing; I cannot say whose it is—I never mark off goods</p>

I received this letter of 26th Sept.—(<hi rend="italic">this letter was read, as in the last case</hi>)—in consequence of that letter, I again looked at the desk—I found it under the counter, in a sort of cupboard place, in the inner warehouse—it had been put there the day after the prisoner had been dis<lb/>charged—I found in the desk a pocket-book, containing twelve duplicates—I made a list of the duplicates, and afterwards handed the pocket-book to Mr. M'Gregor—these three tickets, of 25th May, 29th May, and 10th June I believe were among them—I had found the desk originally in his bedroom.</p>

                  </hi>. There is no mark on this scarf, but it is an article which Mr. M'Gregor keeps in his stock, and from this lot we have three missing—I have ascertained that by searching through the book—that book is not here—I have the book relating to the waistcoating; it is kept by a young man in the counting-house, who Mr. M'Gregor has on purpose to write off the stock as it is sold—when we receive a quantity of goods from a manufacturer's we have the invoice, and the manufacturer's number is put on it from the invoice, which we call the progress number, and our own number also, and both numbers are entered in our book—this has had the manufacturer's ticket taken off—I produce the book and the original invoice of the goods—I am not in the habit of seeing the entries in this book as soon as they are made.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> This is the invoice I received with the parcel of goods—I passed it—I pass every invoice—here are my initials—this number is the first on the invoice; "No. 1," and "29 1/2 yards"—No. 1 is the manufacturer's number, and the red number is my own, the progress number—one is a check on the other—whatever lengths are sold are written off in this book, and put to the credit of the number; and I believe it will turn out that we are something like three and a half yards short of this identical piece—this is the last piece that would have been sold, if sold at all—I buy all my own goods, and sell nearly the whole of them, and am seldom out of my business from morning to night—I have not the clerk here that kept this book—half a dozen clerks might have written it off, according to the period at which it is sold—the entries must first be made in a journal by two young men in the warehouse—one calls one or two clerks out of the counting-house with the journal and invoice, the two warehousemen repeat the names of the articles, number, price, and length, which are entered in the journal; another clerk hears that called back; that is checking it, to see that it is properly and correctly done; then as the things are sold, they are written off here—the lengths we have written off as being sold amount in all to twenty-five yards and five-eighths—there is none left in stock, this is the last portion of it—my books show originally twenty-nine and a half yards—I sell three-fourths of the goods that are sold in the warehouse—the date of the invoice is 1845—this is an article that went immediately out of fashion—there was upwards of 3,000 yards of it—if this had been sold, it must have appeared in my books or else it must have been taken away, one or the other; it is impossible that any article can go out of the house without being entered—the prisoner had no access to the books; he was entirely a warehouseman—he had charge of these goods in common with the other goods; in fact he had the whole charge of a room about three times the length of this Court, and was there by himself—the contents of this book were not brought to his notice at all—he might refer to it if he went into the counting-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Hayes. About eleven o'clock at night, on 21st Sept., I went to John Langton's house with the prisoner—we had some beer—I had six shillings, a half-crown, and a sixpence in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I sat down, and the prisoner sat next to me on that side—when I had been there half an hour, I fell off to sleep—I slept about two hours—when I awoke I missed my money—it had been in a purse—the purse was put into my left-hand pocket—the prisoner was there—I asked him about it—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the George Tavern, Snow-hill. On Saturday 21st Sept., about eleven o'clock in the morning, Wood came for half-a-pint of beer, and paid me with a half-crown—I gave him his change, and he left—I put the half-crown in a cup in the till—there was no other there—I gave the change out of my pocket—about four that afternoon Wood came again, with Hewson and another man—I knew Wood again directly—Hewson asked for a quartern of gin—I served him; he paid me with a half-sovereign—I gave him change, in three half-crowns, two shillings, and two-pence, and they all three went away—I went in the back-room, and showed Mr. Webb the half-sovereign—he said it was bad, and fetched the prisoner back directly—Mr. Connor was there, and he assisted in detaining the prisoner till the officer came—Mr. Webb gave me the half-sovereign, and I gave it to the officer at the station—I did not find that the half-crown was bad till I returned from the station—I then marked it—I found it in the cup where I had placed it—no one had access to the till—I had locked it and taken the key with me.</p>

On 9th Oct. the two policemen came to my house, between eleven and twelve o'clock in a horse and cart, and put up at my house—Ullmer had fourpenny-worth of rum and water, and Hooper had a pint of beer—Ullmer left, and Hooper paid for what they both had—when I took him in the pint of beer it came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid me with a shilling—in a few minutes Ullmer came back and brought in a steak, and asked if I would cook it—I said, "Yes"—he gave me a shilling for cooking it—the prisoners were in and out nearly all day—between three and four Mr. Stone and Mr. Hyman came—while they were there the policeman came in—Mr. Stone and Mr. Hyman produced bad shillings, and I produced a bad shilling out of a little bowl that I keep silver in—I had placed the first shilling that I took from the prisoners, in the bowl—there was then only one other shilling there, which was a crooked one—I placed the second shilling in the same bowl—the two shillings that I took into the tap-room I took from that bowl—they were the only shillings that were there beside the crooked one—I got a good shilling from Ullmer for the second shilling that I took to him, but he made a good many remarks—he said, "It is a pack of nonsense," and he said he had given me a good shilling—he</p>

I saw Hooper between three and four o'clock, coming up the hill near the Three Legs—I saw him take a purse or a bag and stoop down as if he were hiding something—I am sure Hooper is the man—I told Roadknight, and I saw him find a bag in the place that I pointed out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Hernmingford-terrace, Islington. The prisoner lodged with me in July, and afterwards—a policeman came in Sept. and searched the prisoner's lodgings—I saw him examine a dressing<lb/>case which was brought up from the prisoner's sister's room—he produced a key and unlocked it—I saw him find a check-book in it.</p>

I took the pri<lb/>soner—I got some keys from him at the station, and on 6th Sept. went to Mr. Henley's and opened a dressing-case with one of them, and under a secret bottom which was let in, and which I had great difficulty in getting out, I found the check-book produced—as I took him from Guildhall to the Compter that day, he said, "I believe you are going to search my lodgings?"—I said, "How do you know that, did you hear the Magistrate tell me?"—he said, "Yes; don't let my sister go up with you into the room"—I said, "Are you afraid 1 shall find any checks there?" or "Have you any checks</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks to Mr. Hobler, the attorney for the prosecution. On 18th Sept., during the last Sessions, I served on the prisoner in Newgate a notice, and on 22nd Oct., during this Sessions, I served him with another, a copy of the former—this is a copy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These being read, were notices to produce upon the trial a check for 20</hi>l<hi rend="italic">., dated 30th July, 1850, and all other documents in his possession relating to the case.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the notices were bad; the first, as it did not call on the prisoner to produce anything at the present Session, and the second because not served personally on him, but left at the gaol, while he was a prisoner, and therefore unable to take any steps towards its production; further he urged that secondary evidence could not be given of the contents of the check, it not being clearly traced to his possession, which it ought to be before he could be expected to obey a notice to produce it.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the objections must fail; the evidence supported the fact, that in the regular course of business the check would come into the prisoner's possession; and the notice served on the prisoner in gaol, entitled the prosecutor, in the absence of the document, to give secondary evidence of its contents; for although the prisoner was not a free agent, he had the means of communicating with his legal adviser, and through him, obtaining it; a notice was as binding upon a prisoner as it would be if served on a party bed-ridden or incapable of moving.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Banks Hardiman, of Southampton-street, Caraberwell. On 14th Sept. the prisoners came to our shop about three o'clock—Jones asked for a bottle of pickled onions—I served her—she then asked if I had any mixed pickles—I said, "Yes"—she asked me to pick out a bottle that had most onions in it—I took down the pickles; they chose one bottle—Jones then said, "I suppose you can't give me change for a sovereign, can you?"—I said, "O yes, I can;" and she put a sovereign on the counter—I went up into the parlour to fetch the change; I took out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—I counted it before I brought it down, and then counted it down on the counter—there were three half-crowns in it—there was the full change—Jones moved it with her hand, and said, could I oblige her with more half-crowns instead of silver—I then went to the till and took out two half-crowns—I went to the counter and put them down, and went to take five shillings from the silver—I counted it over, and there were with the two half-crowns twenty-two shillings—there were three shillings gone—they had taken up the sovereign; I never saw it after I came down from the parlour—I counted the silver once or twice, and said, "It is very strange, here ought to have been twenty-five shillings, and here are only twenty-two"—Jones said, "You have got your own change, and two shillings too much"—I said I had not, I had three shillings short—Stone said it was quite right—I said it was not, I ought to have had three shillings more—my husband came into the shop, and Stone shuffled her hand beneath her shawl and took out of her pocket a handful of peppermint-drops, and some shillings mixed with them; she shook it in her hand, and she said, "I suppose this is your money?"—she said it as if she meant, "I suppose you will say this is your money"—I cannot say bow many shillings there were, there were more than three—we sent for the constable—after we had sent for him, Stone told Jones to give me the sovereign, that I might take the three shillings out of it, that they might not be detained.</p>

On 4th Oct. the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a bonnet<lb/>shape—Mary Ann Howe, who serves in the shop, went to get it, and while she was gone I saw the prisoner take a coat, which was for sale, from a pile of coats, and put it under her shawl—I called to Charles Smith, and he called to my mother, who came, and after the prisoner had paid for what she bought, my mother told her before she left the shop she would have her searched—the prisoner asked what for, and my mother said for stealing a coat—she said she did not do it—I saw my mother pick up the same coat I saw the prisoner take—it is my father's property.</p>

On Wednesday, 18th Sept., I was on my way home from Charing-cross to Regent-street; I had been with a person I knew respecting a public-house that he was taking in the neighbourhood, and I went to Charing-cross to see him to the omnibus—as I was going from there to Regent-street I had occasion to stop at a urinal, at the corner of Hemming's-row—it is a place where there are partitions—it was then about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning—when I went into the place I observed the pri<lb/>soner there, at the further partition—I went to the first one I came to, and unbuttoned my trowsers, for the purpose of relieving myself—the prisoner directly came to me from the partition he was in, took me by the flap of my shirt, and said, "You b——, if you don't give me a sovereign, I will charge you with an indecent assault"—I immediately struck him in the mouth, and from the blow he fell to the ground—he got up again, and snatched my watch from my pocket, which was fastened by a guard, and got it into his hand—he likewise tore open my waistcoat, and feeling, I suppose, that I had money in my pocket, he said, "I find you have a sovereign or two, I will have one of them"—I then struck him a second time, and called the police—I had about four sovereigns in my left-hand pocket—he said if I did not give him one of them he would charge me as he had previously said—I called the police while we were struggling in the place, he went out—I followed him, and when he saw the policeman coming up, he said, "This gentleman has been annoy<lb/>ing me, and following me"—I directly said, "I give this man in charge for an attempt at extortion"—the policeman then took charge of him—in going to the station, I asked the policeman to allow me to go into a house at the corner of Coventry-street to take a glass of ale, as I felt rather excited—he said, "You had better not, come on," and I did not—I went on to the sta<lb/>tion and gave the charge—when the policeman took him into custody, he said, "If you will go your way, I will go mine."</p>

On the night of 7th Oct., I went to bed about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock—I secured the house—this bar which is now broken (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) fastened the parlour door—there was a wooden door outside, and then an iron door between the parlour and the bar—a person could have got into the parlour by the window from the back yard—that window was shut down over night, but not fastened—there were marks on it as if somebody had attempted to take out a pane of glass, but they found the window was not fast, and they had thrown the window up—if anybody got in there, they would have an oppor<lb/>tunity of forcing the parlour door—in consequence of the alarm I got up, and came down-stairs—I found the parlour door broken open, and this bar lay in the passage—the door was not broken, but there were marks of a crowbar on the panels of the wainscot by the side of the door—I found a knife sticking in the floor to fasten open the inner door of the parlour, a small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and crowbar between the inner and the outer door, and some drops of wax on the seat in the parlour which is behind the inner door, and some on the flagstones against the iron door—there is a wall between my yard and the next, which is Mr. Mears'—I saw Mr. Hampton the same morning; his yard is opposite to Mr. Mean's.</p>

I have known the prisoners eight weeks—Simons used to leave parcels, and said he would call for them himself, but if the female called she was to have them; but she never did—sometimes he took them away when she was with him, and sometimes he used to take them away alone—he went by the name of Mr. Harris, and she Mrs. Harris—the female called on Saturday, 28th Sept., about eight o'clock, and asked if Mr. Harris had been there—she left again, and I followed her to Mr. Lawson's, 211, Oxford-street—she waited by the door a few minutes, and Simons came out of the shop to her—they spoke to each other, and he went in again—a few minutes after he came out and spoke to her again, and a third time also—she was then three or four doors from the shop, and he appeared to put his hand to his coat-pocket and to put his hand towards her, I cannot say exactly, as I was on the opposite side of the way—he then went into the shop again, and she went to Mr. Gurney's—I got back first, and was in the house before her—when she came she had a small parcel—I then served her with something—my master sent to Mr. Lawson, and he came himself—there were then two parcels at our house, which Simons had left, one on the Thursday and one on the Friday, and which he was to call for that night—Mr. Lawson examined those—about the fourth time Simons came, he told me he was going to com<lb/>mence housekeeping—the female prisoner never brought any parcels but the one that night.</p>

I am a draper, in partnership with John Palmer——Simons was in our service six months—on Saturday night, 28th Sept. about nine o'clock, I received information, called a policeman, and went with him to Mr. Gurney's, where I found three parcels of our goods—this is a list I made of them at the station (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"23 muslin collars, 18 pairs of gloves, 9 cuffs, 30 postage stamps, 2 lengths of blonde, 6 cambric handkerchiefs, 7 lengths of ribbon, 1 length of lace, 23 handkerchiefs, 1 paper of pins, 4 bunches of flowers, 1 cap front, 12 shop tickets, 1 knife and fork, and half-a-yard of lace insertion)—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are our property—I know them by the private marks on them—I gave the female prisoner into custody, and went to 19, Cooper-street, Finsbury, which address she gave as her lodging, and there found other things—I examined Simons's boxes, and found 2 lengths of cloth and some silk—he lived at our house, and slept there, except on Saturday and Sunday nights—he told me that on those nights he slept at his uncle's.</p>

On the morning of 17th Sept., I was on duty in Albert-street, where there is a wall adjoining the prosecutor's house—if a person was coming from the window that was broken, to the street, they would come over that wall—about half-past three o'clock I saw the prisoner and two others drop over that wall—the prisoner had his boots and cap in his hand—I took the prisoner in custody, took him to the house, searched him, and found a knife on him; I examined it with the marks on the putty, and have no doubt it would produce such—there was a hole in the window large enough for a man's hand to go through—the prisoner said he was hungry, and out of work, and did it to get some victuals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. William Henry Carey, of Tyron's-place, Hackney. On Monday evening, 7th Oct., about half-past six o'clock, I met the prisoner about a yard from the carriage-house door, in the street—I met one man first, and then the prisoner, and another man—I passed close by the side of them, and had a good opportunity of observing them—they were walking very slowly—I went in-doors, and about half-past seven, I was putting my master's children to bed on the second-floor, and my atten<lb/>tion was attracted by the opening of our bed-room window, which is the adjoining room—it is in front of the house, and the window looks into the street, over the stable—I did not think anything further of it till I left the room at a quarter to eight, when I found the window and door wide open, and a chair placed against the door—I shut the window and door, and went down to my mistress's room on the first-floor—the door of that room was shut—I did not know whether it was fastened, and I listened—I heard a rust<lb/>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185010210061"/>
               <p>of paper, and concluded it was my mistress, and did not attempt to open the door—as I left the room I was met by one of the young ladies, who requested me to get something from the room; I said some one was there—she said, "Mamma is not there," and we rushed down-stairs, got the cook, and she burst the room open, and I saw the prisoner there with a lighted candle in the room—I had a full opportunity of seeing him—I have no doubt he is the man—I never saw him before—we then rushed down-stairs and alarmed my mistress—I did not return for three-quarters of an hour, and then found a crow-bar and several matches on the bed, and some in the room—on examining the premises, I should say the entry had been effected over the stable, and at the attic window—the prisoner was about three yards from the stable when I met him at a quarter-past six—I gave a description of the prisoner to Clark the policeman—on the following Friday morning, I went with my master into Pearson-steet, and saw the prisoner there, and recognised him—Clark was walking behind, in case I should give information as to the man I saw—if I saw the man, I was to give a signal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Robarts, Curtis, and Co. We have no person named John Weston keeping an account at our house—this is a very old blank form of check of ours—I should say at least ten years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. James Cooper, of the Bankruptcy Court. The prisoner was formerly employed by Mr. Turner, of the Bankruptcy Court, who is now dead—I am acquainted with the prisoner's handwriting, and have been so I should think four years—I have frequently seen him write, almost daily—I believe the writing on this check to be the prisoner's—no part of it is Mr. Cooper's writing—he was not in town on that date; he was at Penzance—I had a letter from him that morning—he had been away for a fortnight previously, and he came back about a fortnight afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long is it since you saw the prisoner write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about four months—the formation of these letters are the prisoner's—I have looked at the check before—some portions of it are exactly like his writing—some portions are attempted to be disguised—the I in "James" is different to what he usually writes—the C in "Cooper" has a tail to it; that is not like his; but the "ames," those who have seen him write previously would not have a doubt about—he used to copy for Mr. Turner; he was not his clerk; if Mr. Turner had any copying to do he would give it to the prisoner to do—the prisoner and I have not, to say, quarrelled; we have had a <hi rend="italic">lark,</hi> or something like that—I have never complained of his telling of any misconduct of mine; I am quite sure of that—I know Bolton, a pensioner of Mr. Commissioner Shepherd's—I was never charged with keeping back the pension, and making use of it myself; nothing of the kind—this is the first time I ever heard of anything of the kind; I swear that most positively—I was never charged with keeping back any money given me by Mr. Commissioner Shepherd to pay a pensioner of his—I have been eight years at the Bankruptcy Court, and the prisoner about four—I have known him during that time—I have had no quarrel whatever with him—he very often got drunk, and would come in and be very <hi rend="italic">bouncable,</hi> and I would sometimes order him out—he was in an inferior position to me—he used to create a disturbance, and then I turned him out—I have done that I think twice, not recently; I should think it is twelve months ago—I swear positively I never had any other quarrel with him—I never complained of his stating that I had kept back money which Mr. Commissioner Shepherd ordered me to pay over—Mr. Commissioner Shepherd never gave me a</p>

               <p>after he had called several times and seen the work in progress, he produced to me this other note (<hi rend="italic">looking at one for</hi> 60-<hi rend="italic">lire</hi>)—I believe that was on the Thursday; I am not exactly certain of the day, it was about a week after he first came—I had previously shown him a proof of the 5-lire note, as far as it had gone—when he produced this 60-lire note, he asked what would be the price for 1,000 of them printed back and front—I said they would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the water-mark—he agreed to give that—he did not give any description of that note to me—I did not require a further deposit on that new order; he gave me another sovereign on the old one—he afterwards called to see a perfect proof of the first note—that was on Tuesday, the 10th; he examined it, and said it would do very nicely—he wished me to get on with the other as fast as possible, as he was going out of town on the Sunday—I understood him to say he was going to Birmingham, but I am not very certain about that; it was promised on the Saturday—I have not got the proof I showed him of the first note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a proof of part of the second note that I showed him—he expressed himself satisfied as far as it had gone, and wished it finished, and he would come on the Sunday to see a proof, as he had to go out of town; this is a finished proof—it is a proof from a lithographic stone which I made in pursuance of his directions—I promised that the 3,000 of the first notes should be done on Thursday—he said be would call, but he did not—he came on the Saturday, about eleven o'clock in the morning—he said he had called for the labels which he had ordered—I do not know whether he used the term "labels" or "tickets," but I rather think it was "labels," as he had called them labels before—I said they were ready, and I would fetch them—I went up stairs and brought down a packet containing the 3,000 of the first notes, and delivered them to the prisoner—he opened the parcel and examined the notes—he said some of them were a little pale—he paid me a balance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he had paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—he took away the 3,000 notes with him in the packet I had given him—before he left he saw a proof of the 60-lire note; he had seen it before, partly finished—he expressed himself satisfied, and said he would call the next day—at that time I was aware that Forrester, the officer, was in waiting in the neighbourhood—I believe my father had been in communication with Forrester on Tuesday, 3rd Sept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer of the City of London. I received a communication from Mr. Lee I think on 4th Sept.—he came to the Mansion-house to me, and made a communication to me, and that communi<lb/>cation] I made to Mr. Bush—I employed Goddard—he went with me on the morning of the 14th—I was not aware of his going to Mr. Lee's in the interval—he went with me on the morning of the 14th, and we saw the prisoner a little before ten o'clock—he went into Mr. Lee's house, and stopped there I think about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he then came out with this parcel—I followed him down Holborn into Warwick-court, and then took him into custody, and took the parcel from him—I took him to Bow-street station—when I got him there, I undid the parcel before him, and told him that they appeared like the parts of an Austrian note—he said that all he knew was that a gentleman in France had given him an order to get these things done, and he supposed them to be lottery-tickets—that was all that passed between us—I afterwards went to his house—he gave his address at the station—it was 13, Little Brook-street, Holborn, the George public-house—I went there, and in his room I found this passport (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and other papers—there are two or three letters addressed to him by his name—I also found two more of these Austrian notes—(<hi rend="italic">These were stated to be genuine notes of sixteen and thirty lire.</hi>)</p>

               <p>that the first intimation on this subject that came to your knowledge, was at the Mansion-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from the elder Mr. Lee: I think that was on 4th Sept.—I had no knowledge that anything of this sort was in progress before Mr. Lee called on me—the communication I received was from Mr. Lee the elder—it was not a communication made to the Magistrate at the Mansion-house; it was a private communication to me—I knew Mr. Lee before—the first time I knew him was, I think, two years ago—I had never put him in motion, or he me on the subject matter of such a transaction as this, before I saw him on 4th Sept.—I became acquainted with him by some persons who were convicted here, going to his house to buy some stones for printing notes—that was in a Russian ease, and he was a witness in the ease—I think it was about two years ago; it was the case of Friedeburgh, I think—Mr. Lee had not given any information on that occasion; I think the information went to Mr. Peachey—I think Lee was the person that made the communication—I did not take any advice of any of the authorities at the Mansion-house before I proceeded to Mr. Bush—I went to Leadbetter first—he has something to do with the Austrian Government, and the Commissioners were over here—we talked the case over, and we went to Mr. Bush together—part of the gentlemen who are here now, were in this country at that time—I cannot tell how long they had been here—I only knew of their being here a day or two before 2nd Sept.—I had not seen anything of Mr. Bush on the subject before 4th Sept., nor had Leadbetter, that I am aware of—Leadbetter knew nothing of it till I acquainted him of it—I had not seen the Commissioners before 2nd Sept.; I understood they were at Birmingham on a case there—I did not go to the Austrian Consul; it strikes me that somebody else went, I forget now—I went to Mr. Bush because these gentlemen came, and wished to have advice about it, and that was the reason I went to Mr. Bush with them—I did not have any communication with Mr. Bush until I had seen the Commissioners—I went to Mr. Bush the next morning after receiving the communication from Mr. Lee—I think Mr. Bush was the first person I saw after I had seen Mr. Lee—if you will allow me, I think I can now recollect—there was a person of the name of Netherclift who came to Mr. Bush to give some information about some man—I only know that, because when I went there I saw Mr. Netherclift; he is an engraver—I never saw anybody on the subject of this transaction until 1 saw Mr. Lee, and then I directly went to Mr. Bush.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know, as at that time you had seen nobody, and knew nothing of the transaction, why you went to Mr. Bush? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because Mr. Netherclift had been to Mr. Bush the day before—Mr. Bush sent to me to tell me about Netherclift, and then I stated to Mr. Bush that there was another man of the name Lee giving the same information—I had the message from Mr. Bush the day before I saw Mr. Lee.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had had a communication with Mr. Bush before, how do you reconcile that with your seeing Mr. Bush for the first time after you had seen Mr. Lee the elder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw Mr. Bush, but not on Mr. Lee's information at all—Mr. Bush sent for me because Netherclift had come to give some information on the same sort of thing, and when I went the next day I said that Mr. Lee had been—I think it was on the 3rd I was sent for to Mr. Bush—I said I knew that the Commissioners were then in London—I think it was 2nd Sept.—I had not seen Mr. Bush before I knew that the Commissioners were here.</p>

               <p>would advise with him, and he was recommended to the case—when Leadbetter came to me we thought we would advise with the Commissioners, and recommend Mr. Bush to the case—Mr. Bush has these sort of cases, and understands them, and I thought he was a very proper person to advise with—I had no particular reason for going to Mr. Bush, without communicating with my superiors—what I did was for the best—I and Leadbetter and the Commissioners all went together to Mr. Bush to advise with him—I did not see the Commissioners before I went to Mr. Bush—the first time I saw them was on the 5th; I think about two o'clock—they came to the Mansion-house, and then from there to Mr. Bush's—I expected to see them at the Mansion-house through Leadbetter—I think I saw Mr. Bush before I saw the Commissioners: I have not a doubt about it—it was through Nether-clift the thing was mentioned—I went to Mr. Bush the day after Mr. Lee made the communication to me; I do not know what time of the day I went; I think it was in the morning, about twelve o'clock—I did not employ Mr. Bush at that lime—I went to Mr. Bush because he sent to me, because Netherclift had given him the information; and when he had told me that, and Lee gave me the information, I went and told him of the circumstance—I had no communication with any person whatever on the subject of this transaction until Mr. Lee came to me and made a private communication to me at the Mansion-house—I did not have any communication with any<lb/>body else until I saw Mr. Bush—it was on the 4th that I had a communica<lb/>tion from Mr. Bush, not on this subject—it was perhaps five o'clock; it might be four; I am not sure—I had seen Mr. Lee about twelve in the morning—when I saw Mr. Bush at four or five it was at his own office—I had not had any communication with him before that about any subject of this kind—I went to Mr. Bush because he sent to me when Netherelift was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As I understand, Mr. Bush had something told him by Mr. Netherclift that had something to do with something like this, and then Mr. Bush sent to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in the meantime I had seen Mr. Lee the elder, and when Mr. Bush told me what Mr. Netherclift had told him, I said that Mr. Lee had been to me about the same thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me a while ago that you and Leadbetter had agreed to recommend Mr. Bush, is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know about recommending—we took him, because he is a person understanding this particular affair, or things of this sort, and the Commissioners, I, and Leadbetter went over together to consult him—we went over as much as anything because we knew that Mr. Bush knew that Netherclift had been giving some information—it was afterwards that I went with the Commissioners—I went to Mr. Bush in consequence of the message I received; it was not about Mr. Lee—I cannot tell who brought me the message—I did not say just now that I went to Mr. Bush of my own accord: I do not think I said such a thing—I am positive I went to him, because he sent for me in consequence of Mr. Netherclift being there.</p>

The present note of 5-lire is taken in payment as hard cash at the central treasuries, and at all the public treasuries of the Lombardo Venetian Kingdom. The Imperial Commissary Plenipotentiary Montecuceoli"—the 60-lire note is, "Como—Number 113,496—1st April, 1849—D—Lombardo Venetian Kingdom—60—Treasury note—Sixty Austrian Lire. The present note of 60-lire, and the amount of the interest due thereon, at the rate of the indication on the back hereof, are taken in payment as hard cash at the central treasuries, and at all the public treasuries of the Lombardo Venetian Kingdom. At the expiration of one year the interest will be paid in cash at the central treasu<lb/>ries against the issue of a fresh note. Imperial Commissary Plenipotentiary Montecuceoli"—at the back there is a calculation—the words are a beading to a sort of table on the amount of 60-lire—"Interest will be paid, reckoning from 1st April, 1849, at the rate of 1 centessimo for every two days—on the following table is specified the complete amount due as stated"—I believe these (<hi rend="italic">the forgeries</hi>) to be to the same effect as the others, except that she 60-lire note has nothing at the back.</p>

On 27th Sept., about half-past twelve o'clock, the prisoner and four others came, and called for a pot of stout—I gave it them, and two glasses—they drank it, and got <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> one another about, and broke one of the glasses—I said, "You have broken the glass"—one of them said they had not—I said, "Nonsense, there it is lying at your feet; I don't suppose you broke it purposely; it cost 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; if you pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I will pay the rest"—they did not offer to pay for it—I went round to shut up the house, and three of them <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me up in the corner, and held me there—the prisoner picked up the glass, chopped me in the face with it three or four times, and left me for dead—I was all over blood—my nose was cut open to the bone, and ray lip was cut right through—they all ran away—I had not known him before, but I am sure of him—he was brought back in ten or twenty minutes.</p>

The prisoner applied to me for employment—I employed him about two months, and gave him wages—I then told him he had better return to his friends, as there was no person in London I could recommend him to, but be could remain with me till he wrote to his friends to remit him money to take him home—he left one morning before I was up—while he was with me, I missed a yard and a quarter of silk, worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by the pattern, and by its being faded, and marks of the flies on it from being in the window—it is exactly the quantity I missed.</p>

The prisoner was in my service—on Sunday, 6th Oct., I marked eighteen shillings, and gave ten of them to Upton—on the Monday morning I put the other eight shillings in the till, and took the other money out—I left my shop about nine o'clock, leaving the prisoner in charge of it—he could go to the till—I came back about eleven, found Phillips, and took the prisoner out with me, in the cart—I returned in a few minutes, examined the till, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., ten shillings of which were marked—I took the prisoner into the back room, and asked him to turn out the contents of his pockets, and there were six marked shillings there—he begged me to be merciful, and said he would not do it again if I would forgive him.</p>

               <p>placed the money on the table, and I said there were narked shillings, it is very likely he said, "Very likely; but I can explain how they came into my possession"—he said, "I was turning the silver out of the till on to the coun<lb/>ter, and got my money mixed with that <hi rend="italic">Old Jemmy</hi> had brought"—I might have next said, "I do not know what to do, but I have been going back lately"—I do not remember that the prisoner then said, "I can explain the reason to you"—I might have said, upon that, "I am going back very fast"—he did not then say, "I am sorry for it; I have never robbed you of a penny"—I should not like to swear he did not say that—I think he said, "The only wrong thing I have done was to sell goods under cost price, to make the business appear greater"—he did not get a commission on what he sold—I do not know what object he had in doing it, except to hide the deficiency—the constable took up the money, and put it into his pocket—I do not recol<lb/>lect then saying, "I do not know what to do," and the constable saying, "Oh, you had better drive us down in the cart;" after I had decided on giving him into custody, he said so, as it would be less noise; and the prisoner then fell upon his knees, and said, "I hope you are not going to have me locked up; I would rather work my fingers to the bone"—I do not remember his then saying, "I am quite innocent"—the constable did not urge me to give him into custody—he would not have anything to say in the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 5, Conway-court, High-street, Marylebone. I had a brother named James Geary—he died there, in his bed, on Thursday, 20th Sept., at ten minutes after three—he was twenty-eight years old, and was a plaisterer—on Saturday night, 18th Aug., five weeks previous to his death, between twelve and one at night, I saw him in charge of the police by the Angel, in High-street—he was lying on his back, with his head hanging over the kerb-stone; sergeant Bushell, the prisoner, had his hand in his neck-handkerchief, and knelt on his chest—I went to his assistance, to get his head up, and he told me to keep out of the way, and keep out of trouble—he got up by some means, and Bushell and sergeant McRaw pushed him against the railings outside the public-house, and Bushell hit him violently twice on the right thigh and arm with his staff—I did not see that McRaw had a staff; but he was on his right side and Bushell on his left, both holding him—as they took him to the station he received a great many blows about his body from both of them with the staff—I saw McRaw beating him after they left the public-house—I said, "Do not kill him, he is going quietly"—the deceased said, "I am going quietly"—he had no weapon, and I did not see him strike them—he was quite sober when I saw him at eleven o'clock—I followed to the station-door—I did not see him again till next morning, when he was in a very bad state, and said he was all pains and aches—he took to his bed all that day—he got up next day to appear before the Magistrate—I went with him—he was discharged—he complained every day when he got up—he remained at home from his work a fortnight, but did not keep his bed—he had been at work the week previous and up to the very day, and was perfectly healthy up to that time—after that fortnight he went to his work about ten days—he used to come home every evening and complain—after the ten days, he took to his bed and</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased, and live at 5, Conway-court. He was a plasterer—his age was twenty-eight—on a Saturday evening or Sunday morning a man told me something, and I found my husband by the Angel, in the hands of the police—he was lying down in the gutter sink—the prisoner was on the top of him, kneeling on his chest—I said, "What is the matter? don't killthefather of my children"—the prisoner said, "Lock up the b—b—h"—a policeman behind me said, "My dear woman, keep out of trouble; you will get locked up with your husband"—he scrambled up somehow from under them, and then they pulled him along, and used great violence—Bushell stood at his right side with a staff in his hand, and beat him with it on the body, on the right shoulder, and under the right ear, as they went along—he was struck all over his body—he had no weapon—it was while they had hold of him on each side, that Bushell was beating him—my husband said he was going quietly, and what were they knocking him about for?—after that, they continued striking him all along as they went—he went to the station, but a constable kept me back, and said if I went to the station-house door I should be locked up—Morris Geary came up, and saw his brother between two policemen, and saw Bushell hit him, and he said, "Sergeant Eden Bushell, if you knock my brother about, I will see you to-morrow for it"—I cannot say how many yards off be was then, but quite close, four or five yards from him—Bushell did not answer, but two policemen laid hold of Morris and took him prisoner—that was quite close to the station, within a very few yards of my stopping back—I got bail, and got my husband out—I saw him at seven o'clock in the morning—he was very much disfigured—there was blood about him—he bled out of the right ear; no, I think it was</p>

               <p>the left—there was a great swelling of the jaw under the left ear—his left arm was bruised from the wrist to the shoulder, his body and both his legs were bruised, as if he had been kicked, and there were black and blue marks all up his side, his loins, ribs, and his chest, on both sides—on the Sunday he kept his bed all day—the first thing, when he came home, I went with him to Mr. O'Flaberty the surgeon, who gave him some lotion—I stayed with him all the while be was there—he took his coat off, and showed the doctor his chest, neck, and arms—he was going to strip, but the doctor did not want it he did not take his trowsers off—he went home, and went to bed—he got up on Monday morning, about eight o'clock, went to the police-court, and was discharged by the Magistrate on the ground of being ill-used so much—he remained at home for a fortnight afterwards, and complained of his body—for the first week he used to get up in the afternoon, but he used to lay in bed in the morning part—(I live on the first floor front, and my sister in the first-floor back)—I am near my confinement—the second week he got up, but not before eight in the morning—he walked about, but he was not in his usual health—at the end of the fortnight he went to work, as his master did not wish him to lose it—he worked at Mr. Rice's, or Fry's, over the Great Western Railway—after ten days, he came home ill, and took to his bed—on the Friday morning when he got up, and when he was going to work that day, he complained of being very bad—I wanted him to stop at home, but he went to his work—at half-past five I was fetched home from my work to him at eight, and found him in bed complaining of his body—he never left his bed, but died on the 26th, five days after—he continually complained of his body all over, not of any particular parts—he had not caught cold, that I know of—he wished me to fetch the doctor when I went home, and I fetched Mr. O'Flaherty—on the night this happened I had seen him a few minutes to twelve o'clock, he was sober then—during the ten days he was at work he was not out on any evening that I was not with him, because he was not well—prior to these injuries, I never knew him to be in bad health—during the seven years we had been married he never drank anything but beer hardly, and very little—I have four children.</p>

               <p>questions I put to him, I did not think it neccssary to examine those parts—the bruises on the right arm and right side were repeated bruises, rather of a severe character—the blows on the side of his neck did not appear to be so numerous as those on his right arm—on the Sunday evening his wife came to me for a certificate to present to the Magistrate, which I gave—the blow under the ear was dangerous in this respect, that it was inflicted in a very dangerous locality; but the severity of the blows I do not consider greater than those which were inflicted on his arm, in point of the force used to give them—the injuries I observed were such as to incapacitate him from following his work for some days—I gave him an opiate lotion; told him to go home and keep quiet, and to send me wlord if he got no better—I did not see him again until 20th Sept.—I then saw him in bed at his own house, 5, Con way-court—he then complained of a severe pain of the lower angle of the left <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> or blade-bone, and that the pain was increased by breathing—he was feverish—he complained, if I remember rightly, of headache, and of the general symp<lb/>toms attending fever, or an acute attack of illness—he complained of pain at his chest on coughing—I inquired whether he had a cough; I do not remember hearing him cough; I dare say I did not before I asked that question; I did while attending him—I attended him from 20th Sept. till he died, on the 26th; during that time I heard him cough—I examined his chest, and found symptoms of inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pleura,</hi> or investing mem<lb/>brane of the lungs on the left side—I ordered remedies—I inquired of him his other symptoms, and the conclusion I came to, from the examination I made, and from the answers I received to my questions, was, that he had pleurisy of the left side—there was only one symptom absent, namely, spitting of blood, and next morning (the 21st) that also appeared—I did not make any particular examination of his chest or arm on the 20th—I saw no bruises on his body that day; I did not direct my attention to them, nor did I afterwards—the examination I made of his chest was by means of my ear, to ascertain his breathing—I visited him next day; he then complained that the symptoms were rather aggravated—I then bled him, and he was relieved of the pain in his left side—about two days afterwards he complained of pain of the right side—I then re-bled him, and he was partially relieved—I bled him on each occasion with a lancet on the arm; and he also had leeches on the right side, and a blister—I continued to see him day by day, sometimes twice a day—he died on the morning of the 26th Sept.—I did not see him that day, for I had word sent me that he had died early in the morning—I made an examination of the body forty-eight hours after death—my uncle, who is an apothecary, and a friend of mine, an unprofessional man, were present; they are not here—I found the body exceedingly decomposed, so much so as to prevent ray observing any external bruises if there were any—I opened the chest, and found symptoms of inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> of the left lung—the cavity of the chest was filled with water, which is one of the evidences; and there were bands of fibrous lymph, which bound the surface of the lung to the internal side of the cavity of the thorax, which was another evidence—the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> of the right lung was also inflamed, not to the same extent—that examination of the chest satisfied me as to the cause of death—I did not examine the head; I examined the ribs, to ascertain whether any of them had been broken, or whether a point of any broken bone, which often occurs, had penetrated into the chest, and thereby wounded the <hi rend="italic">pleura,</hi> and occa<lb/>sioned the pleurisy; but that I found not to be the case—the immediate cause of death was inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi>—I have heard the evidence to-day as regards the violence he is alleged to have received—supposing it to</p>

               <p>be correct, I do not think that it could have been the direct cause of the inflammation I saw; it might have been the indirect cause—I mean that if he had lain up in bed from the beating he received, and afterwards gone out into the cold and worked, and caught cold, that might have induced pleurisy—I think if be had never gone out at all he might have survived.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person were thrown violently to the ground on his face, and then whilst on the ground, a man of the size of the prisoner knelt on his chest and stomach with violence, might that produce the inflammation you saw, coupled with other injuries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think if such violence as that were used some of the ribs would be fractured before the inflammation could result—I believe the inflammation to have been the result of cold—I am of opinion that the injuries he is said to have received bad nothing directly to do with his death—they might have induced a certain condition of body which would render him more susceptible of cold—such injuries have a depressing effect on the general system.</p>

               <p>collar, and drew him off, on which Bushell got up, and complained of the man having done violence to him—he then took him by the collar, and pushed him through the court into Paradise-street—he there began to be rather violent, struggling, kicking, and plunging—he threw himself down—Bushell asked me for a rattle—I said I had not got one to give him—we got the man into High-street where a crowd was collecting, and he became very violent, and struck and kicked us both—I had several falls—he put his legs out, and threw us both down several times—when we got towards Mary-le-bone-lane some persons came behind me and struck me a blow on the head, and at the same time some persons untied the deceased's handkerchief—he said no two b——s in the police force should take him to the station, and immediately put his hand in my stock and very nearly choked me—I called out for somebody's staff—one was supplied to me, and I struck him over the arm until he released my throat—I was then on the left side of him—somebody in the crowd struck Bushell—I have an idea who it was, but should not like to swear it—the deceased had hold of Bushell by the throat, and put his hand in his stock—Bushell cried out, and I struck the deceased on the arm once or twice before he released him—there were several persons about who were very violent—we got as far as Wigmore-street, when the deceased's associates were setting the mob against us and ill-using us, when there was a chance—the crowd increased, a brother of the deceased came up, and called out, "Bushell, you b——r, you shall pay for this another day," and seized Bushell by the collar and tore his coat—he called out for one of the constables to take him into custody, and Blaxton took him—during all the time, he struck and kicked, I do not know how many times, both me and Bushell—next day they were brought before a Magistrate, Morris was discharged and fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I should have done so; but I was not asked; I could not force my evidence on the Coroner—nobody had informed me that Bushell was charged with causing the death—the inquest was to know what was the cause of the man's death—I was not present at the examination of the witnesses—I heard of the verdict of manslaughter, and told this story to the solicitor, but to no one else—this is the first time I have been called upon for it—the Commissioners made an inquiry previous to the Coroner's verdict—I did not give evidence to them—we were called upon for a report—Gearey made a complaint against Bushell and myself—we both reported—I have not got the report, the Commissioners have it—Bushell did not strike the deceased in my presence—he could have struck him out of my presence, as I was on the ground, a dozen times, between Grotto-passage and the station—Bushell is a bigger and stronger man than me—he was thrown</p>

On Sunday night, 18th Aug., between a quarter and half-past one o'clock, I was on duty in High-street, Manchester-square, and heard cries of distress—I concluded from the voice that they came from Bushell—I have known him about eight months—I hastened to the spot, got some distance from Thayer-street, near the Angel, and saw Bushell, M'Raw, and the deceased, struggling on the ground together—the deceased was trying all he could to keep them down, and to get on top of them—he was kicking and struggling—he had the advantage at that time—he had one hand in Bushell's neck, and with the other he had got hold of M'Raw in a similar way, and was kicking at both as violently as possible—the two females were there, trying as much as possible to excite the deceased to further violence—they surrounded him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jim,</hi> kill the b——s if you can; give it to them"—they both said so—I assisted in clearing back the two females and an oldish man who was there, for the sergeants to get up—they got up—the deceased got very violent, kicking the sergeants, and trying to throw them up—he caught hold of them, one with each hand—Bushell drew his staff, and told him if he did not go quietly he should use it—M'Raw asked for a staff, as he would not let go of his collar—I gave him mine, and he struck the deceased across the right arm, which loosened his hold—they walked on towards Tbayer-street, where we met the deceased's brother, Morris, who sprang at Sergeant Bushell, and took him by the collar—when the decased saw that, he said, "Now no two b——y policemen shall take me to the station, and I don't care a b——r for the best man in the police"—I pushed Morris away—Bushell's collar was torn quite away—we proceeded towards the station till we got to the corner of Wentworth-street,</p>

I gave him directions to go to Mr. Jones, my lighter<lb/>man, at Horsleydown, and take twenty-two quarters of oats to a customer of mine at Notting-hill—that would be forty-four sacks—I never knew Bodding<lb/>ton, nor had any dealings with him, nor authorized any persons in my employ to have dealings with him—on 11th Oct. I was sent for to the Westminster Police-court, and this sack of oats was shown to me—these sacks were new to me; they had originally been hop-saekt, and I had them turned into corn<lb/>sacks—I gave Bowden twenty of them the night before—the valve of these oats is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they are Archangel oats—this is my sack.</p>

On 11th Oct., about twelve o'clock, I was on duty, and saw Bowden with a wagon near Westminster Abbey, going towards the Horseferry-road, in an opposite direction to Notting-hill—I followed him about half a mile—he stopped at the corner of Peter-street, about fifty or sixty yards from Boddington's—he left the wagon there, and went to Boddington's shop—the wagon was out of sight of the shop—Bod<lb/>dington is a baker, and deals in corn—Bowden stopped there two or three minutes—he came out and took a sack of corn off the wagon, and ran with it to Boddington's shop—I was obliged to run to keep op with him—he went directly through the shop—there is a loft at the back to which you go up by a ladder—I followed Bowden—Boddington was up in the loft; I had known him for eight or nine years—when Bowden was at the bottom of the ladder Boddington said, "Bring it up here"—I went to the bottom of the ladder and I could see them both—when Bowden got up, Boddington said, "Put it down here," and he caught hold of the sack to help it off his shoulders—I heard Boddington say something which I did not distinctly hear—I heard the words "much" and "last"—I thought he said, "I cannot give you so much" for this as for the last"—I went up and the sack was on the floor—I consider that Bowden saw me before I got op, because his face was towards me; he saw me when I got up at all events, but Boddington's back was towards me—I asked Bowden, who authorized him to bring the sack of corn there—he said no one; that he ought to have taken it to Notting-hill—I told him I should take him into custody for stealing it, and Boddington for receiving it knowing it to be stolen—I said, "I have seen that game going on for some time"—I had seen the cart stop there before, and Bowden go to Boddington's, and bring out empty sacks, and I have seen Boddington and him coming out of public-houses—when I told Boddingtou I should take him for receiving it knowing it to be stolen, he said he had not received it—I said, "You have; I heard the conversation"—he said no more—I took them both—I afterwards took the delivery notes from Bowden—there were forty-three sacks of oats in the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 100). On 12th Oct. I was on duty about one o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner—he was alone—he came from the upper end of Dury-lane, and turned down Great Wild-street—I went and asked him what he had in his bundle—he said he was going to the smith's shop in Wild-court, and he did not know what it was—I said I must take him to the station—he gave the name of John Smith, and said he worked for Mr. Allen, in Long Acre, and had brought these things from there—he said he did not know the name of the street where the workshop was, but he should be able to point it out—I went with him, and he went by Mr. Allen's several times, and did not know which it was—I examined his bundle, and found a large metal box, and these things in it—I showed them to the prosecutor, and he identified them—this pair of pincers was in the prisoner's pocket—this pair of shoes was in his pocket; be pulled them out, and placed them under the seat—I found these two keys on him.</p>

On Saturday morning, 12th Oct., I examined the prosecutor's premises—the workshop had been entered from the water-closet—there is a space quite sufficient for any one to get through, and I found the dust had been beaten off from the joints—the door of the shop is fastened by bolts and a bar—the inner door, which leads from the workshop, had a screw taken from the box of the lock—the screw was on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter of languages, and live at 15, Alfred-terrace, in the hamlet of Ratcliff. On Sunday, 29th Sept., about half-past three or four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by the police—I went to an aviary in my yard, and found it burst open, and thirty-four pigeons gone; two of them came back next day—I had seen them safe about ten or half-past on the Saturday night—I afterwards saw two of them in the possession of the police—the aviary is enclosed by the same wall as the house—I occupy it with the house—it was not locked, bat the top part which opens down was pegged and solidly fastened, so that the pigeons could not get out of themselves.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 234). On Sunday morning, 29th Sept., about two o'clock, my attention was attracted by a noise under one of the railway arches which runs abreast of the prosecutor's garden-wall—I went and threw my light on, and then saw the prisoner coming from the top of the prosecutor's garden-wall—directly he saw me he took to his heels and ran as fast as he could through several different streets—I pursued him till I was nearly exhausted—I came up to Mercer, and called to him to follow him—he was afterwards brought back in the custody of a constable named Bull—I am quite positive the prisoner is the man I saw dropping from the wall.</p>

On the morning of 29th Sept., I saw Taplin running after the prisoner, springing his rattle, and his light turned on—I ran towards the prisoner, and he turned down Joseph-street—I saw him drop two pigeons from his left breast, apparently from under his coat—I think it was the same he has on now—I lost sight of him for three or four minutes, and then saw him again in custody of another constable—I am positive he is the man I ran after first, and who dropped the pigeons—I had seen him before, and knew him—he dropped the pigeons in the street, and after he was in custody I went back and picked them up—their wings were broken, and their feathers very much tossed about by being crumpled up in his chest, to that they could not fly—I found them where he had thrown them down.</p>

On Friday night, Aug. 2nd, I was returning home from Chelsea—the clock struck twelve as I passed through St. James's-park—I should say it was a quarter-past when I got to Long-acre—as I passed Rose-street (on the right side of Long-acre as you come from St. Martin Vlane), I felt both my arms pinned from behind—I had a roll of drawings three feet long in one hand, and a walking-stick in the other—at the same instant I was faced by another person, and a third appeared at my left side, at least I guess it was a third—I then saw the prisoner standing with what I thought was a walking-stick—he came up to me on my right, and immediately a machine was put round my neck from the right side, I have no doubt, by the prisoner—I had had a full view of him by the light of the lamp, waiting to put this infernal machine round my neck—I was completely strangled—my coat was unbuttoned, and ray waistcoat pockets were torn—this eye-glass was taken from my pocket, and the word "Eye-glass" was mentioned by one of the men—I was still standing up—all sensation left me, and I was dead to all intents and purposes by strangulation—I have every reason to believe that at that moment some alarm was given, for I was loosened and dashed on the kerb-stone, by which one of my teeth was broken out, and my chin was very severely fractured—on recovering, I saw one man at a distance—I think he did not know the passage out, and could not get away without passing me—I chased him about a quarter of a mile, but the pressure which had been on my throat disabled me from calling out, and I lost him—I met a policeman, and proceeded to Bow-street station—I arrived there at twenty minutes past twelve, and made a complaint—I am enabled to speak to the prisoner, by the gas-light behind me shining directly on his face—I did not describe him that night, but next morning I wrote to Scotland-yard—I saw him again at the Mansion-house, about two months afterwards—I did not know he was in custody; I saw him by chance at the bar among other persons—I went there because I heard a person had been taken into custody—the other persons were close by—I cannot say whether it was the bar—before I recognised him, I had a communication with Haydon, one of the detective-police—he did not point the prisoner out—on my solemn oath I have not the least doubt he is the man—I saw a flexible walking-stick at the station, with a life-preserver at the end of it—by putting the two ends together when round a man's neck,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185010210120"/>
               <p>and twisting them, strangulation would immediately take place—I believe it was an instrument of this kind that was applied to my neck.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gave no description of the person to the police, either that night or next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had not been at the Mansion House a moment before I recognized him—the next time he was brought up, was on my charge—I was not with Haydon when I recognized him—on the night this happened I had been to King's-road, Chelsea—I supped there—I had dined at home—I believe I took a small glass of brandy and water at supper—I think I may say I did not take more than one glass, but could not pledge my oath now—the man I chased, was in front of me; when I got up, I chased him into Hart-street, Covent-garden, through the courts, which are very intricate, and there lost him—I saw the prisoner immediately upon being pinioned—I could not recognize the man who pinioned me—the street-lamp was behind me, eight or ten yards off—it is in the centre of, and lights up the underneath part of the archway, which is the entry to Rose-street—this was not five minutes taking place—it was more than a minute—the man who faced me came suddenly upon me, which prevented my seeing his face, and my attention was called to the face of the prisoner, and fixed upon it—I saw the prisoner immediately I was pinioned, and before I saw the man who faced me; I should fancy I was insensible two or three minutes—the whole of it did not occupy five minutes, it was done very cleverly indeed, nothing could be done better—there were a great many people at the Mansion-house—I did not see the bar at that time—I was never there before—I went there expecting to see the man who had treated me in this way—I described the prisoner, on the night previous to my seeing him, to Haydon—I had read no description of him in the papers then—I had read in the papers about Mr. Cure ton's case, in Aldersgate-street—that was before I gave the description—Haydon came to my house, in conse<lb/>quence of a card which I left in the City about the middle of Sept., before I went into the country—the prisoner's hat was put on him at the Mansion-house, at my suggestion—Haydon was not standing by him when I first saw him, or when I charged him with being the person who assaulted me—he was removed from the bar to the lock-up, and then I went and saw Haydon, and told him he was the man—that was after I had ordered his hat to be put on, and not five minutes after I first saw him.</p>

A.</hi> I should say it was—I saw it at the station—it might be a week or a fortnight after I had read the account of Mr. Cureton's case that I went into the country—I was suffering very much from this attack, and am now—I had no communication with any one about this, till the evening before I went to the Mansion-house—I am quite certain Haydon had not described the person who was in custody, before I described the prisoner to him, nor had any one else—there was nothing at the Mansion-house in my view to distinguish the prisoner from those by whom he was surrounded—I did not look at him a second before I made up my mind it was him—the man wore a had on that night, and I had the prisoner's hat put on, to see if I could recognize him in a hat as well as without one—I had no doubt about him before it was put on.</p>

I took the prisoner on another charge—I had then no knowledge of Mr. Miller or his address; I obtained it on 6th Oct.—I went to his house, and he described the person by whom he had been attacked—I had not described any person to him who was in custody—he came next day to the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was the other man? <hi rend="italic">A.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 10, Little Carlisle-street. On 23rd Sept. I went out to see a friend in Cato-street, who had come from America—between four and five o'clock in the morning the prisoner invited me to his room in Edward's-place, near Cato-street, to have some beer—I had one glass—a man named Deeley was in the room—he did something which made the prisoner tell him to go out of the room, and he said if he did not go out he would strike him with a bar of iron—he and the prisoner went but</p>

About half-past six o'clock, on the morning of 23rd Sept., Hayes was brought to me—he was apparently labouring under concussion—there was a severe scalp wound about an inch and a half long, and down to the bone—one of the arteries was divided—I had considerable difficulty in stopping the haemorrhage—I attended him for about three weeks; he was confined to his bed during that time—symptoms of erysipelas showed themselves—a bar of iron would be likely to produce such a wound.</p>

On 25th Sept. I had to be there early in the morning to see my father—I saw Harrington come at twenty minutes or half-past seven—he began making some stoppers out of No. 1 pot—I gathered the metal up for him—there is what is called a chair by the pot—it is a sort of large bench with two arms to it—as he made the stoppers he knocked them under the front of the chair—there is an annealing oven where they put them till they get cold—he worked till about five minutes before eight—he then went to his other work—he told me to put the tools down on the front of the chair—he worked at them again for five or ten minutes after breakfast, and again when he had got time—I saw Pardoe there; he was finishing off work two or three yards from No. 1 pot—I did not see him talk to Harrington in the course of the day—he was near enough to see what Harrington was doing—in the course of the day Hir<lb/>rington called me on one side, and told me if I saw any of the masters come up the yard to give a whistle—I do not know how many stoppers he made, nor what became of them—I gathered the metal for him, up to eight o'clock—nobody did it for him afterwards—it is usual to have a boy to gather it.</p>

On Saturday morning, 5th Oct., in consequence of infor<lb/>mation, I came down to my back-parlour about eight o'clock, and found the window open, and the forks and spoons were gone—they were mine, and were usually kept in the cupboard in the room—the prisoner was in my service seven or eight years, and for a short time since I have been in that house—he was scarcely doing anything there but looking after the children, and working a little in the garden—that back-parlour window has box shutters inside which lift up; a board goes under the bottom one, which keeps it up, and the sash is fastened by a hasp—it was the duty of one of the servants to fasten that sash—if the sash were open any one could, from the outside, dis<lb/>place the wooden fastening and get in—I believe the sash was usually fastened at night—the prisoner entered my service in Van Dieman's Land; he had been a convict.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman. On 28th Sept. I was in a boat with some friends, and had a leg of mutton in the bottom of the boat—I came ashore at Westminster-bridge, at ten minutes to two o'clock in the day—I went to the Red Lion tavern for twenty minutes, returned and saw the prisoner sitting in my boat throwing some muscles belonging to me into the river—I forced him out, and missed the mutton—he said he knew nothing of it—I fetched a constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The place he was in is just like a watchman's box; three gen<lb/>tlemen said I was nothing like the man; I was set by myself, and you were brought in, and said, "This is the man." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I went to the station, knew him, and pointed him out directly—they did not point him out to me—they said nothing, whether he was a prisoner or anything of the sort—the shorter one's name is Baker; I believe he is now in Brixton gaol for picking pockets—the butter was found concealed under some hay, down the same turning I had seen them go.</p>

I was alone in the house; and about five o'clock a very dark man came and leaned over the gate—I was at the bed<lb/>room window, and he said, "Is this No. 3?"—I said, "No; it is on the left hand"—he went that way, but I cannot say whether he went in—he came back, and said, "I have made a mistake; is not this Mr. Stiff's?"—I said, "Yes, sir, it is; what do you please to want?"—he said, "There is a person you know, nigh Fleet-street, has met with an accident, in getting out of an omnibus, she fell on her head"—he did not tell me who the person was—I should not know him again, it was not either of the prisoners—he said, "You are to take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> directly"—I locked up the house, and every place I could think of, took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at Brixton Church, and went to 334, Strand, the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Times</hi> Office, where my sister was—I saw her directly I got there, and, as far as I could ascertain, no accident had happened to her—I returned with her and the porter, in the same <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> to Brixton—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> first, and saw a light in my bedroom—the porter then got out, got two or three men, got a ladder, and got in at the window—he opened the front door, and I went in, went to my bedroom, and saw a light on the floor against the window—there are no shutters—I missed a fur coat from the passage, which I had seen safe at five o'clock, when I went out—from the parlour I missed the cruet-stand; and the silver tops, the top of the mustard-pot, and two pep<lb/>per boxes, were wrenched off—the lid of the piano was wrenched open, and Mr. Stiff's gold box taken out from there, where he usually kept it—I went to my bedroom, and missed 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold from a drawer, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, belonging to me; and another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in a red bag, and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence, belonging to me; and a silver watch</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer to Mr. Stiff. Taylor was in his employ at the time this happened, and Costello was so about three months before—Taylor worked at the printing-office at Brixton, about 300 yards from the dwelling-house—two or three weeks or a month before the robbery, Taylor told me he had put Costello <hi rend="italic">on to</hi> Mr. Martin's—Mr. Martin is Mr. Stiff's foreman—the day after that, he told me that they were disturbed by a cat, and all cats ought to be stuck with a knife—about a week before this robbery, he told me he should put Costello <hi rend="italic">on to</hi> Mr. Stiff's—he said he went, and tried the key to the lock in the Strand, and had not a key big enough; but Costello had—on the night this robbery happened, we left work at five o'clock, and Taylor went away—he said he was going to the Crown and Sceptre, and would wait for us—the rest stopped till about a quarter to six—I then went to the Crown and Sceptre, about thirty yards off, and saw Taylor there—we had some porter, and stayed till about half-past six—Taylor then went down Brixton<lb/>hill with his father—I heard of the robbery next morning, and recollect a man named Haydon telling Taylor that Mr. Stiff had had his house broken open—Taylor laughed, and nodded his head, and turned quite red—the same morning Taylor told me he was going to Drury-lane to get his <hi rend="italic">whack</hi> of the money—the same evening he came to me, and said, "Be on your guard; you will have the <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> on you all down the road"—I did not exactly know what he meant, and said, "I have nothing to fear or care"—I have heard him say that <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> means "policemen"—he said he should disguise himself, and take the other road; and before he went I saw him tie a handkerchief round his neck, which was contrary to his usual dress—it went round twice, and came over his chin—I did not make any communication to Mr. Martin of Mr. Stiff—I thought he was joking.</p>

I shan't tell you now, but to-morrow very likely you will hear"—there was another man two or three yards off, leaning against the fence, and Adams walked off with him down Streatham-place, and I went on to Streatham—I could not be positive who the other man was, but to the best of my belief it was Gosling.</p>

               <p>Hardy through St. Mary's-square, where he ran nearly close to the garden—there is an iron railing separating the square from the garden—when he was opposite the garden I saw him put his right arm, which was next the rail<lb/>ing, up towards the railing near the gate—I was twenty or thirty yards from him, and continued to pursue him, calling, "Stop thief!"—he ran into Walcot-square, where I came up to him and found him in Edgar's custody, and Taylor came up at the same moment—I have not the slightest doubt he was the same person I had first seen and pursued—I directed them to take charge of him—I went round Bird-street, and found Smith in Garforth's custody—he had hold of him with his left hand, and had some clothes in his right—I took Smith to where I had left Hardy, and took them to the station—I found two coats on Smith over his own, and in his coat-pocket a teles<lb/>cope, a black silk waistcoat, and in his trowsers-pocket a blue silk hand<lb/>kerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the inspector on duty asked Hardy his address, and he gave 5, Martyn-street, Friar-street, Blackfriars-road—I know that he lived at 63, Webber-street, which is five or six minutes walk from the address he gave—about one o'clock the same morning I went to Webber-street, examined the front parlour where I had frequently seen Hardy, and in a drawer there I found these two pair of pliers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have seen such in the possession of house-breakers—they are used for opening locks from the outside without noise—if a key is left inside in the lock, and the door closed, by inserting one of these in the key hole, and taking hold of the protruding part yon can turn the key—I also found six keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), two of which have been partly filed—here is another key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with a black composition on one side of it, which by turning it in a door would take an impression of the wards of the lock, and so enable another key to be made or part of this one filed off so as to make it fit—Mrs. Higgins's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth.</p>
