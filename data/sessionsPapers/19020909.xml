I am an inspector of postmen at Woolwich—until July 28th the prisoner was employed at the Woolwich office—a letter posted at Woolwich about 8.30 p.m. on July 21st, addressed to G. Stoddart, Middleburgh, Holland, would reach our office about midnight and leave at 2.25 a.m.—before leaving it would be sorted—the prisoner would come on duty as postman at the sorting office at 11.10 p.m., and would leave at 2.25 a.m.—he would be stamping the letters, and would have access to the letters lying there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There would be four men stamping, and about eleven there as postmen.</p>

I am an assistant in the Confidential Inquiry Office at the Post Office—I kept observation on the prisoner on July 28th about 10.30 I saw him leave his house at 8, Nyanza Street, Plumstead—he took the train to Greenwich—he went into a post office there and changed a postal order for 20s.—he wrote T.

I am a constable attached to the Post Office—on July 28th I saw the prisoner, I told him I was a police constable and was going to search him, and I did so at the Post Office—taking out his pocket handkerchief I shook it, and from its folds a 20s. order dropped on to the table—at first he denied all knowledge of it, but eventually said he had picked it up in the Slade with the other which he had been seen to cash—I went to his house in Nyanza Street—in a pocket-book in a uniform overcoat I found a postal order for 1s. and four others in his bedroom, one of them for 2s.—there were also some stamps which had the appear<lb/>ance of having been re-gummed—all the postal orders were crossed and made payable to Stoddart, and in the pocket where I found them there was also a quantity of 2 1/2 d. stamps which had undoubtedly been torn off letters—among the orders was the one for 2s. and with two 1 1/2 d. stamps on it—the writing on the 1s. order and that on an envelope addressed to Stoddart was the same—I gave the things to Mr. Pile, and the prisoner was charged with stealing the orders.</p>

I am a clerk in the General Post Office—I gave certain instructions with regard to the prisoner—I saw him on July 28th, the orders were then in my possession—I cautioned the prisoner and said—"These orders have been found at your house, do you wish to give any explanation of your possession of them,"he said "They are what I send away every week to Stoddart; I bought them."I said, "Who wrote on them,"he said, "A friend of mine, he is now in South Africa,"he at once corrected that and said, "I wrote on them, that was a mistake on my part."I think the writing on all the orders is the same, but disguised—I asked him about the stamps, and he said, "They are what I have put on and not sent away."</p>

               <p>reply to the charge—on July 29th, he was taken to the inquest on the body of the deceased, and on the way back to the police court he said, "I owed the old girl £16, but I have made a statement up above about it"—those are his exact words—I did not question him about that, because he seemed as if he did not want to say anything more about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practioner of 273, Cable Street—about 9.30 on July 23rd, I was called by Mrs. Padwick to 131, Cornwall Street—I went to a room on the ground floor, and found the deceased lying on the floor—she was quite dead, the body had a chemise on: around the lower part were the bedclothes—it was lying alongside the bed with the head towards the window—I placed the body on the bed—I saw blood on the chemise and bed clothes; blood had been issuing from the nose, and there was a clot on the floor beneath the neck—I should think she had been dead about an hour, parts of the body were warm—next day I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the body was that of a strongly-built well-developed woman, the organs were fairly healthy, with the exception of a slight fatty degeneration of the heart—I found five wounds, one a stab over the region of the heart in the second intercostal space, with a bruise outside it, the stab being some 3 1/2 inches deep—I came to the con<lb/>clusion that that was the first injury which had been inflicted—I think the cause of death was shock, occasioned by that stab—the second wound was upon the right side of the neck, between the lobe of the ear and the joint between the breast and collar bones, two inches deep; it wounded the external jugular vein—the third wound was on the right shoulder blade 2 3/4 inches deep; the fourth on the right side, and wounded the right lung slightly, passed the fifth rib and slightly wounded the liver, it was 3 1/2 inches deep—the fifth wound was in the seventh intercostal space on the right side, and in the diaphragm, and about four inches deep—those wounds could have been inflicted by this knife, and must have been inflicted with very great violence indeed; there was a cut in the chemise—I did not examine the bed-clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Death would follow almost immediately after the wound in the heart: the other wounds would have been entirely unnecessary.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">GRANT</hi>. The prisoner's clothing was handed to me for examination, on his trousers I found a woman's hair, and similar in colour to the deceased's—I found a stain on the shirt button, and came to the conclusion that it was blood, and there had been an attempt to wash away blood from the upper part of the waistcoat—I found blood in the nail slit of the knife blade—I examined the bed clothes which were round the deceased—there were holes in them; very great violence must have been used; the injuries were deeper than the length of the knife—I think she was asleep when she was stabbed—I think she rolled over or her side, then received the other blows, and probably completed the turn and rolled on to the floor—if she had been awake, she would have made an effort to defend her<lb/>self, her hands were not cut, but were covered with blood—I presume she placed her hand over the first wound inflicted.</p>

I would not do anything—he absolutely denied taking the book—I said, "I suppose you admit taking the withdrawal form?"—he said "No; I never took the withdrawal form"—soon after he admitted seeing the with<lb/>drawal form, and said, "I didn't understand what you said just now about the withdrawal form; I didn't take it"—I said, "What did you want to sneak out so early in the morning for?"—he said.

The next thing I recollect is being in a room at Commercial Street Police Station with three or four. I recollect Inspector Divall as one, that is all I know about it."</p>

I practice at 19, Queen Ann Street, Cavendish Square—I am an M.D., M.R.C.S., and L.S.A.—I have practised as obstetric physician for nearly forty years—I am consulting physician to the Farringdon Dis<lb/>pensary and Lying-in Hospital—I examined the prisoner with reference to her mental condition on September 3rd, at Holloway Prison, with Dr. John<lb/>son—I think now that she is suffering from melancholia, and that probably her mental condition is very much improved since she has been in prison, and is recovering—I do not think any reliance can be placed on any state<lb/>ments she made—she said she had drowned the children, that she could not remember which she drowned first; that she had no recollection of taking the children out of the water; that she had no idea how they got into bed, or who dried them—if she could have remembered the one condition of things I think she could have remembered all—her condition arose from puerperal mania, it appears that her labours were very bad, and that she fainted three times during them when the last child was born.</p>

I should not have been surprised if she had drowned the children, having regard to her condition—I have read the post-mortem report—undoubtedly the elder child died by drowning—with regard to the younger child, there is a doubt—I think it was suffering from catarrh of the bowels, and it probably had diarrhoea—if there was no report as to drowning I should have said it had died from diarrhoea.</p>

I practise at Lower Edmonton, and am an M.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P.—I first saw the prisoner about the first week in April—I advised her to go away for a change—on July 25th I met her at my gate—she asked me to go to her house—I went shortly afterwards—I met Dr. Barton there—I did not hear what she said to him—I have examined her in Holloway—I should not place any great reliance upon any statements she made.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to obtain<lb/>ing fifteen pairs of boots by false pretences from John Carter and Sons—I have been employed by Mr. Green as shorthand clerk and book-keeper for nearly four years—I have known Puttock about eighteen months—I first made his acquaintance by selling him a second-hand pair of hoots—he then found out that I was in the boot trade, and asked me if I could get him some, boots cheap—I said I thought I could, and three days afterwards I took him some new boots—I cannot say exactly what price he gave me for them, but it would be about half the wholesale price—I had obtained them by false pretences—I said nothing with regard to them on the first two or three transactions, but later I told him they had not been got honestly as he ought to know by the price he was paying for them—altogether I took him about £150 worth—when I went to Puttock's shop I sometimes saw a workman, there—I used to hand Puttock the boots in the back parlour, but on no occasion did I give him a receipt—the five receipts produced are in my writing, but I gave him these all on one occasion—he told me that he was going to insure against burglary, and that the insurance company would want to see the receipts, therefore would I give him some—he produced, the paper and I wrote out the five produced all at the same time—the receipts do not represent the prices he gave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The police did not ask me to give evidence—I do not admit being a forger, because I had authority to sign Mr. Green's name—I cannot be certain as to the exact number of receipts I gave Puttock—I had about twenty or thirty private customers for the boots, but nobody else in the trade besides Puttock—there was a notice in Puttock's shop, "Second-hand boots bought"—I cannot say exactly where it hung—it was not in a frame—I am confident the price paid by Puttock was only half the wholesale price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I was arrested on August 12th I made the same statement to the police as I had previously made to Mr. Green.</p>

I am a boot and shoe repairer, of 3, Middlesex Wharf, Lea Bridge Road, Clapton—I was in Puttock's employ from the end of last December to last March at his shop, 162, Lonsdale Road—while there I often saw Flynn come to the shop—I recognise him because he talks through his nose—he came as often as three or four times a week—he often brought parcels wrapped up in brown paper—he sometimes came with a parcel and sometimes without—when he brought a parcel he used to hold it down low, so that I should not see it, and take it into the shop parlour to Puttock—on one occasion Puttock took a boot from the window and showed it to Flynn, and said, "Have you got a No. 8 size like that"—as a rule I could not hear the conversation because I was working at my bench.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employ of Messrs. John Carter and Sons, and reside at 86, Shrubland Road, Dalston—I went with the police to Puttock's shop in Lonsdale Road, where I saw him—fifty-one pairs of boots were found in the shop belonging to Messrs. Carter—sixteen pairs were in the window, and thirty-five pairs were in the shop parlour—those in the parlour were in boxes, but those in the window were exposed for show—they were all new—they were not travellers' samples, because the recognised size in the trade for samples is 7, and these boots ranged from sizes 5 to 10, which is the whole range of men's sizes—I frequently passed his shop and saw the boots in the window—boots which were sold at 5s. 1d. wholesale were marked at 5s. 6d.; one pair sold by our firm at 8s. 6d. was marked 8s. 6d.; and another pair sold by our firm at 10s. 6d. was marked 8s. 6d.</p>

Carter have various kinds of customers, including tally men—travellers are not allowed to take out job lots, and sell them at cheap prices—sizes 8 and 9 would be sold at the same price as 7's—when I went to Puttock's shop with the police he did say that he had seen me looking into his window several times—I do not think he knew where I was employed.</p>

I arrested Flynn on August 12th, and on the way to the station he made a statement to me—on the 13th I went with Mr. Hazeltine to 162, Lonsdale Road, where I saw Puttock—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I do not know anyone of the name of Flynn: I have not bought any boots of Carter; I bought some travellers' samples for which I have a receipt"—he produced one receipt, and I asked him if that was the only receipt he had—he said, "I have some more, but I cannot find them"—I searched the place, and found sixteen pairs of boots in the window, and thirty-five pairs, which Mr. Hazeltine identified as belonging to Messrs. Carter, in the parlour—I then took Puttock to the police station, where he handed me four other receipts—he said, "About five months ago a man, whom I did not know, came into my shop and asked me if I bought second-hand boots; I said 'Yes,' and bought a pair of him which he had in his hand. A few days afterwards he came in and said that he had some travellers' samples to sell; would I buy them. I said, 'Yes, if the price is reasonable.-' The next day he brought some in; I think it was four pairs. He asked me a reasonable price, and I bought them, and got a receipt for them. I have seen him about once every week since, and bought boots of him which he represented as a job <hi rend="italic">line</hi> and samples. I have not seen the man since last Saturday week, when he borrowed 6s. of me"—he then said, "What sort of a man is this Flynn?"—I described Flynn to him, and he said, "Yes, that is the man"—the next day at the police court he said, "How did this man Flynn get the boots; did he go to Carter's and fetch them, and say they were for his governor?"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Puttock made no attempt to conceal anything in the shop—I do not think there were a dozen pairs of boots in the place beside these fifty-one pairs.</p>

Forgive me if I have caused you pain, but I love you and always shall love you—your little Mora."]—I made an appointment and met him on Friday, July 11th, when there was a repetition of the interview at Shepherds Bush—I met him again the following day, Saturday, for him to give me my money which he had and which he promised to do on the Friday—on Saturday he promised to give it me on the Sunday—I arranged for him to come to 524, Oxford Street, for that purpose, and he said that if I would not go out he would say good-bye to me for good there—on Sunday afternoon, July 13th, I was at home alone—he came between 6 and 7 p.m.—I saw him in the street opposite the house—I went down and opened the door for him—I invited him to come over—he crossed the road and came into the house—he asked me whether I was alone—I said, "I am alone, my brother and sister-in-law are away, but they will be back soon."—he walked in before me—we went up to the front room on the first floor, and talked in the reception room about the business in the house—then we went on the second floor where the work was done—I showed him the premises, the workshop, and so on, and afterwards we went to my bedroom on the third floor and sat down—he implored me to accompany him back to Italy—I said, "I have taken my resolution and determined not to go away, not to come with you"—when he saw that I would not go abroad with him he invited me to come to his room in Dean Street, then he would write from his room to my brother and sister-in-law and tell them that I was living with him—I said I would not—he produced a packet of letters wrapped in green paper, and a letter outside the parcel in an envelope—he said, This letter is addressed to your brother"—I said to him, ""What is that letter?"—he showed it to me, and said, "I am going to read it to you"—I said. "No, I want to read it myself, because you won't read what is actually written—he did not consent to that—I tried to take it in order to read it—I succeeded in taking the parcel of letters—then he re-took them—a part of this letter remained in my hand—when he had re-taken the letters I tried to get possession of them again, and when he succeeded in getting the letter he tore it to pieces—here are the fragments (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is addressed to my brother—he threw the pieces by the window of the back room—it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Monsieur Jean—For three years we have not been able to separate.

               <p>"I cannot make it go; wait, I cannot make it work"—then I left—I went to the first floor, turning round all the while, because I was afraid he would be after me—I wanted to write some words to my brother saying that I had been murdered, I thought I was going to die—I went to the front room on the first floor—I wrote this in the reception room, "A coward and a villain"—I was bleeding (<hi rend="italic">The paper was produced smeared with blood.</hi>)—while I was writing I suffered an intollerable thirst; I wanted to go down to the kitchen to drink some water, but heard a noise at the door and opened it, and saw the police—I sat on the stairs and made a sign to them to go upstairs—I was taken to the hospital and put to bed—I felt something slipping down the back of my neck and found this bullet—this is the prisoner's writing, "July 10th—Dearest Brother,—I have spoken to my girl to-day, and as I cannot make her mine we have resolved on suicide, which should take place on Sunday at her house, she not being willing to die in my room, so at her earnest request I accepted the proposal"—that is not true—(<hi rend="italic">The letter also asked the brother to take possession of his personal property.</hi>)</p>

I live at No. 17, High Street, Bloomsbury—I am employed at the Savoy Theatre as a scene-shifter—on July 14th I left the theatre at about 11.45, and walked home through West Street—as I went along, this hammer-head (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) fell between my legs—I stooped to pick it up, when Lambert came up to me with twelve or fourteen others</p>

               <p>—he took the hammer-head out of my hand and hit me a tremendous blow on the jaw with it, which nearly rendered me insensible—while on the ground I saw Lambert standing over me, and I begged for mercy—someone called out "<hi rend="italic">Out</hi> him the bastard,"and Lambert gave me another blow on my face—I staggered up, and Wall hit me under my right ear, knocking me down again—they then made off—Mr. Heritage came to my assistance, and I followed the prisoners to Cambridge Circus—I do not know where the other men went to—I pointed out Lambert to Free-stone, who arrested him—while I was talking to the constable Wall hit me on my right eye with his fist and ran away—he was afterwards arrested—I was taken to Charing Cross Hospital suffering from a broken jaw, and remained an in-patient for a fortnight—I attended as an out-patient for a month after—I had never seen either of the prisoners before.</p>

I am employed in the showroom of Nicole Frere at Ely place—on July 19th, the prisoner Herbert, who gave the name of Dr. Goldie, of Fair Oaks, Salisbury, came and said he wanted two musical boxes for his niece to choose one from—I showed him some and he took two away—he was most peculiarly and shabbily dressed, wearing rather dark glasses like these produced—he wore a very old summer overcoat, very old patent leather boots, and a black and white muffler round his neck—he said he wore the glasses because the light was too strong for his eyes—he looked as if he needed shaving—he paid cash for both boxes and said that he might return one the next day, and it was arranged that he should have the money for the one he returned—he was there about an hour—the box at 32s. came back the next day with this letter, "Dr. J. Goldie begs to return accompanying musical box, as he has decided to keep the 25s. one. Please forward cheque for the balance (£1 12s.) and oblige, J. G. Kindly cross cheque Birkbeck Bank, June 20. 1902"—a stamped envelope was enclosed and addressed to 9, Broadway, E.C.—subsequently a detective came with Mr. Disney and spoke to me, and on July 11th I went to the police office, Old Jewry, and identified Herbert who was fourth in a row of eleven men, as Dr. Goldie—I heard him speak, which confirmed me.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">WELLS</hi>. I am Superintendent Examiner in the Income-tax Claims Branch at Somerset House—claims for repayment of or exemption from Income Tax have to be made on particular forms, white forms for original claims and blue for renewal claims, which are obtainable at Somerset House or at the Local Surveyor of Taxes' office—those forms have to be filled up and signed by the claimant, giving his name and address and the particulars of the property out of which the Income Tax was payable—the body of the forms may be filled up by other people on behalf of the claimant, but they must be signed by the claimant personally in all cases—they are then sent to the local surveyor's office for verifica<lb/>tion, and he certifies as to the general accuracy of the claim—he then returns them to Somerset House together with vouchers to support the claim, such as Income-Tax collectors receipts or certificates of payment and deduction by a trustee in cases of annuities, and in cases where the collectors' receipts may be missing the surveyor would certify that the duty had been paid, and the claim, if satisfactory, is paid by Money Order; if over £20, by a "Receivable order cheque"—this Exhibit, No. 16, is a letter by A. E. Brocklebank, enclosing Exhibits 17,18, 19, and 20, being four abatement claims on behalf of his four clients, named Bland, of 28, Garfield Road, and addressed from 41, Broadway, Stratford—the claims are for three years' taxes, ending April, 1901, and the property is de<lb/>scribed as cottages in the parish of South Weald, Essex—in the 1898-99 claim, the words "Receipt mislaid "are written in red ink, and then a note "No occupation, no other income"—these Exhibits, 21, 22, 23, and 24, are authorities purporting to be signed by the four Blands respectively to pay the money to Brocklebank—they are in four different hand<lb/>writings—No. 25 is a bundle of twenty-four collectors' receipts for different sums of money, each purporting to be signed by a Mr. Garrard—they were sent in corroboration of the claim—believing all the documents were genuine, I passed Exhibits 26, 27, 28, and 29 for the issuing of money orders.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Snapper, a hairdresser of 57, Brompton Road—I had a child on June 28th, 1901—it was called Nellie—she was put out to nurse and returned to me in March—I then sent her to St. George's Hospital for a fortnight—it had something the matter with it—it had been neglected when it was first out to nurse—it came back from the hospital much better—I then arranged through Mrs. Genman for it to go to the prisoner for 7s. a week—I didn't see the prisoner before she had my child—I saw it about three times while it was with her, when she brought it to me—in July I went to her house to see the child—I saw the prisoner and asked to see the child—she said she was not prepared for me, would I call back in half an hour as the room was untidy—I went up to the room—that is the last time I went there—it was after that that she brought it to me—it went there in May, and I heard from Mrs. Genman that it was getting on nicely—I had seen the prisoner when I first took the child there—when she asked me to call again in half an hour I said I could not, I was at work with my husband—when she brought the baby to me I did not think it was falling off—I thought it seemed better—she said it was cutting its teeth—it had always been a delicate child—I last saw it at the latter end of June or beginning of July at the prisoner's house, that was a week before it was taken away by the officers—I paid her weekly, sometimes she sent for the money and sometimes she came for it—she never made a complaint that she was not in a position to look after the child—she never made an application for money to take it to a doctor's—she never said it was suffering at all, except cutting its teeth—I did not undress it to see its condition—it only weighed 7 lbs. when born.</p>

               <p>a month—I asked her if she had notified the County Council that she had the children under her care—she said, "No"—I asked her what she received for them—she said 7s. for Snapper and 6s. for Brunet—I examined Snapper, she was very emaciated and covered with vermin bites, her buttocks were very red and seemed inflamed—Brunet's body was also covered over with vermin bites, he was emaciated, his buttocks were very sore and inflamed, and I noticed that he had bronchitis—I said to the prisoner, "Do you know these two children are very ill indeed?"—she said, "Yes, I know they are"—I said, "Why has not a medical man been called in?"—she said, "Brunet had a fit in the night, but I did not like to call a doctor up at that hour"—it had a second fit at 10.30 on the Friday morning, and she sent for the doctor—on top of the boxes was what looked like rotten manure, it was really cut chaff wet through—there was no mattress over it—it was very dirty—the only thing that was over the chaff was what looked like a piece of quilting—there was a dirty white shawl over the children—in the centre of the room there was a large oval bath three-quarters full of dirty napkins and water—the stench from it was shocking—there were also dirty napkins screwed up and thrown into the corners of the room—they looked as if they had been taken off the children—in the cupboard I found seven quartern whisky bottles and two pint whisky bottles all empty, two packets of Quaker Oats partly used, and half a tin of condensed milk of the cheapest kind—on the boxes there were two feeding bottles which were sour and dirty—the smell in the room was shocking—Brunet was about 15 inches from the woman on the bed, so also got the bad air from her—I telegraphed for Inspector Ross—he came, and soon afterwards Dr. Kempster—both the children were removed that day to the Chelsea Infirmary—I had the house watched during the night, and next day got a warrant and arrested the prisoner for cruelty and neglecting the children—she was charged at the King's Road Police Station and made no reply—she was then under the influence of drink—I do not think she was suffering from bad health or was incapable of attending to the children—she made no complaint to me to that effect.</p>

I am surgeon for the E Division of police—on July 25th I was called by Inspector Ross to 26, Seaton Street—I saw these children in the prisoner's room—Brunet had bronchial pneumonia, and was very ill indeed, he weighed 13 1/2 lbs., which was normal for his age, he was crying and in pain, and was coughing very much—the prisoner said, "The child had two fits last night, but I did not send for a doctor as I did not wish to disturb him, but the boy had another fit this morning, and then I sent for a doctor"—he had rickets, due to improper feeding; the hair on his head was rubbed off through his rubbing his head backwards and forwards, and owing to the pain produced by the rickets and pneumonia; his hands were clenched and his legs were drawn up to its stomach; when I touched it it screamed with pain; its feet were swollen and blue. I think its condition was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190209090090"/>
               <p>due to improper feeding. Its buttocks were red and raw, which would be due to the napkins not having been changed; its body was vermin-bitten, and it seemed that it had been roughly cleaned, but behind the ears there were mats of dirt—I examined Snapper—her weight was 11 1/2 lbs. instead of over 20 lbs., her face was pinched, her shoulder blades shrunken, her eyelids sunken, and she had rickets; her stomach was very swollen and had large veins showing over its surface; her hair was rubbed off the back of her head for the same reason as the other child; her buttocks were also red and raw, but not so bad as the other child; her feet were blue, swollen and cold, and her body was emaciated and vermin-bitten—it was obvious that they both needed medical attendance—they were lying on some chaff which had been so saturated with urine that it resembled manure—there were several zinc baths full of dirty napkins and dirty water which smelt very foul as well as the whole room—the children's condition would cause them unnecessary suffering and injury to their health—I have seen many rooms, but this was one of the worst I have ever seen—I had over forty vermin on me when I got out of it, and my clothes had to be baked—I saw some feeding bottles there, they had sour milk and, I think, Ridge's food in them; if the children had taken it it would have given them stomach-ache and diarrhoea—the prisoner was drunk and had been drink<lb/>ing heavily—I had the children removed—I said to the prisoner, "What have you fed these children on"—she said, "I fed Brunet on Ridge's food and milk since I have had him, I have had him four months "'—Brunet was the worst of the two, he was sent to the Infirmary, where he died—the condition of the children was due to want of soap and water, and ordinary care and attention—that would have remedied everything I saw in that room, and might have been done by the poorest woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at a little cottage in the yard of 4, Little North Street, Lisson Grove—I have two rooms there—I lived there with my daughters, Maud who is about 27 years old, and Kathleen and Lizzie who are 15 and 14—we all slept in the larger room with the fireplace—the deceased, who has lodged with us for about three years, slept in the smaller room—the prisoner, who is my son, has lived with me about the same time, except when he was in South Africa—before he went to South Africa he was a carman, and before that he was in the Police force—he left the force, I think, about four years ago—my husband died four years ago in July—I only knew the deceased when my husband was alive, by seeing him about—he lodged in a house opposite—he was working on the Great Central Railway—the prisoner went out to South Africa on March 25th and returned on August 24th—on the day of his return I told him that the deceased had called Kathleen and Lizzie foul names—he did not make any reply then—on the Friday morning he said he did not like to sleep in the same room as the deceased, and I said I would have him removed when my son got employment—I did not hear any dispute between the prisoner and the deceased—on August 30th the deceased came in about 9.30 or 9.45 p.m.—he was quite white and frightened—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190209090092"/>
               <p>one of his pockets was turned out—he went to bed about 45 minutes afterwards—the prisoner came in about 11.30 or 11.45—he had had some drink, but he was not intoxicated—he had his supper in my room—he asked if the deceased was in—I said, "He is in," and he went into the inner room as was usual for him to do—he only just went in, and out again at once—he said, "That is all right"—he went in to see if the deceased was in—my daughters and I went to bed while the prisoner sat in the chair, but we did not undress then—that was about 12.30—the prisoner went to sleep and I did the same—there was a lighted hanging lamp when I went to sleep, over my bed on a shelf—it is not usual to take it into the other room—the prisoner asked for a candle, and I had not got one—there was a kettle on the oven in my room—this is the kettle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the next thing I remembered was when Kathleen woke me up and told me there was a noise in the other room—it must have been about 1.45 a.m. then—Kathleen got out of bed and went into the other room—I had not been woke up then—when I woke up the lamp was in the other room—I got up and went into my son's room—I saw the deceased laying on the bed, his head on the pillow covered with blood—the bedclothes were all disarranged and thrown about the floor—he had only an under-vest and a white shirt on—he did not appear to be conscious—the prisoner was coming out of the room as I went in—he had a kettle in his hand—my little girl took the lamp off the mantelpiece and handed it to me—I asked my son what he had done it for—he made no reply—he had all his clothes on—when I had gone to sleep he had had his coat and vest off—as far as I can remember he was dressed in the same way when I saw him in his room as he was when he went to sleep—I raised the deceased's head on my right arm and called his name three times—he did not answer—he only gave a gurgling noise in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> throat—I told Kathleen to go and fetch a police-man—my son said that he had done it, and that she need not trouble, as he would go and get one himself—I have examined the kettle—the handle is now bent a little on one side—it was not so on the night of the 30th, but it was always bent forwards as it is now—it is an iron kettle—my son returned in less than five minutes with a policeman—it is not a fact that I had immoral relations with the deceased: he attempted once, but I resisted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fire had been out since three or four o'clock—I do not know if the kettle was full of water when I went to bed—when my husband died we lived at 37, North Street—the deceased did not continually come to visit me—he did not come till he lodged with me—he came to lodge with us at 37, North Street—that was about three months' after my husband's death—the deceased insulted me when I lived at 395, Edgware Road—that was about three years ago—he was lodging with me then—my son objected several times to the deceased lodging with me—my eldest daughter had a child by the deceased, but I did not know it until after the deceased's death—the child was still-born, about nine months ago—if I had known that the child was the deceased's I would not have had him in the house—he and the prisoner fought twice—the deceased was a strong man—I do not think he was quite as strong as the prisoner—they</p>

                  </hi> (158 <hi rend="italic">D.</hi>) I was passing No. 4, Little North Street about 2 a.m. on August 31st—I heard someone say, "Oh, poor fellow!" at the same time the prisoner stepped out from the door of No. 4 into the footway—seeing me he said, "I have killed a man in here, governor"—he turned round, I followed him through the passage leading to a one-storied cottage at the rear of No. 4—we entered the room, where I found Mary O'Connell, who said she was the prisoner's mother, Kathleen O'Connell, and a younger sister—the mother said, "Oh, policeman, my son has killed a man in the other room"—the prisoner could hear that—I went into the small back room with the prisoner—I found the deceased lying on the single bed at the back of the door—he was only wearing a white under vest, a grimy coloured and a dirty rug was lying on the floor, a blanket lying across the foot of the bed, but tucked underneath the mattress—the deceased was lying flat on his back with his head on the pillow, and turned slightly to the right—some lumber had fallen out of a corner down by the side of the bed—there was nothing to indicate a struggle—the deceased was labour<lb/>ing for breath—he was unconscious, and he had wounds on his face, from which blood was flowing—he was also bleeding from his nose and mouth, and he had a black graze on the inner side of his right fore arm cross-ways—I did not see black anywhere else—the prisoner said, "Why, he is breathing; if I had known he was alive I would have cut his heart out before I came out to you"—whilst he was speaking he picked up the iron kettle from the floor at the foot of the bed and said, "This is what I did it with; I do not want to get out of it; he always annoys me when I come home; he was the cause of me getting dismissed from the police force, and he was the cause of my father's death"—he gave me the kettle—I sent for Dr. Bird, who came about twenty minutes afterwards—I remained with the prisoner—he did not say any more—he was looking for his pipe and tobacco in the other room—the deceased was taken to the hospital, I took the prisoner to the station—on the way he said, "I struck him once, but it had no effect, he must have been as hard as iron, but I struck him again, and that fetched blood, and I struck him again, and that stopped his breathing; but I wish I had not lost my revolver I brought home from the front,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The smudge on the deceased's arm was about four inches across—his arm was lying by his side as he lay on his back on the bed—it looked as if it had been caused by the kettle—the room is very small there was no furniture in it except the two beds, and there was very little vacant floor space—there was just room for two people to stand to<lb/>gether between the deceased's bed and the window—there was about eighteen inches separating the two beds—I did not use the lamp at all, I had my lantern—I could have seen just as well with the lamp if I had not used my lantern—I think it was burning properly—when I first went up to the bed the prisoner's mother was holding the lamp inside the door—there was no light coming in from the window—when the prisoner said "Poor fellow!" in the street I thought it was some of the Irish people that there are about there going home after a Saturday night party—I made a note of what the prisoner said about two hours and a half after—I never asked him anything—he did not say, "He is bleeding"; he said, "He is breathing"—I have known him about three years, but not to know anything about him—I have not searched for a revolver, or made any enquiries—I do not know that he brought no revolver home with him—the deceased was broadly built about the shoulders, but he was thin in the lower part.</p>

               <p>the deceased was the father—he used most filthy language to my mother and sisters—he did not use it when my brother was present—on August 30th I was at home—I went to bed in the front room about 12 p.m.—the deceased went to bed about 10—he could only get out of his room by coming through ours—my brother came in about 12.30, we were just going to bed then—my brother was sitting in the chair—when I went to sleep the lamp was on the shelf—the next I remembered was when I saw Kathleen go into the bedroom, she woke me by getting out of bed—I heard a banging, and my brother came out of the room; he said, "Never mind, Maud, I done it for my sisters' sake, I know they will be safe now"—he had the lamp in his hand—my mother said, "Shall I go and fetch a policeman?"—he said, "No, I shall go and fetch one myself"—he went out and came back with a policeman—I did not see the deceased.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner of 1, Edg<lb/>ware Road—I was called to Little North Street on August 30th—I saw the deceased on a bed—he was insensible and breathing stertoriously, his face was covered with blood, and had black marks upon it—I ordered his removal to the hospital—I was present when Dr. Coombes made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the light of a small lamp—it gave sufficient light for me to see clearly, but not sufficient to make a critical examination—I think I could have seen sufficiently even if I had not been told what had been going on—I washed the man's face and noticed that there was no severe bleeding—I did not see any mark on his arm—the prisoner was in the front room in custody—I did not speak to him.</p>

               <p>3.10 a.m. on August 31st I attended the deceased, who was brought to the hospital—he was unconscious, breathing very heavily, and bleeding from six wounds on his face; he was also bleeding from a tear on the inside of his mouth—there was a fracture through the hard palate—there was a great deal of bruising on the left side of his scalp—his left eyeball was penetrated, there was a fracture of his left upper jaw, and it was broken into several places—he never recovered consciousness—he died at 10.20 that morning of coma, the result of hemorrhage following the fracture of the skull—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Dr. Bird on September 7th, when I dis<lb/>covered the fracture—it was at the base of the skull on the left side, and would be caused by the result of blows in front—it could not very well be caused by direct blows—the wounds could have been caused by blows inflicted by a blunt instrument—this kettle would possibly inflict them—there were three wounds above the left eye quite close together but no fracture there—there was a fracture of the left cheek bone, which is very strong—I think the three blows above the left eye could have been caused by one blow—the fracture which caused death was the one at the base of the skull on the left side, above and behind the ear—considerable violence would have to be used to cause the wounds—I noticed that when the deceased was brought in, his hands were begrimed, but there were no marks of violence there or on any other part of his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The black on his hands might have come from the kettle—I did not see a mark on his arm, all the external marks of violence were on the left side of his face—I thought that the wound on the eyelid might have been caused by the spout of the kettle—if a man hit straight out with the kettle that would not cause all the injuries, and one would expect to find the wounds more ragged—I think the spout caused the perforation of the eyeball—the other wounds must have been caused by the body of the kettle—I do not think it is possible to say how many distinct blows were given; I think the wounds might have been caused by three blows—the deceased was powerful but not very muscular, he was rather inclined to be stout.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that when he went into the back room with the lamp the deceased asked him what he was bringing "that d—light "in for; that he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) <hi rend="italic">had taken the kettle in with him to drink from, as he was thirsty, and was holding it in his right hand and the lamp in his left; that he told the deceased to go to sleep and said, "I will see if I cannot get you to shift your lodgings out of this next week"; that the deceased said, "That you can never do, I am a better man than what you are"; that the deceased then jumped up in bed and caught hold of the side of the prisoner's neck, standing behind him; that he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) <hi rend="italic">struck the deceased from three to five times with the kettle, over his shoulder; that he fell back on the bed, and he saw he was smothered with blood; that when his sister came in he went for a policeman; that his object in striking the deceased was to make him let go; that he did not remember what he said after that; that he never had a revolver at the Front, and had given up all his arms and uniform before he left South Africa; that the deceased might have received one or two blows after he let go, as he had let go at the first blow; and that the water came out of the kettle, but that he did not know where it went to.</hi>

St. John's Hill—on July 9th, about 9.45 a.m., I saw the prisoner in the saloon bar—he was there about an hour, and I served him twice—the same afternoon we missed the hospital box containing about 3s.—it was kept on a shelf beside the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chairmaker, of 59, Hufton Road, Hackney—for twenty years I worked for a Mr. Ferry—after leaving him, and for the past three years, I have worked for a Mr. Carter, of Camden Town—I have a fellow workman named Morse, who has worked at the next bench to me during that time—I am a widower with five children, and have a nephew at Walthamstow named Samuel John Hambrook—on July 5th, with some friends, I went to the Canadian Arch, Whitehall—we arrived there at about 11.35 p.m.—owing to the crowd I missed my friends—the <hi rend="italic">'buses</hi> were full, so I walked towards my home—I went past Shoreditch Church, through Hackney Road, through Goldsmith Row, into the Broadway, and on to London Fields—I arrived there at 2.30 a.m. on the 6th—I sat down on the first seat on the public path to rest—there was a woman on the seat—the prisoner was ahead of me walking down the path—he got over into the enclosure, and as I sat down he went up to a man lying upon the ground and kicked him with his right foot—the man got up, and the prisoner punched him with his right hand, knocking him down again—he then hustled him off the ground into Lansdowne Road—I lost sight of him for a minute, and then he came back along the path on my right towards the Broadway—he spoke to the woman, and she got up and went away—he said to me, "Now, get on here"—I said, "My good man, I am doing no harm, I am resting, I have just come from the Canadian Arch"—he said, "Go on, that will do"—I told him I was going to the Hackney Baths when they opened at six o'clock, then get my breakfast and go on to my nephew's at Walthamstow—he then hustled me off into the Broadway, and said, "I will take you down to the station"—I said, "My good man, you must be mad"—he then got hold of my arm—to the best of my recollection he arrested me almost opposite Devonshire Place, below the urinal in West Street—on the way to the station we went down Tredwin Road, and at about the third house down he stooped to pick up something, and began playing about with his right sleeve with his left hand—I said, "What have you there?"—he said, "You will hear about this later on"—I went quietly—I did not drop anything—he picked nothing up when he arrested me—I did not attempt to strike him, nor use the expression "Take that"—on the way to the station he said to me several times, "You thought I was a greenhorn"—he beckoned to another constable (<hi rend="italic">Platt</hi>) on the way, and showed him his right hand and said, "This is a notorious character," or words to that effect—he had a scratch upon his finger—I saw that when he first came up to me on the seat—he <hi rend="italic">kicked</hi> me twice with his left knee, and Platt hit me on the back of my neck twice with his open hand and knocked my pipe out of my mouth;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190209090106"/>
               <p>it fell to the ground—I asked the prisoner if I could pick up my pipe—he said, "We arc not here to wait on you and be your lackeys, you vagabond"—the pipe was left in the road—at the station I asked Inspector Goby what I was charged with, and he said, "You are not charged yet"—the prisoner showed Goby a knife which I disowned there and then, and told him I had one in my pocket with my name on it—the prisoner went out with Sergeant Reynolds and returned in half an hour, and I was put in the dock and charged—I denied all knowledge of the charge, and asked that my friends should be communicated with—the prisoner searched me and pretended to take a hammer out of my pocket, but I saw him work<lb/>ing it down his right sleeve—he then informed the Inspector that he had just found the hammer upon me—I disowned it there and then—I had two keys, a 2-foot rule, and my own knife taken from me—these are they (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I said nothing about being sorry: I had done nothing to be sorry for—I was taken before a Magistrate on the 7th, remanded for a week, and discharged—I was not in Pownall Road on the 6th with a woman, or at all—I did not go into any gateways—a constable did not say to me in the Broadway, "What are you doing in those gateways"—I did not say, "That is best known to myself"—he did not say that he should take me if I could not give a better account—I did not say, "Then take that, you b—"—I did not cut him on his finger with a knife—I did not throw down a knife—he did not stoop to pick up a knife when he arrested me—I did not say that I had no home—I never saw this knife and hammer until I saw them at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not had a good many glasses of beer that night—the last meal I had was my dinner and tea together at home at about 4.15 p.m., with the exception of a saveloy which I had late at night in Drury Lane—I did not go home because I did not wish to wake my landlady at that early hour—my idea was to wait until the baths opened at 6 o'clock, and then go on to my nephew at Walthamstow to dinner at 1 or 2 p.m.—I should have to go before 11 a.m. because the trains do not run between Church hours—I was not asleep on the seat, only resting, as I had walked from the Canadian Arch—my house is about twenty minutes "walk from Shoreditch Church—London Fields is a little nearer from Shoreditch Church—if I had gone home I might have overslept myself—my landlady could have called me, but I did not wish to trouble her—I do not think I should have overslept myself in the Fields—I am prepared to swear that I was never in Pownall Road on this night, and am prepared to swear anything as regards the truth—the first time I ever saw the woman was when I sat on the seat—the seat was 12 feet long, I sat at one end and she at the other—I was not in her society—I gave her 2d. to get a cup of coffee—when I saw the prisoner kick the man I said to her, "Look at what the constable is doing to that man; look at the scoundrel"—I mentioned to my solicitor what I said to the woman, about the constable kicking the man, on July 7th, and also when I went to the Treasury on July 24th, where I was asked if there was anyone else on the seat—the prisoner and I were perfect strangers—I cannot suggest that he owed me any grudge; I have never done him any ill turn—I presume I can rest on the public highway</p>

               <p>if I wish to—I was doing no harm there, neither was the other man—he was lying down, apparently asleep—I said that the woman went away after the prisoner spoke to her, not before—when he pointed to me and said. "Move on," I could see the graze on his finger—I use a hammer in my business, but the hammer produced would be no use at all, it is not heavy enough, it is only fit for tin tacks—I do not use a knife in my business; I always carry my own knife with me and my rule—the knife produced would be no use in my business—a clerk was sent by my firm, who said it was possible that the hammer and knife produced might be used in my trade—a clerk does not understand tools, and he knew nothing at all about what he was saying—when the prisoner had hold of me I did not notice passing any other policeman—I did not see a crowd a few moments before I was arrested—he showed his finger to Platt, whom he called to assist him, and said that I was a notorious character, or words to that effect, and then he kicked me, and Platt hit me twice on the back of my neck and knocked my pipe out of my mouth—I told my solicitor all this at the police Court—I do not know if he put it all down—I told Platt it was a lie, and that I had done nothing to the prisoner—I am quite clear; I was searched after the prisoner came back with Sergeant Reynolds—they went out together and returned in half an hour—I had not been charged up to that time—I was searched by two officers, I believe—there were two or three others present—I did not speak to the Inspector when the prisoner was going to search me because I did not understand about being in a police station, and did not know who had the right to search—I saw him shuffling something down his sleeve, so—there were other officers present—I am positive I did not say I was sorry for having done it, when he showed his finger to Platt: I had done nothing to be sorry for.</p>

Wheelerbread turned round, and with his right hand made a deliberate thrust at his chest saying, "Take that, you b—"; that he put up his right hand to ward off the blow when he received a slight cut on the back of the middle finger; that he dropped something, and he at once picked up an old knife which he produced to me—this is it—"that he arrested the prisoner and brought him down Lansdowne Road towards the station, where he met Platt, who accompanied them to the station; that on the way Wheelerbread said he was sorry for what he had done."—I asked Platt if he had heard that remark, and he said he had. Wheelerbread said he was a little bit deaf, and I repeated to him Rolls statement, and pointed to the knife. Wheeler<lb/>bread said he had never seen the knife before, that the charge was false.</p>

I asked Rolls some questions, and he said there was no one present when he arrested Wheeler bread, and he had not time to examine the houses. I then gave some directions to Sergeant Reynolds—Rolls searched Wheelerbread, and apparently took this hammer from his pocket and placed it on the desk in front of me—Wheelerbread said he had never seen the hammer before, and that Rolls must have put it there—Rolls said to Wheelerbread, "Do you think we carry tools like this about with us?"—Wheelerbread replied, "It looks like it."—there were also found on Wheelerbread a knife with his name on it, a 2-ft. rule, and the two keys produced—before these were taken from him Wheelerbread said he possessed a knife with his name on it—in reply to the remark that he was sorry for what he had done, Wheelerbread said, "I have done nothing to be sorry for, why should I say that?"—after Wheelerbread had been searched, Rolls and Reynolds went out and returned—I had not accepted any charge up to that time.</p>

I am Surgeon of the L Division—on July 15th, at 10.45 p.m., I was called to the police station and found Smith suffering from shock and pains in his chest, which was very tender, and a bruise developed upon his left testicle—Pafford had two wounds on his right thumb, one above and another below the knuckle, which appeared to be done by a bite,—as the two wounds were exactly above and below one another—Earle had a small wound on the back of his hand, which became very much inflamed—he was on the sick list for some time—Smith was quite unable to do his work for three weeks—the prisoner Moore had four wounds on his head, two incised and two contused—the contused wounds could have been caused by a truncheon, and the incised wounds by a jam pot.</p>

               <p>many thousands of finger prints—each pattern has its name, definition, and numerical value, and we classify them accordingly—all finger prints which are the same <hi rend="italic">must</hi> ultimately find their way into the same pigeon<lb/>hole, and throughout my experience I have never found two persons having identical finger prints—I have never found any variation—the pattern remains the same on each finger from birth till death—on June 28th in consequence of information. I went to 156, Denmark Hill, and took a photograph of a print on the sash of a window in the billiard room—I produce the negative, the enlargement, and some prints from the enlarge<lb/>ment—on August 7th. I went to Brixton Prison and obtained a print of the prisoner's hand—I compared it with the impression on the window sash, and with a print of the prisoner's hand, which we had at Scotland Yard, taken on July 24th, 1901, and have no hesitation in saying that they are identical—the print on the window sash is that of the prisoner's left thumb—the points of resemblance are as follows—in the centre of the thumb there is a line going down and another, an independent line, coming up, terminating on the left side—those lines are identical in the photograph of the thumb mark on the window sash, and the photograph of the prisoner's thumb taken at Brixton Prison—the line terminating on the left in the photograph of the print on the window sash is not quite perfect, probably owing to the prisoner's thumb being dirty at that particular point—there are also identical in each photograph lines shaped like a tuning fork, with a line at the side, and another line terminating at the point of bifur<lb/>cation—I have also counted the ridges from the core or delta, and they number <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> in each print—another remarkable thing in each print is a line forking oft' into two, and in my opinion it is impossible for any two persons to have any one of the peculiarities I have selected and described.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gymnastic instructor of 20 Richmond Road. Earl's Court—I have been to the war, and am a pensioned sergeant—on August 22nd, at 9 p.m. I saw some friends off at Waterloo Station—I walked down Waterloo Road into the Borough Road, and called in a public house—while I was in there the prisoner came in with two other men—they followed me out, and when passing under an archway the prisoner butted me in the back, and the two other men searched me—I held the prisoner and called for the police—the two others ran away—it was 10.15 p-m.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> I was not with three other men—you came into the public house while I was having my drink—one of the other men asked me to stand him a drink, and I gave him a penny—when I left you followed me—you did not take anything personally, but you butted me in the back—the man I stood the drink to was one of the men that robbed me.</p>

               <p>duty in the Southwark Bridge Road, when I heard shouts of "Police"—I turned the corner into the Borough Road where I saw prosecutor and the prisoner—I said, "What's up?"—the prosecutor said, "Him and his mates have taken my purse and money"—the prisoner then walked away—I caught him and took him to the station—when the charge was read to him he said nothing—I searched him and found 3 1/2 d. in bronze.</p>
