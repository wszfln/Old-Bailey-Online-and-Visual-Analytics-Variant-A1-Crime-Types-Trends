               <p>purchases over sales of over 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't account for that; I can't account for about half of it—the stock that was actually realized was a little over 1700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is a surplus of stock unaccounted for to the extent of about 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is without taking into consideration any profit to the prisoner on these sales, treating the sales as at cost price—if there were any profits, that would considerably increase the deficit—the debts due to the bankrupt were nearly 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the total assets about 2900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the total debts about 6500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which were customers' dishonoured bills; the deficiency, as between the assets and debts, is 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being treated as liabilities—the bills represented goods that had been sold to creditors—in August, 1868, he was indebted to trade creditors about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't place any great reliance on those figures; but that is the best I can get from the books—I can't state the amount owing to him at that time—I was not satisfied, from the examination I made, that my figures were correct on that point—the bankrupt admits to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of stock in hand at the beginning of January, 1869; but there are no figures in his books to give me any proper data—I have never received from the bankrupt, or from the books, or in any way, any solution of the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency.</p>

               <p>of the goods in the van, because I don't know the weight of kid and patent calf—the van was there above an hour that day—my son was at home—he saw it—he did not make any memorandum at that time, only myself—I did not suggest to him to make a memorandum—it was between 11 and 2 o'clock—the van was standing, for an hour, in front of the door, next door to me—I mean to say that the whole of those goods went in at the front door—there was rather a large quantity—I am sure my son was at home—he came to me, and said, "Papa, look outside, there is a large van full of goods of Feldman's at Davis's door," and I said, "I have seen it already"—he is going on for fourteen years of age—he did not tell me to make a memorandum of it—I had done that already—I did it in His pre<lb/>sence—the goods had all been delivered then, they were just taking them down—this is my memorandum—this "June 28th, kid and patent calf," was written on 28th—the next entry is "June 29th, van of Australian sides," and then, "June 30th, patent calf and lining"—that is my son's—"Cropped bellies and Australian" is mine—that third entry was made by my son—I was not there when he made it—I swear that those entries were made at different times—I had left the envelope in ray desk, unlocked, and my son went to the desk and took it—I had not told him it was there—I dare say he saw me put it in the desk—I can't say whether he saw me write the memo<lb/>random on the 29th—I don't know whether he wrote anything else but what is on that envelope.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and work at his place, next door to Davis—in June last I noticed some goods come to Davis's place—the first day was on the 28th—they came in Mr. Feldman's van—Ward was the driver—the van contained kid and patent calf—it was quite full—I first saw it at Davis's front door—there was no one else with the van when I first saw it—it had driven up, and was standing at the door, and the goods were being taken out of it into the front door by Davis and his man—they received the whole of the load, and that van was driven off—this was between 11 and 2 o'clock in the day—I judge by my dinner hour—on 29th June I saw some more goods come in the same van, with the same driver; they were Australian sides and patent calf—the van drove first to the front door, and was then taken to the side door—the goods were unloaded there, and taken into the yard, and the van afterwards driven away—that was between 11 and 2 o'clock—in the afternoon of the same day I saw the same van loaded with Australian sides—they were driven to the back yard and unloaded; it was the same driver—my father was at home, I believe—on the afternoon of the 30th I saw some lining and patent calf—my father was not at home then—they were unloaded at the front door—on the 28th I was at the door when I saw the things, and I went in to any father and told</p>

               <p>him of it, and he said he had seen it already, and I saw him writing some-thing on the back of an envelope—this is it, and on 30th June, when I saw the load, and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> father was out, I made an entry there—this is it—I put it on the desk, and my father saw it when he came home—when I made the entry, the entries of the 28th and 29th were already written—at the time I saw this we could see from our side window into the yard—after that a fence was put up, a sort of hoarding of boards, so high that we could not tee; that was put up on Davis's was, so as to prevent our looking into the yard; I can't exactly say how long after that I had seen these loads brought that was done; it was thortly after—our windows were originally ground glass, painted; but tome of the paint was scratched off.</p>

I am an accountant—I was employed by some of the creditors under the first bankruptcy—the bankrupt's affairs were placed in my hands—I had all his books on 6th August, I think—he assisted me in making out a statement of his affairs, which was submitted to the creditors—invoices were produced by the bankrupt, extending over this transaction—those relating to the latter part of 1868 and the half of 1869 were also on files—I think we went back as far as January 1st—after I had worked out the statement, I handed these invoices to Messrs, Sole and Turner—there were five files of invoices, and here is their receipt for them—all the invoices were on the files—a large number of invoices passed through my hands—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a book kept by Feldman, with the dates, names, and amounts—when we went through the books, we endeavoured to check the goods off with this, and when we could not find any invoice, we put a cross against the item—that applied to the months of April, May, and June, and up to the bankruptcy—these invoices were left in our office—Mr. Wyatt, my clerk, can tell you what became of them—I did not hand them over to the defendant—I have been applied to for papers connected with the matter, on behalf of the assignees—I have not refused to deliver them—I have delivered every paper we have—we gave copies of the account we took—we have not given the originals—I certainly refused to give the originals—a different accountant was employed—we never give up original documents.</p>

               <p>more—I will not swear that the purchases were or were not three times so large during the last three months to what they were before; I can't swear either way—I came up to the Court of Bankruptcy repeatedly while the examination was going on, and I believe I was twice at the Police Court; but was not called—I was never with David at the Bankruptcy Court—I don't believe I spoke to him there; I never saw him there; I don't believe I did—I may have seen him; but I never spoke to him—I do remember seeing him, now I come to recollect it—I think in September—I did not go across and have some refreshment with him; I have with Feldman, many times—I don't believe I went with Davis and Feldman—I did not go frequently to Feldman's place after the bankruptcy; now and then I may have called there—I was not there continually—perhaps I have not called for a month together—I can't say that I saw Davis there—he may have been there—I attended the sale—I bought some things there, to the amount of about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for myself—it was my own money—I paid with notes and gold—I can't say how many notes—I don't know whether they were tens or fifties—I believe I wanted change of a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Johnson could not give it me, now I come to recollect, and I got it elsewhere—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was my own savings—I kept it at home—I had not had it long; I almost forget where I got it; let me see! I believe it was from Mr. Wolff, I fancy he gave it to me—he is the prisoner's father-in-law—he gave it me about two or three days before—I said I wanted some, and he lent me some, too—it was my own money—I believe it was about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he lent me—I wanted a large note, a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, because I had some smaller ones, and he did not have it, only this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I did not care about carrying many notes about with me—this was not to go to the sale with—it was after the sale—I will swear I had it from Wolff—I did not have it from Nicholl—I believe I got it the day after the sale—I paid a deposit of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the sale, and the remainder a day or two after—I can't say why small notes would not have done as well—it may have been a fancy to get a large one, nothing further—I will swear I did not receive it from the prisoner—Mr. Nicholl was a customer of his—I don't know about his being a friend—I have seen them together constantly, since the bankruptcy—he is one of his bail—he did not send a cheque to the bank and get that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and give to the prisoner, nor did the prisoner give it to me; I swear that—I can't answer for Mr. Nicholl's act—I did not see him send a cheque to the bank—I swear that Wolff gave me the note—I can't swear that it was in the prisoner's presence; he may have been there—it was not at the prisoner's place; it was at 12, Camomile Street, Wolff's place—the prisoner did not go with me to Wolff's—I bought the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods because I knew what they cost, and if they went under cost I knew where to sell them—I sold part of them—I took some away and left some at the pre<lb/>mises, 99, Hackney Road, where the sale took place—there is a small portion there now that I cannot sell.</p>

Davis, but I did not go through the amount to see what it was; they went to Mr. Levy's sale rooms—there were three loads, two of goods and one of cutting machinery—the sales had been stopped somewhere about Christmas—I believe the sale was by private contract; they sold the goods for so much to one person, I believe—they were taken to a sale room, and Mr. Levy sold them.</p>

I am a civil engineer—I was carrying on two magazines, the <hi rend="italic">Artizan,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Freemasons' Magazine,</hi> at 19, Salisbury Street—the prisoner was in my service about four and a half years—his wages, latterly, were 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe—I have been engaged in a good many joint<lb/>stock companies—on 13th August last I was arrested and put into Whitecross Street—whilst I was there the prisoner came to me, almost daily—his duties then were the same as they always were—he was publishing clerk in the office of the <hi rend="italic">Artizan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Freemason's Magazine</hi>—it was his duty to receive money when tendered at the office, receive all letters and hand them over to me, and if I was absent, to my wife—with reference to cheques drawn to order, it was his duty to hand them to me, or, if I was absent, to Mrs. Smith, to be endorsed; that is, if they came open—he had no business to open a letter—he certainly had no right to endorse my name on cheques; they should have been handed to me in the same state he received them—I was in Whitecross Street nearly three weeks, that would include the week ending on 4th September—this sheet, headed "Statement for the week, ending 4th September, 1869," is the prisoner's writing; it includes sums received and disbursed—the disbursements appear as 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this is a receipt given by him to my wife for that amount—I discharged him on 7th October—I did not know at that time, nor for a considerable time after-wards, that Messrs. England bad sent the cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the first I knew of it was by a letter from them, in reply to an application for payment—that was about a fortnight before the prisoner was arrested—the endorse<lb/>ment on the cheque is in the prisoner's writing; he had no authority to make it—he has not entered the amount in the cash-book, but it is in the ledger, under the head of 1st July—it should have passed this, the cash-book, in order to get into the ledger—this is the letter-book—it was kept by the prisoner—there is no entry of the receipt of Messrs.

               <p>for me, by my authority, in the name of George Duncan, engineer, Liver<lb/>pool—I have no recollection of the name of Duncan—he may have accepted such a hill, but I never authorized him; he certainly did not do so by my inducement or authority—I did tell him to accept a bill in the name of C. J. Taylor, engineer, Glasgow—they were not fictitious bills; I had an authority to have bills accepted—he did not accept another bill in the name of Taylor with a different initial; the bill was payable at 5, Adam Street, Adelphi—I don't remember going to Deacon's house after he left me; I certainly did not go there in a cab, and take him to my place, and want him to sign a paper to the effect that he had never signed bills for me—I swear that—he was asked as to certain bills of Taylor's, and if he ever signed any other bills, and he said "No"—I think that was at Messrs. Bambra &amp; Some-body's office—I am a bankrupt to the amount of nearly 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a propo<lb/>sition has been made to pay 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—I am opposed by the gentle-man who instructs you—I have not got to come up for a further examina<lb/>tion, that I am aware of—I am an Associate Member of the Society of Civil Engineers, and have been so fifteen years—there was a company carry<lb/>ing on business in Salisbury Street, called the National Cotton Cultivation Company of Greece Limited; it is not carried on now—the name is not up against my door, that I am aware of—the name was painted out some time ago—I was engineer to the company, not one of the directors, as far as I remember; it is seven or eight years ago—to the best of my belief I was not a director—I should fancy there were seven or more directors, according to the Act of Parliament—I can't, at this moment, recollect any of their names—I attended some six or seven of their meetings—I did not promote the company—I was interested in its operations—there is another company that has its name up at my door, "The Public Works and Credit Company of Italy; "I am the engineer of that; it is the engineer's office; I don't know where their offices are—there has been no business done for some time past, like a great many other companies—the "Agricultural and General Machinery Agency Company Limited," has its name up on my door—I don't remember the day the prisoner was arrested, we had a difficulty in finding him, and I went with the detective sergeant to point him out—I did not go to his rooms and carry away all his papers; the sergeant did—I know that there were some letters from my agent at Glasgow, addressed to the prisoner's private house; also some other letters announcing the payment of money on account of the Freemasons' Bank, in which he acknowledges to taking money—I do not know whether he is indicted for that; I am not a lawyer—I appeared against him at Bow Street, and I acted under advice—I have no doubt that forging the cheque was one of the forms the charge took at Bow Street—whether it was embezzlement or forgery he is being tried for, I do not know—I do not know that a witness who was called at Bow Street is not to be called to-day—I do not know the name which was struck out—I heard Mr. Rogers examined at Bow Street—the prisoner was taken in custody on a Saturday night, or 12.30 or 1.0 on Sunday morning; he did not come home till that time—I knew of this cheque being paid some time in the middle of November, a fortnight, or it may be three weeks, before he was taken in custody—I will not swear it was not five weeks; you have the means of ascertaining very much better than myself—the gentleman who instructs you drew an affidavit, and it was sworn to by Mr. Rust; I heard it read out, and it was full of untruths—I did not go to Mr. Rogers on 30th October, and ask him about this</p>

               <p>cheque, or at any other time—he called at my house, I think, about 13th November, and apologised, and explained the circumstances under which he gave the prisoner change for the cheque—there were two reasons why he was not taken in custody before; all his friends told me he was sold up at his house, and I did not look for him; but when I ascertained that he was at a public-house, I sent to inform the officer—I never heard of his being employed at the Carbon Oil Company, at Westminster, till afterwards—I gave no instructions that he should be searched for, because I was advised that until the evidence was complete I should not be justified in giving him in custody; but when we found another case of fraud, and that he him falsified the books, I was advised to give him in custody—I never saw or spoke to Rust at the Bankruptcy Court—I have not read the affidavit he signed, but I know it is so full of untruths, because statements have been made by the gentleman instructing you upon the contents of it, which, if they represent the contents, it must be full of untruths—this "National Masonic Calender, Pocket Book, and Diary for 1870," is advertised to be edited and published by me, but it is not published—subscriptions and advertisements have been applied for—I cannot tell how many advertise<lb/>ments have been ordered to be inserted—it is usually published on 31st December—no advertisements have been paid for, as far as I know—it is the advertising agent's business to receive the advertisements and the money; he has very likely received some, but none has been paid to me—if you see in print, "Post Office order and cheques payable to Henry Her<lb/>bert Montague," that must be the case, but whether that applies to 1869 or 1870, I cannot tell you—Henry Herbert Montague are my son's Chris<lb/>tian names—he is nine years old—it is a common plan to use a name—the prisoner had not a right to use money which came into his hands for office purposes, excepting for petty cash—he had no authority to pay wages, unless the money was handed to him for that purpose—he had authority to disburse the moneys he received for petty cash, and stamps for newspapers—I describe him thus: "Post Office orders payable to John Rust, publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Freemasons' Magazine</hi>"—on 4th September he came to see me in Whitecross Street Prison, on two occasions during the day, in the morning, early, and at nearly 3 o'clock in the afternoon; I told you so before, at the Police Court—he also called a third time, in the evening, but I did not see him—I raised a question about the petty cash, when he called at 3 o'clock—England's payment, in the ledger, is entered on 1st July—I had not given him instructions to enter cheques on different dates to what they were received on—a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from Taylor &amp; Co., of Birkenhead, on 31st August, is entered in the prisoner's writing, on 1st September—I did not tell him to enter it on 31st July, it would be perfectly absurd—this enve<lb/>lope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—I see several pencil marks on the back of it—I see no initials on it; I see some on the letter of advice—they are not mine; one is a very good imitation, and the other a very bad one—I never asked Mr. Rogers to attest signatures which he had not seen written; but in the case of a specification for patents, a person will come in and sign, and if it cannot be attested then, he attests it afterwards—the stamps of our newspapers posted vary; here is one account, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., another, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and another, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the service in 1867? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my salary was raised, I believe, a shilling a week without my asking for it—the signature to this document is like mine; it bears date 8th July, 1867—I do not remember whether that was the time my salary was raised—it has been raised more than once—I borrowed money, from time to time, from my master—I had one loan, and I might have borrowed half-a-sovereign or a sovereign—I had not twenty loans; they were generally accorded with very bad grace—I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1867 (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I made excuses for not repaying it, and I explained it to Mr. Smith at the time, and part of it has been paid back—the letter of 11th August, 1869, is my writing—I do not know whether Mr. Smith was attending to business at that time—I say here, "Will you oblige me with the loan of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid as follows: 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Saturday, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 21st; and the balance on the 28th; the fact is the poor rates have been collected sooner than I anticipated, and I have to pay them, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to day"—I do not mean that I have seen Rust sign Mr. Smith's name on a cheque—I had an interview with Mr. Smith on 30th October, about my passing the cheque through my banker's—I do not remember saying, at that interview, that I had never known him to sign Mr. Smith's name before—I might have said that, I was indiscreet—there was a debt of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me from September 2nd, and this cheque repre<lb/>sents it—all these cheques are taken from the same book—I hare not got the counterfoils—I buy twenty-four at once—this cheque of the 2nd was not drawn on the 12th, or the 22nd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Hold it to the light, and see whether there was not another figure before the "2" originally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see what you mean; it is drawn with a very bad quill pen, and the prisoner said that they would not cash it—it is possible I might have written "1st September"—I have not got the cheques preceding, or the counterfoils, or the pads-book; but the cheques show that they have been through the London and County Bonk, by the stamp—the cheque of 4th August is from a new book, which accounts for the difference of 500 in the numbers—when I said that the cheques came from the same book I referred to these two—I had had a banking account there for six years, and yet I was borrowing to pay by instalments—I will explain that; I had not a large balance at my banker's, perhaps 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I was bound to keep, and Rust said, "I shall have money on Saturday, and you can pay in this cheque to meet the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I went to my bauker's and bogged them to</p>

               <p>pass it through, so that it should be paid on the Saturday, although the usual course is to do it next day—I was in a hurry, because I thought it would meet the cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was coming in—I got my master's cheque on Satur<lb/>day turned into cash to meet my cheque on Monday, and left his service on the Saturday night, without notice—I bad nothing to do with the books—I find in the prisoner's statement, "Cash received, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the <hi rend="italic">Artizan</hi> office," and "Cash paid to Mr. Smith, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I may have put down 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for wages on Saturday night, but that is a mistake; it should be 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is not in the prisoner's writing—I find the items on this side, and on the other side, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I do not see 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not understand the account—I find 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but not 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know nothing about the accounts whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a common thing, or was it a very rare thing indeed, that the office should be hard up for money, and the clerks obliged to supply it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard the prisoner say so many times and that he did not even know how he was to get the stamps to post the magazines—I left, I believe it was on the 4th, because I did not wish to be mixed up with this matter at all—he knew where to find me, but he pre<lb/>tended not to know my address—his solicitor has not communicated with me—a summons was left at the residence, on Friday, which I occupied when Mr. Smith employed me—I never absconded, or tried to run away—the "Instruct Rust," on this envelope, is, I have no doubt, in Smith's writing, and the "W. S." is very much like the way he used to sign his initials—I should certainly think it is his writing, without swearing to it, because I did not see him write it—I should also say that the prosecutor wrote this "Enter" on the back—it would have been inconvenient to me to have paid the loan of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid back the first week, not 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because the prosecutor said it would come easier to me afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BKSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been shown the envelope, and the pencil writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have had them in my possession once—I do not remember whether that was at the Police Court—it was not just before I was examined as a witness—I did not hear my late master examined there, I was not in Court—I heard him examined to-day, and swear that this pencil is not his writing; I do not swear that it is, but as near as I can possibly go without seeing him write it—I do not pledge my oath that it is his writing, but I certainly think it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever mention the transaction of the cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on 13th October—up to that time I said nothing; I had left—I did not let him know; the prisoner was so much mixed up in the prosecutor's matters that it was not necessary—I did not think it wrong or suspicious in any way.</p>

I have been for thirty-one years employed by the Treasury—on 1st January, from information I received, I went to Sewaid-atone Road, about 3 o'clock, with other officers—we posted ourselves in a position to command a view of No. 14, and shortly afterwards the little girl (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner Ellen</hi>) came from the door and passed us—we watched her to Mann's, the baker's, shop, and when she came out I sent Chapman in—he gave me information, and Inspector Honey went to a public-house—he took possession of a half-sovereign, and showed it to me—we watched the girl home, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came out again, and Honey and Chapman followed her, while I kept within view of the door of No. 14, and saw her return, and the officers folio wing her—I stopped her, and said, "My little girl, what is your name?"—she said, "Cave, sir"—I said, "Where do you live?"—she said, "14, down there, sir," pointing to the door which I had seen her go in and come out from—I told her she was suspected of passing coin which had been impaired, diminished, and light<lb/>ened—she made no reply—I said, "Do you understand me, my girl, or shall I explain it to you?"—she said, "If you please, sir,"—I said, "For lighten-ing the sovereigns and making them of less value, and then passing them; you answer the description of a little girl that passed some light sovereigns to Mr. West, the brewer, in the Hackney Road"—she said, "Yes, sir, I had</p>

                  </hi>. I am chemist to Her Majesty's Mint—I have examined these articles—this box contains two batteries, a wire brush, a pair of scissors, two steal burnishers, and a clasp knife—there is no trough to the butteries, but a tea cup could be used as a trough—various solvents may be used in the trough; cyanide of potassium and various acids—there are two wires, which are in a very similar position to that in which they would be used for electro-gilding—this battery would extract gold from sovereigns, with the aid of acids—with the connection complete, a sovereign would be decomposed—I received the charges drawn from the battery, and charged it with them—I then operated with it upon a half-sovereign, using a solution of cyanide of potassium in the cup, and removed from the half-sovereign these three-tenths of a grain of gold (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I used the other battery, and worked with hydrocloric acid, by which means I removed ten grains of gold from a sovereign in an hour—I have analyzed the liquids with which the battery was charged; one was sulphate of copper, and the other sulphate of zinc—the acid in the cup contained a small quantity of gold—the board with a round hole in it is, I believe, used as a support for the coin after its removal from the solution—here is a sovereign which has been practised upon, and which is still uncleaned; it is dull—this brush would brighten it, and take off the rough red appearance—these bent wires are used to support the coin in this position—the process of electro-dissolu-tion is precisely the reverse of electro-plating; the one is putting gold on, the other is taking it off: you just change the wires—I believe this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001310034"/>
               <p>sovereign, No. 1, has been so acted upon; it has lost eleven grains of gold, which, at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a grain, is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; No. 2 has lost twelve grains and a half; No. 3, thirteen grains; No. 4 has been withdrawn; No. 5, fifteen grains; No. 6, thirteen grains; No. 7, twelve grains; No. 8, seven and a half grains—twenty-two parts out of twenty-four in a sovereign are gold—part of the alloy would be deposited with the gold, and part would remain in the solu<lb/>tion—a lot of alloys were handed to me; they were principally lead and tin; also some emery powder, which he used to polish sovereigns, and remove gold from their surface—the constable brought me ten ounces of coal—I analyzed 200 grains of it, and obtained half a grain of gold (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), and some traces of copper—these chemicals are, nitric, sulphuric, hydrocloric, prussic, and cyanic acids, and cyanide of potassium—assuming such a process to be carried on, some of those acids would be used—I have also found gold in the shavings or scrapings of these wooden pliers—this packet is labelled, "Protosulphate of iron"—that is used for precipitating gold, depending upon the solution—here is also some chlorate of potass, and a bottle marked, "<hi rend="italic">Nuxvomica</hi>"—those might be used in subsequent operations, I cannot say—I believe these three rings to be brass-electro gilt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi> (<hi rend="italic">James</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not several kinds of galvanic batteries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is a very suitable one for electro-plating—they are used by mere amateurs sometimes, and they would have the same articles—then are no articles here which would only be used for reducing gold coin, but the construction of the wires I attach great importance to—it is necessary, in gilding, to avoid putting the copper wire into the solution—I could not reduce gold with this battery, without a gold solution in the decomposing trough—the gold I found was nearly pure, there was a slight trace of copper—if it had been taken from a sovereign it would have been of the same quality, provided you had not used copper wires—I do not consider that a person wishing to obtain gold would use copper wire to sustain the gold to be dissolved, and spoil his gold—the coins I have experimented upon might he circulated among persons whose suspicions had not been aroused—you could get gold from a bag of powdered quartz with this battery, if there was metallic contact—the battery would be just the same if it was used to extract gold from any old gilt articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLERIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that a person who wanted to get the best gold would not use copper wire to get it with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider not—copper is much more easily reduced than gold, and if there is a small quantity of copper in a solution it will come down first—I found gold on the opposing copper wire; it is only at the dissolving wire that the copper would be injurious to the gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is no doubt that by means of this machine gold could be dissolved, whether a sovereign, a gold brooch, or quartz? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—the cup, which may have been used as a dissolving trough, contained a small quantity of gold, and there was some on the opposing wire, which was done by accident—no one wishing to deposit gold would use copper wire, because there would be more copper than gold deposited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">James Cliford, in his defence, stated that, if he fad been engaged in any illegal transaction his door would have been fastened. He entered into the construction of different galvanic batteries, and contended that those found would not be the best adapted to the purpose suggested; stating that what in the cup was a mixture called "pickle" which was used to clean metals before undergoing electroplating, by removing the oxide from them, and contends</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">that if the gold found by the chemist had been, taken from sovereigns, is would have been standard gold, which it was not proved to be, and that all the articles found were those used by ordinary electrotypists. He stated that he was an artillerist, and had been twenty years experimenting in torpedos and shells, and that the chemicals found were used to make an explosive substance twelve times stronger than the best blasting powder; that he made the shells water<lb/>tight by depositing copper upon the joints by the electrotype process, and that he received the gold coins in change, and had not diminished them; that the pistol was used for experiments with the torpedos, and that he had served twenty-two years for his pension, which would be forfeited if he was convicted.</hi>

What training have their sons had, putting out of the question Christian teaching?""It is impossible for Mr. Marshall to regard Mrs. Marshall's children as his own; Mrs. Marshall's companions, since her mar<lb/>riage, has robbed her of all those precious gifts which befitted the character of a mother, and the examples she has had before her are too disgusting to refer to." "I once saved Lizzie's life, when Mr. Marshall absolutely de<lb/>clined to provide her with anything, although she was then living at his house at Holloway; her doctor and nurse can confirm this." "If you were in possession of all the facts of Lizzie's wretched life up to within a few months more of her coming to me, and considering the cowardly and profligate asso<lb/>ciates that she has been compelled to mix with, you would, I am convinced, have advised her differently." "I dare not think wrong of Lizzie, nor regard her (using her own language) otherwise than in the sight of God, her husband."</p>

               <p>—we slept in the basement—my wife aroused me, and I heard a scraping noise at the bedroom window—I got out of bed, and put on my trowsers, when I heard the sash of the window shoved up—I went across the room, god got up in the corner, where I could look between the curtains—I saw the prisoner, apparently listening—he jumped on to the window sill, on the opposite side of the window to where I was—the chiffonier was close to the window—I saw his arm come round the curtain, and take something off—I made a grab at him; but the curtain baffled me—he dropped the article he had got, and ran away—I jumped through the window into the area, after him, and caught him as he was climbing up the pipe, to get hold of the iron railings—I hung on to his legs till I exhausted his strength—he gave me two or three kicks; but ultimately I got him down—I sung out for a policeman, and held him till one arrived, about fifteen minutes after<lb/>wards, and gave him in custody—there were marks on the window sash—something had been inserted between the bars—I found this clock on the floor, by the window; it had been taken from the chiffonier.</p>

I am a cab proprietor, at Long Lane, Bermondsey—I bought a dark-grey mare on 27th November—her tail was shortish then, and she had bad knees—I should say they had not been blistered—the prisoner came with her and another man, who, I have heard since, they call <hi rend="italic">Ginger Jarvis</hi>—I did not know him before—he asked if I would buy a horse—it came in a cart—the other man was driving—he said his name was Jones; that was the name on the cheque—I said the mare had got very bad knees, and asked how it occurred, and Jones said, "I was in Scotland, and I bought her, and put her into the railway truck, and getting her out of the truck she met with that accident, stumbled"—I replied that it ought not to be his loss, that the Railway Company ought to compensate him, and he said, "Unfortunately, one of my men led the mare out, and by that means I cannot make any claim on the company"—the prisoner was close by all the time—I told one of my men to got in the cart and go with Jones, to try her for a half-mile or three-quarters—the man did so, and when he brought her back I said I did not much like to buy a horse in that state, with such bad knees, and I said, "I won't give more than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," for it took a long while to get well—he asked 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said she cost him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Scotland—I asked Jones where he lived, and he said, "Up near Victoria Park"—since then I have found that address to be false—the prisoner was within hearing all the time—I gave Jones a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to order—Jones gave my man a shilling, and I gave the prisoner a shilling to give his stableman, at home—they left the cart in the yard, and came back, in three or four hours, with a pony—I was asked to buy the pony—they would have filled my stable with horses, if I had kept on with them—I did not buy the pony.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You gave the mare up to Mr. Humphrey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, when he claimed it—I can't say in what way the knees had been broken—I should say they had been done some time, because there was a little matter in one; some week or two, I should think—I mode the cheque payable to Jones—I asked him his name, and he said "Jones"—I don't know what the prisoner was—I did not suppose he was the stableman—he remained while my man went in the cart to try the horse—he was close by the stable-door, where I was standing—I don't think I spoke to him—they were about eight or ten minutes trying the horse—I had seen Jones the previous night, alone, and he asked me if I would buy a horse if he brought it to me—I took Jones to be master, and the horse to be his property—the transaction was with him alone—he was the only man I had dealings with—I had not seen the prisoner the previous night—I never saw him except at that time, to my knowledge—I buy horses a good deal—it is very seldom I sell them—I wear them out fast enough.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Crawfoot, of Well Hall Cottages, Eltham—on 3rd January, at 8 a.m., I went down stairs and found the pantry window open, which was shut and fastened when I went to bed at 9 o'clock—I missed from the larder a piece of beef and a very large plum pudding with a little piece cut out of it—I found the pudding in the shed, and saw a portion of the beef taken out of the prisoner's pocket.</p>

On Sunday night, 2nd Jan-uary, about 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoner going down a path at the back of some houses, within 200 yards of Mr. Grawfoot's—I law him again about 11.15 or 11.30 in a shed, covered up with horse litter—I searched him and found a piece of plum pudding, some suet pudding, and a quantity of beef—I asked what he had been doing; he gave no answer—I asked where he got the beef and pudding—he said, "From a servant girl"—I asked him who she was—he declined to tell me.</p>

I live at 100, Wood Street, Cheapside, and am a silk buyer—on 29th November, 1866, I was married to Louisa Maude Owen, at St. Saviour's Church, Haverstock Hill—in February, 1867, we were residing at 6, Durnford Villas, Wandsworth, and continued to do so till the following November—in the month of August, in company with my wife and Mr. Searle, I rowed up the river to Oxford—I left my wife's cousin, Fanny Searle, and the servant in charge of my house—at that time I was under the impression that my wife was with child—we were at Oxford on Saturday, 17th August—my wife had been unwell for a day or two prior to that, and on the Saturday she left me to return to town; I saw her off by the train—Mr. Searle and I remained behind to bring the boat back—by the following Wednesday we had rowed as far as Windsor—from there I sent a telegram to my wife and received one—I arrived home on Wednesday the 21st, and found my wife in bed—Mrs. Skeplehorn was with her and a baby—I, of course, congratulated my wife upon her safe delivery—the child was shown to me, and Mrs. Skeplehorn congratulated me on my wife's being confined; she presented the child to me, and said it was very much like me—I first saw William Skeplehorn a day or two afterwards in my kitchen—he congratulated me on the birth of the child, and made a similar remark to that his wife had done; he also told me he was out of work, and could I give him some old clothes, or be of some assistance to him—I gave money for the nurse; it was arranged to be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I paid the first part of the money to my wife, in the presence of Mrs. Skeplehorn; it was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I certainly regarded the child as my own—it lived with me about six months, till February, 1868—I continued to support it till last November—in consequence of something I heard I went to 78, York Road, Lambeth, where the prisoners lived; that was about February or March, 1868; I went twice that day; I saw the wife on the first occasion in the afternoon; in consequence of what she said, I returned in the evening and then saw both the prisoners together—I insisted upon their telling me the truth of the transaction that had happened, that I was informed it was a false confinement, and the child was not mine, and that they were privy to it—Skeplehorn said that be should tell me nothing about it himself, that the proper person to apply</p>

               <p>I to was the midwife—I pressed him to tell me the name and address of the midwife—he refused to do so, stating that he did not know the address or the name—I told him that I felt certain he did, and the expression that his wife had made use of in the course of the afternoon confirmed me in that opinion—we had words—I pressed him very much—I was accom<lb/>panied by Mr. Searle—I went for a policeman—the inspector thought it was a case in which a policeman should not interfere, and I returned to the house again; I pressed Skeplehorn again, and he refused point blank to tell me anything at all—I told him it was a serious offence, and I should use my utmost efforts to make him tell the truth, and he said I might do my best or my worst—in November, 1869, I called again with Mr. Lewis, my solicitor—he tells me it was on 19th October—I saw them both together, the wife first, and the husband afterwards; they were both together at the end of the interview, and each heard what the other said—I pressed them again to acknowledge the truth of this; from the circumstances that had taken place I felt more certain now than before that it was a false con<lb/>finement, and they were perfectly cognisant of the facts—they said they would tell me nothing; they repeated the statement about finding the midwife—I threatened them several times with punishment, and they said when I brought them up it would be time enough to speak' the truth, and they did not care if they did get five years.</p>

I am head nurse at the Newington Workhouse—on Tuesday, 21st August, Mrs. Ironside called on me at the workhouse—the interview I had with her was alone; but I believe she was accompanied—in consequence of what passed between us I met her at the Waterloo Station, about 6 o'clock that evening (I had, to the best of my recollection, delivered a girl named Fanny Wood, at the workhouse, of a female child, on 29th July) we got out at Clapham Junction, and proceeded in a cab to her house, 6, Durnford Villas, Wandsworth—we called on our way at A butcher's shop, and purchased a sheep's pluck—at the house I found Mrs.</p>
