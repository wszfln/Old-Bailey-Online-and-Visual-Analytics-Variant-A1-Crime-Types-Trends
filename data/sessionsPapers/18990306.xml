I come from the Criminal Investigation Department, Scotland Yard—on February 7th I was with other officers in Broadway, Stratford, and saw the prisoner—I stopped him and told him I should take him for uttering on or about December 10th a counterfeit half-sovereign to Mr. Plumb, of Edgware, and toother persons in the Metropolitan District—he said, "Tell me the times and places, and I will prove an alibi"—I said, "I don't know the times; the places are Edgware, Harrow, Leyton, and Croydon"—he made no reply—I left him with Sergeant Mott, and went and searched his lodgings, 31, Chapel Street, Stratford, but found nothing relating to this case—I con<lb/>veyed him to King's Cross Station, and on February 6th Mrs. Plumb came—there and at once identified him from amongst thirteen or fourteen other men—I then took him to Edgware, and on the way he said, "I know—the man you want for uttering the Jubilee sixpences; he is about my age, has a fair moustache like me, and dresses like me. I have had bete with him, and on one occasion I rode with him in a train, and heard him tell people in the carriage that he had some Jubilee sixpences. He is not so tall as I am"—that statement was voluntary—he was then charged at Edgware, and said to Mrs. Plumb, "What time of day was it?" She said, "Between four and a quarter past four." He said, "That will do"—the charge was read over to him, and he made no reply.</p>

On February 23rd I attended at Reading Gaol and took down a statement by Joseph Harris, which he signed—he made a second statement in the presence of the. prisoner's solicitor at Newgate, which he also signed—I produce the originals—on February 17th the prisoner wrote to the Commissioner of Police as follows:—" Sir: With regard to the offences I am charged with, and which I am entirely inno<lb/>cent of, I feel I cannot do more than explain something of what my friends intend to do in this matter. This cutting of the paper I send you, and for which the person is committed for trial. My friends will not leave a stone unturned, let me tell you, to help me out of these serious crimes. I have also sent you a copy of some of the witnesses who will attend to give evidence on my behalf, and I may state if these were called. Believe me, sir, there are are a good many more who saw me that day, and who will be subpoenaed to attend. Every one of these are respectable people, as the police well know; in fact, the police know some of them. As I am certain, or nearly so, of this being the man that is wanted for the crimes I am charged with, I am willing to make a state<lb/>ment to the police of what I know: in fact, my statement can be substantiated by three more persons. I have instructed <hi rend="italic">my</hi> friends to consult my legal adviser with regard to my defence, and I am sure out of the 400 spectators, who were with me nearly all the time on December 12th, will see me sent to prison innocent without acquaint<lb/>ing the proper authority of what they know. Never was such a blunder made, as all the police know. This is no business of mine. They know I have been betting these five years, whenever there was racing I was always there, and I never missed going to a <hi rend="italic">whippet</hi> meeting this last twelve months on a Monday, which they all well know. If you will allow Mr: Sergeant Williamson and Inspector Mott, of Wapping, to see me I will give them all the information concerning what I know of this man, and who I am sure is the very man. In fact when the man is seen you will say what an extraordinary resemblance he bears to me. The information I will give them will be valuable indeed, and it will prove my entire</p>

               <p>innocence without a doubt. What I want, and my friends also, is a pro<lb/>per, just and fair chance of proving my innocence, that is all. You can rest assured the matter will drop on my part. I shall be anxious to be released and say no more about it; but if I get convicted I can assure you, Sir, of my entire innocence, and I have no doubt my friends will do all in their power to procure my release. Hoping you will grant the request I ask, I will now conclude by remaining your?, Henry Scott. P.S.—" When the man is seen at Warwiok; I have not the slightest doubt of him being the real man." Enclosed in the letter was the following cutting from a news-paper: "At Slough, yesterday, a man named Joseph Harris wag charged with uttering counterfeit coin at Slough and Eton. Evidence was given to the effect that the prisoner tendered gilded Jubilee sixpences as half-sovereigns at four shops, and that when arrested he had three spurious half-sovereigns in his possession. The accused, against whom previous convictions were proved, was committed for trial at the Warwick Assizes," and pinned to the newspaper cutting was the following list of names: "Ernie West, Squires, A. Barret, Jim Saunders (his clerk), Bill Faber, Ted Taylor, H. Hill, George Woods, Nat Levy, Jack Higgins, George Archer, Walter Massey, Soldier, Barnett Hyams, George Camp (his clerk), Arthur Mannie, Charley Rowe"—I went to Holloway, and the prisoner declined to answer my questions.</p>

I live at 31, Chapel Street, Stratford—the evidence of Mrs. Hancock and Mrs. Plumb is false—I am not the man who passed the gilded sixpences on December 10th and 12th—between 12.30 and 1 that day I met West and Squires in Stratford Broadway, and wo went to Davis's coffee-shop, and dined—we then went to Homer<lb/>ton, where the <hi rend="italic">whippet</hi> meeting was held—on the way Mr. Barnes over-took us on his bicycle—we got to the ground about 2.30, and remained till about twenty minutes to five—immediately I got there I stood on my box, and commenced to bet—I had a clerk whose name is John Almond.—I continued betting till the fourth heat for the last—I used a slate book that day which is generally used by bookmakers at <hi rend="italic">whippet</hi> meetings—there were 300 or 400 people at the meeting on December 12th—I was. known to almost all of them—I could not give the names of people I made bets with that day some of them I should only know by sight—the general topic of conversation that day was the fight—I had a bet on it—on the previous Saturday evening, December 10th, J made a bet on the fight with Mr. West outside his shop in the Leyton Road—it was about 7 o'clock—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. West was directed to leave the Court</hi>)—I laid him £6 10s. to £5 on Palmer, who won the fight—he paid me on the Tuesday following by cheque—on December 10th I went to a <hi rend="italic">whippet</hi> meeting at Tottenham Hale with Charley Rowe, a dog trainer and runner, and I was betting there all day and left with Rowe—I invited him to my house to have a wash, and then we went to Davis' coffee-shop to have something to eat—after that we walked to Leyton Road as far as West's shop—I then saw West, and made the bet on the fight—Rowe was with me standing two or three yards away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know the man Beagle by that name—he never communicated with me on February 17th or 18th—I wrote the letter of February 17th from Holloway Prison, and enclosed the news-paper cutting—I got the cutting from the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>, which was brought to me by a person named Lowe—he is not "Beagle"—he is a race-course tipster—I did not give the information spoken of in my letter, because my brother told me not to do so unless I had advice from Counsel—I saw my brother before Inspector Hare's visit on February 23rd—I am known by the nickname of "Badger"—when Sergeant Williamson arrested me on February 4th he never charged me with ottering counter<lb/>feit coin on December 12th; he said, "I will take you into custody on suspicion of uttering a counterfeit half-sovereign on or bout——"—I did not say in answer, "Tell me the time and place and I will prove an alibi" or anything like it—when I was going to Edgware with Sergeant Williamson I did not say to him, "I know the man who is wanted for uttering the Jubilee sixpences; he is about my age; has a fair moustache: like I have; dressed like me, and I have made bets with him, and on one occasion rode with him in the train, and I remember his telling some men in the carriage that he had some gilded sixpences"—I mentioned something like that after hearing the evidence in the Croydon case, after February 15th; I said it while we were going back to Holloway in the train; it may have been February 8th or 15th. Harris is no particular friend of mine; I have seen him twice lately—the first time I recollect seeing him was, I believe, on January 15th, going down to Plumpton</p>

               <p>races; I do not know whether he got in the train the same time as me or not—I do not keep a banking account——I did not give evidence at the North London Police-court—I said to Sergeant Nicholls in reply to the charge, "I know nothing about it; I am innocent"—I was advised in Holloway, after I was committed, that if anything was brought against me in the meanwhile, I should communicate with my Counsel—the solicitor who is conducting my defence was merely watching the case at the North London Police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I received notice at Holloway the day before I was brought up at North London that I was going to be charged with a new offence; that was all the time I had to prepare a defence—I say Mrs. Hancock did not identify me; she did not touch me, as everyone else did—I wrote the letter of February 17th without anybody's advice what<lb/>ever—I was afterwards advised by my solicitor and Counsel to give no information to anybody until I had seen them, and it was acting on this advice, when Inspector Hare came, that I declined to answer his questions—it was February 8th or 15th I had the conversation with Sergeant Williamson in the train; it was coming from Holloway—when I was arrested I did not use the word, "alibi"—I said, "If you tell me the day I will prove where I was"—I had not instructed my solicitor to call Almond as a witness, as I had been informed he has been convicted of dishonesty—that is the only reason.</p>

On January 31st, about 9.30, I went to Islington Workhouse with Detective Eason—I saw the prisoner—I told him we were police officers and were making enquiries about a woman named Young who had left the workhouse on the 30th and who had been found with her throat cut near Caledonian Road the same evening—he said, "Yes;"—I said, "I believe you left this work-house together yesterday morning"—he said "We did not leave together, I met her outside"—I noticed he had some scratches on his face and asked him how he accounted for them—he said "I had a fight with a man named Desborough outside the Queen in Hornsey Road; he left the workhouse with me. Mrs. Young was with me when I had the fight. Desborough went away with <hi rend="italic">Curley</hi> Jones and me, and the woman Young went to several public-houses; I was with her till 8 o'clock that night, we were in the public-house just over the canal bridge in Caledonian Road on the right hand side going towards King's Cross. Two men were having a row there; one was the man who gave her away when she was married. I went out and that is the last I saw of her; I then went back to Islington, and got here about half-past eleven"—I asked him where his clothes were, and he took me to the; receiving ward where he showed me the clothes he had been wearing—they were shown to the doctor—there were what appeared to be marks of blood on the trousers, and the coat was very muddy—I asked him how he accounted for the</p>

               <p>marks, and he said he got them in the fight with Desborough—he also-handed me this cloth case containing two razors, a pair of scissors, a piece-of slate, a shaving-brush and a comb—he said he had got three razors, but-one was missing, he had lost it in the house, as he had done the hair-cutting and shaving, for some of the inmates—he said he had a pocket knife, but I could not find that—I told him I was not satisfied with his statement, and should arrest him on suspicion of attempting to murder the woman by cutting her throat—I took him to the Holloway Station—he said, "I know nothing' about it."</p>

She was turned out of a public-house. I left her and went into the Pentonville Road, and went home"—I told him he answered the description of the man wanted, and I should take him to King's Cross Police-station—I took him there, and at 3 p.m. the same day he was placed among other men, and picked out by Eliza Webster—then I charged him with attempting to murder Emily Young—he made no reply.</p>

I live at 9, Goldsmith Street, with my son and daughter, in the second floor back room—I got to know the prisoner last summer at the Marble Arch; I sell flowers there on Sundays—he minded traps and cabs and did odd jobs—he first came to my room on Christmas morning—my boy had just come out of the hospital; he has got his finger off his right hand—I told the prisoner he might come about 7 a.m. and help my son on with his coat and polish his boots—he came three or four times a week—he would stay till I went to market, and I told him to lock the door and leave the key downstairs, which he did—I used to give him some food, and sometimes a little money—he said he was living in the Salvation Army Shelter, in Edgware Road—I remember him coming on Monday, January 23rd, at 7 a.m.—my son went out at 8 o'clock, my daughter went to school at 9 o'clock, and I left at 10 o'clock and went in-to Mrs. Sheedy's room next door, whose baby had been christened the day before; we had had a little drink the night before, and something that morning—when I left my room about 10 o'clock, the prisoner was stand<lb/>ing by the fire, lighting his pipe—I said, "How long will you be here?"—he said, "I shall be going at dinner time"—I said, "Turn the key in the door"—I stayed in Mrs. Sheedy's room till 1 o'clock—no one was in my room except the prisoner—the floor was nice and olean, and all tidied up—this knife I used for shelling walnuts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK HOWES</hi>. I am a clerk of 57, Shakespeare Road, Acton—the girl Perry came to my house on February 6th and remained there till February 13th as a lodger—she left on the morning of February 13th—she was turned out by my wife because she did not pay her way—she did not pay what she owed when she left—on the evening of the 13th my wife handed me an unopened letter in a envelope which I cannot find; it was addressed to me and I think marked "Private"—I found this letter inside, "Sir,—I was very much surprised to hear of your extremely dis<lb/>graceful conduct towards Miss F. Perry, a great friend of mine. What is the meaning of it? You are probably aware that a term of imprisonment is the penalty for a criminal ofifence or even the attempting of such an offence. But before taking any action in the matter I think it only right that you should have an opportunity of settling the matter privately, and you ought at least to pay the girl a sum of money, say £2 or so. I must add that if you don't agree to settle the matter in this way I shall certainly call and see you (or your wife), and if I do you may rely upon my doing my utmost to make matters 'horribly unpleasant' for you. Lest you should think I am writing this merely to frighten you, I must add that I have several friends (solicitors by profession) who would advise me what steps to take on behalf of Miss Perry, and I have also the necessary capital, and in the event of your not coming to some terms privately with the girl you will have cause to regret it.—Yours faithfully,<hi rend="smallCaps">A FRIEND</hi>,"—on the evening of the next day I saw Perry at the door of another house in the street—I went down and said to her, "I want to know who wrote that letter"—she refused to tell me—I said, "There are ways and means of making you tell"—a police-sergeant came up, and I asked him if he would wait and I would show him a letter which this girl had caused to be written—the girl was present then—I went indoors and got the letter, which I showed to the policeman, who then took her into custody—I never went into the girl's bedroom when she was in my house—I was never guilty of any impropriety—I did not speak ten words to her.</p>

Last Saturday night I received burne in getting two persons out of a tire—I went to a clothes shop to buy some-clothes; they said, "Come with us, if we bring any one they expect a commission"—I believe he gave the other man a shilling—when we came out he said, "What are you following me for, I will give you a shilling"—I said, "I don't want your shilling"—I went home and laid on the bed; my mother woke me up and asked me to have a cup of tea—I went out and met one of these girls who said that the man I was with was locked up for being drunk but they had let him out, and the prosecutor came up and said, "That is one of the men who robbed me "; and the policeman took me—I never laid my hand on that constable unless it was when he-twisted my hand and I put it on his chest; you see these two burns which I received.</p>

Trent following my former occupation, in the potteries, where I met with Arthur Hayman, a coachman, and had been living with him for six months as his wife—I came to London on February 12th to get rooms, as</p>

Browne—sometimes Berkeley brought them and sometimes Worfolk—I knew the circulation of the paper and I knew I was signing inaccurate certificates—nothing was said at the time why I was to sign them—they brought them down and said, "Will you kindly sign these?" and I signed them and handed them back—I never saw anyone else except Berkeley or Worfolk in regard to them—I remember my name was taken off the paper for a time—no reason was given me at the time.</p>

B. Browne rely on newspaper proprietors, do you? we have other means of gauging the figures"—I asked him what 1 should do—he said, "Well, so long as the figures on the certificates equal or exceed those on our guarantee the checking clerk has nothing to do but pass the account"—I said I did not put in the exact figures because I did not know them, Mr. Morgan's offer to me was that I should have £500 a year, and I was to provide a brougham—the guarantee was to be £520, there being 5 per cent, on the gross income and no liability on my</p>

In May, 1897, exact figures were asked for, and I went and saw the checking clerk, and he said the circulation was not less than a certain number"—that was after I had seen Mr. Dover—Worfolk did not say he could not sign the certificates, because the figures in then were not the actual cir<lb/>culation—he did not say the circulation was only 70,000—it is an absolute invention to say that I said, "It is only a matter of form; you had better sign"—even considering the time the papers had been started we did not pet on at all well with the circulation; we seemed to stick—I thought <hi rend="italic">Domestic Life's</hi> first issue was 310,000—I believe I inserted that fact in <hi rend="italic">the Daity Mail</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Echo</hi>—Mr. Morgan did not write to me when he saw those advertisements, and tell me to stop them because the real issue was only 70,000—I might have written to him apologising, and saying I could not stop the advertisements without exciting comment from Mr. Dover, Morgan, Worfolk and I had frequent conversations as to the unsatisfactory circulation of the papers—I asked Mr. Morgan what the circulation was, because my suspicions were aroused—I cannot say when—I might have asked Rogers or Worfolk but I accepted my employer's word—I could not call him a liar—I did not think him one—the original. contracts of February 2nd, 1897, were arranged with Mr. Dover, and signed by him—before the contract of July 23rd, 1897, some man from Worfolk told me the circulation had gone up nearly 100,000—I wrote a letter on January<lb/>5th, 1897, to Morgan, saying the £14 paid was extremely cheap-Mr. Morgan told me he had letters from shools of people, who regarded him with affectionate interest—I did not ask Worfolk to sign a certificate of circulation after the paper had gone into liquidation—I suggested to Worfolk on August 11th that the other certi<lb/>ficates should be sent out at once, otherwise Browne and Co. would be writing for them to the Official Receiver—Worfolk Hid not say that as the Accounts would be collected by the Official Receiver he must be the person to send out the certificates—I may have written a letter to Worfolk—I said he must sign the certificates if he wished the money to be got in quickly—I do not think I wrote saying that if he did not soon do something the whole matter would come out—I did not say that if he did not sign the certificates he would be placed in a very awkward position with Mr. Dover.</p>

I am 45 years old, married and with five children—for twenty years I was in the service of Goff and Company in the Strand—I was cashier for twelve years—in March, 1897,1 entered the service of <hi rend="italic">Architecture, Limited</hi>, at a salary of 50s. a week—Mr. Morgan was the managing director—I undertook the accountant's, work on the then new paper, <hi rend="italic">Domestic Life</hi>—I was not paid for that till July, 1897—<hi rend="italic">Architecture</hi> and the Morgan Newspaper Company had offices in the same building—in July 1897, Mr. Faichney, the cashier and accountant Co the Morgan Newspaper Company, retired, and I was appointed in his place at £3 a week and a 10s. weekly rise—I also received £1 10s. from <hi rend="italic">Architecture</hi>—I occupied the same room as Mis. Nunn—the first certificate I signed was in July, 1895—Berkeley came to me in the room where I and Miss Nunn sat, and brought me the typed certificates and asked me to sign them—reading them, I noticed the figures did not agree with the day book, which I had recently written, up—I showed Berkeley the day book, and that the figures did not agree, and I demurred to sign them—he said it was <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> and customary in the trade to have the certificates without reference to the correctness—he said Faichney always signed them—in consequence I signed the certificates on Mr. Berkeley's assurance—I had known Faichney for four or five months, and I knew he bore a high character—I had never signed, certificates anywhere else—I never knew that there was any guarantee whatsoever to anybody as to the circulation of <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Domestic Life</hi> until after the winding up of the Company—I had never seen the, written contract or a copy of it between the Company and Messrs. Browne—I considered Mr. Berkeley to be my superior—he had control of the advertising department—I did not gain anything by signing the certi<lb/>ficates—on March 21st, 1898,1 was appointed a director of the company—the qualification of a director, by the Articles of Association, was that he must hold shares to the value of £100, and if he does not he must. cease to be a director—I never possessed a share in this company, and. so never qualified as a director, and ceased to be one on June 21st, 1898, but I had in the meantime mentioned the matter to my solicitor, and, upon his advice, I did not qualify—I only attended one meeting—I had a con<lb/>versation with Mr. Berkeley when the company went into liquidation, and I refused to sign any more certificates—he suggested the advisability of sending in the ceritificates, otherwise T. B. Browne would be writing to the. Official Receiver for them—I wrote a letter to Messrs Browne on January 22nd, 1899—when I signed the certificates I had not the slightest idea that.

B. Browne, Limited, and got a cheque from them for £200 on May 12th, 1898—I asked them to pay it in advance—I do not remember saying to Mr. Wann then that the certificate would be forwarded in due course, according to the contract—I have called on several occasions for cheques—on one occasion I took the certificates to show that I was justified in getting the payments—I took them there with a view of pro<lb/>curing the cheque—I think I signed certificates after I became a director—I signed them right up to the liquidation, but I was only nominal direc<lb/>tor then—after I became a director I was still under the orders of Ber<lb/>keley as regards the advertising department, not as regards directorship—I did not think I was doing anything wrong in signing the certificates—after the company went into liquidation I did not see why I should sign the certificates—the books were out of my hands and in charge of the Official Receiver, and if he was going to quote the assets he must deal with Messrs. T. B. Browne—as it was a matter of form, I did not see why I should sign them any more if the company got into difficulties—Berkeley asked me to sign certificates twice.</p>

Berkeley repeated his request to me to send in the usual certificates before the Official Receiver applied for them, and told me that if I did not send them in his position with Mr. Dover would be a very awkward one for the obtaining of future orders—in addition to those two interviews, I have also received this letter from Berkeley—I am inclined to think the interviews were after the letter which is dated August 16th. (<hi rend="italic">This letter contained the following passage</hi>: "It will not do to have T B. Browne and Co. asking the Official Receiver for the usual certificates of circulation for July. This question will not be raised at all if you send those who usually have them the usual form without waiting request from checking clerk. The figures must be over 200,000 for A. and over 150,000 for D.L.")in the first place when Berkeley asked me to sign the certificates I demurred to doing so—I said, "I do not like to sign certificates which are not true," or words to that effect—I pointed out to Berkeley that in the case of <hi rend="italic">Domestic Life</hi> the first issue was only 70,000 of the first number, and that there had been a gradual decrease since then—he said it was customary to sign exaggerated statements, and that my predecessor Mr. Fiachney had always signed them for twelve months previous to myself, but had</p>

               <p>only signed them for <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes</hi>—I was present at several meetings at which Berkeley was present, when the decrease in the circulation of both papers and the means of increasing it were the subject of discussion—they were informal meetings, at places of refreshment—on one occasion Mr. D.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Before I received the letter of August 16th I did not know it was considered necessary by anybody that certificates over a certain amount should be given to Messrs. Browne or anyone else—I knew they were exaggerated, but I had no stipulation as to any increase—I had no idea that any contracts existed between Messrs. Browne, and Morgan Limited—I believe the conversations were after that letter, probably within a few days; events at that period were very rapid—the liquidation was on the 9th, and I was busy—I refused to sign the certifi<lb/>cates, and went at once to Mr. Morgan, and had a conversation with him on the subject—after that I went to the Official Receiver in the liquida tion, and had, a conversation with him, which had reference to the fact of these certificates having been issued, and I said that I took some certi<lb/>ficates to Messrs. Browne—I do not think I quite understood the question put to me—I cannot positively say that I did not take some there—when I took them I had no idea of the advertising contracts, or tne terms or conditions, of it—in almost all cases Rogers, the printer and publisher of the paper, signed the certificates first, and I signed afterwards as accountant—I had no salary except the £3 a week—I had nothing from my three months directorate—the meetings referred to were for thepur<lb/>pose of discussing how the circulation could be raised—they were not re<lb/>gular meetings.</p>

I was employed at this time in the office of Mr. Woodham, a public broker—prior to February 10th I had lent £3 to Maud in two sums of 30s. two weeks previously—I went to his shop on 11th February to collect the £3—I asked him if he could let me have the £3 I lent him; he said he was in difficulties and told me he bad falsified his books and was in a little bit of ouble—I told him he was very foolish—I got there about 12.45—Maud and I had dinner together underneath the shop and then came up into the shop again, and Maud sent the boy out on two occasions and when he came back the second time he wrote a letter and sent him out with it—when the boy had gone, Maud said, "I have sent him to your house with a lettern—I said, "What for?"—he said, "I want to have a talk to you;" or "to get him out of the way"—I said, "You should not have done that"—I had no reason for sending a letter to my house—Maud then asked me to get him a couple of sacks, as Mr. Crick was coming and he wanted to clear up the place—I thought he had got some rubbish downstairs that he wanted to clear up—he gave me a shilling to pay for the sacks and I brought them back—he said he had rather a heavy stock of good boots and suggested that I should purchase some—he showed me some guinea boots at 16s. a pair, and I agreed to take 6 pairs and have a month's credit—it was an ordinary transaction—I did say that the windows were plastered with bills—I never suggested his having a fire or a burglary—I stayed with him till about 4.30 I should say, and then I left with one parcel of boots, which I left at the Criadera—I agreed to meet Maud at 7.30 and spend the evening with him—I went back about 7.45 and waited for him—he came out with his trade books under his arm, and also the other parcel of boots and his leather bag—I took the boots—I fetched the others from the Criadera—we went to Simmons, Gower Street, and I left the boots there—I had no private conversation with Simmons; I simply asked him to mind the boots—I bought them to sell again—it is usual when you buy boots to take them away—we then got on a 'bus and went to Hanway Street, and Maud said, "I shall go to see a friend of mine," and</p>

               <p>we parted about 8.30—he said he would see me at 10.30. I went to the Oxford Music Hall. I did not keep the appointment at 10.30. I left the Oxford a little after 11 and went to the Horseshoe and had a steak, and then went to the Excelsior public-house in Charing Cross Road, opposite the Oxford, where I had a glass of bitter and a cigar, and then I went house to Kilburn—he gave me the £3 he owed me when we were having dinner, that was all the next morning I called in at Chancery Lane, and Maud said he had had the burglary. I said I was very sorry—we went and had a drink and I left him. I was with him about five minutes—when I was arrested I said, "You are joking; will you have a drink?"I thought he was joking; he was introduced to me somet time before. I know nothing about a glass cutter—I certainlyneveragreed with Mand to carry out this supposed forcible entry into his masters premises.</p>

"Take this to the Criadera, I will pack the other one presently"—I got to the Criadera about 5o'clock, or it might have been 5.30, and I left the parcel there—it was about 7.30 when I feltched them away-Miss Ball made a little mistake in the time—Maud brought the other parcel with him, about 7.40 or 7.45—Maud told me he had falsified his master's books; not that he had robbed his master—I did not give a though to why he had doneso—I said, "You have been very foolish"—it was not my business to ask him—he did not say what kind of diffculty he was in—he sold the boots to me on credit him—he did not—he had sold me two or three lots of boots before—I did not think he was paying me £3 with his master's money; I had not the least idea—I heard Mand's statement read over by Haynes, in which he entered into all the details about the sham burglary—I made no comment on it to the policeman—all I said was. "You only gave me £3"—I said I knew some<lb/>thing about the boots, in a measure, and nothing about the cheques—it is decidedly untrue that I advised Maud to have this burglary, or to take the books home to get rid of them; or that I advised a fire in the first place—I am not in business on my own account, I am with Mr. Wood<lb/>man—I have been with him since September 6th, 1897.</p>

I keep a baker's shop at 267, Upper Kennington Lane—on January 31st—about 7.30 p.m., the prisoner made a purchase and gave me a half-crown—I gave him the change and he left—I found it was bad, and followed him, and did not lose sight of him—he ran up Henry Street, which has no outlet, and turned back, and I charged him with passing a bad half-crown—he said that if I did not make a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> he would give me 3s.—I said that I wanted my change back—he gave me 2s. 5d. and asked for his half-crown—I refused and kept with him, and gave him to the police with the coin.</p>
