                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman J</hi> 436). On the night of 21st July about 8.45 I was called to the Light Horse, Staines Road, Hounslow, and found a woman there drunk and disorderly, whom I know now as the deceased—I at last turned her out of the house, and asked the prisoner to take her away as I understood he was her husband—he was not the worse for drink—I asked him if it was his wife—he said "Yes, and my name is Henry Lock; we live at Halliford"—they left together in the direction of Bedfont—on the same night, about 10.10, I received information, went to Dockwell Lane, half a mile from the public-house, and saw the woman lying down with her head resting on the prisoner's legs—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Oh, she is drunk again"—I asked him if he could get her away—he said that he would try—I did not see her move—I found she was perfectly helpless—I did not know that she was dead—she smelt very strongly of drink, and I sent for a stretcher, which came about 11.20, and she was carried on it to the Huzzar beershop—while the people had gone for the stretcher Taylor told me in the prisoner's hearing that at 9.30 he had seen him kick her. in the side or the stomach—the prisoner said nothing then—I struck a lucifer, examined the woman, and found she did not move—the prisoner said "If she dies, and I think she is <hi rend="italic">a going</hi>, I shall say she died from heart disease, for she told mo a fortnight ago when she went she should go all in a moment; but she is drunk, she has been drinking run all day; she will be all right when she has had her sleep out, she often lays like that for four or five hours"—before the stretcher came, Dr. Evans came and reported that she was dead—the prisoner is a dealer, gathering rags and bones—I saw this knife on the ground.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Hounslow—I was called about 12.30 on this night and found the deceased by the side of the road—she had been dead about an hour—she was carried to a public-house, where I examined her, but found no marks of violence—I have since made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found a tumour on the liver—it was not a drunkard's liver—there was also disease of the lungs, heart, and blood-vessels—from the state in which I found the heart a kick would have a tendency to produce death—I think the immediate cause of death was syncope, a fatal fainting—any shock to the system would produce syncope, either physical violence or mental excitement, in the state in which she was, but she might have died suddenly at any time independent of any external cause—if she had been kicked and died immediately I should not expect to find a mark.</p>

Crawcour maintained their right to have their goods which had not been paid for—this prosecution was instituted by me, at the desire of all the creditors—I cannot tell you whether that is in writing, that is between them and their solicitor—no communication in writing came to me—Mr. Urry, of Ventnor, gave me verbal authority in my office, that I positively swear—I did not know till February last that the prisoner was alleged to have sworn that he saw the deed executed—I believe the Vice-Chancellor said that he considered me a very litigious person—I have not paid all the cost of these proceedings, but I have paid many hundreds of pounds, and in order to intimidate me an execution was put into my house by Hickson, Ward, and Co., the prime movers in this case—we wore going to prosecute for perjury before the case came on before Vice-Chancellor Malins, but under the advice of our solicitor, Mr. Urry, we did not—that was in February last—the question of whether the defendant was present or not was raised by the Vice-Chancellor, who said that he would have it tried by a jury if it was pertinent to the case—we decided to have the defendant prosecuted before it came before the Vice-Chancellor—I was not in Court when the Vice-Chancellor delivered judgment, I was in the Isle of Wight—I read it, but I did not know then, nor did I hear, that the Vice-Chancellor had come to the conclusion that the defendant was right—it did not occur to me that the Jury who tried him would not have the advantage of hearing him, that his mouth would be closed—it is the first case of the kind I have been in—I did not know that he might not be examined—I heard Mr. Salter examined before the County Court Judge at Ryde—I did not tell the Vice-Chancellor that I had an indemnity—I believe I named Ind, Coope, and Co., of Burton-upon-Trent, among the creditors, but I named twenty others—I knew that there was a bill of sale eight or nine days after I was appointed receiver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Newport, Isle of Wight—I acted as solicitor to Mr. Salter—on 7th January I went to the Queen's Hotel, Ventnor—I went into the coffee-room first—the two Salters were there, and the defendant, Mr. Cox, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Norman—in the coffee-room I was introduced to Mr. Norman as Mr. Crawcour's solicitor—I asked him to let me look over the deed—I was nearly an hour examining it, and the servants came in to lay the cloth at luncheon-time, and we went into the other room—I did not notice any conversation in the coffee-room between anybody there and the defendant—we went into the other room, and I said to Salter, "If I were you I would not execute that deed; the terms are so stringent you will never be able to meet the requirements; you</p>

               <p>may as well sign your death-warrant as that"—he said, "There is another deed which they can put in force against me"—I said, "Well, do as you like I advise you not to sign it," and after a good deal of talking the defendant went out of the room—Salter then signed it, and Norman said, "Let us have a glass of sherry together," and we met him in the passage, and he said, "Have you got the deed signed?" and I said "Yes."

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I put the interview down in my diary—I never made any bill of costs, as I knew that it was of no use charging my client any<lb/>thing—I was telegraphed for to go to Ventnor, and he paid my railway fare, and I had a glass of sherry and a bit of bread and cheese—my attention was first called last November to the fact whether the defendant was present—my attention had not been called to the matter from June, 1878, to November, 1879, nor had I any note in writing of the transaction itself—I think Mr. Richards called on me about it in November, but I have no note of it—he named it to me when I called at his office in Newport, but I do not think we discussed whether the defendant was present or not—he asked me, I think, whether I remembered whether Mr. Crawcour was in the room at the time he was signing it, and I told him he was not—he did not tell me why he asked the question—I had not been consulted about any of the previous proceedings—I had heard nothing about it from January to November last year, except when Mr. Salter filed his petition in bankruptcy—I swore him to the affidavits as a commissioner authorised to administer oaths—mine is a pretty good memory—I read the deed for the purpose of advising my client upon it, but it is so long ago and I have had so many deeds since—I believe it was an indenture of lease which was granted to the Salters—I do not say it, but it recited the lease—it purported to convey by way of mortgage to Mr. Smith the indenture of lease, and Smith was to pay 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to discharge the encumbrances, so as to save it for Messrs. Salter, but they might come in in a few hours and take possession of everything—Mr. Salter mentioned that there was a former deed from Mr. Rule—I believe the arrangement was that Mr. Rule's 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid off, but I have not seen it for the last two years—I do not know whether the encumbrance was paid off; I never saw any money pass—there is a clause enabling Messrs. Crawcour to come in at any time—it was ageed that the bill of sale was not to be registered for 18 days, to give Salter time to look out and get his money somewhere else, and then he would have paid them off.</p>

               <p>defendant were there—I asked the defendant what right he had to interfere as I was putting his father off in lieu of the hiring agreement—he behaved like a dog at my heels—I have no doubt he felt annoyed at my remarks, and I told him to get out of my presence, I was dealing with Mr. Smith's solicitor, not with him—when we got into the other room Mr. Norman's clerk was there, and my son, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Cox, and the defendant—I said to the defendant, "You go away, and do not interfere; I will pay your father the money"—he withdrew, and I closed the door after him—all the rest were left in the room—the deed was on the table, and Mr. Rhodes was perusing it—I signed it first, after a good deal of reluctance, and my son, Mr. Rhodes, and Mr. Norman signed it as attesting witnesses—the defendant was not in the room then; he had left at my request—I sub<lb/>sequently took proceedings to set aside the deed—I was in Vice-Chancellor Malins's Court on 26th January, 1878, and was represented by Counsel—I saw the defendant in Court, and saw him leave the Court hurriedly—after that I became bankrupt—I was examined when this action was heard before Vice-Chancellor Malins in April last, and saw the defendant sworn—he gave evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined as a witness at Ryde in August, 1878, and gave an account of this transaction—I was asked what the document was which I signed—I said that it consisted of seven skins—I said nothing about the trustees—the purport of what I said was that there was a legal gentleman present, and I thought if I signed it it would be my death-warrant, and I did not know what to do; if I did not the parties would stop in possession—I dare say I was asked how many were present—I never said that Herbert Crawcour was present, because I objected to his being there, but he was in the hotel—I very likely said in the Vice-Chancellor's Court. "After Crawcour had gone out of the room it is very likely he came in again, but if he did Mr. Norman would order him out"—I cannot account for the words, I am so excitable under this case—the defendant never came into the room again after he was ordered out, but I met him in the passage afterwards—I said, "When we left the coffee-room and adjourned into the other room I believe it was Mr. Norman ordered him out"—that is correct—I cannot say whether Mr. Norman ordered him out; my memory fails me—I may even have said, "It is very likely Mr. Norman would order him out," but I know he was not present when the deed was signed because I should not have signed it—I have been bankrupt once, and have filed a petition twice for liquidation—when I met my creditors I believe there was not much assets—I do not think the estate would realise anything—I failed in 1867, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I do not think I failed again in September, 1870, but I met my creditors and they met some assets—I only owed Messrs. Rule 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they got a mortgage out of me for 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in order to turn the hotel into a company—Mr. Smith arranged to advance 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and pay off what Rule had a claim for—it would not have come to my being sold up by Messrs. Rule but for that, but I dare say I told him so—I did not know that the 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to come out of Mr. Smith's pocket—I mean to say that I did not owe Messrs. Crawcour anything at that time—I had paid for 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and the carriage down to the Isle of Wight cost me about 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not in arrear in my payments, only 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, which was the balance of a bill I paid before it came due—while Rule was threatening to turn me out Messrs.

               <p>two instalments behind—I did not know till 12th January that the money to pay off the mortgage came out of Mr. Crawcour's pocket—I did not know from that time until last January that the defendant had sworn that he was present when the deed was executed—I never looked at the affidavit by which the deed was verified—I am not a lawyer, and my lawyer neglected it—I paid Tindal, a lawyer, 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all the money I had, but he would not work—Mr. Urry has not been my lawyer—I swear that Mr. Tindal has not acted for me since—I swore this affidavit, and the date is there (<hi rend="italic">January</hi> 29, 1878)—it was both Mr. Norman and I who ordered the defendant out of the room—I said at Vice-Chancellor Malins's Court that I ordered him out—I was very angry with him—I did not personally invite the defendant to lunch after the deed was signed—no doubt I invited the other gentlemen, and as they had to go to lunch they might as well come to me as to the Royal—he had two or three of his sons coming loafing down there—I pledge my oath that I saw Mr. Crawcour senior in and out of Court on the day that Mr. Locock Webb made an application to Vice-Chancellor Malins—Mr. Smith is a public-house broker—I believe he intro<lb/>duced Mr. Crawcour to me for the purpose of getting the furniture on the hire system; I am not quite sure—he is the person to whom I applied to get the money to pay off Rule—I attended the Newport County Court in my last bankruptcy in 1878, but not to get myself made bankrupt to defeat this deed; I was obliged to go there from force of circumstances; I was forced there by creditors both at Newport and Ryde—I did not get myself made bankrupt on purpose, but being in a deplorable position I assented to be made bankrupt—the first time I saw Mr. Rubenstein was when he was pointed out to me at the Court; he was with young Mr. Crawcour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Clarence Villa, Bedfont, I went to live there in October, 1878—on 30th December that year the prisoner and his wife came to reside next door in a house called Holly Lodge, a detached house stand<lb/>ing in its own garden, and about 30 feet from my house—on Saturday, 3rd July, I noticed that the blinds of the house were partly drawn up, and they continued in the same state up to the 13th—I had not seen anything of the prisoner or his wife during that week—on Sunday, the 11th, about 7 in the evening, I went round to the back of the prisoner's house; I got on a garden seat and looked through the window; I could not see anybody; I could see into the kitchen; I could see the table and I could see the clock going, and could hear it tick, and there was a basket of wood on the table; the next evening, Monday, I saw the prisoner peeping through the glass of the passage window upstairs, and I saw him two or three times in the course of the afternoon passing across the passage from one bedroom to the other—on the Tuesday afternoon, the 13th, he came to me and said he either thought Mrs. Catlin was dead or mad—he said "That d—d bitch has been mad again," and he asked me if I "would do him a favour, to send for Dr. Lundy; I did so—when sober the prisoner and his wife seemed on very good terms and fond of each other—I have frequently seen Mr. Catlin the worse for liquor, and Mrs. Catlin three or four times—I did not hear any noise in the prisoner's house during this time—I went into the house on the Tuesday after Mr. Lundy had gone—I saw Mrs. Catlin lying in the right-band room downstairs—at that time the prisoner appeared to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at Feltham, close to Bedfont—on Tuesday, 13th July, I was fetched to the prisoner's house about 3 o'clock—after knocking a second time the prisoner opened the door; he said "Who's there"—I said "The doctor"—he said "Come in"—I entered, and he relocked the door; he then opened the door of the right-band front room on the ground floor—he said "Come in and see a b—corpse"—he had the appearance of recovering from heavy drinking—I noticed a very bad smell—he sat down in the easy-chair by the side of the Replace; I saw the body of the deceased lying on the floor with her head towards the table and her feet towards the fireplace—she was entirely dressed except stockings—I said to him "Mr. Catlin, this is a serious matter"—he replied "She set herself on fire on Tuesday; I threw two pails</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On Tuesday, 13th July, about 3 in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house—I saw Dr. Lundy there, and saw the deceased lying on the floor—I found a quantity of clothes partially burnt, and a quantity in a dust-pan in the kitchen; it was tinder—there was an apron in the scullery, and some burnt clothing in the right-hind bedroom upstairs—I found this empty oil bottle lying down outside the back door—the clock was going—I took it to the police-station to test it; it will go nearly 30 hours; you pull up the weights when it runs down—I saw a moveable calendar in the back parlour, set for Wednesday the 7th—I took the prisoner into custody on the 15th, after the inquest—I told him I should charge him with culpable neglect and causing the death of his wife—he said "I have nothing more to say than I have said before the Coroner"—I was present at the inquest—the prisoner was called by the Coroner, and cautioned that what he said might be used in evidence against him—he made a statement, which was taken down and read over to him, and he signed it. (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoners Statement was read as follows</hi>: "I am a retired baker. The deceased was my wife. I was lying down very much afflicted with diarrhoea, and had taken some brandy and water. There was a scream, and when I went down I found her in the passage. She was alight. I threw some water over her. She was well enough to go up and take off her burnt rags and lie down. She come down again and sat in the easy-chair, as she was in the habit of doing. I had to lie down again afterwards, and when I came down she was lying on the floor and appeared to be dozing, when I found she got so bad. By the time I got down again she had been lying there a couple of days, I should think, and so I sent off for the doctor. I was very much to blame. I ought to have sent for a doctor before. It was three or four days, I should think, from the time she was burnt until she died. I can't say on what day she was burnt. It was about foe 8th or 9th, I think. I had nobody in the house. I had no servant.</p>

Close was appointed trustee—the act of bankruptcy was the liquidation petition—here is a statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt, showing liabilities 2,028<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and assets 515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the furniture and fittings at the office at Broad Street are mentioned among the assets at 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the furniture at Augusta Road is estimated to produce nil, being covered by a bill of sale dated 24th November, 1879, and registered 29th November, 1879—I find that on 11th February there was a private sitting for the examination of the bankrupt and others—the transcript of the shorthand writer's notes is here—I also find an Order of Court of March 9 setting aside the bill of sale.</p>

               <p>and came back, in consequence of what I heard from the last witness—finding some boots in the hedge, I concealed myself in a garden, about 150 yards from the back of the house where the burglary was—a little before this I had seen the prisoner going along the Green Road, close to this hedge where these boots were found—he walked up and down for five or six yards, pulled the twigs of the hedge aside, and looked in three or four times—I saw he was a stranger—I went to him and told him I should take him custody on suspicion of this burglary—I asked him if he had any knives or, boots about him—he said "No"—I searched him, and found this boot between his coat and waistcoat—I took him to the station—I subsequently examined the garden of Fern Lodge—I saw footprints there—several nails were out of the prisoner's boot, and the marks corresponded exactly with it—the prisoner's boot was very wet; so was the bottom of his trousers, and there were pieces of grass on the boot—I searched him at the station, and found a shilling on him—I took his shirt off—there were two moles on his back—he said "That is good enough, Maclntyre knows me well enough; only <hi rend="italic">come</hi> out two days ago; I had 10 months last time from Highgate for stealing tools"—he also said he had had seven years, and would as soon be in prison as out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector Y</hi>). I am stationed at Southgate—from information I received I went at 2.45 a m. to Mr. Turner's house—the back kitchen window was open; a pane of glass had been broken; the kitchen was in confusion—some brown paper had been pasted over the outside of a broken pane, and there was a hole through the brown paper sufficiently large to admit the arm—the window catch had been forced back; it could be reached easily by the arm—I saw footprints in the garden walk, which was very wet, as it had been raining the previous day; they were well defined; I covered them up—after the prisoner was charged I took his left boot off; I took it to the garden path, and im<lb/>pressed it by the side of the footprint I had covered up; it corresponded exactly; I noticed particularly the three nails in the heel of the boot—he was charged with stealing the boots and the knives—he said "I know nothing of the knives, those you will find."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the station when you were brought in—I think it was No. 40 came in with you—he made some such observation as "Here is the old man, I found this boot upon him"—I do not think that remark was answered—the other officer recognised you as the man he had searched and found nothing on—I am not aware that I silenced him; it would be my duty to do so if he was talking while a prisoner was there—No. 40 is not here—you said "I know nothing of the knives, you will find them"—I think those were the words, and not "They will find them for anything I know about them"—there were lots of marks made by your running in the garden walk—I took the measure of your boot, and the measure of the impression of some one's boot at the back of the house, and put it in the same print afterwards, and the nails fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had come from Edmonton on my way to Barnet. I could get no lodging, and found shelter in that road, where I must have</p>

               <p>slept for some time. I then went down the lane to search for running water, and saw two policemen; they said nothing to me. The young gentleman asked me if I saw anybody. I said "No." He asked if I knew where he could find a policeman, and I said "You will find two at the top of the lane." I picked up this boot, thinking it would fetch me a few halfpence I moved the bush about to reach it. I was taken into custody. There were four persons there, and the policeman never tried their shoes or his own. You will find a similarity in the nailing of boots in any shop, and I think it is cruel that a man should be convicted on this evidence. I saw two policemen at the top of the road, and if I was there I could not be at the prosecutors house, but they have taken care to keep that man back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman to the firm of Jesse Davidson Barker, and have been acting for them in this matter—I know the prisoner's writing—this letter contains the terms of the arrangement between my firm and the prisoner—the prisoner had a partner named Pretty in 1877—this is the prisoner's signature; he ceased to be Pretty's partner at the end of 1878, and in December, 1879, we received this stock list in the prisoner's writing, showing that he had 571 dozen umbrellas in stock—with a very trifling difference that is correct—this document is in the prisoner's writing: "May 30, 1879. Please let bearer have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on half-dozen umbrellas, and oblige G. A. W. Morton"—Messrs. Smith and Dimond are pawnbrokers of Newgate Street, and we have obtained several umbrellas from them—in consequence of instructions I came to London on April 19—this letter of April 30, 1879, is in Morton's writing, and is an order to Mr. Barker for 200 dozen umbrellas—this letter of 3rd September, 1879, is in the prisoner's writing; he says, "Stock wanted at once," and in this letter of September 6 he says, "Hope to see more stock next week, now is the time"—on 22nd September he writes, "I am working your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030039"/>
               <p>goods well just now"—I saw him on 21st April and he produced a bundle containing a number of pawn-tickets, and said that it was no use hiding it longer, he would make a clean breast of it—I asked him how he could do such a thing—he said that he was to blame, it was his own extravagance, and he had spent the money—I asked if he had disposed of any other goods; he said "I have, to job buyers and others," and that he had received the money and spent it—I said that I should telegraph to J. D. Barker—this letter of 22nd April is in his writing, in which he says that he cannot find words sufficient to express his sorrow—on 1st May I took out a summons at the Mansion House, returnable on the 10th—he did not appear, and I obtained a warrant, upon which he was brought up on the 24th, and remanded till 29th July—the 157 dozen pawn tickets he gave me represented 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—100 dozen had been pawned up to December 13, 1879, and partly by special contract—in consequence of his not appearing I redeemed about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, but could not redeem more as the tickets had expired—the manager or I had the whole of the pawn tickets, but we cannot find them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Barker is not here—I have invoiced goods direct to Pretty and Morton, but "Stock" has always been written on the invoices—I never made an cut sale to them—they never made a purchase of me which was charged against the commission account—they have not made direct purchases from me—I never consigned goods to any place in England for sale by auction, nor were any sold by auction at my direction—I have sent goods abroad for sale, but do not know how they were sold—umbrellas do not depreciate in value for a year—Mr. Pretty retired in 1878, and Morton went on; besides being our agents. they were independent merchants, excepting in umbrellas—they could not retain our agency and have another—they could sell to wholesale houses only—I cannot say what discretion they had—you will find the terms of the contract there—the prisoner frankly told me what he had done, but I do not think I made any remark, I only asked why he could dispose of goods in that way—I was on very good terms with him—I went and had some refreshment with him—I said that he could not starve though he had committed a breach of morals and a breach of contract—I had a statement with me, which I corrected by his duplicate books, showing the account between him and the firm—I did not take stock, I assume that he had disposed of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—there is no ledger account—I did not draw up the account debiting him with the value of the goods which he has not accounted for by regular sales—Mr. Barker has only been up to town once since Mr. Pretty retired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the prisoner gave me the pawn tickets I told him that I must communicate with Mr. Barker, which I did that day or the next—I put myself in the hands of the solicitors, and took what course they thought right—the prisoner was not authorised to pledge goods in any way.</p>

I am a superannuated City Police-constable—in December, 1876, I was with Oldhampstead watching Fish Street Hill—on 9th December I saw Collier, Chapman (who was afterwards convicted), and another person at 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill—I saw them go into several public-houses, at last they came to the European public-house, opposite the Mansion House—I pointed Collier out to Sergeant Smith—on the 11th December I was watching with Oldhampstead about 10 a.m.—I saw Chapman go in 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill, and saw him leave—I followed him to various money changers in the City—ultimately he came to the crossing in Lombard Street, where he met the prisoner—they went in the office and came out again one after the other—Oldhampstead followed Chapman—I saw Chapman go to the Continental Bank in Lombard Street—he passed some papers over to a man behind the counter—he received some notes and gold—then he came out, and in about 20 minutes met the prisoner at the corner of Lombard Street a second time—they went on in conversation together to Moorgate Street and separated, the prisoner went towards Moorgate Street railway station—Chapman got into a cab and I followed him to other money changers and various places in the West End—on the 12th December I was again watching 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill, about 10 a.m. with Oldhampstead—I saw the prisoner get out of a brougham and go into 1 and 2—he remained about a quarter of an hour, came out, got in the brougham, and drove away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have given the same evidence before—I did not mention Collier's name then—Riches was also arrested on 15th December, 1876—I don't know the date of Chapman's arrest—I did not know Chapman's name in 1876—I had general instructions to watch—I and Oldhampstead watched the two persons who were discharged go into the Uxbridge Road branch of the South Western Bank at Shepherd's Bush—they presented a cheque on Mr. Gortz—I was examined about that with the other detectives—I have not seen the witnesses in this case—I have left the force.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a City detective, but am superannuated—in December, 1876, complaints were made to me in reference to fish Street Hill—I set Oldhampstead, Simmons, and others to watch—on the 9th December, 1876, Simmons spoke to me, and I went with him to the European public-house—he pointed out the prisoner to me, who was sitting in a chair talking to another man also sitting down—on 15th December, 1876, between 8 and 9 a.m., I went to 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill, to a room on the third floor—I there found 32 letters, delivered by that morning's post—I marked 14 of them—I took them away—some of them contained cheques and post-office orders; others were applications for the pamphlet, others asking for remittances—I marked the remaining 18 letters with my initials and took them back to the office. (<hi rend="italic">An extract from the pamphlet was read to the effect that the office possessed a special telegraph wire, and that hundreds of testimonials could be seen there.</hi>) The office was a room on the third floor; there was no telegraphic communication with it—I did not see any testimonials—I saw 200 or 300 provincial newspapers; they contained similar advertisements to the one produced (<hi rend="italic">advertising the pamphlet of "advice to investors</hi>")—there were two books only, with no entries—I found the letter from Mr. Manstead as to the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw Riches the same day; upon him were the 18 letters I had marked—I also saw the two persons who were discharged; I read a letter found upon one of them—on the 31st December, 1876, I went with Sergeant Mitchell to 9, Porteous Road—we searched some rooms pointed out to us by Mrs. Lane; I found 500 envelopes in the back bedroom similar to this, with "Unitas et vis" and the device on them of two boys holding a purse—in a capboard I found some clothes hanging up—out of one of the pockets Mitchell in my presence took these five documents. (<hi rend="italic">These were receipts for registered letters, one having been sent to Manstead, and another to the Manager of the London and South-Western Bank, Shepherd's Bush.</hi>) I also produce the die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only saw Collier once; I did not then know his name—Mr. Churchill occupies the ground floor of 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill as a hatter—there are three floors of offices, about three offices on each floor—Collier is called Collier <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Riches in the warrant because we found an account had been opened at the Birkbeck Bank in the name of George Riches for the passing of crossed cheques, and the description answered to that of Collier—this man absconded from Witney Villa—the two persons who were discharged were not watched—they were discharged after several remands—they brought an action against me, but I do not think they got the advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined.</hi> I got a description of George Riches from the Birkbeck Bank—from the description I thought he might be the man I saw in the European—when the warrant was issued I discovered that Collier had introduced Gortz to the London and South-Western Bank—hefore and after I had the warrant I endeavoured to arrest the person named Collier in various parts of the country and at Shepherd's Bush—his address was Witney Villa, Avenue Road; we discovered that address about the 16th or 17th December.</p>

I live at 37, Little Russell Street;—the prisoner is my husband—we have been married about 12 months—on 20th May I was at home with him—we had a quarrel—he promised to be home by 8 o'clock, but did not appear till nearly 10 o'clock—that was the cause of the quarrel—it lasted about 20 minutes—there was supper on the table—I refused to go to it—he tried to push me towards the table—I did not feel that I had been struck with anything—I felt faint—I felt a knife by the bedside as I was going towards the table—my sister came downstairs—I walked to the prisoner's sister's place—it is not in the same house—I then found that I was bleeding—I was seen by a doctor about an hour afterwards, and the wound was strapped up—I was in the hospital seven weeks—there was a little struggle between us when I felt the knife—we were living together happily—I do not want to press the charge against him at all—I do not believe he meant to hurt me—he said, "I did not mean to do it; I do not know how the knife touched you at all."</p>

I cannot account for my hurting my wife"—I took him to the station, me on the way he said he was very sorry; he could not account for it, and asked me several times if she was dying.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector B</hi>). I have been in the police 20 years—my division is at Westminster—I now receive rather more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but I entered as a constable—on 25th May I went to Cooke's coffee-shop, which is in Wilton Street, opposite Victoria Station—it is not a public house—the female prisoner lived there—she is the wife of William Cooke, and she assisted in managing the business—I went there soon after 8 a.m. with Sergeant Preston and Constable Blatchford—Ser<lb/>geant Preston found a chest of tea there which had been opened—we took possession of it, searched the house, and found a large quantity of jewellery in a movable safe, and a deposit receipt for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made a list of the jewellery, which was worth between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and consisted of watches, rings, bracelets, pins, lockets, and all manner of things, and the stones were pearls, diamonds, and other stones—I took the man Cooke into custody, and the woman was taken afterwards on the same day—they were both taken on that day before Mr. D'Eyncourt, the Magistrate at West<lb/>minster Police-court, and charged with receiving a chest of tea knowing it to be stolen—there was a remand to the 1st or 2nd June—on 4th June this deposit note for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given up to Mr. W. D. Smyth, the solicitor defending Cooke—an application was made for it to the Magistrate, who said it was to be given up to him—this is the receipt Mr. Smyth gave for it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the 5th June the prisoners were before the Magistrate, and were remanded again—Mrs. Cooke was bailed, and the man remained in custody—after the examination, the prisoner Butcher came to my office in the police-station adjoining the Court—I have known him for a number of years—it was then about 3 o'clock—he said "There is a couple of hundred pounds for you if you will let Cooke out and bring nothing against him"—I said that I would see about it, and I went with him to a public-house and had something to drink with him—I did not communicate with</p>

               <p>any one that day, as I had to go in the country—I returned on the Sunday evening, the 6th, and saw Butcher on Thursday evening, the 8th, at the station—he said "It is all right, but you cannot have all the money at once, unless you let us have some of that which you have in your posses<lb/>sion;" I said that I would see about it, and he left; the next day (Wednesday) he came again and said it was all right, he had got a <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> who would do it—I made an appointment to meet him at the Aquarium at 9 o'clock that evening to receive the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Preston and Blatchford were about the building, but were not with me—I met him there, and he said that his friend was there somewhere, but that he could not find him; I waited until 11 o'clock, but he did not come, and Butcher then made an appointment to meet me at 11 o'clock next morning at St. James's Park Station—I went there and waited some time, but Butcher did not come, and I went to the station—he afterwards came there, and said where did I promise to meet him? I said at St. James's Park Station at 11 o'clock; he said "I thought it was here; never mind, I have a <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> who will do it in about 10 minutes;" I said "Where;" he said "Under the arches at the Victoria;" I said "At the restaurant?" he said "Yes"—I told him to go on, and I went there and called for a glass of ale, and he paid for it—while I was drinking it I saw Butcher and Smith, whom I did not know before, but I had seen him about the Court—I afterwards found that he lived in Tower Street—Butcher said "This is my friend Smith"—I had a glass of ale, and he paid for it—after Butcher had finished his dinner he got up and went out just under the archway, and said "We may as well do that little job here;" I said "Tea, what is it that you wish me to do?" Smith said "Not to bring anything further up against Cooke, but let him get out, and there is another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you; there is only the tea, and that he will get out of, for we are going to subpoena Hill to prove that he was with him on the day"—Smith then gave me a white handkerchief tied up; it was very heavy—I asked him what it was—he said "There is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I put it in my left trousers pocket, and he said "Are you going to give me a tip?" putting his hand behind him, and: I said "What do you mean?" he said "Half a <hi rend="italic">sov.</hi> for myself;" I said that I would meet him at the Aquarium at 9 o'clock; he said "That is all right;" Smith said "he" or "we are now going up to see Cooke, and bring nothing farther against him, and when he is out there is another hundred for you"—Preston was watching outside—we went to the police-station and showed the handkerchief and the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Inspector Foinett—I examined it—there were 100 sovereigns in it, and it was marked "M. A. Cooke"—I then informed one of the directors, and went to Mr. Wontner, who prepared the case—I communicated with my supe<lb/>riors from time to time—I had the jewellery in my office and upwards of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In bonds and cash, which was afterwards given up by the Magis<lb/>trate's direction—it was deposited in Tapsell's name; I did not trace the clock—that was about two years before—I took Smith at 6, Wilton Road—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a printed list of the property, which was sent round to all the police-stations—Blatchford was a plain-clothes man—he was on duty on the morning of the 16th June, and I have not seen him since.</p>

               <p>keeps the Cabin vincent Square, Westminster, within 100 yards of Bochester Row—I heard that he had arranged to give up the Cabin, before the tea was put into the house—I have been on intimate terms with Butcher, speaking to him and meeting him—I have said he has been an intimate friend with me—that is true—while he was keeping the Cabin, which is next door to Westminster Police Court, he had the run of the place to supply refreshment to the prisoners, with the knowledge, I believe, of the people in authority at the police court—I was on such terms as to have refreshments brought by him into my office if I requested it, and also for the men; there was a little bill of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for drink supplied a long time before this, but I did not know that it had been run up for me—very likely some of the brandy went down my throat—I did not tell Butcher in my private office that I knew Cooke when I was with Serjeant Harris in the Borough—I did not call him Cooke—I have called Butcher <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> some time since—Serjeant Clynch is not missing; he is all right—I made inquiry of Blatchford's wife the day he went away—I did not know of Clynch and Blatchford being at Epsom races on the Derby day with Butcher in the enclosure—I have no information on the subject—I believe Church is here to-day—I do not see him in Court—I do not know that he was with Butcher in the enclosure when the Derby was run—Butcher never told me that Blatchford had said that he might take refreshment down to the cells to Cooke—he never told me that Cooke wanted to see me, nor did I answer, "I am too busy, because I am not going to be seen going down there, you go yourself, and tell me what he wants"—I believe that you said, on the hearing at the police court, that I was the last person that any one would for a moment conceive it possible to bribe—that is right enough—I acted a part as though I was about to be bribed—my words were, "All through I acted the part of a police officer who was ready to receive a bribe"—anything that Butcher suggested to me I said, "Yes, I will see," and I agreed with him that I would meet him at any place, and so on—I did not ask him from time to time, "Have you seen Cooke? Have you been to Cooke's place?"—I did not say, "I saw a lot of money in Cooke's house;" he would know that by being in Court and hearing it given out what was found in the house—I do not know who told him to come into Court—I saw him taking refresh<lb/>ment inside—I never told Butcher that I was there for the purpose of decoying Cooke and his friend—Butcher said that the gentleman went in after plush; that means that he did not want anything disagreeable—I did not shake him by the hand and say, "As a man, you shall never suffer for anything you do for me." Nothing of the kind—I did not give him assurance upon assurance that he should not suffer—I acted the part of a person who was willing to receive the money—I did not tell Butcher that I was going to let my superiors know, or I should not have had it—I have not read the shorthand notes—I think something was said about going to Cooke's people, but I cannot remember telling him positively—I then called him Bill, but we did not meet every day—I once said that I would meet Cooke's people anywhere—I did not say "I don't like promises, and the money can be deposited;" but I think I said, "I don't like promises"—I gave him to understand that I should not get into trouble—I will not swear I did not say, "Bill, what you do for me you shall not get into trouble"—on Mr. Richards, one of the clerks at West<lb/>minster Police-court, taking down what was said, I nudged Butcher and</p>

               <p>made a gesture to call attention that he was there—I was acting under Mr. Wontner's direction as to Blatchford—Blatchford did not tell me that Cooke had complained of the charge made against him being false—I did not hear of it being imputed to be false until after this affair of the money—I had some notes at the police-court; these are them—the account I have given you of the interview between Smith and myself is truer—Butcher said, "We may as well do it here," and we went out under the arches—When he said, "This is Mr. Smith," the conversation all went on between me and Smith, and Butcher stood aside. He never asked me for a tip—I said at the police-court they were then going up to see Cooke at the House of Detention—I said that I was not positive whether it was "he" or "they," but according to my notes it is "they"—I will not say that it was not "we" are going up to see Cooke, meaning Smith and Butcher—I think I swore it again in my examination in chief in answer to Mr. Wontner—it was you who called my attention to it; you would not allow me to look at my notes—the answer was, "Smith said we are going up to see Cooke and tell him it is all right;" my note says "Smith said he was going up to see Cooke"—after going away with my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think I saw Butcher again in Rochester Row—I sent a message to him by a man named Davidson to say he was wanted—that was when I was going to apprehend him—It was arranged to find where Smith was and where Butcher was, as they had not been seen in the Court that morning—I never had an angry word with Butcher in my life—I didn't want him to go to the House of Detention to see Cooke, nor did he say, "No, I do not want to go there."</p>

I knew Cooke as a returned convict—I have known him for two or three years as a coffee-shop keeper—he would use tea in his trade; I never knew what his defence was till you mentioned it at the police-court—I was asked if I knew a man named Lawrence—I do know him—he is a convicted thief—I do not know that Cooke's defence was that Lawrence had brought the tea there in his absence with the knowledge of the police—when Cooke was taken into custody he said, "I have been sold like a b—bullock"—I cannot say whether the prosecution was dropped by the Treasury, because Cooke was not present when the tea was received—I have tried to find Lawrence and cannot—I have tried to find Blatchford and wish I could find him—Cooke was taken in custody in May; out of this long list of articles I can only trace the clock and the tea as stolen—he was charged with stealing the clock, but they had not finished the evidence when the charge was withdrawn—I will not allege that it was stolen property, but we did not go on with it on account of it being stolen so long ago—he was remanded four or five times in custody—notice was given to attend and then the prosecution was dropped by order of the authorities—that was some time after Blatchford disappeared—Blatchford did not tell me that he would not go into the witness-box and support my statement by perjury—Cooke was liberated and he was then charged with keeping this place as a brothel—I knew that it was frequented by prostitutes; I do not know for what purpose, they may have gone in for a cup of tea—I do not say now that it was a brothel—I know nothing about it—they did not consult me; the warrant was issued for keeping a brothel, and I gave Preston directions to execute it—that was while Cooke was in custody—I knew that the warrants were going to be applied for, but I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030054"/>
               <p>that the charge was going to be made until the warrants were received (<hi rend="italic">Parts of the witness's depositions were here read to him, to which he assented</hi>.) After I had sworn that the men were kept in custody five or six weeks, Cooke said that the tea was left in his absence, and I fancy it was—I have never changed my opinion if the prosecution have—I do not know whether he fetched soda and brandy into my office when Butcher was there—I am not positive if I told him whether I would see him to-morrow—I do not remember sending Blatchford to Butcher to tell him that I wanted to see him at my office—I will not swear I did not—I cannot say whether he came to my office the next day after the soda and brandy was had—Butcher may have come in when Detective Buxton was there—I did not send him out in order to speak to Butcher, but I will not swear that I did not send him out—I did not say to Butcher when Buxton had gone, "Have you seen anything of Cooke's people?" nor did he say, "No"—I did not say, "Go down to his shop and tell them from me that it is all right, there is nothing more against him more than the tea"—that is an invention—I very often saw Butcher talking to Davis, a jeweller—I will not swear that I did not say, "Have you seen Cooke to-day?" nor did he say, "No, he is down in the cellar; go and see him and tell him it is all right"—I will not swear that I did not say there were three persons there—I did not say, "I shall do no more than I am obliged to do"—I don't recollect it; I did not subsequently say to Butcher with regard to the cells, "I cannot come down, but tell him to tell you anything he wants to say to me"—I do not recollect saying, "I shall be over in my office, Bill"—I will not swear I did not—Preston's name is John—I do not say that I have not called him Jack—I do not remember saying, "Be careful not to say anything, now, as I don't want Jack to hear;" I will not swear I did not—I sent Deadman to find Butcher, but I cannot say that Butcher came—he was apprehended by Preston; I won't swear he did not come to my office—when I sent for him it was to lock him up—I do not remember his coming when I sent Deadman for him, nor did I then say, "Bill, what you do for me shall never get you into trouble. I will give you my word as a man and get them to meet me anywhere they line and let me know where you will meet them at half an hour's notice"—I do not remember any portion of that—I told Smith to tell him that I would meet him under the organ at the Aquarium, and I went to the Aquarium, and there was no Smith there—I saw Butcher there, he and I were in company during the evening—I saw him the next day outside the police-station, but did not see Smith—I did not say to Butcher "Have you seen Smith?" nor did he say "He has gone to the restaurant in Victoria Street"; I did not know who I was going to meet—I went to the restaurant in Victoria Street and drank one glass of ale by myself, and one glass with Butcher, which he paid for—Smith was sitting at the table—I did not say "Where shall we go," Smith wants to speak to me, does not he?"—I said that I would meet them at the Aquarium that night—I did not meet Blatchford that night; I met him the night previous—I told him to say that I could not come—I did not say to Butcher at the very commencement of the sugges<lb/>tion, "Cooke has got a lot of money and somebody ought to have some," nothing of the sort—the first suggestion of a bribe was made to me on the 5th June—it was introduced by something about the weather—Butcher knew me as a highly respectable officer—he said, "There is Cooke <hi rend="italic">rounding</hi> again, and there is a couple of hundred for you on the</p>

               <p>quiet"—there was nobody else in the office, he made that suggestion perfectly of his own free will—I was not very much astonished because it had been intimated to me by Poinett that the statement had been made to him by Blatchford—I communicated with Foinett on Monday, the 7th—I never said to Butcher that I was frightened at the matter, there was too much b—rounding going on—it is very seldom I use such language as that—I will swear I did not say so, even leaving the adjective out—I did not suggest that the money should be paid to me in gold; I know that notes are traceable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I will not undertake to say that I did not hear Cooke say to me at the station in Preston's presence, "You have done this for me, you have sent it to me"—I did not know what Cooke's defence would be—the tea was stolen from Mr. Fitzgerald's on 24th May about 1 o'clock in the day—I had no conversation with Preston about Laurence on any day prior to the tea being left at Cooke's—I did not know of the existence of Laurence on 24th May, but I told Mr. M. Williams at the police-court that I did not believe I had talked about Laurence, because I was not positive—it was Preston's duty to look at the convict list, and he says that he looked at it—I looked at it and I expect Laurence's name was there, but I cannot say that I noticed it on 23rd May—if I read the list down, I must have—I know now that Laurence came out from his sentence on 20th May, but I did not know it on 23rd May—I did not speak to Preston about Laurence on the evening of 23rd Kay, I swear that—I had seen the convict list before I gave evidence at the police-court—I said in answer to Mr. M. Williams at the police-court, "I do not recognize him in the convict list" and that is what I say now—there might be half a dozen Laurences in the convict list, and I did not know when Mr. M. Williams was cross-examining me that he was inquiring about the Laurence who came out on 20th May—the convict list is for the purpose of carrying out the police supervision—I must have seen his name in the list before 20th May—I do not know that Preston saw Laurence on 22nd May, I have never heard it—I swear Preston never told me so—I do not know that Preston was in communication with Laurence on 22nd May—I never heard of it—the tea was lost or stolen on the 24th in the middle of the day—I decline to answer the question whether I saw Laurence on the morning of the 25th May about 8.15—I saw a man who I know by another name, but I know his name now to be Laurence—I saw him on the morning he was apprehended, that was 25th May—I do not know whether that was the man who put the ten in Cooke's shop, I cannot say for certain—I was in the neighbourhood of Victoria Station at 8.15 where Laurence was, to do my duty; that was to go to Cooke's house—I did not know that that was the man that left the tea there the day before—I met the man there—I went to meet him—I did not know at the time that he was the man who had left the tea there the day before—I may as well tell you at once I went there to receive information from him—he had told me the night previous—I did not know that Cooke was at the races when the tea was left, nor do I know it now—he did not tell me that he had left the tea, and that there should be no mistake he had broken the chest and taken some of it out, if he had I should have taken him in custody—he did not inform me who had taken the tea there, he said that it had been taken there, and that it was taken from Mincing Lane—he did not tell me who had taken it and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030056"/>
               <p>I had no idea that he had taken it—I met him there by appointment at 8.15—I did not tell him to go into Cooke's house before I went in to take Cooke in custody—I swear that—I believe he did go in, but I did not see him—I detailed Blatchford to watch whether Laurence went into Cooke's house, he is the man who has gone away—I do not know that the prosecu<lb/>tion for felony was dropped partly because Mrs. Blatchford had written to the Commissioners of Police—I have heard that she has written to the Treasury—that was not one of the reasons for the prosecution being dropped—I do not know that the chest of tea case was dropped on the one hand on hearing that Blatchford could not give evidence against Cooke and on the other because he did not like to turn round on his superior officer—I believe I swore at the police-court that I had no communication with Preston before the day Mr. and Mrs. Cooke were examined with regard to Laurence—that was true—I made an appointment personally on the 24th to meet Laurence at 8.14 next morning in the neighbourhood of Victoria Station—I cannot remember whether Preston was or was not then in my company—the appointment was made in Wilton Road, within 50 or 60 yards of Cooke's house—Blatchford was there—I undertake to say that I did not know that man by the name of Laurence on 24th May—I knew him as McKenzie—I did not know that he had been doing penal servitude for a robbery of gold on the Ottoman Bank; that I swear—I never asked his history, and I never saw him before the night of the 24th—observation has been kept on Cooke's house for two years, but not at my instigation—he has been unsuccessfully watched as to receiving stolen property—Baldwin, a policeman of the A division, brought McKenzie to me on the night of the 24th—I cannot say whether Baldwin saw me on 21st May—I will swear that he and I did not have a conversa<lb/>tion about Cooke on 21st May—I cannot say whether Baldwin met McKenzie as he came out of prison, but it was his duty to do so—it was not his duty to bring him to me, but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> made a statement to Baldwin, and on that statement he brought him to me—the statement conveyed to me was not that McKenzie had stolen the tea from Fitzgerald's and left it at Cooke's or I should have known what to have done with him, sharp—I will swear he never told me he had left the tea at Cooke's or I should have had him—I wanted to meet him for information respecting the tea—it turned out afterwards that the tea was stolen from McKenzie's—he told me that the tea was in Cooke's place, and that I should find it as I went in in a little room under the cupboard—I had no idea then that he took the tea and put it there himself—I do not know when he came out of prison—it was Baldwin's duty to meet prisoners on the morning they came out and hand them certain papers if they are not licence-holders, which instructs them what to do—Baldwin brought him to me from the statement Fitzgerald made—he did not tell me that McKenzie had stolen the tea and left it at Cooke's, or I should have known what to do with him—I do not remember Preston admitting that he had a conversation with me about a man named Laurence—I was ordered out of Court at the beginning of Preston's cross-examination by your wish, but the Magistrate thought I had a right to be in Court—I know a public-house in Rochester Bow, kept by a man named Harris—it is not at the corner—I think I saw Preston after the case was over, but we did not speak about Laurence that day—I may have spoken about McKenzie—I cannot say that I spoke about my</p>

               <p>being ordered out of Court at your request—I don't think he told me he had been asked whether I had any conversation with him about Laurence—I will not swear he did not—I said in my cross-examination "I know two or three people named Laurence; I do not know who you mean, I have not the least idea; I have heard Laurence's name mentioned in connection with that chest of tea"—I think I also said "I know that Lawrence had been talked about, I believe he is a convict"—I only knew him as McKenzie—there might have been another Laurence there—I have frown Baldwin seven or eight years—he is on intimate terms with me—he does not visit at my house but he visits at the station—he is not in my division—I did not suppose for some time afterwards that the man who gave the information about the tea had anything to do with stealing it, and from what was said afterwards I informed the Directors and told them who I received the information from—I did not tell the Directors that McKenzie had been to Cooke's shop and taken away some of the tea and a piece of the chest—I swear that—I tried to get from McKenzie who took the tea, and he slid "Don't ask me"—the tea was not stolen in my division—the reason that the man was brought to me was that the property would be found in my division—McKenzie did not tell me that he was not on the spot at all when the tea was stolen—he maintained a discreet silence, and I had no idea that he had anything to do with taking the tea—he gave me the information the night before, I was not satisfied with it, and asked him to meet me next morning—the information was not sufficient for me to go to the place and find the tea—it was not my duty to do so—I use my discretion—if the tea had been disposed of in the night I should not have had anything to do with it—I knew that Cooke was not at home, but I did not know that the tea was left in his absence—I do not know at what time it was left—I never heard that he was betting that day—I got the infor<lb/>mation on the morning of the 25th that Cooke was at home, and that the tea was still there, and that instead of being stolen from Mincing Lane it was stolen from a turning up Mincing Lane.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On the evening of 28th May, Laurence or McKenzie was brought to the station by George Baldwin of the A division, and he gave me information about the tea being stolen that day, which was said to be at Cooke's—that house is in my division—I did not then know whether his true name was Laurence or McKenzie—after I had seen him I sent a telegram to the City and got a reply—I went the same night to see if Cooke was at his place and found he was not—it was after that I went in and made the search—I had no information from Laurence who the person was who had stolen the tea, simply that it would be found there—I did not know that Baldwin was going to bring a man to me on the evening of the 24th—he brought him and he gave me the information—I do not known of my own knowledge when Laurence or McKenzie came out of prison—I do not know that he came out on the 20th—I mentioned, when I took Cooke, that the ten had been left when he was out yesterday—I told the Magistrate that—I think the date of Laurence going out of prison would be in the convict list.</p>

I was perfectly well known to young Butcher—the Cabin had only changed hands the day before—I did not tell him to go and see the <hi rend="italic">Squire</hi>; I said "The governor wants to fee you"—that is Squire White—he said "It won't do for him to come here; where had I better go? I will go round the square way to his office; where is the <hi rend="italic">Squire?</hi>"—he said "Over the road; go and tell him"—I went and saw White, and at once took Smith, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards I took Butcher at the Cabin door—there had been general conversation at the station that day, 25th May, about the Derby—that was the day that Cooke was apprehended—something was said about the quantity of money which had been seen in Cooke's house—there was a deposit note for 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In a box—I never heard it talked about that it was actually making a man steal the goods to put them there—Blatchford did not say that it was a put up thing and he would not go into the witness box, but I said to him when he was in the case, "There is a lot of money, and there will be very likely something up with this money; be careful what you are at"—I do not say that as early as the Derby I expected bribes would be offered—Blatchford did not tell me on the Derby day that there would be money offered me, nor the day after—I told White what Blatchford had com<lb/>municated to me over night—I think that was June 2nd—it was the day after I saw Laurence as McKenzie—Blatchford did not tell me that the whole thing was a put up, that a convict stole the tea and put it there.</p>

I had some sandwiches to-day at a house on Ludgate Hill with Baldwin—I do not say with White, because I can only speak of one at a time—White is my superior officer—he was there when I went in, I did not know he was there—I do not know whether White had been examined then by everybody but Mr. Sleigh—we had no conversation at all about the case; Mr. White said that we had better say nothing about the case, and we did not—I have seen Baldwin two or three years at Rochester Row—it may be longer; I do not wish to make a mistake.</p>

I did not hear from White that Laurence had given him information as to who stole a watch from a mattrass six years ago, but he gave me instructions in the matter—I do not know that the police have had their eye upon Cooke two years, for the purpose of finding whether he was the receiver of stolen goods; but I have had instructions to keep observation on the place to discover whether he was—White did not tell me that Baldwin had made a communication about Laurence—I am sure he did not—I did not know that White had seen Laurence on the night of 24th May, till after I had been with White, and then I did not know it was Laurence, I only knew it was a man—I knew Blatchford was away—I have beard that his wife has made a statement to the authorities—I was at the police-court when the case of felony was withdrawn—I do not know that it was withdrawn because Blatchford had absconded, rather than give evidence against me and White—I never heard why it was withdrawn—I was never more surprised than when I heard it—I have no idea that it was withdrawn by the Treasury in consequence of Mrs. Blatchford's statement—I heard of her statement—I never heard that the prosecution had been withdrawn with reference to the felony because Blatchford would not give evidence against me—I have heard in conversation that Mrs. Blatchford made a statement, but it was not told to me, nor did I hear that White's name and mine were mentioned in it—a conversation was going on at the Regency, in Regent Street, and I overheard that she had made a statement, but I took no further notice than what I have told you—I heard it after the charge against Cooke was withdrawn—I did not know what statement she had made—it did not connect itself in my mind with the withdrawal of the prosecution, because whenever any of Blatchford's friends came I made it my business to go away—I did not shut my ears because I heard it, but I am ignorant of the statement she made, and I do not know now—I have not the slightest idea that the prosecution was dropped because that statement was made to the Treasury as to the <hi rend="italic">bond fides</hi> of the statement against Cooke—I did not hear the conversation between the man and White, and I did not know that White had an appointment to meet Laurence at 8.15 a.m. on 25th May; but I know that he did meet him—when I was going there I knew the object, but I did not know whether he was Laurence or McKenzie—I merely went</p>

Newmarsh and Sewell, of Cirencester, a firm which we knew very well and who were clients of ours—he said, "My father died when I was quite young and left Mr. Newrmarsh my guardian, when I was old enough Mr. Newmarsh sent me to Eton and I was absent about a year"—he mentioned the house he stayed at which I forget, and that he afterwards went to a crammer for the purpose of passing a military examination to go into the service—upon the strength of these statements we undertook the business—he said he wanted money particularly on that very day, and on the 21st April I gave him this cheque for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am a matting manufacturer, Three Colt Lane, Lime-house—on 14th July, about 6 o'clock, I was in New Road, Limehouse and saw two men near the bridge apparently looking for something—the prisoner is one of them—he seized me by my throat—I got from his grasp, and as soon as I did so the other got hold of my arms from behind and nearly broke one arm. We went over and over, and the prisoner kept mauling me and catching hold of my hair, and my hair came out, and then he kicked me on top of my head and on my back—I felt his hands in my pockets and they were turned inside out—I said, "Are you men? Do you want to murder, me?" and I had no sooner said so than the prisoner held me by my throat and smashed my head against the wall—the other one was holding me—I saw my watch in his hand and Made a snatch at it; it had a braid guard to it, and then the other one fan—we had a desperate struggle for it, but I got it back—the guard was broken and the bow—he made a sharp run for three or four steps, but Mr. Waller stopped him, and I did not lose sight of him.</p>

               <p>made no reply—I found the back parlour window of 246 raised as high as it would go, and the back door open—the bolt of the window had been shoved back and I found the tobacco pipe and cigars on the window-sill out<lb/>side—I made this examination ten minutes after Hemmings went into 1, Star Street—I took him to the station before I searched him—he said, "You will find three halfpence on me"—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 5 ¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, this tobacco-box, and cigars: and the pocket which the tobacco-box was in was full of loose tobacco—the prisoner Stevens was in the loom with Hemmings—she said something, but I do not remember what—on the same day I went to the Clyde public-house at 12.45, and took Driscoll—I told him—the charge—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I searched him at the station and found a shilling on him, and 7¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, this brooch, these cigars, a half ounce package of tobacco, and part of one—he gave no account of how ho got the tobacco—he said, "I bought the cigars yesterday at the North Woolwich Gardens."</p>

               <p>Bailey, and Rogers went through King William Street Moorgate Street to the corner of For, Street where they went in to a public house, leaving the barrow of nuts outside—I stayed about 20 minutes, when all three came out, Donovan and Rogers wheeled the barrow towards london Wall, Bailey went towards the Bank sent Detective Davidson after him and he brought him back—I afterwards stopped Donovan and Rogers—I told them I was a police officer and asked them what they had in the barrow—Donovan said "A bag of nuts"—I said "Where did you get them from?"—he said "I bought them of a man on London Bridge"—I said "How much did you give for them?—said" 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I had to borrow 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Rogers-Rogers made no reply—I asked Bailey, who had been brought back if he knew anything of the men—he said "No, I know nothing about it"—I said "I saw you leave Messrs. Mill and Grant's warehouse this morning with nuts, and I shall take you all to the station and you will all be charged with stealing nuts"—I took them to the station—after I had explained the case to the inspector, Donovan said "I bought them in the barrow of a man who had some business in the East End"—these are samples of the nuts—the same afternoon about three I went past Messrs. Mill and Grant's, 30, Pudding lane—I saw Miles—he made a statement to me—Mr. Grant and Mr. Taylor were present—at the Mansion House Bailey said "What Miles said is quite right, he did let me in"—on the 23rd I went to Kingston—I saw Phillips leave the train from London—I said "I am an officer of the London Police—I have a man named Bailey in custody for stealing a quantity of nuts"—he said "Yes, I know"—I said "I have traced a quantity of nuts to you by South Western Railway"—I asked him about his shops—he said he had shops, and "I have not had any Brazil nuts this season"—I reminded him that he had some—after hesitation he said Yes, I had them—I said "Who did you get them from?"—he said "Piggott"—I said "Who is he?"—he said "A porter"—I said "How much did you give for them?"—he said "42"—I said "Have you any order or invoice?"—he said "No, I have none; I do not keep them"—he said Piggot sent them down, he called for them the same day and sent him the money—I then went with Mr. Grant, Junior, to One Acre Road, Kingston-on-Thames Phillips' place—there I found in a basket a quantity of Brazil nuts—I said "Here are the nuts"—he said "Yes, they are some of the last parcel I had, they came down on Friday" Mr. Grant then turned over the stock and found another basket—it was a private house with a bar window fitted up as a shop, with oranges, lemons, and sweets in the window—I told him he would be charged with stealing the nuts—I brought him to Seething Lane Police Station—he said he thought they were all right, but he was sorry he had had anything to do with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 451, Bethnal Green Road—I am in the service of Messrs. Samuels &amp; Co., and have been for seven years, as a packer—lately I have been foreman—it was my duty to go to 7, East Smithfield in the morning to open the premises—I was also there last at night, and shut up the premises—I took away the key with me—Holland was also in Messrs. Samuels' employment before I went there, as a cleaner of shells—about 12 months ago Holland spoke to me about some shells—he said he knew where to sell some goods, and we could get a few shillings if I liked—the goods were to be taken early in the morning, and he would take them—I agreed to it—he had two cases of clams—that was the first transaction—the time of opening was 8 o'clock—Holland met me there and took the clams away—I took them from the ground floor—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them from Holland—the next transaction took place in about a month or six weeks—I made the acquaintance of Solomon about eight or ten months ago at Holland's place in Settle Street, Com<lb/>mercial Road, one evening after my work was done—there was a conver<lb/>sation about shells—I do not exactly recollect it—the goods were to come from Samuels'—I stayed about an hour—only Solomon, Holland, and myself were present—I do not think any money passed—Solomons wanted more shells—I sometimes got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I used to see Solo<lb/>mon occasionally after that, sometimes at his house and sometimes at the Red Cross public-house, close to my employers', in the evenings—I did not go to his house very often, about once in, perhaps, two or three</p>

               <p>months—I went to see if he wanted anything—he used to tell us what he wanted; we used to agree on the price, and we used to send the goods round when the money was paid—Holland generally took them—I never did—Solomon only paid me on one Saturday afternoon when he came for the goods—Holland divided the money with me—I used to send him clams, spiders, white murix, rose murix, bull nose, melons, snails (the snails were cleaned), and merospikes, cleaned white ears, cleaned red ears, cleaned green ears, and cleaned black ears, also nautiluses and mitres—the shells in a case were sent in a truck—when they were cleaned they were carried round—they were not packed, but loose in a basket, accord<lb/>ing to what they wanted—I made no alteration in the case when it went away, I sent it out just as I took it from the stock—on one occasion some large snails went—I was paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for those—my master sold them for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I also remember some bulls' months going, also some bulls' mouths, clams, and spiders—that was about the beginning of May—on that occasion Mr. Marcus Samuels came into the warehouse and asked me a question—when Holland came back he asked him where he had been—Holland said for the sugar baskets—one Saturday afternoon after that I was on Tower Hill about 4.45. Holland was with me—we close at four on Saturdays—Tower Hill is seven or eight doors from my masters' place—we had just come out of the Red Cross public-house—we met Solomon coming to<lb/>wards Mr. Samuels' shop—he asked us if we would let him have some goods out, and we agreed—he said he wanted some clams, melons, and spiders—he said if we liked he would go and get the cart and get them away that afternoon—we agreed, and he went away to get the cart—when he had gone, Holland and I went back to the warehouse and got the things out—we had shut the warehouse, and we went and re-opened it—we got two cases of clams, a case of spiders, and a case of melons—we took the cases just as they were, without doing anything to them—the van came and backed up the gateway to the warehouse—Solomon was not there, but there was a carman driver—the cases were loaded on the van and taken away—that must have been from 5.15 to 5.45—after we had shut the warehouse up and got away, Solomon gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was divided with Holland—the value of these stores are from 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one day in June I called on Solomon; he was not at home—I went in the evening and saw him—he told me he wanted some small white ears, some rose murex, and some turbos—he offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the six dozen turbos and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for the rose murex—the turbos are worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and the rose murex are worth from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen if cleaned, but they were in the rough—the turbos were cleaned, and were worth 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—Solomon asked me if I knew anything about the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at the shop; some one had been selling shells under cost price. He knew it was not him, because he heard it was somebody that did not know the trade—I told him I did not know—I was spoken to by Mr. Samuels and a detective—I made a statement to them—I got instruc<lb/>tions from them—Holland came next on the 23rd—I gave him six dozen rose murex, six dozen white ears, six dozen turbos, and 10 or 12 large red ears—they were put in a hamper—he took them away—that hamper was afterwards shewn me—I also saw some cases at the station like those taken.</p>

               <p>they are ours—these shells are very rich in colour, and it is very rare for open ears of that kind to come to this market—we have not had them ourselves for many years—if they had come into the market we should have bought them—we have information of every fancy shell that comes to London—I saw a quantity of clams, and particularly spiley clams, which are ours, also this nautillus—this green ear is calcined inside—the spiley clams are very rare, and we have to supply the only house in the trade—there were also bulls' mouths, and several mats of bulls' mouths—the mats were original, and marked "London"—I identify all these produced—these are two of our original cases—all Solomon's cases were opened at the top like this one—it is rendered useless because the battens are knocked out with it.</p>

There are three wholesale houses in the trade in London, and only one besides our own doing a large business—I heard my brother's evidence at the police-court—I agree that it is difficult to identify a particular shell, as it is a particular sovereign—I do not know that there are numbers of mats marked "London" to be bought—I bought these about two years ago of the executors of the late Mr. Moses privately—I can especially identify this green ear—I can identify the cases more than the shells—we get the cases from Singapore—other houses are not supplied by the same shipper—Binns is still in our employ—I have not promised to retain him, but we are going to retain him—I do not know Walker nor Wankin—I have seen Drayson—Mr. Jones has been a cus<lb/>tomer—if Mr. Jones has 16 of our cases he has no right to them—there are firms which supply oases—we buy them ourselves—we do not charge the cases we send as we wish them to be returned—this is our printed card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which we have had for years, and which is reversed to send back the empty—I do not know Mrs. Crowning.</p>

Martin Seal, of 30, Hamsell Street, and he left an order to send goods to the amount of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we had a second order in the course of the month for the same amount—they were sent to Hamsell Street—I knew him before, from his connection with the Cripplegate house only—the terms were monthly—I applied for payment and saw Townsend after calling a great many times until I was tired, telling him unless the matter was settled I should put it into the hands of my solicitor, which I did, but failed to get the money—part of the goods were afterwards returned to me under a threat of my exposing the matter at the Mansion House, and I saw some in Townsend's warehouse in Wood Street—those were not the goods which were sent to Hamsell Street, but to Noble Street, under the previous transactions with Z. Martin Seal Co.—I did not see any of the buttons which were sent to Hamsell Street, except those which were re<lb/>turned—I received an anonymous letter about three months ago, in con<lb/>sequence of which I went to a public-house in Holborn, but I saw no one there that I recognized, and went back to my office—Townsend called about half an hour afterwards, and I said, "It was you who wrote that letter, was it?" He said, "Yes"—I showed it him, and he tore it up, saying that he did not wish to be indicted for obtaining money under false pretences—he said upon payment of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would give me such information as would enable me to obtain my money from Z. Martin Seal &amp; Co. at once—at first I objected, but afterwards gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and an I O U for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me Z. Martin Seal's address as 3, Friern Place, Peckham Rye, and also the name of his bankers as the London and South-Western Bank, Rye Lane branch, Peckham Rye—he said that Seal had a balance of l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—I went to 3, Friern Place the next morning, and made inquiries of a girl who opened the door, but she denied Mr. Seal being there, knowing nothing of the name—I went to the bank, and after seeing the manager he produced the signature book, and I saw signed there the name of Sidney Seal—he said the account was overdrawn—the name of Townsend was in the book as a reference.</p>

Martin Seal and Co., to Debenham and Tewson, is Townsend's writing—I was employed by the firm of Z. Martin Seal and Co., but the actual employment was by Townsend only.</p>

I am the wife of Benjamin Wilderspin, a tailor, of 60, Walton Street, Chelsea—the prisoner came to lodge there on 4th May, and continued there till the 26th—she brought two children with her, a boy, named Willie, and a girl, Laura, but no man—the girl was about 4 year of age and the boy under 2 years, a year and a half, I fancy; he could not walk—I knew the prisoner as Mrs. Pleasance—she told me she had lodged in Trevor Square before coming to our place—when she first came the said she was going to take the boy to his aunt at Cambridge—on Satur<lb/>day morning I got up at 8, and then found that the prisoner and the boy were gone; the girl was left at home—the prisoner came back alone—I did not see the boy again—on Wednesday, the 26th, I saw the prisoner and the little girl together until dinner-time, about 2 o'clock—the child was playing—Inspector White had been before she went out, and had seen her—I did not see the little girl alive again after about 3 o'clock—I did not see them go out—I saw the prisoner again that same night in one of the cells at the Walton Street Police-station, and had a short conversation with her—I said "Why did you not say something to me before you went out about taking Laura away"—she said she loved her children too well to leave them to the</p>

               <p>mercy of the world—I think those were the exact words—I did not take her a change of clothes; I sent her some dry things off her bed to wrap round her; that was after 12 o'clock—Constable Leeson had been to me, and it was in consequence of that that I sent some dry things to the cell—I was there when she changed them; I helped to change them—the clothes she took off were very wet—when she said she loved her children too well to leave them to the mercy of the world, she said "I have drowned Laura; she died in my arms without a struggle; she was asleep at the time"—she also said she had tried to drown herself—Laura was a very healthy child—after the interview in the cell I went to the mortuary in Old Battersea, and there identified the body of Laura; she was then undressed; I saw the clothes; they were the same I had seen her wearing on the Wednesday—I always thought she was an affectionate mother to the children—I had more opportunity of seeing the girl than the boy—she was to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week rent; she had only one room—she paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she offered my husband half a crown, and would have paid that, only we had no change—it was our fault that it was not paid.</p>

On Wednesday night, 26th May, about 1/2 past 12 o'clock, I was in Walton Street, Chelsea, watching opposite No. 60, in plain clothes—I had been watching there since about 1/4 to 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I did not see the prisoner till about 1/2 past 12 o'clock; she was then standing in the New Head, opposite Ovington Square, about 80 yards from No. 60, under the shadow of the gaslight, alone—I said, "Are you locked out"—she said, "No"—I said, "Did you have a little girl with you when you left home this afternoon—she laid, "Yes"—I said, "And your name is Mrs. Pleasance, is it not?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "And where is your little girl now?"—she said, "Dead, in the water in Battersea Park, I drowned it, it died in my arms without a straggle"—I said, "Can it be true what you say?"—she said, "Yes, my poor Laura is in Heaven now, I hope"—I said, "Where is the little boy?" (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Sleigh interposed, and as the fate of the boy was the subject of another indictment, he considered it should not be alluded to on the present charge. Mr. Justice Hawkins could not exclude the evidence, it being part of t)ie con<lb/>versation between the prisoner and the witness, but the Jury would understand it would not affect the present inquiry</hi>)—she said, "I will say nothing of the little boy"—I said, "The matter is serious, be careful what you say as I shall have to repeat your words; you will have to go to the station with me"—she said, "Yes, I will go quietly"—I said, "I feel truly sorry for you"—she said, "You would if you knew my troubles"—I then took her to the station and handed her over to the custody of Inspector White—I noticed that her clothes were wet, I believe all over, her hat and hair were also wet—on Thursday, the 27th, I took her from the police-court to the prison in a cab—she made a statement which I afterwards put down, as soon as I had lodged her in the prison, and this is the note I made—she said, "Do you know who employed Mr. Dutton" (he had appeared for her before the Magistrate at the first hearing) "Is he for the prosecution or the defence?" I said, "For the defence."—she said, "I do not know the name, who he said employed him; I do not want the friends of the father of my children brought into the matter at all, as his sister and mother have been very kind to me, and they cannot help what I have done."—I said, "Do be careful what you say as I shall have to make use of your words; I don't ask you to My anything, and whatever you say it will be voluntary"—she said, "Mrs. Baird is a bad woman, and it was through her that my husband was taken away from me." She made some further statement about the other child, and then she said, "Young Mr. Wilcox was living with us in Trevor Square</p>

               <p>it to be quite dead—it was about a quarter past 2 o'clock when I found the child, and very nearly 3 o'clock when I showed it to Dr. Kempster—to the best of my belief it was the same child that I had seen that afternoon with the prisoner—the body was taken to the mortuary by another officer, and I afterwards saw it there—I produce a certificate of the birth of Constance Pleasance, on 10th November, 1876, and also that of a boy named William on 5th October, 1878.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 17, Trevor Square, Knights<lb/>bridge—at the end of March, 1879, the prisoner came to live there with a man who I knew as Mr. Pleasance—they lived as husband and wife, and had two children, a girl named Laura, and a boy called Willie—they occu<lb/>pied two rooms on the drawing-room floor—the man left on 1st May—the parish officials had been communicated with and he was taken away by them as being insane—he was a French polisher—they were in very poor circumstances from Christmas—the prisoner left my place on 4th May with the children; she carried the boy and the little girl walked by her side—she paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week rent—I went to the mortuary on 26th May, and there saw the body of the child Laura.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The rooms they rented were unfurnished; they famished them themselves—the prisoner was a hard-working industrious woman as far as I saw—I cannot say that she and her husband were much attached to each other—the prisoner was very good to the children and was very fond of them as far as I saw—I believed that the prisoner was married to the man, up to last Christmas; she behaved herself in a respectable and proper manner—up to last Christmas the man had regular work, after that it fell off and they began to be in very different circum<lb/>stances—I think the prisoner took in a little needle-work about Christmas time; she was very anxious to get work and did all she possibly could to get it—I think it troubled her very much not getting it; she seemed very despondent after Christmas—she treated the children well and was particularly careful in their dress—she took a pride in them—after Mr. Pleasance was taken away his brother came and took the property belonging to him; he paid the rent that was due to me and left her enough to furnish one room, a very small amount—the best part of everything was taken from her by the brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, of 5, Rutland Street, Brompton—I knew the prisoner when she lived at 17, Trevor Square—I lived there at the same time—I knew the man who lived with her; his real name was John Poole, but they lived there as Mr. and Mrs. Pleasance—I worked for Poole—I stayed there till the 1st May—I knew the children Laura and Willie—on Thursday, 6th May, I went to Walton Street and saw Willie—I never saw him afterwards—at that time Poole had been taken away, out of his mind—the girl Laura was playing in the yard—on Wednesday, 12th May, I again saw Laura; that was the last time I saw her alive—I did see the body at that time—I afterwards saw the body of Laura at the mortuary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M.R.C.S. and lire at Oak House, Battersea—on Thursday morning, 27th May, between 2.30 and 3 o'clock, Inspector White brought me the body of a female child, apparently between three and four years of age; it was dead and cold, the rigor mortis had set in—in my judgment she had been dead several hours, probably five or six—there was no decomposition—she was beyond all medical aid—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on 31st; there was no sign of disease or any marks of violence—the stomach contained partly-digested food—in my judgment the cause of death was suffocation—if she had been put into the water and kept under until death took place that would produce the appearance I saw—in cases of ordinary drowning we generally find a frothy mucus about the mouth, in this case there was none—if a person was kept under the water until death took place I should not expect to find it, spasm of the glottis would ensue, and you would not find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Supposing the woman had thrown herself into the water with the child, intending to drown herself, and had fallen down and so the child had been kept under water there would be no frothy mucus; what I mean is that the child must have been kept under water for some<lb/>time, from one to three minutes—I have had some experience of pregnant women—I have no knowledge myself of this woman's condition—when a woman is pregnant she is more likely to have local determination of blood—they are local determinations to the uterus principally—I cannot say that I have read Montgomery on the signs and symptoms of pregnancy, but I have had a large experience in those cases—I have read extracts of a book by Esquinol, but I must protest against being examined over the whole range of medicine; if you will ask me as to my own knowledge and experience I will answer you—with some pregnant women the cerebral disturbance amounts to a disorder of the intellectual faculties; some are subject to phantacies; in some exceptional cases they amount to a perven<lb/>sion of judgment, which sometimes becomes violently maniacal—I cannot say that the gloomy and desponding state is greater in the earlier stages of pregnancy than in the later—I have not observed it—there is a tendency to insanity amongst certain pregnant women—that tendency would be very much strengthened by trouble—want of sleep would be a collateral cause; the loss of dearly beloved friends might be; indeed any mental anxiety—sometimes the mental disturbance is so great that women will eat things which under other circumstances they would regard with loathing, and they will regard with antipathy persons for whom they entertain the greatest affection—the whole moral nature, in some exceptional cases, is changed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Charlotte Street, Kent Road, and am an engineer's labourer—the deceased was my wife—her name was Louisa, and she was 27 years of age next birthday—we had been married nine years—up to three months before her death she had been generally in the enjoyment of good health—about six weeks ago she was admitted into Guy's Hospital as an in-patient—I went to see her there from time to time, the nurse Ingle was attending upon her—on Sunday, 4th. July, I went with my brother to the hospital about 2 o'clock p.m.—we were the first in that day—my wife was lying down, and she asked me to lower the pulley down—I did so, and she pulled herself up in a sitting position, and continued to sit up talking to us until we went away, at 4 o'clock—she was cheerful, and getting on nicely; she even smacked my brother's face—on the following Wednesday, the 7th, I saw her again—I saw an alteration in her directly I went in—I said to her, "Louey, what is the matter with you?"—she was lying cross-legged, and made a com<lb/>plaint to me, in consequence of which I spoke to the prisoner, saying, "Nurse, how came these bruises on my wife's arm?"—she said, "I know all about it"—I said, "If anything happens to my wife, you will have to give an account of it"—she made no remark, and went away—I did not tell the prisoner what the deceased had told me—I then saw Dr. Pavy, and told him about the bruises, and asked him if he would allow me to come in a little oftener, and my sister-in-law, and I then left—next morning I saw my wife again, and she was worse still—I don't think I saw the prisoner then, I think it was another nurse that was coming in to attend her—I went to the hospital every day after till the day of her death (21st July)—on one of those occasions the prisoner called me out of the ward and said something about my wife being hysterical, and that it was a very bad case—I said, "I want nothing at all to do with you"—on the Wednesday before I had this conversation with the nurse I looked at my wife's arm and chest—there were five bruises on the left—the right arm she could not raise out of the bed—there was a slight bruise upon her chest—on the Saturday after the Wednesday I was sent for to the hospital—the prisoner had left—the deceased was afraid of her, and used to dread seeing her coming along the ward—she complained to me three or four times, and on Wednesday, 21st July, about five minutes past 11 p.m., she died—she never rallied no more.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. My wife had been ill for some little time before she went to the hospital—I think she went in about 9th June—I was there every time I could get away, I never missed any time both Sunday and Wednesday too—on the Sunday I was there with my brother—she looked a good deal better, and I went home quite cheerful—she then told me she had been trying to dress herself on the previous Tuesday, and that she had had a fall by the bedside, No. 1 I was there at the time and assisted, it did not hurt her, she had slipped down by the side of the bed—I did not knew that she was suffering from consumption when she went into the hospital, not until we saw the paper over her bed, the first Sunday; I could not make it out, as I cannot read—when I spoke to Ingle about the bruises she did not say, "I do not know how they came there, but it might have been from the way she held on to the side of the bath;" nothing of the sort—she did not refer to the bath—my sister-in-law</p>

               <p>was sitting by the bedside at the time—the prisoner did not say anything about going a second time to the bath and turning on the water when it was too hot—I was there on the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and every day afterwards—Ingle did not tell me after that that she was sure that the doctors and the sisters were making a tool of my wife, nor did she say to anybody belonging to me that they were doing this in order to get rid of her—she did not complain that the doctors had not informed her what the patient was suffering from; I never heard anything of it—she did not say a word to me about my poor wife being hysterical; I do not think we had two minutes' conversation together the whole time I was there, only by the bedside—I remember asking Ingle to accept a present of a shilling on the Friday, when she called me out of the ward—I said to her, "Be kind to my wife, and I will bring you some flowers," when I gave her the shilling—my wife said that the nurse had been very kind to her—I said, "Which nurse?" and she pointed out a tall young lady; I do not know the person's name—I said, "Is that the lady?"—she said "Yes"—I said, "Which is your proper nurse?"—she said, "The black lady"—I did say to Ingle, "If you will be kind to my good lady I will bring you some flowers on Sunday, as you will not accept any money"—she said that she liked flowers, and would gladly accept them—I did not bring her any flowers—I did not see the bath—I think there were six or seven bruises upon the deceased altogether—I did not count them, the day I saw them I saw Dr. Pavy—the skin was black and blue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister of the Mary Ward at Guy's, and have been so six years or more—the prisoner was a paid day-nurse under my direction—she had been there about four months, I think—I remember the deceased; she was in the hospital for consumption—the prisoner as day-nurse had charge of her, and would perform her duties under my direc<lb/>tion—she would have to come on duty at 8 a.m. until 9.50 p.m.—she would have to make the beds directly she came, and attend generally to the patients—if there was any dirt she would have to put on clean things, and if the patient was dirty she would have to attend to her—The prisoner came to me on Monday, 5th July; I was standing in the hall, in the centre of the ward, and she asked me if she might give No. 2 a bath (that was the number of the deceased's bed) as she had passed an evacuation in the bed—I said she might have a bath for the purpose of cleansing; that was all the conversation that passed between us—the prisoner then left me—there is a bath with hot and cold water in the centre of the ward, but not in the room where the patient was—a chair with wheels is provided if the patient is too weak to walk—the bath is 70 feet distant from No. 2 bed—I did not see the deceased taken to or from it—Dr. Pavy had charge of this case, and in the afternoon, between 2 and 4, he generally came round—there was nothing particular in the deceased's appearance that day, but afterwards there was a change—I saw her several times between the time she had the bath and Dr. Pavy's coming—I saw her that day about dinner-time, about 1 o'clock—I think most likely the last time was at 11 o'clock at night—I saw no very marked change in her that day—the next day she appeared worse—Mr. Howsell was the house-surgeon who had charge of this case—. he resides at the hospital, and is called the house-physician.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. The bath was given on the Mon<lb/>day—Dr. Pavy saw the patient on that same day, between 2 and 4 o'clock;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030120"/>
               <p>I was there; I was sent for—Dr. Pavy, Mr. Howell, and several clerks were there, and the nurse—at that time I did not observe any marked change in the patient's appearance—Dr. Pavy asked me if I knew about the bath, and I said I knew that she had had a bath—a variety of questions were put to me about the bath—Dr. Pavy did not draw my attention to any alteration in the patient's appearance, nor did any of the other doctors, and I did not observe any till the next day—she then seemed to be weaker, and there was a change of countenance, a sort of vacant stare; the countenance wore a distressed look, and when spoken to she did not answer readily or collectedly—I have charge of the Mary Ward, not of any other—I am the sister and have charge of all the nurses in that ward; I am the responsible head of that ward—I have had a large experience in nursing—in order to get to the bath, <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 2 patient would have to get out of bed and then be taken between a number of beds across the central hall, then turn to the right and into the bath room—there is an arch between the ward and the central hall which you have to pass under, and then get into the bath-room—there is a long raised bath there, not against the wall; you can walk round it—this sketch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) fairly represents it—there are four day nurses and two night curses—I saw this patient every day; she had been getting better up to a certain time, but not quite so well three days before the bath; but on the Monday when her husband came she was better—I saw her on the Sunday, she was cheerful and seemed to be rallying—I knew that she was suffering from consumption; I knew it by being present when Dr. Pavy visited her, soon after she was admitted—when the physicans attend it is the practice to go round to the various beds and examine the patients, and the students occasionally accompany them, and the nature of the disease is explained—I was present when Dr. Pavy gave the students an explanation of this disease; I cannot remember when that was—I don't remember his saying "This patient seems to have been suffering from various aches and pains, for which there seems no apparent cause at present"—he might have said so—he said nothing to me about hysteria, I don't remember it—I remember his saying something of this kind; "There is a certain pallor denoting mischief of some kind, I should say proceeding from an anaemic condition of the body, but we shall hear more when her case is thoroughly gone into"—it was when he was addressing the patients at the bedside I learnt that in his view the patient was suffering from consumption—I do not know whether it was on the first visit or not—that was the only communication I had on the subject, hearing what was said—I am the sister who is responsible for the nursing—it is very important that I should know exactly what a patient is suffering from, and I did know in this case; I knew what was alleged; I knew it too by being written up on the bed letter, on the card—the card is put there the first day the patient came in, but it may not have been written on that day—I do not mean that the disease is always written up the first day; also the date, and the prescription—the disease is not always described for some time, it might be weeks; I have known many instances of that—possibly it has not been ascertained—phthisis was the disease put on the card—that was put on some time before the patient died, before the bath; I am quite sure of that—this consump<lb/>tion was not in an active condition, the reverse, it was quiescent—there was lung mischief, but it was not developing itself—Dr. Pavy did not tell me that she had hysterical tendencies; I do not remember his saying that—I</p>

               <p>heard that he wished her to get up, because she would become weaker by lying in bed—we very frequently have hysterical patients in the hos<lb/>pital, especially females—hysteria is a very common disease—a woman suffering from hysteria imagines that she has ailments which she really has not; many of them imagine that they cannot move their limbs; that is the form of the disease—a common way of treating them is to induce them to exert themselves—I have known such cases over and over again—Ingle is a fairly educated woman—when she came to me on the Monday morning she said the bath was wanted for cleansing purpose—I saw no harm in the patient having it, providing it was properly administered—I had not received from any of the medical men any injunction against the patient having a bath—she was put into a bath when she was first brought in—all patients are bathed upon admission—if a person is too ill they are not bathed—between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, when this bath was given, the water would not be very hot, later on it would become more so—I gave no specific directions about the bath, I left that to Ingle—I gave her directions about the soiled bed—I saw her after the woman had been taken to the bath, and asked her where No. 2 was; I saw that the bed was vacant——she said she was in the bath-room—I said "Not in the bath?"—she said "No, she is sitting in a chair wrapped in a blanket," or something to that effect—she did not say she had placed her upon the chair in order that she slight have a good rest before she came back—I believe she said she was wrapped in a blanket—the prisoner has been there about four months—I lure had no cause to complain of her—we have not had many cases of tubercular disease of the brain in the hospital—I had an idea that this woman was suffering from it, after the bath, and before the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I was not informed of it—Dr. Pavy did not tell me—he said she seemed to have had a shock; he did not put it in any other form—none of the physicians told me that she was suffering from disease of the brain—I did not know that it was so important that I should know it—tubercular disease of the brain is fatal—I was not really informed of it, but I thought so from the symptoms—in tubercular disease the patients suffer from headache, and nausea, and torpor, a strong reluctance to use any exer<lb/>tion, a confusion of ideas, and difficulty in expressing what they want to ex<lb/>press—inability to control the motions is one symptom, and inability to stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> From the Wednesday, 9th Juno, when the patient first came in I knew that she was suffering from consumption; I think after one or two visits had been made by the physicians, and from the card at the head of the bed—the moment it is ascertained what the disease is it is put down on the paper, it is also the custom to enter the medicines pre<lb/>scribed; I have 56 beds under my charge—I cannot tell you the date when the word "phthisis" was first written on the paper—as she gradu<lb/>ally got worse the symptoms led me to suppose she was suffering from tubercular disease of the brain; that was several days after Monday the 5th—as sister of the ward I act under the directions of the doctors, un<lb/>less I had any special directions the patients would simply be nursed—I should not take upon myself to give a bath as medical treatment—this was the only bath she had, except the cleansing bath she had when she first came in—I could not say that I ever saw any hysteria in this patient—after the bath I heard Dr. Pavy mention the word, but I could not tell you exactly in what way.</p>

               <p>morning, July 5th, I was coming out of the bath-room at a quarter to 9 o'clock, I think it was, I will not be sure, in the direction of the hall which leads into the ward—I saw the nurse bringing the deceased into the bath-room and she said to me, "She has been very dirty; she has dirtied all her things"—I did not answer, I went back to my work, and some time afterwards I had occasion to go into the bath-room—I do not know what the time was then, but I think it must have been about a quarter-past 10 o'clock—(the deceased was dressed in her night dress, with her bootson—she had no covering except her nightdress—I did not see them before they got to the bath-room, coming down)—it was about quarter-part 10 o'clock when I went into the bath-room and saw them again, and then I saw the deceased sitting in the bath, at the foot of the bath, with her hands on the woodwork, trying to raise herself up—as soon as I opened the door she said, "Oh, Mary, I am so cold"—I said, "Can't you get out of the bath?"—she said, "No"—I then said, "Where is nurse?"—she said, "I don't know"—I then came out of the room and shut the door after me, and went to find the nurse, as the sister was not in the ward at the time—I found Ingle, the nurse, at No. 13 bed; the de<lb/>ceased's bed was No. 2—I did not notice what she was doing, but I think she was arranging the quilt; I said, "Do you know that No. 2 is in the bath, shivering, and she says she cannot get out"—she said, "Yes, I know she is in the bath, but she really is so very obstinate, she won't assist herself, and I am determined I won't help her"—nothing more was said—while this conversation was going on between me and the prisoner; I did not notice what she was doing—I went into the hall and saw patient No. 42, and asked her if she would not go into the bath-room and help the deceased to get some clothes on—about 10 minutes after I had the conversation by bed 13 Ingle went into the bath-room; I could, not see what took place but; 3 noticed that there was not much water in the loath, not sufficient to cover the de<lb/>ceased's hips; I cannot say how much there would be—the hath is worked by three taps, hot, cold, and waste—I did not put my hand in the hath at all—during the time I saw the prisoner with the deceased she had hold of her arm taking her to the bath; one leg she dragged behind, and the other leg she moved forward—the prisoner had hold of her, because her arm looped in her arm, the same as you take hold of another person's arm; I mean arm in arm—after she came out of the bath I saw her bringing her from the bath with a blanket over her head, I could not see her face—I saw them coming across the hall—coming back the prisoner had hold of her arm, dragging her in the same way, and she pushed the deceased's leg which dragged behind; she put her knee underneath the leg which was dragging, and kicked it along—while she was doing that I heard her say it was obstinacy; that she could walk if she liked—Ingle did not ask me to help the deceased at all.</p>

Ingle had hold of her by one arm; I cannot say which arm. The deceased appeared not to want to go. I did not hear her say anything. No one was near her. The deceased was in her night-dress. I went into the bath<lb/>room before they went in"—that was true, as far as I can remember—from these steps I saw her being dragged by her arm, she was not walking—I intended to tell the Coroner's Jury that I saw her being dragged across the hall—I have not said that I was very glad that this woman was charged; but I never liked her from the first time I saw her—the deceased was not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at Guy's—on Monday, 5th July, I saw a patient being taken towards the bath-room—I do not know her name, but she went by the name of <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 2 in St. Mary's Ward—Mrs. Ingle was trying to take her to the bath, holding her by the arm—she seemed unable to walk, and her leg dragged after her, and then Mrs. Ingle called Nurse Distin to help her—she did not seem as if she wanted to nse her cruelly; she wanted her to walk—I did not see the patient in the bath—she did not seem to want to hurt her—I know Miss Burt, the matron—I have not had a conversation with her—I did not see the woman in the bath; I went to prayers—it was about 10 o'clock when I came back—from the time I saw the patient being taken towards the bath to the time I returned from prayers was about an hour and a half—at that time No. 2 was not in her bed—Miss Burt has not talked to me about this matter.</p>

I heard the prisoner call Norse Distin to help her, and saw Nurse Distin go to help her—that was when they were about half way across the ward—Nurse Distin did help Ingle with the patient to the bath-room; she went to the other side of her—I did not see her so far as the bath-room—that was about 8.30 a, m., because I was just finishing my work—I went to prayers at 9.30, and prayers are over at 10—there is a chapel in the hospital—I did not hear that the patient was hysterical—I did not hear orders given by the doctor that she was to try to walk—patients who are in a weak condition we take in a chair to the bath, and when they come back we put them in a wheel chair.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., F. R C. P. I am one of the physicians of Guy's Hospital—I have been connected with the hospital 33 years from my student days—I remember this patient, Louisa Morgan, being admitted into the Mary Ward, to No. 2 bed, on Wednesday, 9th of June—I saw her on the same day that she was admitted—she was suffering from consump<lb/>tion, affecting the lower part of the left lung, and there were various erratic pains, which, in the absence of any tangible cause, I put down to her being hysterical, and was supported in that opinion by the previous history, which was to the effect that she had been married at 16 years of age, which was 10 years previously, her age being 26, that she had had one child, a year after her marriage, and had no family since, and was the subject of a leucorrhoeal discharge—I examined her chest—there were no marked symptoms of consumption—we were guided by the results of the physical examination of the chest—it is the practice to put upon paper the name of the patient and the name of the disease; I have that paper here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is upon a printed form, "No. 2, Mary Ward; name of the patient, Louisa Morgan; age, 26; name of disease, phthisis, left side"—I don't know whose writing that is—the physician dictates the name of the disease to the clinical clerk, and the clinical clerk writes it down, and also the prescription—I prescribed for her and the clinical clerk wrote it down, and on that paper my first prescription is entered on June 9th—I do not go the rounds of the hospital every afternoon; I go three times a week—after the 9th June, I went from time to time to see this patient—I saw her on Friday, 2nd July—during all this time, from 9th June to 2nd July, she had no attack to my knowledge of hysteria—I had not all this time treated her entirely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030126"/>
               <p>for the disease of the left lung; her general condition was weakness general weakness; that was the main feature of her case—about a fortnight afterwards I said to the sister that it was desirable that she should be got up in the evening if possible, saying that the longer she remained in bed the weaker she would get—on Friday, 2nd July, there was scarcely any difference in her from the time of her admission into the hospital—I found nothing serious in her state about that time; but on 2nd July, or it might have been the Wednesday previous, my attention was called to her com<lb/>plaining of a pain in her left leg; I examined her left leg, and could not find any tangible cause for the pain—she seemed to be as usual—the next time I saw her was Monday, 5th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, or a little after 3 o'clock—I was struck with her altered appearance, and I made the exclamation, "What has occurred to make this alteration?"—she was in bed—Nurse Ingle then was present, and the patient No. 2 made a statement to me—Ingle was standing at the foot of the bed, and I should think she could hear, I have no reason to believe that she could not; she was standing at the foot of the bed—the patient was in a feeble state and crying—it was made in a hesitating manner; disconnected or hesitating—I sat on the bed in order to hear better what she said—when she made the statement Ingle made no reply to it—she spoke in a voice which could be heard, and I should repeat her answers, because the students were all round—I had not to put my ear to her mouth—it was in a voice sufficiently loud for those standing round the bed to hear her, but in my way of putting questions to patients, I very often repeat the answers—I will not say that she spoke so loud that Ingle heard all she said, but she spoke sufficiently loud for a person standing where the nurse was to hear what she said—I was not obliged to sit on the bed to hear what she said, but in order that I might the better hear what she said; I am a little hard of hearing myself; I don't say it with reference to this case, but I find I am obliged to put questions twice to hear the answer—that may be the fault of the questioner—she was half crying—I do not mean to say that some portion of the conversation in my judgment she could not hear—just the same as I should say of every conversation, that I cannot say that every word was audible—it was ordinary conversa<lb/>tion, such as in my judgment a person standing where she was could have heard; and the substance of the conversation I am sure would be heard by the nurse—she made no remark, but she made a remark afterwards that I had not made any inquiries of her—the deceased said, "I was taken to the bath-room this morning, and placed in a bath with cold water to begin with, and was kept in the bath for an hour and a half;" she then went on to say, "I could not help it; it was a mistake that any one is liable to make sometimes"—she said she was in the bath some time before warm water was turned on—Ingle said nothing at that time—I found the patient half crying, and there was this further said, that she had not been able to get warm since—she seemed cold and was shivering—I did not examine her at that time to see if her state of health had been affected at all, but I made the observation at once that this patient's statement must be inquired into, and I sent for the sister of the ward, who was attending with another physician at the time—I told her what the patient had said—Ingle was there then, and I paid that the matter must be fully investigated—I requested the house physician, Mr. Howell, to obtain full particulars, and to place them before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030127"/>
               <p>me at my next visit—he resides in the hospital—that was all that passed—supposing the statement of the patient was correct, she was in such a state as I should expect her to be in if she had had this bath given to her; in such a state of cold and shivering; just the state which would be produced by the bath which had been previously administered—I had not ordered a bath for her—in the state she was in it was not a prudent thing to take her from the bed and give her a bath, and keep her away for the time stated, but an ordinary cleansing bath would not be improper then; I should expect proper care to be taken, and if she could not walk she should be carried in a chair—I do not think she was in a fit state to walk from the bed to the bath and back—I saw her again on Wednesday, the 7th—the house physician was with me, and on account of what he said, I carefully examined her body, and found several bruise marks on the left arm—there were bruise marks also, but not to the same extent, on the right arm, and an extensive bruise on the left leg, and the skin there was abraded; the marks on the arm were just the bruises you would expect from the arm being pinched very tightly; when I say pinched, I mean taken hold of—when a patient is in bad health she would very likely show bruises more readily—she was depressed, but there were no inflammatory symptoms at that time, and she was able to talk to me in the ordinary way—on that Wednesday evening I went down specially to see her again, and she was in about the same state—next day, Thursday, the 8th, I found her in quite a different state; she had a flushed face, a hot skin, a frequent pulse, and she looked about in somewhat a vacant manner, giving me the impression that tubercular inflammation of the brain was setting in—there might be many causes for that, but to make the matter intelligible a little explanation will be required; I am quite ready, for the sake of assistance in this matter, to give that explanation—rough treatment and exposure to the cold, with a patient suffering from lung disease, would set up tubercular inflammation; with such a predisposition existing, and a person suffering from consumption has that predisposition, I should say that such treatment as the patient was subjected to would be calculated to act as a sufficient exciting cause—sup<lb/>posing what was done to the patient on Monday morning did operate as the exciting cause, I do not say tubercular signs would show themselves on the third day, but that would be an ordinary time—on this Thursday when I saw the signs of tubercular inflammation in the brain, the patient did not decidedly rally, there was a slight rally; she became more conscious for a time) but afterwards relapsed into a more serious state than she was before—I saw her afterwards every day, except one of the two Sundays; I went on pur<lb/>pose to see her, and from day to day the disease progressed in the ordinary course of tubercular inflammation of the brain, and she died on Wednesday, July 21st to the 22nd; that was a fortnight after I first recognized the tubercular inflammation of the brain—in the meantime I had caused the nurse to be removed from the ward; on Friday, the 9th, I thought her presence was prejudicial to the patient—I spoke to Dr. Stephens, and she was removed immediately—I was afterwards present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Howell—I found that there was disease on the left lung of long standing, not in an active state—I found that my belief of tubercular disease of the brain having set in was correct; there was an extensive tubercular deposit, with inflammation of the membranes, espe<lb/>cially noticeable at the summit of the brain, and inflammation of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030128"/>
               <p>membranes; there were also two inflammatory masses just below the surface of one hemisphere of the brain; there was also some tubercular deposit at the base of the brain, but that was insignificant in proportion to the other—the immediate cause of death was tubercular inflammation of the brain—there was also disease found in the pelvic region of the body, connected with the Fallopian tubes, which are in the broad ligaments of the womb—that had preceded and had been at the foundation of her having no family and had been the cause of the hysterical symptoms—there were cysts, one of which had opened into the bowel, and the contents of the cyst had discharged into the bowel—there was an opening existing between one of the cyst and the bowel; a patient in that condition would be very likely to soil the bed, I think—supposing this disease of the brain had not set in, from the state in which I found the left lung she might have lived for some time—I was beginning to be unfavourably impressed by the feature, when she first came in I thought favourably of her case, but after some time I began to be unfavourably impressed by that feature, but I saw no imme<lb/>diate danger—I had before July began to be unfavourably impressed; not from the disease of the lungs, but from the general state of the patient not improving to the extent that I could have desired—I am merely mention<lb/>ing to you an impression after the patient had been in three weeks, and before the day of the bath—I did not look to the bruises in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN HOLKER</hi>. The bruises had nothing to do with the death—the skin was discoloured, what ordinary mortals would call black and blue—the skin of an invalid is easily discoloured, especially that of a woman, and more especially if an invalid—I cannot say whether the flesh of a woman is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> easily discoloured than that of a man—the cyst connected with the broad ligament of the womb, was of old standing—they may have been going on for years—they might have started into existence after the first child was born, and they would have prevented her having a family—the cyst was in a state of suppuration—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, tubercular meningitis; that is, inflammation of the brain set up in consequence of the presence of tubercles—there were a considerable number of tubercles, especially at the summit; there were some at the base—there were some masses of deposit on one of the hemi<lb/>spheres of the brain, what we call yellow tubercles, and there were also grey tubercles, but the principal portion at the summit of the brain were yellow tubercles—the grey tubercles were chiefly at the base of the brain—the disease which was the cause of death, inflammation of the brain caused by the tubercles, is caused tubercular meningitis—if there were tubercles with<lb/>out inflammation, we should simply speak of tubercles of the brain—the deceased had hysterical symptoms—I said so in consequence of the erratic pains, which I could not account for from disease—I have said she was suffering from consumption of the left lung, accompanied by hysterical tendency but no hysterical fits—when a patient first comes in she is examined—sometimes we have some difficulty in ascertaining what the disease is and on some occasions the disease may be only inserted on the paper after some time—that not unfrequently happens—the clinical clerk filled up this paper—it is filled up in different writings; one clinical clerk succeeds another—the clinicle clerk takes the account from the physician, and makes notes from day to day—you draw my attention to that paper being in a different</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030129"/>
               <p>writing; the name of the disease, "phthisis," was said to be filled in after<lb/>wards; that is certainly not with my knowledge, I should consider it most reprehensible; and if you look at it you will find that it is in the same writing as the name of the disease—Dr. Steele, the superintendent of the hospital, suggested that—there has not been a great deal of difficulty about; this case—the public know well that there has been a good deal, of un<lb/>pleasantness at Guy's about the nurses; about some fresh system of nursing—there is a difference between the nurses; about some fresh system of nursing staff—I mean that some one suggested that this has been filled in since the facts were all discovered—I cannot tell you when I first saw the paper at the top of the bed filled up in tins way, but as far as I know it was filled in within a few days of the patient's admission; I am speaking of the name of the disease; if you notice, it is in the same writing as the first prescription, and the subsequent prescriptions are in a different writing; I cannot tell who wrote it—"Louisa Morgan" may be in a different writing to the words "Phthisis, left side"—I say, "The patient seemed to he suffering from various aches and pains, for which there was no tangible cause at present, but there was a certain pallor probably proceeding from an anaemic condition of the blood"—anaemic means pallid; the substance of it is that the patient was vary much out of health—if we have a patient suffering from acnes and pains of this kind, that is known as hysteria; but we have aches and pains also in the male subject which cannot be caused by hysteria—I say she was suffering from consumption with hysterical symptoms; I have to do. with a great many hysterical subjects—hysteria is a well recognised disease, but it is very peculiar—I do not admit that a person suffering from hysteria "fancies" she has got a number of aches and pains which she has not got; I believe she feels these aches and pains, hut the tangible cause on them does not exist; it is necessarily belonging to females—I have not known men hystarical, but hypochondriacal—there may be aches on pains without a tangible cause in a man or in a woman, just the same as there may be pal<lb/>pitation of the heart; it depends upon wrong nerve action;—a woman suffer<lb/>ing from hysterical symptoms may undoubtedly imagine that she is unable to more her limbs when she is able to move them; that happens from time to time—it is not the common thing for physicians to put the patient in such a position as she shall be obliged to exert herself—with a patient suffering from hysteria, galvanism may be used; we endeavour to bring to the knowledge of the patient that she has the power of using her limbs; we do that if we induce her to use them—if we have got An hystarical patient, and her feeling is that she cannot use her limbs, the best way is to induce her to use them—I have spoken about this woman having hysterical symptoms; I said that it would be better for her if she got up; that was about a fortnight after her admission—I may have said so twice, but not on sevaral occasions—after the sister had drawn my attention to the pain in the left leg, and I saw that she was very weak, and said to the sister, that she must use her own judgment on the subject, as to whether, she was equal to getting up or not, of an evening—when I saw her on 5th July, I have no decided knowledge of being informed that a few days prior to that she had got up and attempted to dress and had fallen—I heard it mentioned at the Inquest; I am not aware that I had heard it before—the consumption, the mischief in the lungs, had nothing to do with the other disease, except as predisposing the patient to tubercle—the real cause of death was the tuber<lb/>cular</p>

               <p>inflammation of the brain which was set up—as a rule, I do not tell the sister of the ward what the disease is which the patient is suffering from—the sister has nothing to do with the name of the disease; she has to do with the nursing arrangements, which are conducted on general principles, or with the disease itself, unless it is anything requiring special instructions—supposing the patient had been suffering from tubercle of the brain when she came in, I should not have given special instructions to the sister; nothing more than the directions which were given—tubercle of the brain is not uncommon—tubercular meningitis is a common form of death—tubercle of the brain does not invariably end in tubercular meningitis; it does not always produce inflammation—tubercle of the brain is not generally fatal—tubercle of the brain does not kill as tubercle of the brain, unless it has grown to such a size as to press upon the brain substance, and set up inflammation—we know nothing of tubercle of the brain until it grows, so as to press upon the brain; it is not the tubercle which we know, but the effects of the tubercle—tubercles have been found in the brain of persons who died from other causes; so I say, I do not know—how can I say that persons can have tubercle on the brain and recover—my answer is simply this, that tubercle of the brain is discovered in <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations without having caused death, and there being good ground for believing that it has existed for some considerable time previously, and therefore we do not know, if the patient had lived, how long it would have gone on; it might have got into a cheesy condition, and remained in a dormant state—I cannot tell you how long it might have been there, because there was no opportunity of knowing when it came there—if there are no symptoms to indicate the commencement, how can I date it?—I say that a person may have tubercle upon the brain without having any symptoms; you are putting me to answer an impossibility—tubercle of the brain generally produces inflammation and death—it must do, but there are cases where a person has all the symptoms of tuber<lb/>cular meningitis, and may recover, but you look upon it always as a fatal disease—I say tubercle may exist in the brain without any symptoms—inflammation will not set up unless the tubercle has grown sufficiently to press upon the brain—a slight rise of temperature is not an indication of tubercle, but it is an accompaniment; continued headache may be an accompaniment, and nausea may be; vomiting is another symptom of the inflammation; I must get you to distinguish between tubercle and inflammation—supposing the tubercle has grown, and is pressing upon the brain, that would produce headache; it is what constitutes a tumour of the brain, but you would have no inflammation—where the tubercle has grown and is pressing upon the brain headache would be one of the symptons I should look for, but not a rise in temperature, unless there is inflammation—I should look for nausea and positive sickness, but not torpor and great languor—I should not expect a patient to be in a state of torpidity—I should expect a patient to have an objection to exercising, and I should look for partial paralysis; paralysis generally appears more in one limb than the other—I should expect a patient to involuntarily cast motions, according to the extent to which the growth has advanced, after it has produced decided paralytic symptons: even without inflammation; you have a foreign body in the brain structure—supposing the tubercle had advanced to such an extent and pressed to such an extent upon the brain that it produced</p>

               <p>headache, nausea, sickness, disinclination to move, and inability to use the limbs, and loss of the power to retain the motions, I should say that the patient would be in a different condition altogether to this patient; in that case I should certainly not judge it necessary to give special directions with regard to her—I consider that in such a case that it would be a proper thing to give a woman a bath in order to cleanse her; even though she was in the condition described, she ought to have a cleanse bath; it is the duty of the nurse to give it—tubercle does frequently end in inflammation of the brain—its ordinary period of duration is about a fortnight; certainly not six weeks; that is a mistake; that is tubercular inflammation—if you cannot give the commencement how can you date it—tubercular meningitis has not been known to run six weeks, nor tubercular disease ending in meningitis; that is a disease which lasts for years—it is not well recognized in the profession that tubercular disease, which ends in meningitis, runs about six weeks, because there is reason to believe that tubercles may exist fox months or years—I did not see the patient on the Sunday before the bath; I saw her on the Friday—she was then complaining of a pain in her left leg, which was, I think, attributable to pressure of this cyst on the nerves, which would also account for any weakness in the leg—I said before the Coroner, that when I saw her she was as usual, that there was nothing urgent in her condition—she was in about the same state—I said there was no sensible alteration in her condition during the month previous to the use of the bath—I saw the clinical report to-day; I asked for it, it was taken away, I do not know by whom; I suppose by Dr. Steele, the superintendent—these clinical reports are for the physician—I considered it belonged to me—it is the ordinary practice to have reports prepared, and to-day is the first day I have had an opportunity of reading it—on the 11th June, that was on the day after the admission, the condition of her tem<lb/>perature is put as 100.4, and on the 12th as 99.8—the normal temperature is 98.4—on the 16th there is "still complains of headache; says she was worse after taking her medicine"—the medicine contained some opium—"A harsh sound is heard at the left apex;" that was in connection with the consumption—"Appetite not so good to-day; tongue rather furred; bowels open; headache is less than it was, but still complains slightly"—that is on June 20th; you will find no mention of headache afterwards—I think my attention was drawn to the headache at this date—there was nothingspecial in the rise of temperature from 98 to 100.4; then there is nothing until the 25th—there might be nothing to note down particularly—in an urgent case of tubercular meningitis there is a daily record—the headache had left her on the 25th—on the evening of the 7th July the temperature is 100.8; it is written as 7th July and evidently applies to the 8th, because the account on the 7th exactly corresponds with what I observed to be the condition of the patient on the 8th—I did not take her temperature—the report goes to July 14th, when the temperature is 103; that is the temperature of tuber<lb/>cular meningitis—we cannot say any specific temperature, but when a patient has a temperature of 102 or 103, we should expect it to go on in<lb/>creasing gradually until death—I see the last recorded temperature is 106—that is not precisely the temperature of tubercular meningitis it may be °f fever or inflammation of the lungs—it would be the temperature I should look for if tubercular meningitis was there, but there are modifying influences—I should expect it to be progressive, perhaps until just at the</p>

               <p>last, when a collapsed state might be induced—rise in temperature, head<lb/>ache, nausea, sickness, and so on would not be an indication of mischief in the brain, of tubercular deposit, or you would have hundreds and thousands of persons as suffering from inflammation of the brain who had none—these things may arise from other causes—there is nothing indicative in that report of disease of the brain—hysterical symptoms are not associated with disease of the brain—I never knew such a case—I do not know that I can call one to mind—there might be hysterical symptoms, the influence of the disease on the brain might act in that way—I do not say that the bath set up the tubercles—I cannot say that tubercles were there when the bath was taken—I have not said that the bath would probably cause tubercular disease—it would cause inflammation; any excitement would cause that, if there was the predisposition existing—I should think an animated conversation of some duration would be likely to set it up—a very slight cause can do so—a bath properly administered would certainly not be likely to set it up, not in my opinion—certainly not a cleansing bath—if this woman had been hysterical there would not be anything wrong in assisting her to the bath—if she had been suffering from tubercular deposit, not accompanied by inflammation, there wouldn't be anything wrong in it—the impropriety which the prisoner was guilty of was, in my opinion, giving her a cold bath and keeping her there for a long time, and in taking her to the bath as she did—when she found the patient couldn't walk she ought not to have exercised her own judgment that she could walk if she chose, she ought to have assisted her—it might be that if she was hysterical she would suppose she couldn't walk when she really could if she chose to exert herself; but it is not for the nurses to judge—I had recommended that she should try and sit up, to get out of bed and to dress—the marked difference which I saw in the patient was a distressed appearance—I questioned her and she answered in the way I have described—I did not ask the prisoner about it—I had nothing to do with the nurse—I did not ignore the nurse—a statement of that kind made by a patient, and a nurse implicated standing at the foot of the bed, it was not for me to decide between the patient and the nurse—I asked her nothing about it—I did not give her any opportunity of explanation—the first time time at which symptoms of in<lb/>flammation appeared was on Thursday—I then discovered tubercular inflammation, a fatal disease, which undoubtedly caused her death—I think you will find effervescents ordered on that day—no alteration was made in the name of the disease, or any special instructions given—I should consider that the bath ought to have been given in bed—it would have been im<lb/>proper to have taken her to the bath and have given it to her, when urgent symptoms set it—I would not say "most improper," if it was done with care—if she was put into a chair and carried to the bath, and then a cleansing bath used, I do not consider that would have been improper—that is my view—it would entirely depend on the state of the patient—I did not give any specific instructions as to how she should be treated by the nurses when I found she suffered from tubercular meningitis; no word as to whether she was to be given a bath or not—I did not tell any nurse that she was suffering from tubercular meningitis—I left it to them to exercise their common sense and humanity—their common sense would tell then what was the condition of the patient—they could easily see that she</p>

Yesterday had a very prolonged bath, almost cold water; remained in it a considerable time; appears to have suffered from a severe mental shock"—that is an accurate account of the state of the patient on that day—I believe the description on 7th refers to the 8th—Dr, Mahomed, the registrar of the hospital, would see this from time to time.</p>

I am hospital physician at Guy's—I recollect the deceased—I did not come in as resident horse physician till the 1st July—that was the first time I saw her—from that day up to the day the bath was given her I saw her; she was able to sit up in bed and con<lb/>verse; after the bath she was not able to do so; she laid down in bed, and as far as I am aware she never sat up afterwards—I noticed her state from day to day before the bath—I noticed the difference in her the morning after she had the bath—I got in the ward a few minutes before 1 o'clock—I went up to her in the ordinary way and asked her how she was; she could not or did not answer me—I stayed there for some time trying to see what I could make out of her; it was such a change as to cause my attention—no statement was made to me till the afternoon and then it was not made to me directly—I found about four or five bruises on the left arm and a Iarge bruise on the inner side of the left elbow two smaller bruises on the left arm, also a bruise on the elbow, two on the inner side of the right arm, and several down from the left knee to the ankle of the left leg in front; a pressure of the fingers would have caused those bruises on the fore arm, they had that appearance—they were such as could be caused by a grip of the hand—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I came in just as it was being finished—I have heard Dr. Pavy's evidence, and agree with it, as to the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, and the cause of death, and as to whether this was the right or wrong treatment of the woman—she was complaining of aches and pains before the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. I think she was rather an emotional patient—that is not the same thing as hysteria—a patient may be emotional without any disorder of the nervous system, but she would not be hysterical without it, because that is a disorganization without any disease—she had consumption associated with hysterical symptons; in that shape she was emotional—she said she was unable to walk; I was unable to find the exact cause of that—it was not my view that if she tried to walk she could—I had not seen her walk, therefore I had not an opportunity of forming such an opinion—I could not discover any symptoms to satisfy me why she could not walk—hysterical symptoms are not generally associated with tubercular disease of the brain—hysteria is a disorder of the nervous system without any organic change—if you have tubercular disease you have organic change—it is a disease which comes on very insidiously; there might not be any rise of temperature at all except there is inflammation; headache might be a symptom of it, if enduring for some time; nausea and sickness might be symptoms of it, and inability to use the limbs and dragging of the leg, but that depends upon what part of the brain is affected—inability to control the evacuations is never a sympton until a late stage of the disease, then the disease would not exactly be tubercular—it might be from the presence of a tumour in the brain—I never directed my attention to ascertain whether this woman had tubercular disease of the brain; there was nothing to shew me that she had any disease of the sort—the symptoms just named did not indicate to my mind that tubercular disease was there; they did not indicate hysteria as far as I was aware—when I first saw her she had no rise of temperature—I tested it; I believe there was a loss of motion in one of the legs, but I never saw her walk—I did not hear that there was loss of motion in one of the legs; I knew there was pain in the leg; we tested her before the bath and she moved her leg perfectly—I did not tell the nurse that she would not try to move her leg; believe I said something like it, but that was not exactly what I said—this loss of power in the leg I was first acquainted with after the bath, not before—I believed there was a certain amount of reality in it, but I thought there was an exaggerated loss of power—inflammatory symptoms had set up when I sent in this report to the treasurer—I am alluding to the Saturday morning, the 10th—the evening temperature then was 101.6, that is a condition of inflammation; 99.2 is above the normal temperature—it may indicate inflammation or not, but you would have to compare something—you can have a temperature of 100 without inflammation, or 101—this was not the temperature of a day or hour, so it was the temperatures of disease—these temperatures told me that there was inflammation; that I am positive about—it does not exactly follow that in tubercular meningitis the woman would not be able to use her limbs—I believe there are cases on record were persons have recovered from tubercular meningitis; I have never seen one—it generally closes in about a fortnight—I have not had much experience in tubercular disease—I have not seen a case in which there have been yellow tubercles only—I have seen it in the lungs, not in the brain—I have seen grey tubercles in the brain, but never yellow that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. I have heard Dr. Pavy's evi<lb/>dence; I think I agree with him entirely; I would like to make one addition, that I thought that the signs of pain in the leg, headache, sickness, and the slight rise of temperature, which were recorded in the report soon after her admission, were fully accounted for by a suppurating cyst in her pelvis—they were utterly unlike the symptoms we find in tubercular disease—I did not discover, the cyst till the post-mortem examination; when I noticed the symptoms I did not in the least know of the cyst—it did not occur to me they might be produced by brain mis<lb/>chief—I thought there was something behind, more than mischief in the longs, which I could not find out, but I did not give any opinion; the lung disease was very slight indeed—I thought that would not account for her generally bad health; I thought there was greater debility—I thought there was something more than lung disease, long before she had the bath—I did not see any hysterical symptoms; I was told in the ward by one of the clinical clerks that she seemed to be hysterical—that was after her bath, and before also; he said she was nervous—he did not tell me that the physician said she should be induced to exert herself—it would be better for her to be induced to exert herself if she was hysterical, if there was nothing more; in my experience, I have had a considerable number of cases of yellow tubercle—they gives rise to no symptoms, nor to rise of temperature, I have never seen it do so—it might give rise to headache, sickness, inability to use the limbs, dragging of the leg, or inability to control evacuation; if I may explain I would say these were present in a marked degree, to such a degree that my attention would be immediately directed to the brain—her not being able</p>

               <p>to control her evacuations would be easily explained by the state of her pelvis, it would also be explained by the presence of tubercular disease if she was in the last stage of tubercular meningitis—yellow tubercule pressing on the brain would produce partial paralysis in some places—it would be very unusual for paralysis to disable a woman from retaining her evacuation; it might do so in a vital part of the brain; I was told she had dirtied the bed that day—I did not consider that a very serious symptom; she soiled the bed afterwards on several occasions—she was afterwards in a state of collapse and shock, and it was impossible to remove her; I am resident in the hospital—the senior physician is Dr. Habershon—Sir William Gull is consulting physician, I think the senior one—Dr. Owen Rees is another physician, Dr. Pavy is the visiting physician—Sir William Gull does not visit the hospital, he has not any charge over the patients; I believe he has some reputation. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The consulting physicians Dr. Gull and Dr. Rees were formerly physicians at the hospital in the position of Dr. Pavy—after a certain time there is a compulsory retirement, and then they are made consulting physicians—they never attend the hospital; it is a post of honour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Deposition was read as follows</hi>:—"I was head nurse of Mary Ward. I attended on the deceased. I am willing to answer all questions. Deceased was in the hospital, I did not know what for. I can read. There was a paper at the head of the bed. I looked at the paper after the bath, and then had no idea it was consumption. I had no idea of it till the Treasurer mentioned it, and asked if I had seen the letter. She had complained of aches and pains, but none of which appeared to trouble her. I found the bed dirty when I went to make it, and I complained to her of making herself and the bed so dirty, and said she must have a bath whilst I changed the bed. She said nothing to that I told the sister that deceased was so dirty that I must put her into a bath whilst I changed the bed. She said very well, and gave directions about the bed, but not about the bath. I then went back and helped deceased out of bed, and with my support helped her to walk along the boards to the bath room. She had her boots on. I did not see Costello there, I did not say to Costello that deceased was very dirty. I walked by her side and had my arm round her back, and supported her. I may have taken hold of her left arm. I did not drag her along, certainly not She showed an inclination to slip on to the ground. I thought her object was to be carried, but she could walk, and I thought it unnecessary. I took her into the bath-room. There was no water in the bath. I sat her on the side of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030137"/>
               <p>the bath, and when I had undressed her I lifted up her legs and twisted them over into the bath. There was no water in the bath when I put her into it I then took her under her arms and lowered her into the bath. I then turned on the hot water. I think I turned hot and cold together. There was not more than 6 inches of water in the bath altogether. I then left her to wash herself and, went to make her bed. She only complained of one leg being stiff. I can't say how long I was away. I came back once or twice. Once I found her clinging to the side with her head rather to the water. I turned the water off to get her into a sitting position again, and turned it on again, and she called out suddenly, and I concluded that it was too hot, and turned it off again. She was in the bath altogether from about a quarter to 9 o'clock, when I fetched her, and before 10 o'clock when I got her back. Taking her there took some time. I helped her out of the bath. Costello came to me once and said deceased was so cold in the bath. I said I had been to her and found her shaking, but I felt her back, and she was perfectly warm. I may have said something, of the sort that she was so obstinate I was determined not to help her. She could not get out of the bath alone. I told her to rest in the chair and then walk back, and not make herself a laughingstock to the ward. If she would help herself I would help her. I left her wapped up in the chair for 20 minutes. She then started walking very fairly with my arm round, her. going along she did not take hold of the wall. She did not drag one leg till a gentleman came forward. I put my foot to catch her leg from slipping sideways. I did not put my knee to push her on. She did not speak. I then put her into bed. I did not drag her along, of course not; I had my arm to her back all the way."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, carrying on my practice in Brook Street, London—I am the Senior Consulting Physician of Guy's Hospital—I have made myself acquainted with the details of this case, and have perused the clinical report very accurately—I cannot say that I have also perused the evidence of the medical men called before the Coroner—I am not acquainted with the evidence of my colleagues—I have perused the clinical report—tubercular disease of the brain occurs in two forms: when it forms slowly it is yellow, and frequently in masses; when it forms more quickly it is disseminated, scattered, and is more or less transparent—I should describe the latter condition as the grey tubercle—yellow tubercle is of common occurrence—the course of the disease is insidious, and attended with equivocal symptoms—the symptoms are headache; occasional sickness, or not; sometimes slight rise of temperature, but nothing much; 100° or 100.5° or 99° are about the temperature of the deposit of yellow tubercle, and sometimes a depression of temperature—the symptoms are equivocal, but they have a dreadful significance to the experienced phy<lb/>sician, although they may seem trifling to bystanders—the natural course for the yellow tubercle is into inflammatory mischief of the brain itself, or its membranes—it is an invariably fatal malady—the course of the malady</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030138"/>
               <p>is uncertain, except in its closing stages, which may vary from a few days to a week or two—that is after the inflammation has set in—when I say "a week or two," I do not mean literally a week or two; I mean indefinitely one or two—I think it is not strictly governed by time—the yellow tubercle may exist in a latent form for a long time; and the grey tubercle for days, probably a fortnight or more; not before the inflam<lb/>matory mischief, with the inflammatory mischief—in the case of yellow tubercle you would be guided by the symptoms of the patient as to when it was first formed—I doubt whether a patient would live six weeks with the yellow tubercle without symptoms—loss of power in the limbs would be a symptom of brain mischief—the inability to control the motions would be a striking symptom of brain mischief—it is a brain symptom; it does not occur in hysteria; never, I think—I do not know hysteria as associated with tubercular disease—I have the clinical report before me—assuming that this woman, when she came into the hospital, two days after was complaining or suffering from nausea, from sickness, and that for some time she suffered continuously from headache, and her temperature was from 100.4° to something slightly over that, and sometimes something slightly under it; assuming also that she had lost power in her limbs, that she had been un<lb/>able to stand when she got up to dress, and that she had inability to control her her evacuations, then I say she had brain disease; whether tubercular or not would depend.—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But in your view should a skilful physician have known that brain disease existed?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There I must be careful—there is no doubt great difficulty in recognising brain disease at that stage—there is no doubt it is one of the most difficult parts of medical practice, but I cannot doubt that suspicion should have existed—there is great difficulty in determining with any degree of certainty, perhaps only suspicion—supposing this woman was suffering from brain disease on the 5th July, which rendered her inca<lb/>pable of using her limbs, in my opinion the administration of the bath would be most improper—I should say if there was the presence of yellow tubercle in the brain an ordinary bath might be used for washing purposes, but it would require immense care not to exhaust the patient or tire her—the skin or flesh of a woman who has been in bed and suffering for some time is easily discoloured, in strumous people, and this woman was—the attempt to lift herself from the bath might have produced discolouration—I do not think that the fact of the woman being put in the bath and kept there for some time would itself produce or give rise to the tubercle; if so, we should have tubercles all over the community every day—I very much doubt whether death would be accelerated by this treatment—the course of the malady is continuous and universally fatal—the bath did not produce any injury to the head, which is the chief seat of the malady—the dragging of the limbs would not increase inflammation of the brain, though in this case it was much to be deplored dragging the poor thing to the bath; but I doubt of its doing anything to the brain itself—it would subject her to dreadful suffering, I should think, as far as she was conscious—such people are not so alive as people who are well, I mean alive to suffering, not perfectly conscious—supposing the excitement or the shock of the bath had caused inflammation to set in, I should have expected to find an alteration in temperature; there was, however, no rise in temperature for two days after the bath, at least as appears from this report—four days after the bath there is no more rise in the temperature than half a degree—that does</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030139"/>
               <p>not lead me to the conclusion that the bath did not cause anything; it had not much to do with it—then, again, the bath could not in the nature of the case do it—you might batter a person about the head, and set up inflammation of the brain; but taking a bath would not, for remember this woman had not active disease in the lung—the evidence shows that the disease in the lung was quite latent, inactive—the yellow tubercle presses on the brain, but the transparent tubercle does not much—if the bath had been cold I do not think it would have caused inflammation of the brain—we put ice to the head in inflammation of the brain to check it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. We do not put ice to the feet and body to drive the blood to the head; we do not drive the blood to the head at all; we put it to the head—supposing this woman's head was not in the cold, but her body and legs in the cold, and she was kept for half an hour or more shivering in the cold, that would have a tendency to interfere with the circulation, but will you tell me what cold you mean?—this woman had brain disease, and they are given to shivering—supposing I found that she did not shiver at all till she had the bath, and that she did shiver after<lb/>wards, even that would not be a fair inference that the cold caused the shivering and not disease of the brain—it might be the first shivering—this shivering might fairly be considered the first symptom of brain disease—I mean it might be a nervous shivering—it might have been the first shivering of brain disease—a sense of cold often goes with real heat—with great care a person may have a bath and be washed, with disease of the brain, without doing any serious injury—I should think with brain disease the woman ought not to be put into a chair, but I should think it might be done without any injurious effects—I should not do it—it is not possible to tell when tubercle commences—you may suspect from the symptoms—I will not say that often suspicion is very inaccurate—you judge of the tubercular commencement from the symptoms—the symptoms are equivocal—they are uncertain—we cannot tell with any degree of certainty; we only suspect—the clinical report is a report made by the clinical clerk, who is a student—I sent for it when I read the report of the Coroner's inquest—I sent to the house, not to the Treasurer of the hospital, to Doctor Steele—I read the report in the paper—I had then two reports, the physician's report, which he said was singularly accurate, and this report—you cannot tell positively how long the yellow tubercle existed before the inflammatory symptoms set in; you can only suspect from the symptoms, sickness and headache.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. It was in the post-mortem examination I found that there had been tubercular inflammation of the brain, and if I could go back and have a record of the symptoms attending the patient during her lifetime for six weeks or two months, and obtain an accurate account of the symptoms, I then should be able to say, "I put my finger upon that day"—perhaps not that day, but that time—you find one symptom one day, and that joined with something else the next, and I should say that at that time the mischief was commencing—until the acute symptoms show themselves you cannot say with certainty there are tubercles—when on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination it was discovered that yellow tubercles existed during lifetime on the brain, and in that way caused death, then you might trace back and get the origin of it.</p>

               <p>great accuracy—the common time after the inflammatory grey tubercles set in till death followed would be about fourteen days—they remain quiescent; I will not say for a long time; we have no evidence of a long time—the best judge of the state of the patient ought to be the physician who sees the patient from day to day—a person who knows the case from the commencement at the hospital, and sees it from time to time, and watches it, and attends to it as the physician, no doubt ought to be the best judge of the state of the patient—his eye can descry the difference in the patient on the one day between what is done in that case, and what is alleged afterwards—in this case I should certainly put my judgment against the judgment of the physician who attended the case from the commencement; and I will tell you the ground of it; upon the students' report I would put my opinion against that of Dr. Pavy—the physician governs the students' report—his duty is to see it—I am not assuming that it is the same as if it was made by the physician himself; but I was a physician of Guy's for 20 years and my clinical reports were my own reports—I always dictated the report myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In this case I put my judgment against that of the physician who attended to the case; because, when I read the report, I found there was headache, nausea, sickness, and rise of temperature, and all the signs of brain disease, and she dies with grey and yellow tubercles of the brain, and I know that these yellow tubercles would not be set up in fourteen days; I did not receive a report from the physician himself from the Coroner's inquest, which the physician said was singularly accurate—I did not find any symptom of hysteria—hysteria was said by the late Sir Benjamin Brodie to be a paralysis of the will, and the duty is to urge and rouse the patient—supposing a woman is suffering from hysteria, or there is reason to believe it, and she thought she could not walk, when in truth she could, trying to get her to exert herself would be the right thing to do—it would be the best thing to do; the late Dr. Jeffe, of Leamington, who had great reputation in cases of hysteria, used to treat it in this way, by taking the girls in his carriage a mile or two from home, and, then turning them out and making them walk home—that was proper treatment.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These were three cheques for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">drawn by F.

I went to 91, Long Lane, at 7 o'clock on the evening of 10th May, directly after Holmes was brought in; it was baker's shop, with the name of Holmes outside, and arranged on shelves round the shop inside were 23 empty butter firkins, 20 empty cheese boxes, 14 empty biscuit boxes, and some dummy cheeses arranged carefully on the shelves round the shop, and painted in large letters round the shop were "Choicest dairy provisions, rich old Cheshire and other cheeses, prime mild Wiltshire and other bacons, prime Devon and Dorset butters"—I did not find the smallest particle of butter, cheese, bacon, or anything else; I found some bread, and some flour in small paper bags similar to the bag found in Holmes's pocket—outside, on the lamp, was "Bread, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per quartern," and that was also marked on the window with chalk—there was a bakehouse, and two sacks of flour—I searched the house and brought away a sack full of letters and papers; they consisted of orders for goods, and commission from every part of England respecting flour, provisions, and other articles, and a large number of answers—while I was searching the shop a man brought in a County Court writ, and I found about 40 or 50 County Court summonses; there were judgments amongst them—I found no general business books; there were small account books for credit customers—I Handed the papers I found to Mr. Wontner—on Monday morning, 31st May, I went to Lawrence's premises, 19, Charing Cross; he occupied the first floor back room over the shop, and written on the door was "H. Law<lb/>rence and Co., the Accidental and General Arbitration Company'—the room was very scantily furnished—I found there papers and books which I took away, and cards with "H.

If you will send us guarantee, we will sign and return at once"—upon that I wrote to Dover Brothers for a reference as to themselves and got a satisfactory one—I ultimately got from them this guarantee on the 4th February, which we agreed to take—we then delivered 10 sacks upon that guarantee, to the amount of 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and on the 17th February we received from Dover a promissory note for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at 2 months—we after wards supplied some flour amounting to 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 13th February—we did not send anything on the promissory note—we only delivered it upon Dover's guarantee—we returned the promissory note, refusing to deliver any flour upon it, because that was an order from Dovers themselves—they had opened a shanty—we refused the order, because it was out of our way of business—Holmes's debt of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is still due—we were not paid by Holmes or Dover, and we took proceedings against both, but got nothing—the first 10 sacks were paid for—I do not know whether we obtained judgment, or whether this prosecution stopped it—this letter of the 4th of March we wrote to Dover asking for a cheque of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as we had not obtained payment from Holmes—we got no answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEVY</hi>. Ten sacks were supplied, for which we were paid, and 20 for which we were not paid, and for those we sued—I knew that Holmes's father carried on business for 16 or 20 years—I cannot say that I knew Holmes.</p>

I do not know how long the father has been dead—this guarantee is for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had the name of Ashton as a reference for Dover—we wrote to him; I believe he is a surveyor at Kingston—I did not enquire whether Dover had a large contract at Thornton Heath, and that he wanted flour for his workmen—I think Ashton mentioned in his letter that the contract was at Kingston—this is the letter—I never saw Dover till he was at the police-court—I did not sue Dover and Holmes on the promissory note—it was on the guarantee; I am sure of that—it did not go to trial—we instructed Mr. Gaisford, of the Temple, and a writ was taken out by him.</p>

I have been in the employment of the executors of Mr. Charles Flowers, a miller, of Biggleswade—Farrington was a traveller of Mr. Flowers, and his father had been so before him—in December, 1878, an order was taken by one of the Farrington's, for flour to be supplied to Charles Holmes, of Tabard Street, to the amount of about 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell which of the Farrington's brought the order; they were both in the service at that time, the son acting during his father's illness—it was the son's duty to get in this debt from Holmes—he did not succeed in doing so—we have never been paid—Holmes had previously paid for small-quantities of flour.</p>

Tabard Street on the Wednesday, and on Thursday morning we received a letter from a man stating that he (the writer) had bought the business of Holmes—payment was not made—we put the matter in the hands of our solicitors; they sued him, but were unable to serve the writ—I met him in Mark lane some weeks afterwards; I did not speak to him—I afterwards heard of his doing business in Dulwich—the writ was after<lb/>wards served in Long Lane, but on the wrong man—I obtained a second writ, and meeting Holmes in Mark Lane, I said "Mr. Holmes;" he said "Yes"—I said "I have a piece of paper for you"—he took the writ, tore it in two, and knocked me down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">In Custody</hi>). I am under sentence of five years' penal servitude in Pentonville—I was tried here and sentenced with Henry Harbord at they January Sessions, for stealing drugs of the pro<lb/>secutors—after my conviction I communicated with Inspector Phillips and saw him in the prison and made a communication which he took down in writing—I afterwards saw Mr. Fryer, of the firm of May and Bate, and made a statement to him—in October, 1877, Henry Harbord and I were working together at Pink's pickle manufactory, Long Lane, Ber<lb/>mondsey, and the following January I opened a coffee-stall at Dock" Head, Bermondeey, and kept it till September—I was then living at 81, Eupert Street, Bermondsey—I was then single, but engaged to be married to my present wife—Henry Harbord came to my wife and asked her to make some money—I said, "In what way?"—he said that he had a friend who could get any kind of chemicals, red precipitate powder and calomel—I said, "What is the use of getting them if you can't sell them?"—he said, "I can sell them, I have sold tons of them"—I said, "If you can get the chemicals and sell them, why don't you do it your<lb/>self?"—he said, "I am so well known about there, it would get to the governor's ears if I went about there, "meaning the premises—he told me that he worked at Baker's 7 years—I said that I would consider of it—I afterwards got married, and in December I saw him again; he asked me what I thought of it—I said that I would go down with him any time he liked to May and Baker's—he said that we were to meet Tom King the night watchman at May and Baker's—I went there with him the Saturday before Christmas, 1878, at 12.30 in the day, and we met the prisoner King in the street—he and King walked on and I followed—when they had got about 10 yards we all three went together and Harbord said, "This is my <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>"—King said, "Is he a sound one?"—Harbord said, "Yes, you could trust your life in his hands"—King said, "I shan't do anything this side of Christmas. I hare bad leg and it is awkward to get about"—we made an agree<lb/>ment to go down the first Monday in January at 9.30 p.m.—King said that would be a quiet time to go as the police were charging duty—Henry Harbord and I went to William Harbord's house, in Hope Street, Battersea—I left him there as arranged, with King, and went to May and Baker's; I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> there at 9.30 p.m., and found King waiting for me at the small gate—he asked me inside and asked for the bag—I gave him two bags which I brought with me, and went with him and saw him fill them with red precipitate powder—we went through</p>

               <p>three doors, up a flight of stairs—I took 70lbs. of red precipitate; it was taken out with a scoop—Henry Harbord and I took it to my house, Bells Court, Bermondsey Street—we had an arrangement with King to meet on Tuesday night; we went at the same time—King let us in, and asked whether we wanted calomel or red precipitate—I said, "It does not matter"—he said, "We will have lumps to-night, as there is not much calomel there"—he gave me 60lbs. of red precipitate in lumps; he weighed it—I told him Henry Harbord wanted powder—he said, "Come on Thursday night"—you must wear a white smock and carry a tea bottle in jour hand, and you then can pass anyone, the people will have left work—I went at 9.30 on Thursday, with two bags and tea bottle with me—King let me in and we came to iron doors—he opened them, rent in, and got 25lbs. of powder out of a box marked B. T.—I took it to William Harbord's house, and told King it would be easy to draw on Friday—he said, "That is right, I want some money"—I took it to my house, and Henry Harboard came at 9.30 next morning—he said, "I will take some samples, I am going to my old pal—I said he had better sell it—he went away, returned at 12.30, and said he could not find him—he then said he would go to the man who had bought the spirit of him, Mr. Freeman, Chemist, of Kennington Park Road—he returned at 180, and said, "I have had a bit of luck, I sold 14lbs., one of white precipitate, one of calomel, and some bismuth"—I said, "That's no good, there is no red calomel and no white precipitate"—he said he would take ten of red precipitate and one of bismuth, and get money for them—I waited outside the shop; he came out in 20 minutes and said, "This party cannot buy much red precipitate powder, he wants dry chemicals; he says he bought bismuth at three shillings a pound, and red precipitate at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.t and he gave me a sovereign"—he said "You have Men working at chemical works, have you not any pals? "I said, "No"—On next Wednesday I met Henry Harbord, and he said, "I have met my pal, and have sold the powder at a low price," and he was to take it to the Old George public-house, Tower Hill—I went there with him the next Thursday, and met a man named James Clark, who paid six sovereigns, and I had two—we met King again the same night as he left his work, and saw three sovereigns given to him near the police<lb/>office—he said, "I can't do anything this week, there are Some men at work, meet me at the same time next week"—Harbord gave me four boxes on Monday and I gave them to King, and went to William Harbord's house—I stopped there till 9.15 p.m., and then went to May and Baker's—King let me in—he had four bags, weighing 120 lbs.—I said I could not carry the whole of it at once—he said, "Leave two and come back again"—I took it to my place, and next morning to William Harbord's house—he said, "I can't allow you to make an accommodation of my house unless I get something by it"—Henry Harbord said, "We will give you something"—John Clark bought it of us at a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, and we gave William Harbord 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to the factory three times a week, and generally five times—we always sold it to the same person, and gave William Harbord 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the use of his house—on our way from the factory, in June, 1879, with the calomel and bismuth, Serjeant Francis stopped us, and I told him it was whitelead—we were both taken to the station, brought before a magistrate, and remanded on bail; we were subsequently discharged, and the property restored to us at Greenwich</p>

               <p>Police Court, and we sold it to Clark—I did not go to the factory again till 1st July—I then got the same kind of thing—that continued till the end of August—King said that Mr. Fryer had been looking about the premises, saying that there was a thief, and he would catch him—I told Harbord, and we did not go again for a month; wo then returned and continued doing the same till November—all the stuff we took in October we sold to Cross (about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth) between the three of us, King, Henry Harbord, and myself—we took very little in November, because Clark told me he could not sell any till after Christmas—in December I was being trained for a running match by a man named Carpenter every morn<lb/>ing at 10.30, and I told him we should like to sell some drugs, and gave him two or three samples which I got from Henry Harbord's house—on 4th December I god 981bs. of calomel from May and Baker's and left it all night at William Harbord's—next morning I fetched it from Waterloo Station, and the officers took me in custody—I said that it was whitelead—they said, "That tale won't wash this time"—William Harbord was called on my trial to prove that it was whitelead, but the Jury convicted me—he swore that it was the same stuff as the Greenwich stuff—when I took the lumps home I reduced them to powder—I was living in Arthur Street, Walworth, and the landlady told my wife she would not let me the place if I did it at home—we used to get a sheet of paper and lay it on the table and roll it with a bottle—Henry Harbord was not there; my wife has been to his house with me from time to time—I once saw a man on May and Baker's premises who King said was Old Ike, a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of his—Henry Harbord said he became acquainted with Clark through <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Smith; that Clark used to work at May and Roberta's, and they both lodged at <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> Smith's, and that his first transaction with dark was 10 bottles of quicksilver, for which he got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they were worth 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I formerly worked at a druggist's in Alderagate Street, when Mott was in their employ, and in March, 1879, I met him in a coffee-house in Newington Butts—he was then working at Morson's, in Southampton Row—I told him that Henry Harbord and I were getting calomel and selling it—he said, "What is the use of that?"—I said, "We are selling it on the <hi rend="italic">cross.</hi>—he said, "I should like to make some money myself"—I asked him to bring Henry Harbord, and meet him up Holborn next day outside the music hall—I did so, and we went into the Ship public-house—Henry Harbord and Mott had a little talk, and an agree<lb/>ment was made how he was to bring things out from Morson and Sons, and a great quantity of things were brought from there every week which Henry Harbord sold to a man named Freeman—the money was evenly divided between me and Mott and Harbord—Bennett worked in the same firm, Mott introduced me to him—he brought hampers of chemicals out of Morson's in July, which he delivered to me, and they were sent to my house by parcels delivery; one parcel contained 321bs of tartaric acid, and another 301bs of bromide of potassium—and another contained some brown liquid—that was in September, it was addressed to me and sold to a man in Finsbury Park Road—the profits were shared equally between me Bennett, Mott, and Harbord; the highest profit we made was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one day—I discussed with Harbord what they were paying us, it was some-where about one fourth and somewhere one third of the value—I used to meet Friar at Holborn with Mott; he was called Little Harry—he said to</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of May and Baker, manufacturing chemists, of Gorden Terrace, Battersea—we have been so 25 years—we have large premises—this (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi> is a plan of them (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—there is a lamp at the corner of the premises, and a person coming from the outside could see whether it was alight or not—it is usually lighted. The prisoner King has been our night watchman since 1876, at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.a week—Henry Harbord was in our service up to September, 1876—we had every confidence in King; he had access to all parts of the premises which were not locked at night—he had access to the red and white precipitate and to the lamps—they are kept in boxes and in pans—I saw Stevens in prison—you go up six steps as you enter the office, and there are three doors and then another flight of steps, and that gets you into another part of the premises where the lamps are kept—there are some iron doors as you turn to the right, one door sliding horizontally and the other lifting up—that is where the precipitate is dried and kept—there is a shed in this corner on the left leading down to the river—King's hours were from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 a.m.—he used to come on duty on Saturday at midday—on 5th or 6th December Inspector Phillips showed me two baskets containing about 281bs. of white powder, which was produced here in January. I examined it carefully; it was white calomel—we sell it wholesale; it was not completely manufactured; it was such as we were manufacturing in November and the beginning of December—it is our property—there are peculiarities in each person's manufacture—I immediately spoke to King who said that he had not seen Henry Harbord since he left the service, I think, but I am not quite sure; I know it was a remote time—I recollect</p>

               <p>King having a bad leg in May, 1879—I know the date because I wrote an order in the order-book for some sarsaparilla—we had a man named <hi rend="italic">Old I ke</hi>; and James Smith was in our service—white calomel was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per lb. then, bismuth from 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb., of which there were on the premises some cwts.; and red precipitate, of the value of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb. at that time, but it has been as high as 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if a person could sell it it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I should consider it very cheap—we missed calomel, bismuth, and red precipitate during 1876—the lumps could be rolled and sifted, and then it would be saleable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. H. AVORY</hi>. Thomas and James Smith were in my service at the time Henry Harbord was there—King worked there a year and a half before we made him watchman; everybody knew that—men worked at night on an average three or four nights a Week—King's duty was to look over the premises generally, he had access everywhere—the entire property covers 2$ or 3 acres—King's duties would be all over the works—the premises open to the river on one side, but a wall 13 feet 6 inches high has existed for 12 or 15 months, and before that there was I fall cutting off the old shed—there perhaps would only be 2 feet 6 inches of wall in a very high tide—the gate at the chief entrance is 11 feet high, it has been altered more than 12 months—King had not charge of the keys of locked-up places—he also had the special duty, shared in by the other hands, of making mercury corks—I have known that to take eight hours, but the duty is not continuous—the fires have to be looked after constantly—we had the most implicit confidence in King, or we should not have left him there—before Stevens was tried in January, I mentioned to King a report I had heard about somebody being at the premises the night before; he said that somebody had been down inquiring for me—I heard nothing more about it—I have visited the plice at night over and over again, but I never found the gate open, a suffcient time always elapsed after I rang the bell for anybody to come; I heard his steps and he came from the right quarter as a rule—I always found King at his post—he had no intimation when I or my partner were coming—King was called as a witness for the proseoution on the former charge, and I heard him say on his oath that he knew nothing of the property being carried away, and never gave any away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Henry Harbord.</hi> I took stock myself in January with regard to the mercurials—I did not swear at Southwark that I took stock on 10th December, and missed 100 lbs. of calomel, nor did my partner—I took stock in January, 1880, and the profits were considerably short—I lost a great deal more than 3 lbs., or 8 cwt.—probably none of us were the better for the making of antimony, and I suffered with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After the police took possession I examined the stock, and missed about 103 lbs. of calomel, value 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that has been going on ever since November—you can get from our place by rail to Waterloo station—I did not go round the works before post time, but I have been at 10, 11, and 12 o'clock, and again at 2 or 3 a.m.—the men came on for night duty at 6.80, and came back from supper about 10 o'clock.</p>

If I was robbing May and Baker should I take samples of their traveller and know tell the article can no more be sworn to than a miller could swear to a handful of flour. I am a worker of chemicals. Every particle of what Stevens has stated is wrong; I said I would not have anything to do with anything that was <hi rend="italic">on the cross.</hi> Baker said "I mean to get up something for somebody," and when I saw the rules in the cell at Pentonville I thought he meant to write to the Home Secretary; I did not think he meant to bring innocent men into it If I had anything to reveal against his character I would do it, but I won't convict an innocent man. Mott was a bosom friend of Stevens, and the other man I have never seen in my life They swear to a bottle without a string or paper upon it They found chemical apparatus at my place; I can cheat the public and the revenue, but where I make 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., May and Baker make 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

He said 'Your people keep opium?' I said 'They keep a small quantity.' He said 'Can you get me some?' I said 'Certainly not.' Previous to that such a thought never crossed my mind, but he talked me over, and I yielded to the temptation to bring him one or two pounds of opium. He gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 1 1/2 I got him several other little things, and got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him. I admit I did wrong; I did rob my master to that extent, but am innocent of any conspiracy. Stevens admitted that I did not send parcels to his house, and if it had not been for him such a thought would never have entered into my mind. I was brought up respectably. I yielded to the temptation only considering it a petty theft; there was no conspiracy whatever. Stevens is a very bad man, and would lead anybody to do wrong."</p>
