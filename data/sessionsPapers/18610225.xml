                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at 32, Tufton-street, West<lb/>minster. On Sunday evening, 21st January, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house—I had not known him before—he said, "I have a gold watch for sale;" and he pressed me very much to buy it—I had not stated to any one, except my brother, that I wished to buy a watch—after a great deal of per<lb/>suasion I asked the prisoner into the parlour with another man who is not in custody—they produced a watch to me, and asked me twenty guineas for it—I did not like the appearance of it, and said it was rather too much—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the watch—I said I would rather not have anything to do with it, I would rather go to a respectable place and purchase one—he said, "I will take 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "No; I will not have it at all"—then he said 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and after a great deal of per<lb/>suasion, I said, "I will give you 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I do not care whether I have it or not"—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, and gave an I.O.U. for another pound, to be paid in a month from that date—next day I tried the watch, and found it to be quite a spurious article—it is not gold.</p>

               <p>his boots, and he did not go out any more—I stopped upstairs ten minutes and then came down again when I had put the little ones to bed—the boy was then down with his father—I was down nearly the whole evening after that, and he did not go out whilst I was there—I stopped there all the evening; he did not go out at all—I am quite sure he did not go—I could go from where I live to Moor-lane in five minutes, or less than that—I never left the room my son was in, except when I put the children to bed; that was soon after 7, and I was down before half-past 7, and between that time and the time he went to bed, he did not go out—I cannot tell exactly the time he went to bed, but it was before 9; the detective came after him and found him in bed—I think it was between 9 and 10 that the detective came—I could not say for certain—my son had been in bed a good while before the detective came; I could not say exactly how long, but I know he was in bed before 9—I cannot say what time it was when the detective came, but I think it was nearly 10—I think he had been in bed about half an hour when the detective came; I cannot say exactly to the time, for I did not look at the clock—I know he was in bed just before 9—I went to bed after they had taken him away.</p>

I am a furniture dealer of 78, Long-alley, Worship-street—on 28th January the prisoners came, and Perry asked me if I bought old furniture, as his mother had some old chairs in a cellar which she did not want—I asked him what he wanted for them—he said, "Four shillings"—the back was off one of the chairs, but he said that he could bring it to me if I bought them—he asked Murray if he should take 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Murray then asked me if I would give 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6d—I said, "No," and they went away a little way and came back—Perry then said to Murray, "Shall we take 4s?" Murray said, "Yes, we may as well take four," and I bought them—next day Perry came alone, and on the day after that, January 30th, they both came, and Murray said, "What did you give him for those three chairs last night?" alluding to three which Perry had brought the day before, and which I had let him have 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on, and was to let him have more if it turned out that his mother had really sent him—I said, "I gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but what made you run away, Perry, when you got the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., because you were to show</p>

I do not think I ought to be blamed for all; if you do not know where he is, I will show you"—he then went with me to Mr. Keaney's house, 7, Half-moon-alley, and said, "If you go up-stairs to the top you will find Perry there"—I went up, but Perry was not there—I told Murray so—(I had left him in charge of another constable at the door)—when we got to the station he said, "Well, I will tell you as far as I know; I went with Perry to sell some chairs in Long-alley, and we took them from Mrs. King's; I had nothing to do with stealing them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Chantry, of 2, Spring-villas, Ealing—on Monday evening last, 18th February, I was in Regent-street between seven and eight o'clock—I went from there to the Circus, and across from the Circus down Oxford-street, down Vere-street, across Wimpole-street, exactly opposite Vere-street chapel—just at the corner of Wimpole-street I was attacked by three boys—one of them, I can scarcely tell which, I was so frightened at the time, gave a pull at my umbrella—I held it very tight, and the next moment it was snatched out of my hand, and the boys ran away—I turned round and saw the three boys—the handle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was left in my hand—the three boys were running very fast when I turned round—in half a minute afterwards a witness brought one of the boys, asking me if I had lost anything—and I showed him my handle, and said I had lost my umbrella—Frederick Salter was the one he brought to me—the prisoners are like the boys that I saw—I cannot swear to them—they are about the size and general look—I should say they are the boys—they are like them exactly, but I did not see their faces—the value of the umbrella is about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

Nicoll and Co. of Regent-street—last Monday night, the 18th, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in Regent-street, near the corner of Argyll-street—I observed the three prisoners following a lady—I fancied they were up to no good—my attention was drawn to them—I followed them to the Circus—she crossed the Circus at Oxford-street, and went along Oxford-street to Vere-street, the boys still followed—I followed them closely, two or three times looking at their features, so that I should know them if they were <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to anything—I was as close to them as I am to this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">the foreman</hi>)—then they walked on to Vere-street—the lady turned up Vere-street—I crossed on the opposite side—she turned to the right to go into Wimpole-street—I crossed the road immediately, and at the corner of Wimpole-street and Henrietta-street the three lads made the attack upon her—they rushed towards her—I could not tell what they took</p>

               <p>from her until I took one of them to her—the three ran away—I captured the little one, and took him to the lady to know what had been stolen from her, and then I gave him into the custody of the police-constable—I saw the other lads next morning, as near half-past ten o'clock as possible, at the police-court—I identified them there—I gave them into the custody of the constable—they were at the corner of Weymouth-street and High-street, game standing at the corner of a public-house, about fifty, sixty, or a hundred yards from the police-court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

About 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 6th I took Elgee into custody, in consequence of what the prosecutrix told me—I received the chain from the prosecutrix—I took Elgee to the station and detained him—I then went to where the robbery was alleged to have been committed, and the locket was handed to me by a woman—it was picked up by a little child between where the chain was picked up and where the robbery was committed—it was not picked up while I was there.</p>

I asked him what was the matter; he told me I was concerned with another man that stole a watch-chain. I said I did not, neither was I the person that was with the person who stole the watch chain. He took me to Arbour-square station. I went with him. When I got there I was inspected by the policemen, and they said, "No, he don't look like him," that is what the youths stated when I got there. I did not have any hand in the robbery at all.</p>

I was formely inspector of the Metropolitan Police—on the morning of 18th February, about 5 o'clock, I went with other officers to 31, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel—I opened the door by means of a latch and proceeded up stairs to the first-floor back room—the door was securely fastened—I forced it open and went into the room—I there found the prisoner sitting on the side of the bed, and the female prisoner (<hi rend="italic">See next case</hi>) in bed—I told him I had received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after him, he was suspected of coining—I said, "We come here to search for counterfeit coin and coining instruments"—he said, "Oh, God blew you, Sir, you will find nothing of the kind here, you may search"—at that time I saw him stooping, removing a piece of cloth, which was a substitute for a hearth-rug, by the side of the bed—(he was undressed)—I said, "What are you doing there, man?"—he replied, "Looking for ray stockings"—I went to that part, and underneath the rug which he removed, I found a piece of loose board about ten inches long and six inches wide, underneath which I found a tin box, containing five half-crowns, finished, separately wrapped in paper, eleven shillings, finished, also separately wrapped in paper, two shillings, un<lb/>finished, and two sixpences, all of which I believe to be counterfeit—I placed them on the table and said, "I think that this is proof positive that my in<lb/>formation is correct"—he said, "I am guilty, I am the only guilty one, spare my wife, she knows nothing at all about it, we made them after she went to chapel last night: I had a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> from the chapel," meaning Whitechapel, "come to assist me to turn out a few things on a Sunday night, my wife knows nothing about it, I am the guilty party"—he was then in the act of putting on his waistcoat, and I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Nothing, Mr. Brannan"—I searched him, and in the pocket I found this woollen bag or purse containing a franc, a good shilling, and fourpence farthing in copper—I believe the shilling has been in plaster, and that from it one of the moulds was taken—I made a further search, and under the fire<lb/>place there was some broken plaster which had apparently been used for moulds, some sand in a basin, a spoon, which has been produced, and all the necessary implements for making, colouring, and coating counterfeit coin.</p>

On 10th February I lived at 10, Holborn-buildings—I now live at 10, Bishop's-head-court—I am the wife of Michael Connor—I had a child named Catherine—on 10th February the prisoner visited my room, my husband was at home as well as myself and four children—the child Catherine was there among the others—she was ten months old the night she died—the prisoner was sitting by the fire—there was a piece of iron used as a poker, with which we stirred the fire, standing by the fire<lb/>side—the prisoner took it and began to poke out the fire with it, and began fiddling with the fire, with the iron rod—I <hi rend="italic">reprimanded</hi> her two or three times to put it down—she was poking the fire out one way and the other—I was suckling my child, and when I was in the act of holding it out, she thrust the poker quite straight at the child, right in the groin—I said to the prisoner, "You have burned my child"—she said, "No," turning the poker round and bringing me the other end—I said, "Don't you do like that,—I put my hand against it and it was quite hot—I was suckling the child at the time she did it, and holding it out—the child's clothes were up, and the prisoner thrust the poker up towards it—it came right on the privates and thigh—the child did not cry much at the time—I got some sweet-oil and used it—it got very low—the prisoner had used the poker towards the other children in the morning part, and she said to my husband she should like to put the poker so and so, and mike so and so of him; it is not fit to be ex<lb/>plained—this was between 6 and 7 o'clock on the Sunday night—I went to a surgeon in Leather-lane on Wednesday—he examined the child and gave toe some elder-ointment for it—I can't tell the name of the doctor—on the Friday I took it to Bartholomew's Hospital and the doctor dressed it, and</p>

I am a labourer, and live at Bishop's-head-court, Holborn—I work for Mr. Sanders, in Castle-street—the deceased child, Catherine Connor, was supposed to be my child—she was ten months old when she died—I was present on Sunday evening, 17th February, when she died—on the Sunday evening before that, at the time the accident occurred, I was in my own room, in Holborn-buildings—the prisoner was there—she had come in several times the day before—I saw her doing something with the poker—I do not know anything much about this occasion, and I am very sorry to know it now—she caught hold of this poker and was putting it in between the bars for some time, I can't tell you how long—she kept putting it in and out—my wife sat at one side of the stove and the prisoner sat at the other side—my wife was holding the deceased child out to make water—since this has happened I cannot recollect things as I ought—the prisoner took the poker out of the fire and put it right into the child and catched her in the privates and in the thigh—the poker was hot at the time—I do not know whether it was red hot—the child made but very little noise—my wife said to the prisoner, "You have burnt my child"—I can't recollect what she said to that—I don't recollect her saying anything about the state of the poker, whether it was hot or not—I had had something to drink at this time, but I have often had more—I was sober enough so far as not to do an injury to anybody else—I was sober enough to recollect what happened—what I do recollect I am telling you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live at 4, Gray's Inn-lane—on Saturday night, 16th February, about 11 o'clock, I was visited by Honora Connor, with a female child—I examined its private parts—it was suffering excruciating pain—it was bordering on a state of mortification—the extensive inflammation was seated on the right labia of the female organ of generation, and there were marks, corresponding to the instrument produced, of charred cuticle—the child was suffering from nervous excitement from pain—it was in a healthy condition generally, and well nourished—it was not in a low state—it was in a very excited state from great pain—such an inflammation as I saw would produce that excited state until the mortification made progress—having examined the marks I aw with the instrument, I have every reason to believe it was inflicted by that instrument, and by a burn—I have not the slightest doubt of that—I ordered a liniment, which my assistant made up—I was absent when called on the following day, and my assistant went and visited the child—that was on Sunday—I was summoned to go to the child—it died just as I arrived, about a quarter to 7 on Sunday evening, the 17th—I saw it dead at that time—it vas the same child—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body twenty-four hours after death—the general appearance of the body was good, very well developed, and particularly fine for its age—it was particularly clean—the under and upper parts of both thighs were highly inflamed, and bore marks of the instrument, marks of burning, charred cuticle, completely destroyed—there was a corresponding mark on the outer side of the left foot, as though the instrument had been applied to the genital organ, and then in the movement to avoid it. H had caught the foot—the mark was slight on the foot, it had merely destroyed the surface of the cuticle, but it bore evident marks of the instrument produced—there was very extensive inflammation of the right labia passing to the internal parts of generation, extending to the bladder, and producing extensive inflammation into the pelvic cavity—I was very careful in my examination, and was unable to find any<lb/>thing other than would have ensued from nervous excitement—the cause of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250030"/>
               <p>death was nervous prostration, induced by the injuries inflicted—it is my firm belief that the burn was the cause of death—I could not see anything else to account for it—mortification had taken place in the parts, conveying the effects to the nervous system, and ultimately killing the child—the mortification was in the substance of the labia and the lower part of the right thigh, which implicated all the vessels in the immediate part.</p>

I have been a good friend to her in every way; my husband was fifteen or sixteen weeks out of work; we were obliged to sell our home, and I went to her for shelter. I did not do it with any bad feeling, it was dirt and neglect, and the place being so narrow, and I poking the fire with the poker. I did not mean to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 10, Trump-street, Cheap<lb/>side—in June last, I was agent to Joseph Marshall and Co. of Leeds, cloth merchants, and went to the premises of Gandell and Co. in Greenwich-street, which is in a line with the water—it is the premises marked C on this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the under part, I believe, belongs to the copper company—I had never been there before—this gateway is the entrance to the premises—I think the entrance is in Greenwich-street, and not by a door in the gateway—the packing business was being carried on there—I did not see the prisoner on my first call, and I do not think I left any patterns—I called again, perhaps two or three days after, and saw the prisoner in his counting-house at the end of the warehouse—it looked out on the water—I took some patterns of blue cloth with me—I said that I had the pleasure of representing Joseph Marshall and Co., of Leeds, in the cloth trade, and showed him some patterns of blue cloth which I then had in my warehouse—I left them with him, and he asked me to come again in a day or two—I did not know his name at that time—I only knew him as Mr. Gandell—I had applied for Mr. Gandell, and I. was shown into the counting-house to him—that was the second time—the person I asked took me forward into the counting-house, and said, "There is Mr. Gandell"—I saw no other Mr. Gandell—the prisoner was the only party I saw at any time to have any conversation with—I called again in two or three days, and went into the counting-house—I never spoke to him in any place but the counting-house, and I do not think I ever went without asking for Mr. Gandell—he said on that occasion, "You can send in those pieces that you have"—I agreed to do so—I do not remember arranging at that time how they were to be paid for—when I sent them in he told roe he could buy a lot of goods for the market, such as black, and Oxford mixture, and brown. medley, and that he could do a large business for me—perhaps that was a day or two after I had agreed to send in the cloth—I told him the nature of the goods, and I think at that time he said he would buy the other goods of me if I could get up patterns of them—I got patterns up from Leeds, from Joseph Marshall and Co., and saw the prisoner about them in his counting-house—some of them were purchased, and he told me that he could buy a lot of goods for the China market, a class of goods we call Spanish stripes—I said that at present I had nothing in that way, except a small lot of eight and a quarter coloured cloths which I had, representing Thomas Conyers and Co., of Leeds, whose agent I was—I pulled the patterns out of my pocket, showed them to him, and I think I left him ten or twelve of them, and promised to call again—I saw him again a few days afterwards, and he said that he would take them—that was I should imagine, in the early part of June—I asked him for a reference, as I like to have a reference with any new customer—he gave me a reference to a house at Bradford, by word of mouth, and I think I wrote it in my</p>

               <p>pocket-book at the time; but will not swear to that—I then wrote to Marshall's, giving the reference—that was before I went about Conyers' goods—the reference the prisoner gave me when Coyners' goods were ordered, was at a house in Halifax—will you allow me to say that he may have written it on a small slip of paper, and given to me, but if so it was verbally as well—if it was given me merely by word of mouth, I should make a memorandum of it—whatever it was I communicated it to my principal—I said to the prisoner, when Conyers' goods were ordered, that my men were little men and preferred cash—he said that he could not pay cash, but he would accept a bill at four months from the date of the invoice—I agreed to that—we had agreed upon the price—I communicated the order to Conyers, and the goods were afterwards sent in direct from Leeds; not through me—it was after I got the reference and sent it into the country, that Marshall's goods were sent in; not many days after, but time enough to make inquiry—I recollect Mr. Conyers coming up to London—I do not think that was on 18th June, but it was on a Monday—the bill was drawn on the 18th—I went with him to the premises in Greenwich-street, and introduced him to the prisoner—I said, "Mr. Gandell, I have the pleasure of introducing Mr. Conyers, of Leeds, to you"—Mr. Conyers then said that he had brought up the bill for his acceptance, producing this bill—(an invoice had been sent in; that would go from Leeds, it was not produced at this interview)—the bill bore date 14th June, and was addressed "Messrs. Thomas Gandell and Co. 79, Thames-street, London"—the prisoner looked at it, and drew his pen through the word Thomas, saying, "We always accept as Gandell and Co.," but turning round to Mr. Conyers, he said, "It makes no difference, the firm is the same"—he made other alterations, but I only noticed his striking the pen through "Thomas"—the address is altered—he has introduced the words "Joiner's Hall-building, Upper Thames-street"—I know Mr. Conyers' writing—it is not his, and it is not mine—the prisoner then said he wished the bill re-drawn, and he would accept it—I did not notice whether anything was said about the date, but I see that the date is altered from the 14th to the 18th—Mr. Conyen then returned to ray warehouse, taking this with him.</p>

               <p>affair were Peeles of Bradford—I have known the firm of Gandell and Co. a long time, and I believed it to be the firm of Thomas Gandell and Co. when I first sent in the reference to Marshall's—I always knew the firm as Thomas Gandell and Co.—I never asked the prisoner what position he held in the firm—I had only known the firm as hot pressers and packers, never as merchants or consignees of goods—I had not known them to be carrying on the trade of exporters for more than three weeks or a month before I called on the prisoner—that was the first time in all these years that I heard that they were exporting goods—it did not strike me to ask the prisoner how long the firm had been engaged in exporting, or to ask whether it really was the firm of Thomas Gandell and Co. which was exporting—when I use the word "export," I mean selling as well as exporting—I have known other packers; there is Perrett and Watts—I never knew men engaged in the business of packing, ship goods on their own account, but perhaps, my Lord, you will allow me to make a remark; my first reason in calling on Gandell and Co. was that they had been concerned in packing goods to Hudson's Bay, and on that occasion they were trying to do a little business on the quiet—I should say it is not a common thing for packers to ship goods on their own account, but many people profess one trade and carry on another—whether light or wrong, I supposed that by carrying on the business of packers they were shipping on their own account, and that led me to apply to them—I think it was on the quiet something; out of their ordinary course of business—I should say Mr. Conyers came up to town a week or a fortnight after I had received the order for him—I cannot say exactly—the arrangement was that the bill was to be drawn from the date of the invoice—Mr. Conyers did not know the firm of Gandell and Co., my clients are not supposed to know all the firms I call on—I did not tell Conyers that they were doing a little shipping on the quiet—I do not know that I told him they were packers—I did not tell him that they were shippers—I gave him the reference—when he came to town I told him something, and took him to Thomas Gandell and Co. of Thames-street—I did not tell him who they were, I took him to see for himself, and I think he saw that they were packers—he must have known the nature of the order at that time, because he executed it—he was present at the presentation of the bill—there was only one conversation in reference to the bill—there is no drawer's name on this bill, but it is not a bill, it is a stamped piece of paper—I do not know that Thomas Gandell and Co. banked at the Bank of England—I saw a piece of paper on the prisoner's desk, with "Messrs. Price" on it, and I imagined that Messrs. Gandell banked at Sir Charles Price's, and I do not know whether he did not give me that reference—my impression is that he did bank at Price's—I cannot say that he gave a reference to Sir Charles Price—I never went to Sir Charles Price—I cannot say whether Mr. Conyers or myself presented this piece of paper, we were both together—we were both in the room when he scratched out the "Thomas"—I made no observation to the prisoner then—it was a momentary transaction—I will swear that the form of expression was," We do not accept as Thomas Gandell and Co."—I did not notice that he laid any emphasis on the word "we"—I did not hear at the time how long the firm had been shipping goods—I do not know since, that bills to the extent of about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. have been met at Sir Charles Price's, certainly not; how am I to know t—I could not go into his private business—it is not likely that I could go to a person and find out what bills had been met—I know nothing of Thomas Gandell and Co.'s bankers—the prisoner on one occasion spoke to me about black cloth mixture, which, I understood</p>

               <p>him, was for the India market—I do not know that those goods are suitable for the India market, but shippers send out strange things sometimes—I believe that stripes are especially suited for the China market—it is a very light fabric of cloth—at the time when the "Thomas" was erased, the prisoner did not say that he had no authority to accept as Thomas Gandell, certainly not; you may take that down.</p>

I never saw that paper in London, till a fortnight or three weeks ago—I came to London on 18th June, and went with Mr. Barelli to the premises in Greenwich-street—he introduced me to the prisoner as Mr. Conyers, a manufacturers of Leeds—we commenced a conversation about Spanish stripes and cloths—I pre<lb/>sented the bill, and Mr. Gandell struck out the name of Thomas, and altered the date from the 14th to the 18th, and wrote "Joiner's Hall-building". Upper Thames-street"—he requested me to draw another bill in the name of Gandell and Co.—he said, "We accept Gandell and Co. but the firm is the same"—I was desired to draw a fresh bill and send it down—I agreed to do so—I afterwards drew this other bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and it was afterwards brought to me, accepted as it now is—I negociated it, and it was returned about 24th October.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and was residing at 9, Arlington-street, Islington, on 6th February—on that afternoon, about half-past 4 o'clock, I entered an omnibus at Camberwell-gate to go to the Monument—I went to the very top of the omnibus, near the driver—there was nobody in the omnibus when I entered it—some lady entered and sat at the bottom, next the door—I cannot tell who came in next—after a while the two prisoners came in—one sat opposite me, and the other on the same side as myself, next but one to my left hand—I was sitting on the right hand side seat, as you enter—a lady was between me and Smith—when close to the Monument the omnibus stopped for me to get out—I was getting out, but had some difficulty in passing the prisoners; one of them put an umbrella across the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and that detained me some few minutes—the conductor said, "You will keep me here all night"—before I got out I saw a notice <hi rend="italic">atop</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, "Beware of pick-pockets, both male and female"—I got out, and, as I went to feel in my pocket, I found my purse was gone—seeing the bill induced me to feel in my pocket—I hailed the conductor to stop, which he did, and he put me into the omnibus—when I first got in my purse was safe—I did not take it out when I got in—it was in my pocket—I did not require it then—I felt for it to see that it was there—it contained 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some silver—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the purse—I did not see it when it was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Woodland-terrace, Trafalgar-road, Green<lb/>wich, and am a city-missionary—I was in the omnibus on 6th February—I got in a little this side of King-street, Walworth—I rode from there to the Monument, where the prosecutrix got out—the prisoners got in after me—they came in together—Burton sat on my right hand—my wife sat next to the prosecutrix, and Smith sat next to my wife—I was not on the same side as the prosecutrix—I sat at the top of the omnibus opposite the prosecutrix—upon the prosecutrix leaving the omnibus she was very much obstructed; she could not get past the prisoners; they sat nearly opposite each other—she was detained some little time—I lifted up her shawl with my left hand and saw Burton’s hand very near Miss Mullett's pocket, at least near her right side, where I supposed her pocket was—she got out, and in a few moments, before the omnibus had scarcely gone on a yard or two, she came back and was introduced into the omnibus again—as soon as she got in, she looked very confused, and said, "Oh, my purse, I have lost my purse"—I said, "All right, Ma'am, your purse is safe; your purse is in the omnibus"—I then laid my hand on Burton's shoulder and said, "This is the woman who has your puree"—I then said, "I insist now upon this woman being searched, and not only her, but the woman sitting opposite"—that was Smith—Burton, in reply to what I said, began to abuse me and to represent herself as a respectable person, and that I must take care or I should be likely to be punished—I do not recollect that the other woman said any<lb/>thing—a moment or two afterwards, Burton said, "You can search me," and began to rise from her seat—they were removed from the omnibus, and we then began to look about for the purse, and it was on the floor a little to the left of where Burton had been sitting—I believe both the women volunteered to come out and be searched at once—there was a policeman at once.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>before she came back to me in an excited state—she pulled my coat, and said, "Conductor, I have lost my purse"—I said, "That accounts for the obstruct<lb/>tion I saw take place in the omnibus"—I should think that all in the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> could hear me say that, but there was great confusion at the time—I spoke it loud enough—I opened the door of the omnibus, and insisted upon the lady getting in again—she, at the time, was in a fainting state, and could scarcely get in—I assisted her in, and after that Burton volunteered to be searched—in the mean time I saw her in a rising position from the seat, and saw her hand, and something, which was no other than this purse, slide from her hand to the omnibus—at first I thought it went on the seat—I would not allow any one to leave the omnibus—an officer arrived, and I gave the two prisoners into his custody—I afterwards saw this purse found somewhere in the omnibus; I think, on the floor—I thought at first it was on the seat, but in the great confusion I will not exactly swear as to where it was—it was placed in my hands by one of the passengers—the money was in it—fourteen sovereigns—I gave it to the officer.</p>

I do not think the notion of it being hit duty to return the warrants would make him a bailee.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON CHANNELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">on the point</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">My brother Channell agrees with me most distinctly upon this point, that the vendor had a right to insist upon cash, he was not bound to take cash, but taking a crossed cheque it was entirely his own fault that time was given to the prisoner to enable him to do what he has done, and I think it would have been the same thing supposing instead of giving a crossed cheque he had given a bill payable two days after-wards; in reality a crossed cheque is a cheque payable the next day, the taking of that crossed cheque was the vendors' own faulty and I think he cannot turn it into a stealing; he has taken that which he was not bound to take, he hat voluntarily altered the contract and given a credit to the prisoner which he was not bound to give. I don't think I can consider that a felony or leave a case of that sort to the Jury. I want as distinctly as I can to let this be understood, that if a person who is entitled to cash, instead of that takes an instrument which necessarily postpones the payment, he by his own act gives the party a control over the property which he would not have had if he had held to the bargain as he had a right to do; he in fact by so doing gives up both property and possession. My brother Channell very much agrees with me in the doctrine that you ought as little as possible to introduce indictments for felony or foist pretences into what are really and truly matters of sale and purchase. If this man was in the habit of buying and selling and trading in this way, as hat been opened, although he may become a fraudulent trader, you cannot suddenly make him a felon; for instance, if a man is dealing in plated articles, and he represents an article to be of one quality and it turns out to be of another, it would be monstrous to say that that man is to be indicted for obtaining either money or goods under false pretences—where a shop is actually opened for the express purpose of carrying on matters of that sort or where a man goes on Change for the first time expressly to do some act of that kind, then I think a different consideration might obtain, although it would not then of necessity be 6 felony. It seems to me that the answer to this charge of stealing is this, that it is all your own fault; you (the prosecutors) take an instrument which gives to the prisoner a credit which you were not bound to give, and giving him that credit he had lawfully during that time the possession and the right of property on account of the sale. I think the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a carman residing at 24, Milton-street—the stables of my mistress, Mrs. Bingham, are immediately by Mr. Hale's house—on Saturday night last, about 7 o'clock, I was coming from my stable, as I had done my horse up for the night—I heard a noise, and on looking to the tiles I saw the man jump from the tiles into the yard and run towards the gates—I ran after him, and secured him till the policeman came—I heard last witness call "Police"—I did not see anybody else at that time, but I heard some one.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 175).' On Saturday night last, I took the prisoner in custody from the last witness, and took him to the station—I told him he was charged with being there for some unlawful purpose—I did not know the charge at the time—he said he had only just come in the yard—I searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I went into the yard to get a drink of water, and I no sooner went in, than a man caught bold of me and said, "There is a woman calling out 'Police!' I shall hold you till she comes;" and he held me the policeman came, and gave me in charge: he did not see me on the tiles, I was not on the tiles.</p>

I am the wife of James Withers, a baker, of 86, Blackman-street, Borough—Mr. Walmsley has been a customer of Our's some years—on 9th of October, Myers came and asked me if I could oblige Mr. Walmsley with cash or change of a 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—he did not offer to buy anything—I looked at it, found It was not endorsed, and told him to take it back and get Mr. Walmsley to put his name on it—he said, 'Oh, you want Mr. Walmsley's name on it,' took it, and left the shop—Mr. Walmsley's place of business is not 150 yards from our house—Myers re-turned in five or seven minutes, said nothing, but presented me with the cheque—I looked at it, found it endorsed, and gave him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. part in gold, part in silver: there were some fourpenny pieces—there were no notes—a boy named Oviat was in the shop—I said something which caused him to go out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Union Bank of London—the prisoner was a clerk there for some time—I have frequently seen him write—I believe this signature "Frederick Jones" to be the prisoner's writing, and the body of it appears to bear a similarity—I think that is his also—I mean the amount; the word "order" I cannot say anything about, but I swear, to the best of my belief, to the signature—there appears to be a similarity about the figures, with what I have been accustomed to see in his figures—I cannot speak as to the figures in the margin or to the word "order," but the other part of it I believe to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

Jones," and I have seen him sign his name when we were on the walk together—to the best of my belief, the "Frederick Jones" in this cheque and the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. written in letters are his writing—I cannot speak to the 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in figures—the word February I should also say is his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the detective police—I have been engaged in inquiring into the robbery at the London Docks—on 12th January, I went to the Eastern Shades beer-shop, No. 1, Upper North-street, Bethnal-green—I there saw a person named Solomons, and had some conversation with him—he gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took Solomons to the police-station, where he gave me a key—in consequence of what he said to me, 1 took that key to No. 6, Devonshire-street, Mile-end—I was accompanied by Sergeant Robinson—I went upstairs, and saw a Mrs. Hardiman, who is here—in consequence of what Solomons had told me, I went to a cupboard in the first-floor frout room of that house; at least, there is only one room up stairs, and one down stairs—the cupboard door was open—the key that he gave me was the key of the door of the house—I had not occasion to use it—the door was opened by Mrs. Hardiman—Sergeant Robinson went to the cupboard in my presence, and I saw him take out of it this opium (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it weighs 261bs.—Robinson took possession of it—after that, we returned 10 the Leman-street police-station, Whitechapel, where we had left Solomons—I then went with Sergeant Robinson to 63, J idling-street, Dockhead—the address on the card, is "Christopher Summers, 63, J idling-street, Dockhead"—I think it was about 9 o'clock in the evening when I went there—I did not find Summers—I waited till 1 o'clock, but he did not come home—I then returned to the station—not being able to find the prisoner, I charged Solomons on</p>

               <p>suspicion of having stolen the opium; of having it in his possession, and he was detained there in custody—I went to 63, Jidling-street again, about 11 o'clock the following morning, Sunday, and saw the prisoner there—I said, "l am a police-officer; do you know a person of the name of Solomons, residing at 6, Devonshire-street, Mile-end?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have him in custody charged with having stolen property in his possession, and he has made a statement, implicating you in the matter"—Summers said, "What does he say then?"—I said, "I will not repeat what he says, you had better hear what he says in your presence at the station-house"—we then walked on to the station, and going along, the prisoner said, "I can't think what he wants to see me for, I never sold him anything except a sewing machine"—on arriving at the station, Solomons was brought into the prisoners presence—I said, "Is this the man that you state that you had the opium from?"—Solomons said, "Yes, that is the man"—Summers immediately said, "I never sold you any opium"—Solomons said, "Why, yes, you did"—the prisoner said, "When?"—Solomons said, "Why, many times"—Summers said, "I never sold you any opium"—Solomons said, "Why, yes you did, you know I paid you a sovereign last Friday night at the beer-shop"—Summers said, "Yes, but that was for the sewing-machine"—Solomons said, "No, it was not; you know the sewing machine was paid for long ago"—Solomons repeatedly asserted that he did any it, and the prisoner repeatedly assertedthat he did not sell it to him—he was then charged with Solomons—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of opium that I got from Mr. Phillips', a chemist's shop in Tottenham-court-road.</p>

               <p>I think, "About 20 lbs."—I then got the key from him—that is not all the conversation I had about Summers—I think it is nearly all affecting Solo<lb/>mons—I have heard that Summers is still in the service of Mr. Kearas since be has been on bail—Mr. Kearns was examined before the Magistrate, and bound over to be here, and he was here on Monday—he was not taken before the Grand Jury—his name is not on the back of the bill—Solomons gave me the list of several places where he had sold the opium—none of those people are here—Mr. Phillips is not here—the assistant from Mr. Phillips has been here each day—I do not know whether he is here now.</p>

I live at 6, Devonshire-street, Mile End, and have from time to time dealt in sponges—I have known the prisoner four or five months, I do not know exactly—I first bought opium from him somewhere about four or five months back—he came to me at the Britannia beer-shop, where I was—the landlord called me out and said I was wanted—I went out and saw a man standing at the bar, I passed him and went into the street, thinking it was my wife who had called for me, which she had occasionally done—when I found she was not there, I went in again and saw the prisoner standing at the bar—he said, "Is your name Solomons?"—I said, "Yes; what do you want?"—he said, "Do you deal in Turkey sponges?"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "Would you buy some Turkey opium?"—I asked him what Turkey opium was, for I did not know—he said, "Well, I dare say you know—I said, "Indeed I do not, for I never saw any in my life; but what might be the value of it, what do you want for it?"—he asked me a price, and I told him that if he would bring me a sample I would inquire the value of it and let him know—he asked me 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound for it—on the next night, or a night or two after, he brought me some, a piece or two, and I took it to a druggist and inquired the value and the quality—the druggist told me it was very good quality indeed, very superior, and the market price of it was somewhere about 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—I then agreed to purchase of the prisoner at half-a-guinea per pound—I asked him how he came by it, and he said that one, two, or three ships came into the docks every week, and he could smuggle such a thing as ten, twelve or fourteen pounds per week from those ships, or if he could not smuggle it that it could be smuggled from those ships, and from that time he continually brought me some, two or three times per week—sometimes it was two pounds, sometimes three pounds, and sometimes four pounds—it was never one particular quantity, but varying from a pound and a half—not having kept an account of it, 1 judged when I was first asked that I had had about 140 pounds of it, but on reference to my recollection, having a little more time since, I do not think there was so much as that—I cannot say how much short of that it was—I do not think the time would have allowed for so much as 140 pounds, in the quantities he brought at a time—I dealt with him generally at a public-house called the Duke of Gloucester, in Seabright-street, Bethnal-green, and sometimes he brought it to my house—no person ever saw me deal with him, because it was done secretly—Mrs. Hardiman, the woman who lives with me as my wife, was at home several times when he came—I</p>

               <p>remember weighing some opium at a chandler's shop, in Three Colt-lane—the name was Stichbury—the reason of my weighing it there was that he charged me for half an ounce weighed in the paper, and when I weighed it out of the paper I found I had not the weight—he was in the shop with me when I weighed it—I remember buying a sewing machine from him—that would have been a month or a little longer, before Christmas—I never kept any dates—it was paid within one week of the purchase—there were two separate payments—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the first payment,' and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the second, according to whether the first was 30<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was paid within ten days—I do not recollect the date, but the last payment I made him was a sovereign—that was likewise about a short time before Christmas—I do not know whether it was more than a night before I was taken in custody; I think it was one night only—I think it was on the Friday—I was taken into custody on the Saturday—I had borrowed a sovereign of the landlord of the house, to pay my fare to go into the country with, and I came home—I was not fortunate in selling my goods, and I only brought home 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me—I paid the landlord a sovereign, the prisoner came in just at the moment, and I said, "Here is a sovereign for you, and I have one sovereign left, which I want for my household expenses"—when we went outside the door he said if I could only pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be a sufficiency for the present, for that there were other persons connected with him in it to whom he had got to give the money—I remember giving a card to Which her the ins<lb/>pector, who took me in custody—Summers gave that card to me—he wrote it.</p>

Q.</hi> You have not given us the names of the persons who kept the public-houses where you bought the opium; did Mr. Morris keep one, the Eastern Shades? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is where I paid the sovereign—the "Duke of Gloucester is kept by William Johnson, that is where 1 generally dealt—the place where I first saw the prisoner is the Britannia—I only saw him there once—the landlord's name is White—I did not understand the opium to be stolen—I understood it was smuggled—he told me that ships came into the docks two or three per week, up to January, and that there could be ten or twelve pounds smuggled—I only know that he told me it was smuggled from the ships in the docks—I had no occasion to make any further inquiry at all, except as to the value and quality of the articles I was going to purchase—I have dealt in sponges this forty yean, and inquiry has been made into my character by respectable gentlemen—my bills of parcels will prove all my dealings in sponges to be fair—I buy the sponges from different merchants; Mr. Cantor is one, and Mr. Fuminger another, and Mr. Lewis, the wholesale dealer in the article, and several more—I never got any smuggled sponges—I have dealt occasionally in other things; I have dealt in pictures, but sponges is the manner in which I get nay living—I Have dealt a little in jewellery at times, nothing else that I can think of—I carry a bag about when I travel—I do not hawk and go about from house to house—I go and serve shop-keepers only—I do not always get an article at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the market; I only sold it at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., A pound.</p>

I was in No. 6, Surbiton-street, between 12 and 1 o'clock on 1st February—the last witness and the prisoner were present—I had drank two glasses of port wine with the prisoner before I went home, no more—he was not drunk, but he had been drinking—I got into bed—I could not see what took place then because there were curtains all round—I heard Bridget Donovan crying, saying, "You have given me two black eyes"—I got out of bed—she said, "Are you afraid of a knife"—I said, "Yes"—he went and asked her for his money—she said she had not got it, and he asked me for histrousers—I gave them to him, and he took them in his hand, and his knife and sheath, and he went across and tried to stab her in the breast, and she turned round and caught it on her shoulder—the prisoner had given Bridget a shilling to get him some gin—I unlocked the door, went down stain and gave the alarm—the prisoner came down stairs after me and Bridget, he ran out at the front door with his trousers in one hand and his knife in the other—he had nothing on but his shirt—I went and gave the alarm, the policeman came, and I went out with him in search of the prisoner—I found the sheath down stairs.</p>

We then went to their home. Gentry induced me to stop there, which I did; we had some gin, whilst drinking I got my knife and cut up some tobacco, at the same time talking with Gentry who was in bed—after I had cut up my tobacco, I looked for my money, and money and purse were gone. I asked Donovan where it was; she said she knew nothing about it. I said I would search her; she resisted, and we got into a struggle, and in the struggle she came in contact with my knife, which was in my hand all the time; we were all drunk—she said 'You have cut me.' Gentry gave an alarm, and I ran out; I was frightened."</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. 1 am the assistant relieving-officer of the parish of Woolwich—in December some application was made by the prisoner's wile, I believe, after which I went to the prisoner's house—I saw the deceased—that was on Sunday, the 16th December—she appeared to be wrapped in a dirty rug, lying on a bed which was straw—I saw some portion of straw from the edges of the bed or mattress—the room was offensive—I did not say much to her—I saw that she appeared to be in an imbecile state and was dirty—her form in the bed was more like that of an animal, with her knees up, and so on—that decided me at once as to her state—I saw the prisoner with reference to the poor woman going into the workhouse—I told him that I had an order for her admission into the house, but that as I perceived from the appearance of the place and from a remark made, there were means to pay, I said to the prisoner, in consequence of his having previously stated to me that he was willing to pay a small sum, "You told me you would pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and your brother, you said, would pay something?"—he said, "Yes, I have no objection to pay 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and my brother will be down to-day "—I said, "You and your brother will come down and see me in the after-noon; I will give you an order for her removal into the union at once"—the order did not depend on their payment—I had an unconditional order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a part of the union used as a hospital, for the reception of persons who are unwell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a large infirmary and also a place for imbecile and deranged persons—we have every facility for applying water, cold and warm—the prisoner was in two rooms as far as I saw, part of a house, lodgings—there was nothing of the sort there.</p>

               <p>and, I think, a younger child—the sitting-room was rather larger than the bed-room—there was no sleeping accommodation in the sitting-room—it appeared to me that the family slept in the same room as the deceased—I understood that the two drummer-boys slept at the barracks—I never gave the order to the prisoner, I only told him I had obtained it and told him to come for it, as is usual, we don't carry them about with us—it was about five weeks afterwards that 1 heard of the death—I did not go to the house in the interval—I suggested to the prisoner that he should contribute some<lb/>thing; I did not suggest that his brother should also do so, that was his sug<lb/>gestion—nothing occurred which led me to imagine there was any ill-usage or unkind treatment towards the woman, had there been I should at once have seen to it and made the order imperative—I never heard a word of the kind.</p>

I am the wife of a pensioner at Woolwich—I lived in the room opposite the prisoner—I was living there when the deceased first came there—she was then very clean and tidy—sometimes she would go out of doors a little and walk about—within about four months of her death she looked very poorly, her head was bad and she seemed very ill—I have been into her room—I did not find her so comfortable as I think she Ought to have been—she was lying on the bed with a sort of mattress—there was straw coming out at the foot of the bed as if there was some put underneath—I did not speak to the prisoner about her—he was continually out during the day—he did not work at home, but at the tailor's shop at the barracks—lie went out about 7 in the morning, returned about 12 to dinner, then went out again and returned after 6 in the evening—I heard the deceased cry out for bread and butter and tea one night about four months before her death, and once when I heard her cry out I took her some from our table; it was about tea-time—the prisoner was not there at the time.</p>

I received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after you as dealing largely in counterfeit coin; there is pretty good symptoms of it here," pointing to the battery and counterfeit coin lying in all directions, and the implements on the table—(his name is Vowell)—he said, "I do not know what you mean; somebody must have put them here since I have been gone"—I said, "Oh! that is what you mean, is it, <hi rend="italic">Mr. Frenchy</hi>; what have you got about you?"—I put my hand to his waistcoat-pocket while Bryant held him, and in it I found seven good sixpences, loose, and ten bad sixpences in another pocket, wrapped separately in paper—I said, "Perhaps somebody put these in your pocket since you have been out"—he said, "Well, it is no use, Mr. Brannan, I will plead guilty to it ail, if you will spare my poor wife and child"—I said, "I can hold you out no pro<lb/>mises "—he said, "I only sell, I do not make"—I said, "This is pretty good proof," producing the moulds, the impressions on which were effaced—he said, "Well, it is no use, I will plead guilty to it all: when I came out of prison last time, I met a man who taught me; I am a brush-maker by trade; I am badly off for work"—I have known him since 1849, and believe the female prisoner is not his wife—she has lived with him perhaps a couple of years—I produce a large quantity of counterfeit coin—one packet contains five half-crowns, two finished, and two unfinished: ten florins, nine of which were counterfeit, and the other, I believe, to be the pattern piece, it was wrapped in the same paper with the bad ones—here are twenty-two counter<lb/>feit shillings, some finished, and some unfinished, and considerably above 100 sixpences—here are all the necessary implements for casting and clean<lb/>ing counterfeit coin.</p>

I am the wife of John Blott, a baker—we now live at No. 10, Mint-street—a short time ago we lived at No. 12, the same house in which the prisoner lived—we removed from there about two months before the death of the child—we had been living there about two months before the prisoner came home—the child was in the house at that time—the prisoner's husband was living there with her and three other children besides the deceased child, and older than her—she was about 14 months old at the time she died—they occupied a room at the top of the house, I occupied the room immediately under them—when the mother brought the child home the first week it cried very much, but I did not take any notice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250081"/>
               <p>of it till my attention was called to it by the neighbour next door, in consequence of that I listened to it and I heard the mother slap the child repeatedly, and scold it for being dirty—the child cried on and off very much the second week—I heard the slaps frequently, mostly every day—the child cried very much—on one occasion I heard it slapped three times in the day—after the mother had been at home a fortnight with it the child was one day crying very violently and I heard the mother slap it—Mrs. Freeman who lodged in the next room wished me to go in, and I did and said to the prisoner, "You will excuse me, Mrs. Connor, for coming in, but it very much upsets me hearing the baby cry so, and hearing you flog it"—the baby was then sitting in a corner of the room and the family were getting their dinner at the other side of the room, the prisoner, her husband, and the other children—I wished Mrs. Connor to let me take the child downstairs and let my little girl nurse it while they were getting their dinner—she took it away from me, sat it down in the corner again, and said she would not allow me to take it down, and I left the room—I did not say anything more—I heard it slapped after that—it went on for another fortnight) at times—I heard it slapped on Friday night and I knocked at their room door and asked what she was doing to the child—the man brought the child out and abused me very much indeed—I said I could not help it, I did not wish to interfere! but I could not bear to hear the baby cry so and hear it slapped—I thought it was because the mother was strange to it and it had not got used to them and I wished her to take it and comfort it—I told her on one occasion that I was afraid that being away had won away her affections from the baby, and in mercy to her I think that was the cause of it—she said it was no such thing, it had not won away heraffections; it was very dirty—they threatened to punish me for interfering, but she was in a passion at the time and I did not take much notice of it—I told her I did not wish to interfere; 1 had a great regard for her at one time and I undertook to do for her children while she was away from them, as I thought striving to do what she could for the benefit of her family—she had been put to it very much at home through her husband being out of employment—the husband was generally out when I heard the slapping—I heard it slapped on the Saturday afternoon, after I had interfered on the Friday—the father was out then—the mother flogged it as if she was in a great passion with it because it would not go to sleep—I was on the staircase at the time—I heard the prisoner say she would make it go to sleep—I did not go into the room then—I accused her once of stifling its cries, and she said she merely threw a shirt over it that she was making—it sounded very much to that effect, not as if it was severely stifled, but it did not cry so plainly—on the Friday night when the man abused me, the neighbour next door wished me to take a policeman in, and I said I would have them watched for I knew they were not kind to it—on the Saturday afternoon after the mother had flogged it, I said I would fetch a policeman if they continued to ill-treat the child—she said she was not afraid of a policeman; she had done nothing to her child no more than she had to the other children—she said if the policeman did come she would put him and me down stairs—I heard the child slapped next day, Sunday, but nothing more than I have heard a baby slapped by other mothers if they have been cross—I went in on the occa<lb/>sion and found the mother and father both there, she was holding the baby over a pail to have a motion—there had been a great many words on the Saturday, and I went in and said I had no ill feeling, only the baby made me very unhappy, I did not wish them to suppose for a moment that I wished to</p>

               <p>interfere—before I went in I was on the stair-case and I heard the father say, "Don't 1" when she was slapping it—the child was not crying when I went in—I asked them to let me have it a little while and the father said I should not—the mother said, "Yes, let her take it," and I took it, but he said I should not take it downstairs—I never saw the child put into water; I have heard it washed in water several times—I have heard it moaning very much, I thought it was from teething—I did not hear it slapped on those occasions—I heard her slap it very little after the Sunday—I do not think I have been in about the child above four times since the mother's return; I gave great offence by going in, and the mother was never friendly with me afterwards—I have given it something to eat—I went in on several occasions when she was gone out with the little boy to the hos<lb/>pital, for two or three hours together—it ate what I gave it—I never saw it fed.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you have never <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the child ill-treated in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard it—some of the slaps I heard were very violent, too violent for an infant—I thought they were slaps on the bare flesh—after the slaps the cries appeared to be stifled—I have not been constantly abusing them and calling them murderers—I did at the time the man came out and abused me—I did not one day, when I heard the child crying, go up to the door and call out, "You murderess, you will murder your child," nothing to that effect—I said to her on the Saturday after she had been beating it so severely, "You had better murder it, do not torture it"—that was the only time I said that to her—she told me that she treated the child as she did the other children—I never had any conversation with her afterwards—I lived in the house about eight months altogether—my sister-in-law, Mrs. Freeman, also lived in the house—the prisoner went as wet-nurse to Lady Frederick Fitzory—during that time she entrusted the baby to Mrs. Freeman—I did not hear any complaint that the child was not looking well while it was with Mrs. Freeman—it had a severe cold on one occasion—their room was a very small one—I heard that they had been in great destitution before she went to Lady Fitzroy's—she came back in September—in consequence of the child being ill, the prisoner took it away from Mrs. Freeman and lodged it at Notting-hill—I did not see it all the time it was—at Notting-hill—I heard it was getting on nicely there—there was a little contention between Mrs. Freeman and the father, he said she had not time to attend to the child sufficiently—after that I offered to take charge of the three children, not of the baby—I don't know that the prisoner said she would prefer having it at Notting-hill where it was improving—it looked a very nice baby; I nursed it the day it came home for nearly an hour—I never observed any peculiarity about the eyes—I have seen much finer children at the age, and many worse—I did not think it a very fat, fine child, but I thought it was through not having the milk from the mother—I never knew a fed child thrive so much as one fed from the breast—I left that house about a month after Michaelmas as near as I can judge—I have been away from the house three months now—I had seen nothing of the child, I think, for nine or ten weeks before its death—I did not know the prisoner took the child to Mr. Llewellyn—I knew it since—I was told, that she took it to Mr. Wood, a medical gentleman in the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>opposite, but I don't know their name—I was told afterwards that Mrs. Higginbottom had told Mrs. Connor that 1 had been to her—I don't recollect on one occasion after I had complained of Mrs. Connor having slapped the child in that way, her stripping it before me and Mrs. Freeman and showing the body to show whether there were any marks—she did not show it to me, and not to anybody in the house that I know of—I don't know that she did to Mrs. Freeman—I never heard that she did—she has threatened to go before a magistrate and have me punished for annoying and insulting her—I believe on two occasions she threatened to do so, the man and woman too—she never did go before a magistrate—I never heard that the man was not kind to the children—on one or two occasions he has told me that he would not put up with my constant interference and annoyance, that he and his wife were doing their duty by the child—the child cried very much indeed—I did not see her after she had been to Mr. Wood.</p>

               <p>seen it, but I have heard it slapped and beaten by the mother, when the father has been out, never when he was at home—I have heard the child cry very violently—I live in the kitchen and the prisoner lived at the top of the house, and I have heard the ships when I have been in the kitchen—I never saw anything about their food—I have said to Mrs. Connor, "What makes you beat the child?"—she said, "Because she won't be clean, she is a very unclean child"—I persuaded her not to beat it, because that would not break it of those habits—I have fed the child myself when Mrs. Freeman had it, not since, except about a fortnight and three days before it died—I took up a little piece of pudding for the children and I gave the baby a piece, and she ate it, and when she dropped a currant she picked it up and ate it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 71, Black man-street, Borough—I saw this child about three times before its death—it died on 30th January—I saw it first about four months and a fortnight before its death, shortly after its return to Notting-hill—I do not know exactly the time—it was in a very good state of health then—the prisoner brought it to me to examine to see whether there were any bruises on the child, for the nei<lb/>ghbours had complained that the child had been ill-treated—I examined the child but could find no external marks of violence whatever—I did not give it some powder for teething at that time, but a few weeks after she brought it again, said it was very fractious, she thought it was teething, and I gave it a little soothing medicine, and, to the best of my belief, I lanced its gums, was to remove any state of irritation—the child was then in a very good state of health to all appearance—I saw it again the day it died; it was then very much emaciated, quite a skeleton—I saw that the child was dying. and it was useless to do anything—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found all the organs of the body perfectly healthy—I saw it a few hours before its death—my assistant saw it the day before—it was quite emaciated,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250086"/>
               <p>quite a skeleton—I found no evidence whatever of any disease—the stomach was very pallid and completely empty, except two or three spoonsful of mucus—the bowels also completely empty and contracted—I found no particle of food at all, and no feculent matter in the bowels—there was neither food nor the results of food in the bowels—I cannot judge whether there had been food within a recent time—I did not see any marks—the stomach was not eaten away—the stomach was healthy—the child could not have had food for some little time, but how long it is impossible for me to say—the cause of death was inanition from want of sufficient nourishment—I can come to no other con<lb/>clusion, because there was no disease—all the fat was completely absorbed, there was not a particle—there was not much blood in the vessels, they were relaxed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering that the organs were healthy, can you judge from what cause it was that there was no fat and so little blood I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If there was not sufficient nourishment the child must have fed on the fat of its own body, and it must consequently have become absorbed—that would be caused by want of nourishment certainly—there was a small bruise on the forehead, apparently recent, within a few days I should soy—that had nothing to do with the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it because you could find no ostensible cause of death, that you say it died from want of nourishment I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is so—there was no evidence of disease—I examined the brain—it was perfectly healthy—I examined the state of the teeth, and can say pos<lb/>itively that teething was not the cause of death—teething does not induce children to reject food so entirely as that you would not find the slightest particle in the body—if it had rejected food for two days,' that would not have got rid of all the feculent matter from the body, not in that short space of time—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was made by direc<lb/>tion of the Coroner—I never knew a case precisely like this—I have made many <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations—my assistant was with me at the time, and I also had the assistance of another surgeon, Mr. Randall—he is not here—he was not examined before the Coroner—he did not see her at all before death—my assistant is not here—I heard, after the child's death, that a gentleman of the name of Wood had seen it a fortnight previous—I believe Mr. Wood's assistant is here—my assistant saw the child a day previous to its death—he had not seen it before—he is a young man of twenty or twenty-two years of age, studying at Charing-cross Hospital—Mrs. Blott has been to me; she came once before the child's death—only once to the best of my recollection—that was a few months before the death—that did not induce me to go and see it; the child was brought to me—I don't recol<lb/>lect Mrs. Blott coming to me after the death; she may have done so—I know the neighbourhood of Mint-street very well—it has been a very un<lb/>healthy neighbourhood; it is better now—the air of Notting-hill is decidedly preferable to that of Mint-street—a removal from Notting-hill to Mint-street, would not be likely to have a beneficial influence on the child's health—I don't know that the transition would be so very violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Wood, a surgeon, of 22, Union-street, Borough—I saw the deceased child on one occasion when it was brought to the surgery about a fortnight before its death—it was very much emaciated and apparently sinking from mirasmius, which is synonymous with consumption, it is a wasting away of the body—whether that wasting away arose a rose from want of food or disease of the lungs or some other organ, I cannot tell—Mr. Wood never saw it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will that wasting away frequently occur without any ostensible cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, without any apparent cause—I have no doubt that the removal from the atmosphere of Notting-hill to Mint-street would have a very marked effect upon the child—I am not prepared exactly to say that it would produce the wasting away I speak of, not wholly perhaps—no doubt it would have a very marked effect, but I think not to that extent—I have known instances where a child, in teething has entirely refused food for a certain time—teething will produce irritability of stomach that may induce a child to throw up its food as soon as it had taken it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where you find the stomach absolutely empty, with<lb/>out a particle of food or any fat, would you infer that that would arise from teething? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; teething might occasion a child to reject food for a time—I don't think it would do so to such an extent as to cause the stomach to be absolutely empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any experience to enable you to give a positive opinion upon that. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot take on myself to give a positive opinion—the change of atmosphere that has been spoken of might cause a child to fall off in its appetite—mirasmius is such a disorder as is sometimes called "atrophy,"—supposing the child to have died of mirasmius, the ex<lb/>ternal appearance would have been such as Mr. Llewellyn has mentioned—I should expect to find disease in the intestines or stomach; I mean perforated intestine; it would be very evident—disease is very apparent in such cases—when I saw the child a fortnight before its death, it did not appear to be in want of food—if it had been perishing for want of food, I think it would have appeared to me on that examination.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, M</hi>). I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in—I received the charge—he denied the robbery—it is usual to ask the name and address of prisoners, and also their trade and occupation—I asked him his address, and he said St George's New<lb/>town—I said, "What street?"—he said, "I don't know the street—I said, "Do you know the number?—he said, "No, I do not know the number"—I suggested Clarendon street to him, as the principal street in St George's New-town—he said, No, he did not know the name of the street at all; but he said there was a name on the door—I said, "Do you mean a sign-board?" there are a number of sign-boards there—he said, "Yes"—I did not believe his statement, and paid no further attention to it—after the case was disposed of at the police-court, I was passing through the gaolers room, and saw the gaoler taking down the prisoner's name and address in a book—the gaoler was called into the Court for a time, and asked me to remain in charge of the prisoner till he returned—I did so, and as soon as the gaoler had gone out, the prisoner commenced crying—I said to him, "It is no use crying, that will do you no good at all"—he said, "Why should I get into such trouble for other people?"—at this time a woman came into the room, and he said, "That woman knows the two men as well as I do, that committed this robbery"—another woman came in, and he said, "That woman knows them both as well as I do"—I was about to tell him that if be wished to make a confession, I would receive it, and at that time his solicitor, Mr. Edwin, came in, and I said, "There is your solicitor, you had better consult him"—I then left the room.</p>
