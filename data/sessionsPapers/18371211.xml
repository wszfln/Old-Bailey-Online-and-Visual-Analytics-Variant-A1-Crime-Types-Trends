                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Cotterell, a pawn I broker, living at No. 163, Oxford-street. On Saturday, the 21st of I October, about seven o'clock in the evening, the defendant Harris came I into my master's shop—he was dressed in a similar way to what he is I now, except that he had a silver guard-chain round his neck, a brooch in his shirt, and a ring on his finger—he had quite a respectable appearance—when he came into the shop he took this watch from his guard-chain, and this ring and brooch from his pocket—he was not wearing them on his finger and shirt—he said, "Will you lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these; I am going to a concert» and don't like to go without a few pounds in my pocket"—and he said, "I bought this ring of you about three years ago, and the brooch I bought in Paris"—on examining the watch, I saw something which led me to suppose that the Hall mark, which represented the Goldsmiths' mark on both cases, the inner and outer, was a forgery; and on pulling back the case, I broke it off the hinge—I said nothing to Harris about it, but said, "Does the watch belong to you?"—he said, "No; the watch belongs to Mr. Knowles, and in fact they all belong to Mr. Knowles"—I said, "You told me just now you bought the ring of me, and the brooch in Paris"—he said, "I meant to have said the ring was bought of you, and the brooch was bought in Paris"—the ring had not been sold in our shop, because all our diamond articles are booked—this is a little rose-diamond—it is worth altogether about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14t.—it is one of the commonest description of rose-diamonds.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it have been a pledge, and sold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If so, it would be sold at the sale-rooms—we could have bought it in at the sale-rooms; but if we had done so, it would have been entered, and I should know it.</p>

               <p>said, "Oh, I will go and fetch him," and turned round quickly, and went out of the shop, leaving the property behind him—he walked very sharply out of the shop—I was behind the counter—I went to the door, but he was out of sight—it was dark at the time—he did not return that night,—next morning I went to No. 8, Paddington-street, and found Knowles did not live there—I have examined the watch—as it is only a metal one, we should not be able to get of a private person more than 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—it would depend very much on the quality of the work—it is a lever movement—if it was not for the quality of the works it would not fetch more than 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this description of movement would not fetch more—if it was made to order, it would come to more; but if bought in the shop, not more than 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the way of trade it would not be more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should think a watch-maker would charge 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, if an order was given for it—the brooch is worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is gold, but I take it to be common gold—there is a way of gilding common gold, colouring it, to make it look like fine gold—there is a stamp on this.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a watch is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A patent lever—it if a <hi rend="italic">duffin</hi> watch, made to deceive the public—there has been about 300 pawned about the trade within three years—it is an old-fashioned lack lever—it has a jewel in it—a watch could be jewelled for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in that way—it is gilt upon brass.</p>

               <p>I did not offer it for gold"—I told him he had offered it at a gold price, and I could not let him go without taking him before a Magistrate—he then said, I did not offer it for gold"—I said he had at a gold price—the policeman was there at the time—there is a very great deception about the article—I did not discover any thing myself till after I took the movement out of the case to weigh it, to see what weight in gold there was, and in doing so I ascertained it was not gold, from something I saw in the case at the time I weighed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwood, Hadley, in the parish of Enfield. The prisoner Lock was about six weeks in my service—on the 6th of December about twelve o'clock at night I was going to bed and was undressed—my dressing-room is almost over the pantry—I heard people talking, and went down stairs and listened at the pantry door for some time—I still heard talking, and tried the door, but could not open it—I said to my servant Lock, "John, open the door"—he said, What, sir?"—I said, I insist on your opening the door"—he opened it—I found he was in liquor—I said, Who were you talking to?"—he said, I was not talking to any body"—I said, Nonsense, I have been listening at the door"—he said, I was not talking to any body"—I went to the adjoining place, where there is a sink and a door which leads to the wash-house, and found a man concealed behind that door—I dragged him to the light, and found it was the prisoner Matthews, who had been in my house some time previous, brewing—he had two bundles in his hand—I said, What have you got here? put them down on the ground"—I desired him to open them—Lock was going to open them, but I would not let him—Matthews opened them, and in one was two pairs of shoes which do not belong to me—the next bundle contained some bread, which, as Í bake at home, I know to be mine—while I was looking at him I observed he had a bottle stuck in his breast—I collared him, and said, I will see what is in this bottle"—he said, You shan't,"—I said, I will"—we had a scuffle-at last we got against the sink—I pinned him, and when he found he could not help himself he smashed the bottle against the sink—it contained sherry wine—I was dragging him back to the pantry, and he struck me three or four times, but did not hurt me—I pulled him down—my maid servant was gone to the stable for the groom—my wife came in, and, being nervous, I was obliged to let him go, to go to her to get her away, and in the meantime Matthews escaped, but he was apprehended at eight o'clock next night—the wine was taken from my cellar—I know that from Lock's confession—I always kept the key of the cellar myself, and gave out per haps two or three bottles of wine at a time—I did not miss any wine—it is difficult to miss any, for there is a good deal of wine drank in my house</p>

               <p>when I am out—I might easily lose a bottle of wine without knowing it—I know the bread—the loaves are a very peculiar shape, and we bake them ourselves—this is a loaf that came out of his handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 11, Exmouth-street, Commercial. road, and am a nautical and mathematical instrument maker.

               <p>who lives in Spital-square. The prisoner was his porter—I remember Friday, the 20th of October last—my young masters, Mr. Bennett's sons, dined at home that day at five o'clock—the prisoner and I took tea together that day, as soon as I could get the gentlemen's dinner up, but he did not stay to finish his tea before he went out—I had spoken about going out that day, and about one o'clock he asked me at what time I should go—he asked me that at one o'clock, and at five o'clock also—I told him at one o'clock that I was going as soon as I had cleared away the dinner things—I gave him that answer on both occasions—he had wished me, during the whole of the week, to go out with a friend of his—after dinner was over, the two Mr. Bennetts went out—that was a little before six o'clock—the prisoner and myself were then the only persons left on the premises—we had not finished tea at that time—he went out without finishing his tea—before he went out he said I was to be sure to be ready to go out at the time he should come back, and that would be seven o'clock—he went out as soon as the gentlemen went out, that was before six o'clock—he went almost directly they did—I cannot say to a minute—he returned about twenty-five minutes after seven o'clock—I was then ready to go out, all but my bonnet—he asked me if I would go to my late employers, where I had lived eight years, to ask for a situation for him—they live at King's cross—I knew he was about to leave—King's-cross is a long distance from Spital-square—I told him I could not go, it was too late to go so far—it was a quarter to eight o'clock when I did go out, and I came in at nine o'clock—I shut the door after me when I went out, and tried it after me—I had told him that I should be back at nine o'clock, and he asked me to get something for supper—when I returned at nine o'clock I found the door still closed—the prisoner let me in, and I saw him in the scullery, soon after my re turn, cleaning some harness-irons—I went into the scullery Boon after him—while I was in the scullery, and he was cleaning the harness, some man passed the window, and said, I say, halloo, when you have done with that, hang it up"—I asked the prisoner who that was, and he laughed at me—that window looks out into the street, by the side of the street-door—the window was not open—the bar was down, but the shutters were shut—I could not see out, but I could hear the voice—I could hear distinctly what was said—there was a light in the scullery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the shutters in such a state as to enable any body outside to see what was going on inside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they could not see what was going on—they could see a light, and they might, if the shutters were not quite closed, see any one pass, but not distinctly see who it was—a person outside could not see a person in the scullery—it was the voice of a man that I heard—it is a very quiet place—I can easily hear what passes—I had noticed that the warehouse doors were both shut before I went out—they were as they usually are when my masters have locked them, and they were in that state, as far as I observed, when I returned, but I did not take particular notice—Mr. Bennett's sons returned about ten o'clock—I let them in, and they went up stairs to bed—I and the prisoner remained below in the kitchen till about twelve o'clock—the prisoner fastened the street door that night—I never had any thing to do with it—I used to light him to do it—I did not light him on this occasion—I was in the kitchen, and heard him fasten it.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first called the prisoner up, did not he tell you he did not intend to get up for half an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he said, "I shall not get up yet"—those were his very words—I am not aware that I ever said his answer was, "I shall not get up till the half hour"—I did not follow him up stairs, the night before, quite immediately—I was in the kitchen a minute or two—I never said I followed him up immediately, that I am aware of—I will not swear I have not said so—I have been in Mr. Bennett's service nine months on the 10th of next month—I found the prisoner in his service when I went there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the prisoner and you been good friends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we have not—we have had a great many quarrels about his being out so late at night, but he has been down on his knees, and begged me not to tell Mr. Bennett of it—he asked me for my company once, but I found he was engaged to a great many—he wished to pay his addresses to me—I did not refuse him at once—I told him I should see how he went on—I have told him that a great many times—it was not long after that I found out he was</p>

               <p>engaged to a great many—he said he was not—I told him I should not have his company, and he asked me again—I never thought any thing of him particularly—I heard he was engaged to one or two—he told me him self there were a great many came after him, but he did not think any thing of them—he said Mr. Bennett's nurse-maid came running after him to the house—I have seen her come after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you told him you would see how he went on, did you find out his engagements to a great many others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew it be fore, when he asked me for my company—I knew he was engaged, and told him so—by seeing how he went on, I meant providing he gave them up—after that Elizabeth Lester came to see him, and several others—I never cared any thing about him—Lester is Mr. Bennett's nurse-maid—she used to come, and she said she would come running after him un known to master—I did not tell my master of her coming—I did not wish to make mischief, and I gave him up—I would have allowed him to keep company with me if he had given up the others, if he went on in the way I should wish.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that you never cared any thing about him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not like his way of going on—he was out sometimes all night, and sometimes till three or four o'clock in the morning—I have had quarrels with him about other women—he was unwell once while I was in the house, and had twelve leeches on—I put them on myself, and attended on him for two nights.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do that with your master's knowledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I sat up with him two nights.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now attend—did he not tell you in the beginning, if you did not go out that night that he himself should go out again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when he came home, at twenty-five minutes after seven o'clock, he said, Now are you going; if not, tell me, and I will go out again?"</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long did you live in your former place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not live there a great while, on account of the family being unfortunate, and failing—the situation before that I lived eight years at—I am still in Mr. Bennett's service, at his private house, No. 26, Compton-terrace—that is where Elizabeth Lester lived, who came after the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the prosecutor's sons. His Christian name is Henry—he has a house at No. 10, Spital-square—it is in the liberty of Norton Falgate—he carries on the business of a silk and velvet manufacturer, and resides himself at Islington—I and my brother live in the house of business in Spital-square—our premises are at the cor ner of the square, and are entered by one door—there are two warehouses on the ground floor, a front and a back one—as you enter the street door, the door leading into the front warehouse is on the left hand—it may be about two yards from the hall door, not more—if you proceed to the end of the passage and turn to the left by another passage you come to the door which opens to the back warehouse—there is a door inside opening between the two warehouses—after business is over we lock the front warehouse door inside—there is a spring to that door which rings a bell if opened inward—we leave the key in the lock after locking it inside—I locked up the premises on the night in question—I did as I have stated that night about half-past five o'clock—I locked the front warehouse door inside, and left the key in the lock—I then proceeded into the back ware house—there are two iron safes there—one safe is inside the other—I locked them both—there is a drawer inside the inner safe—that was locked,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183712110037"/>
               <p>and the key of it was in my father's possession—I saw that the window shutters and bolts about the premises were all secured—I then locked the back warehouse door on the outside—that door leads into the passage to the left which communicates with the hall—there is only one entrance to the street—I locked up the key of the back warehouse door in one of the drawers in our bed-room—my brother and I sleep in the same room—there are two keys to the safes—I deposited them in the back of a till belonging to my desk, in the upper warehouse on the first floor—the upper warehouse is over the back warehouse—there is a communication from one to the other by a small staircase—there was money kept in the desk where I put the keys—the drawer is about a foot and a half long—I should think it would be necessary in order to get at the keys to pull the drawer out nearly to its extreme length—we dined that day at five o'clock—I locked the ware houses after I had dined—I had been round the greatest portion of the house that afternoon about a quarter of an hour before I went to dinner (about a quarter before five o'clock)—that was after business had closed—I cannot say exactly whether it was after the front door had been shut—I went over the greater part of the premises—it was to look for something that was missing—the foreman and a lad accompanied me—it was quite light at the time—we have work people who come to our premises with work and to fetch it—they come to the back part of the premises, on the first floor, over the back warehouse—I searched all the front part of the premises and the greater portion of the back—I searched the part the workmen are in the habit of coming to—the dwelling-house is not entirely separated from the part used for business—they are on different floors—there is a door as you go upstairs which you have to pass through before you leave the business premises to get to the dwelling-house part—it has a spring which causes it to shut of itself—there is also a spring to it which rings an alarm-bell—I searched all the parts of the premises below that door on this evening, and I did not find any person in the place then—my brother and I went out directly I locked up the warehouse—it might be about twenty minutes to six o'clock—we let ourselves out—I found the outer door closed when we went out, and I closed it after me, I am quite positive—my brother and I were generally in the habit of going out after dinner, and usually returned about ten o'clock—we returned rather before ten o'clock that night—Susannah Baker let us in—I noticed that the front warehouse door was closed when I came in—my brother and I proceeded to bed directly—we did not lock our bed-room door—I was not disturbed at ail in the night—I was alarmed about seven o'clock by Baker, and on proceeding down stairs I found the front warehouse door open, and the spring inside communicating with the bell, turned up—the key was in the lock—it did not appear to have been at all forced, but as if it had been opened from the inside—I had noticed that door closed at ten o'clock the night before.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you try the front warehouse door when you returned at ten o'clock?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—it might have been unlocked, but it was closed at that time—the prisoner was down before me in the morning—after I had ascertained what had been done to the door I examined the iron safes, and found the doors of both the outer and inner safes open—there was not the least appearance of force having been applied to them—I found a knife stuck in the drawer of which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183712110038"/>
               <p>my father had the key—I did not find a key in that lock—I saw a small key lying on the counter, but it was not in the lock—on applying that key to the lock of the drawer I found it would enter but not turn—the drawer had not been opened—that small key appeared to me to have been recently filed, so as to enable it to go into the key hole—I have the key here, and the drawer too—this does appear to me to have been recently filed—it goes into the key-hole, but will not turn—I found some skeleton keys, crow bars, and dark lanterns spread about—I then looked at the door of the back warehouse, which was wide open—there did not appear to have been any force used to that door—I then proceeded to my desk in the upper warehouse, and found the top of the desk forced off and prised up, by which means the drawer could be got at, but the desk had not been opened—that would enable the parties to get the keys of the safes from the drawer—there is a flap to the desk itself—that was not interfered with—there was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or less in the fore part of that drawer—the greatest portion of that was gone—there was a half-sovereign, a fourpenny-piece, and some copper left—I found the keys of the safes in the same part of the drawer as I had left them—I brought the key of the lower back warehouse down with me—I had it in the drawer of my bed-room, where I had put it the evening before—I found that drawer locked as I had left it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could any person, after ten o'clock that night, become possessed of the key of the back warehouse without coming into your bed-room, and by some means opening that drawer and taking the key out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I found that key in my bed-room and the drawer locked—there was another desk opposite mine, in the warehouse, there is one flap to that desk—there are four desks in the lower back warehouse—there was no other desk interfered with, except the one which had the money and the keys of the safe—eighteen pieces of velvet were gone—they were worth about 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were kept on the floor close to the front warehouse door—they were in boxes—some in a row, and others piled on them—they were velvets of an expensive kind—there were other boxes containing inferior velvets—they were in separate boxes—there were velvets laying about the counter and warehouse, out of cases altogether—none of the inferior kind, either in cases or open were taken away—there was only one piece kept in each box—there were about two dozen boxes or rather more taken—the eighteen boxes which had contained the velvet which was taken away, were left empty—I should think there was about one hundred boxes of velvet altogether in the warehouse—those we lost were some of the best—our back premises are shut in by high walls—I did not find the least appearance of anybody having entered at the back—I examined the windows and fastening in the front of the house, and there was not the least appearance of violence having been used any where—the prisoner had been in my father's service about three years—he was the porter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would he in his employment have the means of knowing where the money was kept and the keys, and the general system of placing the goods in boxes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would—there is what is called a Number-book kept in the warehouse—by referring to the numbers there a person can see in what boxes the best velvets are kept—the prisoner would have an opportunity of looking into that book if he chose—my father had given him notice to quit his service—his time for leaving would have expired on the Wednesday after this Friday—we had a dog kept on our premises—it is between an Italian greyhound and a terrier—he runs about the premises—he is a very small clog, but very sharp indeed—if the bell rings</p>

I dined with him on this day, and returned with him about ten o'clock at night—next morning I was alarmed by the witness Baker—I came down first, and observed the prisoner standing at the street door—the front door was unfastened—it had been fastened by a bolt at the top, another at the bottom, a chain in the middle, and a bar which goes into the ground in the middle—it is a great cross-bar—there was also a lock to the door—the lock must have been undone, because the door was ajar, but I did not go to the door—the removing of those fastenings would make a considerable noise—I can always hear them removed in my bed-room of a morning—I have always heard them—I did not hear them on that Saturday morning—I had seen some inferior velvets on the counter of the back warehouse on the Friday evening before I had dined—I saw them on the following morning—they were in the same state then, except that two pieces of paper, which were put on the top to keep the dust off, were on the ground—that would enable a person to see the quality of them—I do not know who opened the warehouse shutters that morning—I did not see my brother open them—I did not hear any noise from the dog that night—it always used to bark very loud when any strange noise occurred, or any stranger appeared—when the policeman came we found various crow-bars and other things—the policeman is ill—I have seen one of the keys that was found—that key goes into the lock of the drawer exactly—it has been filed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publisher and printseller, in partnership with Richard Hodgson, in Pall-mall. On the 8th of December I received in formation, and missed nine copper plates and one steer plate, which I had had in my possession—they were for a work of Sir Joshua Reynolds, in the course of publication—they would cost upwards of one hundred guineas to replace—from information I received, I went to Mr. Morris, in Holy well-street, Strand, and found the plates there—that was last Friday, the 8th of December—I have no recollection of the prisoner—the plates had been returned from the printer on the 5th of December, and the last time I saw them they were lying on the counter in my shop.</p>

About five o'clock last Wednesday afternoon, the two prisoners came and asked to look at some diamond rings—I showed them some small ones—they said they wanted to see some larger, which I showed them—on turning my eye I saw there was a tray of brooches there, and I put it into the window—I turned, and then a man came in and asked to look at some tooth-picks—our boy went to speak to him, and I saw Melloy go to the door—Allen was then looking at the rings—the other man went out—Melloy then returned, and persuaded Allen not to have a ring to-night—I had shown him one ring at sixty guineas, and saw a common rose-diamond ring in its place—I said, "It is very strange, there was a sixty guinea ring here, and now I see this beastly thing"—I requested they would wait till Mr. Walton came.</p>

On Saturday night, the 10th of December, I was in the Shakspeare, inquiring for a bed—the prisoner asked me if I would go with her—I told her I was married, I did not want to go with her—I wished to go to a private bed, as I was in trouble in consequence of my brother's death—she said she had a good fire, and I might be quiet there—I asked if there was a pen and ink, she said, "Yes"—I went with her, and she had no ink—I put my watch on the table, and went to bed, and left her sitting by the fire—in two or three hours I went to get up, and my watch was gone—she awoke me by coming to bed; I got up immediately and the watch was gone—I asked her where my watch was—she said she could not tell me—I then went to get my clothes on, and my money was gone—I asked her about it, and if she was in need—she said she knew nothing about it—I opened the door and called the policeman—I do not know whether any one else had been in the room—I did not see any one but her—I left her in charge of all my property—I do not know whether she went out while I was asleep—the watch is not found—I valued it, as I had it ever since I was a little boy—it was about three hours after I went to bed, by the officers account, that I was awoke by her coming to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital. On the 15th of November John Quinn was brought there—I found a wound on his abdomen—it was a small wound—I do not know the depth, as no in strument was introduced to try it—it had been done by some sharp-pointed instrument, and was a dangerous wound—he appeared to suffer a good deal from it—he appeared very faint, and in a very bad state—he was three weeks in the hospital, or it might be more—he was completely recovered when discharged.</p>

On the 15th of November I went to the prisoner's house, in Drury-court, and found him very drunk—I took him into custody—he was standing in Drury-lane when I went up to him—I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "You are my prisoner—he said, "If I am it can't be helped"—I said nothing more to him at that time, but took him to the station-house, and locked him up—I after wards took him, by the Magistrate's order, to Charing-cross Hospital, for the Magistrate to take his son's deposition—I asked him what he had done with the knife he had stabbed his son with—he said he did not know, he had thrown it away, and had not seen it since—I afterwards found the knife burning on the fire—the point of it was broken off—I could not find the whole of it—I have it here, except the point—I have had the care on it ever since.</p>

               <p>the 9th of December—I kept them in the back part of my house, enclosed in a fence three or four feet high, in a field belonging to Mr. Theobald—the prisoner lives three doors off—I did not lend or borrow any ducks of him—I saw them next in the officer's possession, about a quarter before twelve o'clock the next morning—they were mine—the heads of two were cut off—one remained on—I have no doubt they were mine, from some particular feathers—I reared them from ducklings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to the prisoner's house and traced these feathers from where they were stolen, to the back of the prisoner's premises, and that led to the discovery—the prisoner was in his back bed-room—he seemed to wish me to keep back, hut I went in and found the three ducks, and two ducks' heads were in the pail—I asked if they were his—he said yes, he had bought them of a man in the Brixton-road for three half-crowns, at twenty minutes to sir o'clock—I said—"Where are the feathers you had?"—he said, "I had none"—I took some logs of wood off the fire and found a quantity of feathers there—I took them out of the fire, and they are similar to what I traced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you put down his answer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have had no other cases since, I am sure I am not mistaken about the time—the feathers I traced on the track were the same at those I found in the prisoner's house—they are of a similar kind—they appear as if from the neck, and their being ducks' feathers made me go over the fence—I traced feathers for about thirty yards, and I saw the foot-mark where it is an unusual thing for people to go over, and then I went to the prisoner's house.</p>
