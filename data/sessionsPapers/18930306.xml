I am a coachman of 48, Princes Mews—on the morning of 22nd February I came home about a quarter-past twelve—I let myself in—no one else was living in the house—when I got upstairs I lighted the gas, and then saw some soldier's clothes on the bed, a tunic and great coat, and a pair of trousers on the table—I saw a man's foot projecting from under the bed—I asked what he was doing there, and told him to come out—he came but; and I said, "You have got my trousers and waistcoat on"—he replied, "All right, old man, I am a deserter"—I said, "And you have got my cap"—I took the cap off his head; he went to the window, shoved it up, got on a ladder, and down he went—I halloaed out "Police!" as loud as I could—no policeman was there—I went into Exhibition Road and got one—I saw the prisoner run up the mews—he had broken a pane of glass, put his arm through, and pulled the catch back—it was all safe when I went out; I had never seen him before—he seemed to me to be half silly, or three parts drunk; but he must have known what he was about, or he could not have got up the ladder, and got on it again to get away.</p>

               <p>I was at the first floor window, which looks into Castle Street, and saw the prisoner come down Castle Street from St. Martin's Lane—he backed himself up against a hole in the brewery wall on the opposite side of the street, took a white paper packet from his pocket, put it into the hole, and walked away—I went over with Green about five minutes afterwards, looked into the hole, took out the packet, undid it, and found seven bad half-crowns and a florin in it, with paper between each—in ten minutes I saw the prisoner come back with another lad and feel in the hole—there are several holes along the wall—he went to two or three and then went a way again—I informed the police, handed them the packet, and described the prisoner.</p>

I am the parish doctor, of 606, Harrow Road, Chelsea—on 15th December last the prisoner brought a child to me with an order—it was in a very weakly emaciated condition, with scarcely any fat on its bones—I said to the prisoner, "You are not feeding the child properly"—I advised her to feed it regularly every two hours with a pint of milk and half water during twenty-four hours, to keep it warm and well covered up—I saw it again on the 17th, and I did not see it again till after its death—I was sent for on the 29th January and found it dead—I made a post-mortem examination on 2nd February—it weighed four and a half pounds; the normal weight of a child three months old is about 11 pounds—it was a mere skeleton, there was no particle of fat anywhere about its body—the organs were healthy—there was a very slight patch of congestion on part of the right lung, but my opinion was, it was simply from the lung—I could attribute the death to nothing but want of sufficient and proper food.</p>

Cowles said, "Yes"—I said, "You had better say what you know about him"—Cowles said, "You stopped me last Tuesday morning, when I was coming from market, and I bought these three bracelets from you"—three bracelets were produced—Lynch hesitated for a moment, and then said, "They don't belong to me"—I said, "Perhaps you can tell us to whom they do belong?"—he said, "No, I don't wish to say anything more about it at present"—they were charged and made no reply—after they had been before the Magistrate next day, Cowles told me where he had sold this bracelet, and in consequence of what he said, I went and found what he said was true—on the Monday in the next week Cowles said, "Have you found that other bracelet?"—I said, "Yes; you were going to tell me last week how you paid for the bracelets," because he said he had paid £4 for them—he said, "Yes; I paid him £2 on Tuesday morning and two half-sovereigns, "I think he said, "on Tuesday evening, and a sovereign on Wednesday morning"—Lynch made no reply—I said, "You also said you bought those rings of him"—he said, "Yes '—I said, "What did you give?"—Cowles said, "25s."—I made this note soon afterwards—Lynch said nothing to that—I said, "You also tell us you bought a coat of Beales'"—Beales was present—Cobles said, "Yes; I bought that of Lynch on Tuesday morning, and gave him six shillings for it"—Lynch said, "It is not my coat; I pawned my coat for four shillings"—I said to Cowles, "Where were you when you bought it?"—he said, "In Vincent Square"—Lynch said, "Vincent Square? Do you think I should bring it to Vincent Square? I might as well bring it to the Police-station at once"—Vincent Square is at the back of the Police-station—he then said he knew nothing about it.</p>

I am the prisoner's son, and live at 7A, Peabody Buildings, Westminster—on Sunday, 19th February, I was in the sitting-room—there are three rooms—the prisoner and my mother and sister were with me—it is the front room—I left the room—the prisoner went out before I did—it was a little before twelve—while absent I heard cries of "Murder!" but no quarrelling—I rushed back to the room and found my father with a knife in his hand and his left arm round my mother's neck—I saw some blood on his arm—I struggled with him and took the knife from him and put him outside in the corridor—the prisoner had his back towards me as I came in at the door and my mother was half on the floor; he seemed to be pushing her on the floor—he was in front of her—the prisoner was given in charge—my parents have not lived on good terms lately—I have not heard threats—the prisoner has been a teetotaller—he came home drunk about eight days previous to this occurrence—I saw him—I believe he has been drinking since, and his manner has been strange—on the Friday he called me in and said he wished to apologise; he was off his head; on another occasion he would not go to bed, and then got into bed with his trousers on; I spoke to him, and eventually he took them off—he then seemed sober but strange.</p>

I live at 22, Glynn Road, Clapton Park, next door <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mr. Palmer—I have known the prisoner by sight about three years—on Wednesday or Thursday, January 26th or 27th, I was at the George public-house with a friend, about 10.5 p.m.; the prisoner came in five minutes afterwards, and asked if I could get him a cheque for £1 4s. 8d.—I said, I do not know where to get one"—he said, "Go to Mr. Palmer"—he said it was too late to get a post-office order, and that it was for Mr. Bottle—I wrote the name down, and went to Mr. Palmer's, which is only a stone's throw off, and gave him the £1 4s. 8d.—he gave me a cheque for it, which I gave to the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot read—he told me to tell Mr. Palmer who the cheque was for, and that he wanted it to pay a little debt—I did not post the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the London and County Bank, Hackney—Mr. Palmer keeps an account there—this cheque-book was delivered to him on December 15th, 1892—it contained cheques numbered 6,826 to 6,850—this cheque for £81 4s. 8d. was the first cheque in that book; it was presented to me on January 26th by messenger No. 632, and I paid it with £40 in notes and £41 4s. 8d. in money—at the end of the day I found I had nearly £20 over—there were eight £5 notes, 86442 to 86449, dated November 17th, 1892—I put the cash into a paper bag open, and handed it to the messenger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave the boy's number first as 626, but I corrected it at the last examination; that was before I had time to refresh my memory by looking at my notes—according to my impression I paid him the full amount, but as nobody has claimed the amount and the boy says I paid him £20 short I suppose I did so—£19 19s. 7d. is the exact amount—I took the notes from a drawer by the side of the till, and as I took out each note I entered it in a book—I identify it by the name of the drawer of the cheque and the numbers of the notes.</p>

I am superintendent of the Boy Messenger office, 5, Gresham Street—on 28th January, in the morning, the prisoner called and handed me this letter, with a letter in it, and asked me to have it sent at once, and he would come back in half an hour for the answer—he did so, but I told him we had not sent the letter, because the address was so vague, and there were a great many people in Palmerston Buildings—I then added the word "Hotel" at Sexton's suggestion, and the prisoner said, "Yes, that is the place I meant"—I sent a boy to the Palmerston Restaurant, who came back, and I sent him back again with further instructions, which the prisoner gave, but they were very vague; I did not understand them, and I do not think the boy did, and he came back—I sent another boy, who returned with the boy Curtis, the district messenger, who handed a parcel of money to the prisoner in my presence, who opened it and counted it, and signed a receipt—I saw the prisoner five times that day between eleven a.m. and 2. 45, and made this sketch of him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from memory—I afterwards picked him out from about eight others at the Police-station.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage for William Rose, the Bell, Middlesex Street—I advertised for a potman and barman just before 20th January—Betjemann applied for the situation in the name of Blackbrow—as the situation of potman and barman was filled up engaged him as barman—he told me to apply for his reference to Mr. Lipmann, Peabody Arms, Shadwell—he said he had been in that situation as potman and barman ten months, and had left it about a fortnight—he asked me 10s. a week, and lodging and food—I went to the Peabody Arms and left my card with Mrs. Lipmann, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189303060030"/>
               <p>next morning I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This, signed L. Lipmann, stated that he had always found Walter Blackbrow honest, sober, and a good worker, and that he had been with him for ten months at</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week</hi>)—next morning Betjemann came; I told him his reference was satisfactory and I would take him on as a barman—he entered on his work the same day, and was with me ten days, and on Monday, 30th January, he was in custody—I saw Blackbrow in my bar on the first night Betjemann was in my employ, and on four or five occasions afterwards on separate days—I believed at the time that Betjemann was called Blackbrow—Blackbrow was in my bar about two hours on 20th—he generally came in the evening—I did not see him there when Betjemann was not behind the bar—I never saw him before Betjemann came into my service—I leave the bar to rest from between two and three to five, and that is the only time I am away from the bar except meal and washing times—I received information from the police—on Monday morning, 30th, they marked eight sixpences, four shillings, and a florin in my presence, and I arranged that the police should pass the money while I was resting on that same day—I went away from the bar at three o'clock after clearing all money out of my three tills—at five o'clock I returned—I had left Betjemann in charge of two tills, and the barman Ford at the end of the bar in charge of the other one—at five o'clock when I came down Cumner and Thompson came in, and in their presence I cleared the tills—my tills were Cox's patent—when you put the coin in the bell rings, and the coin cannot be taken out again and must be found there—the marked florin was not in any of the tills—I then called Betjemann into the bar parlour and the officers came in with him—Cumner told him who they were, and asked him if he had any money on him that did not belong to him—he said, "No"—they said, "I want you to produce what you have in your pockets"—in his waistcoat pockets were sixteen sixpences and eight separate shillings—this marked sixpence was among the sixteen—the officers asked if he had any more money, and he said, "No"—they emptied his hip pocket and took out a packet of thirty-four sixpences—they said something to him, and he said, "I had better take and tell the truth; I have stolen it all"—they asked him why he had done, it, and he said, "Because I have such a mob behind me I am obliged to do it; one of them is in the bar now"—Cumner said, "Which one is that; the one that is in front of the engine?"—he said, "Yes"—Cumner went round and brought Blackbrow into the bar parlour, and then said to Betjemann, "Is this the man you mean?" and he said, "Yes, that is the one I mean"—Blackbrow said, "Me?" and Betjemann said, "Yes, you," pointing to him—Betjemann said, I am here with your name and your reference"—Blackbrow said he did not know * anything about it—the policemen took the prisoners to the station—I went there—Betjemann told the inspector, "I am here in Blackbrow's name and with his reference, and pay him 10s. a week for it"—Blackbrow disowned it at first, but afterwards he said to the inspector, "Yes, I did give him my reference; I did not want it, and I thought it would do him good as he had not got one"—the inspector said, "You have to pay him 10s. a week for his reference?"—Betjemann said, "Yes"—the inspector said,</p>

I have since seen Mr. Lipmatin—I have no doubt that Blackbrow was in his employ as barman and potman, and that if the character had applied to Blackbrow it would be perfectly true—I have seen Betjemann serve Blackbrow; but I saw nothing between them that excited my suspicion—I expected something was going on, as the takings were so short—I had a communication from Miss Reeves on Sunday, 29th—on the Monday I saw Blackbrow in the bar—my suspicions were not directed towards anybody else but Betjemann.</p>

About 4. 30 on Monday, 30th January, I went in plain clothes to the Bell, Middlesex Street, with some marked coins which Cumner had given to me—I tendered a florin for two two-pennyworths of whisky and half a pint of whisky in a bottle—I had a friend with me—Betjemann served me; I gave him the florin, and he gave me sixpence change—I did not notice where he put the florin; he went to the till and the bell rang—I believe he got my change from the till; it was from a shelf at the back where the change is kept—I went outside and returned in less than two minutes, and called for two two-pennyworths of whisky, saying to my friend, "It is my birthday, I will treat you again"—I tendered a marked sixpence, given to me by Cumner—the prisoner rang the bell again, and put the sixpence in the till, I believe.</p>

I keep the Baker and Basket, Leman Street, which is not far from the Bell—I have known Betjemann and his family for seven years—on Friday, 27th January, between five and seven, Betjemann, Blackbrow, and another man, who were strangers to me, came into my bar—they had a drink and left; they had a cab outside, which Betjemann's father, who happened to be there, called my attention to—about the same time on Saturday the same three men came in; they remained two or three minutes and had one drink—after they had left Betjemann returned immediately, as if he had a sudden thought—he stooped his head and said to me, "Would you take care of this?" handing me £3 10s. in gold—I had only heard on the previous evening that he was in a situation in one of Rose's houses; I did not know where it was—I heard he was with bad associates the night before, and when he left this money I sent down to the police, believing something was wrong—I identified Blackbrow afterwards from among ten others.</p>

On the Monday morning I was in plain clothes—I marked the money in Fry's presence—I gave Grummett a florin and a sixpence to pass—about five o'clock I went to the house; the prisoner was serving behind the bar—the tills were turned out in my presence—we could not find the florin nor the sixpence—I did not examine the money on the shelf—I think the bell of the till could be rung without putting a coin in—Betjemann was called into the bar parlour, and I asked him about the matter—from what he said I went round to the bar where Black brow was, and said to him, "There is a barman making a very grave accusation against you; you had better come round and see"—he said, "Certainly"—I said, "A barman has accused you of giving him his character; that he is working here with your character, and that he has given you ten shillings a week for the use of it, and that he has to treat you and your mob to drink. You had better come round and see him"—he said, "Certainly, I will come round and see him"—he came round with me into the bar parlour, and then Betjemann repeated his statement—Black brow said, "I deny it"—I said, "You will have to go to the station along with me"—he said, "Don't show me up. I have got a brougham outside, and I will drive you down to the station"—we walked there—the brougham followed—Blackbrow said to the driver in livery, "Follow down. "</p>

It was a commercial traveller's brougham; Blackbrow had met the man casually, and took him to have a drink—I have made inquiries about Blackbrow, and find that up to the present he had borne the highest character—he was in Lipmann's employment as barman and potman for eight months—I found without going there that Betjemann was employed at an eel-pie shop, under the name of George Lewis—he was only there a short time, and was turned out for drunkenness—he went out and got drunk and never came back.</p>

I took the charge when the prisoners were charged together—Betjemann said the whole of the money Miss Reeves had and the money found on him was the property of his master, except 28. 6d. left from his wages—he then began a statement in Black-brow's presence, and I made these notes of it on blotting paper: "I was in service at an eel-pie shop, and went out one evening to a public-house at Stepney; I there met Blackbrow and other barmen; I got drunk, and in consequence lost my situation"—I told Blackbrow that concerned him</p>

               <p>—Betjemann went on: "It was then arranged between Blackbrow and me that I should steal money at William Rose's before I went there"—he was charged with conspiring, and he then said, "I met Blackbrow at the Angel and Trumpet at Stepney, about eight months ago, in company with some other barmen, when they made me drunk, and I lost my situation at the eel-pie shop. Soon after that he offered to give me a brief to work on if I would give him 10s. a week if I got on, and pitch them over the bar when they came in. In consequence of what I saw, I went for the potman's place at the Bell with the brief Blackbrow gave me; I did not get the potman's place, but took a barman's. He has been in the house every day since, and I have pitched him a number of pieces over the bar"—Blackbrow interposed and said, "I have been to the house; Mr. Fry knows that, and knows when I have been there; I have not spoken to that man"—Betjemann said, "Yes, you have, and I gave you 5s. one day when I was out, and another day 10s., and another day 5s., £1 altogether"—I said, "How did you do that in a fortnight out of 10s. a week?"—Betjemann said, "I had to steal it from my master"—Blackbrow said, "I gave him my character because I was tired of the business, and he could not get on without one; I thought it would help him a bit."</p>

I live with my uncle in Mathias Road, Dalston, and am an artist—at half-past nine, on Monday, the 20th February, I was in the Bullen Road, going home, when I was surrounded by about half a dozen boys—Murray got hold of my arms and pulled me down, and Cooke hit me on the breast and put his hand in my pocket—Murray held one of my arms and Cooke the other, and Murray wrenched the purse from my hand—Cooke put his hand up my petticoats, and hit me in the face—I called out, "Police I"; two of the boys were keeping watch—when I called out they ran away, and Murray came back and hit me on the cheek, which swelled very much—I got up, went home, and told my uncle all about it—we went out on Wednesday and Thursday; and in the Allen Road, not far off, I saw a number of boys, and pointed out to my uncle the three prisoners—my uncle ran after them, and blew a whistle—the boys ran away directly they saw us—my uncle</p>

I received information from Annie Fletcher, and from information I received elsewhere I went to the prisoner and said, "I am a police-officer, and am making inquiries about a watch which has been stolen"—he said, "Yes; I bought the watch of a small boy yesterday, who I do not know, and gave him twopence for it; he said he found it on a dust-heap"—he thought it might do for his children to play with, but it might be broken up—I took him to the station—he gave his address at Kilburn—I went there, and his wife handed me the watch from a chest of drawers—I took it to the station, and it was identified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. You gave me all the information in your power, and asked me to inquire into your character—I did so, and find you are a very honest and respectable man; nothing was known against you—you have been known in the neighbourhood of Kilburn for three years, as a man who works hard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am London manager, at 145, Queen Victoria Street, for J. Russell and Co., iron tube manufacturers Wednesbury—I received this letter, of 15th November, from Tournay and Co., decorators and contractors, 1, Dudley Terrace, Philip Lane near West Green Station, asking for a list of gas tubing, and what our discount was—I quoted prices in answer—I received this letter from Tournay and Co., dated 19th (<hi rend="italic">This ordered certain gas tubing to be delivered at their premises</hi>) I gave instructions for the goods to be forwarded—the invoice price at one month's credit was. 19s. 10d., subject to two and a half per cent, discount—on 19th December, in consequence of a letter I received, I went to 1, Dudley Terrace—I found it was a small house with stables; it was closed—when I had the goods sent I believed there was a genuine <hi rend="italic">bonâ-fide</hi> firm at the address—the goods have never been paid for—on 19th December I saw the goods at the Tottenham Police-station, and identified them by our mark on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of Summerhill Road, Tottenham—I first knew Gander a few days before 16th December, when he called at my Shop and said he had some iron barrel for sale—I asked if it was his own property—he said, "No," he was commissioned by a friend to sell it—I asked how much there was of it, and the value, and whether it was new or second-hand, and he told me it was new, and was about £25 nett, I think—he told me he had been a builder and decorator—I told him it was a very heavy amount; I could not entertain that if it was new stuff, unless I saw the invoice—he promised to bring me the invoice the following day—he came during Saturday 14th and brought me this paper, which had no printed heading, but is just a description of the articles—I told him it was of a very informal character, and I could not purchase the goods unless I saw them—I asked him where the goods could be seen—he said, "At an empty shop at Stamford Hill, near the South Tottenham Station"—I arranged to meet him some few hours afterwards and go with him—he came for me afterwards; in the interval I had communicated with the police officers—I went with him to an empty shop on Stamford Hill, in the occupation of Cox, who was there—we went through the shop into the back yard, where I saw the property in question, a quantity of new barrel, galvanised and black, and a bag containing gas fittings—Cox in Gander's presence told me he had certain charges on this barrel, and that he could not let it go till these charges were paid—I said that had nothing to do with me—Cox said he had been carting it about the day before trying to sell it for Gander and could not succeed in doing so; I thought he had a claim on it—he said his claim was some shillings—I and Gander went bask to my shop and I offered him £12, or £12 10s., or £15; I think it was £15; I cannot recollect clearly—whatever offer I made I made by arrangement with the police—Gander tried to get more, but eventually he accepted my offer—he was to have my cheque when he delivered the barrel, which he said he would do that day—it came on the evening of the following day, the 16th—I was not at home then, and saw nothing of the arrest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Gander.</hi> Cox did not tell me that the stuff belonged to Tournay—on our way to my place you said it belonged to Tournay—I had no knowledge of Tournay's son previous to your arrest; I knew of him afterwards—you did not say you would have to see Tournay before you could take what I offered; we agreed the price before we parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Chalkley</hi>. I marked on this list of the stuff these figures as the value of it, and they amount to £16 13s. 3d.—that is the price I agreed to pay, as far as my impression carries me now—he said there would be £50 or £60 worth gross—Cox had a claim for thirty shillings on it—I said I would give thirteen guineas for the whole lot and the bag of fittings, subject to measurement—that would be fair value, buying it as a job line—in the usual trade way of business they would have cost £15 13s. 3d.—before going to Cox I communicated with the police, because I had my suspicions after receiving a document of this character, which I was told in the first instance would be a proper invoice—at Cox's house there were old rags, iron, and a few things</p>

The one that will tell you all about it is in the corner; it is not mine"—he pointed to the Lord Palmerston at the corner—I took him into custody, telling him his account was not satisfactory as he was in possession of it—I asked Gander the name of the man in the corner, but he could not tell me—he took a book out of his pocket, but could not find any name in it—I went to the Lord Palmerston, where I found Chalkley and Cox—I said to Chalkley, "How do you account for the possession of the</p>

               <p>iron that you have just brought to Jubb's?"—he said, "I cannot give any account; I am here to draw the money. It is not mine; it is Tournay's. It has been in Cox's possession about a week. I had to pay him 30s. to get it, and that I had to borrow"—I told him his account was not satisfactory as he was in possession of it, and I took him into custody—I sent him away, and he did not hear what Cox said when I arrested him—at the Police-station Cox, in the prisoner's presence, produced this authority, signed Tommy, to deliver up the goods on payment of his charges. (<hi rend="italic">Chalkley here stated that he wrote this authority.</hi>)—I asked Cox where he got it from, and he said, "I got it from Grander"—I said to Gander, "Where did you get this document from?"—he said, "I got it from him," pointing to Chalkley—I said to Chalkley, "How do you account for this?"—he said, "I gave it to him"—I said, "This is signed Tournay"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is your name Tournay?—he said, "No; but I sign Tournay's name sometimes"—I said, "Did you write this document?" he said, "Yes, I admit writing that; that is my handwriting"—Gander then produced this invoice with no heading—I asked him were he got it from—he said, "I got it from Tournay"—I then went to look for Tournay, and have made inquiries, but have not found him—on searching Gander I found this envelope, addressed Mr. Thomas Tournay, Phillip Lane, and also this one addressed to Messrs. Tournay and Gander, builders, 1, Phillip Lane—I found other documents at Gander's house, 63, Shrubbery Road, West Green, which is not far from Dudley Terrace—this card, "A. J. Mann, lime, cement, and slate merchant, 2, Marlborough Road, Bedford Park," was found on Gander—on Chalkley I found this bill-heading, "Tournay and Co., decorators and contractors, 1, Dudley Terrace," and this letter, addressed to Messrs. Tournay and Gander, asking for money for goods supplied—I had a warrant for Tournay and Mann—Tournay I cannot find—I believe there is a man Tournay distinct from either of the prisoners—Mann was committed for trial, but is now at North London Sessions on some other case—Jubb communicated with me three or five days before 16th December, but we had kept observation before that, as we had information about the same matter.</p>

I served a subpoena on Cox to attend here—he was here on Tuesday, and I warned him yesterday to be here this morning—he is not here this morning—I wired to him, and got a reply this morning—prior to about 2nd or 3rd December, 1892, I instructed Henbest to watch 1, Dudley Terrace—on 16th December I was in plain clothes in Clyde Road, Tottenham, about seven p.m.—I saw a van backed up to Jubb's premises; Gander and Bevis were unloading it—Cox was there, but not with the van—in the van was a quantity of new iron gas barrel—I asked Gander what he was doing, and I pointed to the contents of the van and said, "This is all new iron piping"—he said, "It is nothing to do with Mr. I am only employed by someone else, as you might be. The one that will tell you all about it is in the corner; it is not mine"—he pointed to the Lord Palmerston at the corner—I took him into custody, telling him his account was not satisfactory as he was in possession of it—I asked Gander the name of the man in the corner, but he could not tell me—he took a book out of his pocket, but could not find any name in it—I went to the Lord Palmerston, where I found Chalkley and Cox—I said to Chalkley, "How do you account for the possession of the</p>

               <p>iron that you have just brought to Jubb's?"—he said, "I cannot give any account; I am here to draw the money. It is not mine; it is Tournay's. It has been in Cox's possession about a week. I had to pay him 30s. to get it, and that I had to borrow"—I told him his account was not satisfactory as he was in possession of it, and I took him into custody—I sent him away, and he did not hear what Cox said when I arrested him—at the Police-station Cox, in the prisoner's presence, produced this authority, signed Tournay, to deliver up the goods on payment of his charges. (<hi rend="italic">Chalkley here stated that he wrote this authority.</hi>)—I asked Cox where he got it from, and he said, "I got it from Gander"—I said to Gander, "Where did you get this document from?"—he said, "I got it from him," pointing to Chalkley—I said to Chalkley, "How do you account for this?"—he said, "I gave it to him"—I said, "This is signed Tournay"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is your name Tournay?"—he said, "No; but I sign Tournay's name sometimes"—I said, "Did you write this document?" he said, "Yes, I admit writing that; that is my handwriting"—Gander then produced this invoice with no heading—I asked him were he got it from—he said, "I got it from Tournay"—I then went to look for Tournay, and have made inquiries, but have not found him—on searching Gander I found this envelope, addressed Mr. Thomas Tournay, Phillip Lane, and also this one addressed to Messrs. Tournay and Gander, builders, 1, Phillip Lane—I found other documents at Gander's house, 63, Shrubbery Road, West Green, which is not far from Dudley Terrace—this card, "A. J. Mann, lime, cement, and slate merchant, 2, Marlborough Road, Bedford Park," was found on Gander—on Chalkley I found this bill-heading, "Tournay and Co., decorators and contractors, 1, Dudley Terrace," and this letter, addressed to Messrs. Tournay and Grander, asking for money for goods supplied—I had a warrant for Tournay and Mann—Tournay I cannot find—I believe there is a man Tournay distinct from either of the prisoners—Mann was committed for trial, but is now at North London Sessions on some other case—Jubb communicated with me three or five days before 16th December, but we had kept observation before that, as we had information about the same matter.</p>

")—a day or two after that somebody came down and looked over the premises—I spoke to him; he was there half an hour—he wrote something, and went away—I afterwards got a letter and went up to 16, Princes Street on 13th May, 1891—I saw the prisoner and. Another man behind the counter in the front office; I gave them my business card, and said I wanted to see Mr. Townend; I was told he was busy—after I had waited a minute or two a gentleman came out of the inner office, and I was told to go in, which I did, and saw a gentleman who I supposed was Mr. Townend, but I found out afterwards that his name was Leicester—the prisoner came in, and I told them I wanted £25—Leicester said, "You cannot have £25; you can have £15"—I said, "That is no use"—he said, "I cannot lend anymore, but if you like to have. £16 you can"—I said, "Very well, I will take it"—one of them gave me a paper with "Indenture" on the top of it, and read part of it to me, and told me to sign it—I signed it twice—these are my two signatures. (<hi rend="italic">This was a bill of sale for</hi> £30 <hi rend="italic">with</hi> 60 <hi rend="italic">per cent, interest, to be paid by monthly instalments, and a schedule of furniture.</hi>)—at the time I signed it I did not know it was a bill of sale, or that it recited a loan to me of £30—I do not think the £30 was read to me, and I am sure the 60 per cent, was not—Leicester gave me a sheet of paper "with a printed heading, and told me to put down every word he dictated—I did so—I naked him how to spell some of the words, and he told me—this is what I wrote. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "I understand I am paying one shilling for every pound I have this day borrowed from you, namely, £30, for which you hand me a cheque, and I am to repay the same by monthly payments of £1 10s., and I understand I am giving you a bill of sale to secure the same.—<hi rend="smallCaps">FREDK.

               <p>will give you the money for it"—I said, "Very well," and he gave me a £10 Bank of England note and five sovereins—he kept all the papers—I then left—the prisoner left just before me, and was in the outer office as I passed through—he took the document with him which I now know as the bill of sale—I heard Leicester say to him, "Take this out and have it copies"—there are two doors; one is for the general public—the prisoner went out at one door as I went out at the other—he was present when the £15 was given to me, and when I endorsed the cheque—the money was put down on the table before me and I took it up—I went back to Halstead the same night, where I was living eith my mother, and showed her the £10 note and £4 in gold; I had changed a sovereign going down—it is not true that I went to the bank with the cheque, and that I ttok it away from 15, Princes Street—it ahd gone four o'clock when I left; I lost my way in London, and then took a cab went sraight to Liverpool Street—I commenced to repay in June, asking occasionally for some days of grace, and by May, 1892, I had repaid fifteen guineas—about May 20th I received this letter: "Unless we receive your over<lb/>dur instalment by twelve o'clock to-marrow we shall at once take possession"—I wrote: "In reply to your letter I do not know what is meant; I have paid all the money; the interest was to be 7 1/2 per cent. You only lent me £15. I have only the interest to pay back"—I received no answer to that letter; but on June 16th I received this: "We beg to remind you that your instalment is over due; we beg you to send it by return of post—I then wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Enquiring how much was due.</hi>)—I received no answer to that; but on June 29th I receivd this: "We must request payment of your overdue instalment by return of post"—on June 30th I wrote this. (Com<lb/>plaining that he had received no answer to his former letters, and refusing to send more money.)—there was no answer to that—on August 11th I received this: "Unless we received yoour instalment by return of post we shall at once take possession"—on 16th August my goods were seized, and I then learned for the first time that the document I had signed on May 13th was a bill of sale—I consulted Mr. Jones of Colchester, and under his advice files a petition in bankreuptcy in August 19th, returning a statemnt of affairs showing my liabilities, which amounted to £62 0s. 9d., including Mr, Townend's claim, £36 15s., as being still due—the Official Receiver became the receiver in my bankruptcy—an application was made to set the bill of sale aside—I swore an affidavit on August 31st—the first hearing was fixed for September 9th, in answe to my affidavit—what I swore was true.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only paid one visit to the premises in London, and only saw Upton once—I never saw Leicester again—I learnt that he had absconded—there is a warrant out for him—all the conversation I had was with him—he told me I should have to pay 7 1/2 per cent. interest—my affidavit says: "He called a man, presumably a clerk, from the other room, who read to me what I understood was a note of hand"—I nver used those words; the affidavit was prepared by my solicitor—I belive it was the prisoner who read it—the one who came into the room read; the list of furniture was not read—when I signed this it was blank sheet of paper—I asked no question at all about the document—</p>

               <p>I listened to every part of it—I cannot recollect whether, £30 was mentioned in it—I thought the document which was read over was a note of hand—I said nothing about it to Leicester—I do not recollect saying, "I knew it was a cheque when I endorsed it; I knew what the amount of it was when he gave me the £15"—I had never seen a cheque before—the man told me that the bank was closed, but I did not care so long as I got the money—it was after I signed the bill of sale that I signed my name on the cheque—I do not know in what order the things were done—Upton was in the room all the time the business was done; he was called from the outer office directly I said what my business was—I am almost sure he was there when I accepted the offer—whatever story I first told to Mr. Jones was the right story—I brought an action against Mr. Townend, but got nothing out of it—Mr. Jones said it was settled in my favour—I have no idea for how much—all the money I parted with on the bill of sale was £15—it has been set aside, and my mother and I brought an action for trespass, and costs incurred by Mr. Jones—I have not got my discharge yet—I do not know whether the money was given to the trustees in bankruptcy—my liabilities were for goods sold and delivered to me—although I never saw a cheque I can read and write—when I wrote, "I understand I am paying 1s. for every £1 I have this day borrowed from you, viz., £30,"I did not understand it—I wrote the words, "Bill of sale, "but I did not understand it—it was given out to me word for word, and I did not notice that I wrote "Bill of sale,"I was so confused—I am sure Upton was in the room when I signed the cheque, although I said before the Magistrate, "To the best of my belief defendant was in the room when I signed the cheque; I can't swear positively"—he took the document I had signed out of the room with him—I put the money in my trousers pocket when I got into the street—as I went out Upton was behind the counter with a young clerk.</p>

I live at Shiplake House, Henley-on-Thames—I am a spinster—in January, 1889, I saw an advertisement in one of the newspapers with reference to an invention for the saving of coal in steamships—I did not keep the advertisement—it stated that the invention would produce at the rate of about £1,000 a day—I wrote for particulars, and received this letter of 11th February, 1889. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated from</hi> 115, <hi rend="italic">Great Titchfield Street West, and was signed C. Wells, C. E.

Few and Co.—up to then I had taken no advice from anyone—I had never seen the prisoner—until my solicitors had made enquiries I believed there was a genuine French Company; I did not believe I was a partner in it. (<hi rend="italic">Other letters from the prisoner to the witness were read</hi>) I never received a farthing—all the £18,860 that I parted with was lot—when I got his letters describing the kind of business he was carrying on, and the different departments, I believed it was a genuine description of his business—I was more than once assured that he was Dot dealing with any other person than myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Hughes and Gleddon, solicitors, of 40, Gracechurch Street—on 4th August, 1892, Mr. Trench consulted me; he came to my office with the prisoner—he asked me to advise my client to advance him a sum of £2,500—he said that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> client was a member of an. unlimited company, registered in Paris; that the company was in difficulties, and that there were bills out to the extent of £50,000—he asserted that my client was liable, and that he would free him from all responsibility as managing director of the company if Mr. Trench would pay him the sum of £2,500—he said there were no books of the company at present, and therefore nobody knew who the shareholders were, or the amount of their holdings—he suggested that Mr. Trench should give up the shares he held, and upon which his name was written, and accept in exchange some further shares, which were to be allotted to Mr. Wells simply as security for the £2,500—that was the conversation on that day—next day I saw him again—I then told him that Mr. Trench would not let him have the money; that I did not see his liability—I asked the defendant how he made him liable in England—he said that he (Wells) had a London office in Great Portland Street—I requested the defendant to put any proposition he had to make in writing—on the Saturday morning, 6th August, he brought me a document embodying his terms—he said he was going to Paris to enter the Hon. Mr. Trench's name as a share holder of this unlimited company, and I think he said as partner—I made some inquiries at the Patent Office in London—I also received from Mr. Trench a document, in consequence of which I went to Paris on 8th August—while there I went to 16, Rue de Surenne, also to the Rue de Surenne—I did not find an office of a company there—I also went to the Hotel du Commerce and saw the prisoner there—I asked him where the meeting was held of which he had given notice to Mr. Trench, who attended it, and what was done—he declined to tell me—I said the whole thing was a fraud, that the patent was invalid, and I had the proof—I showed him this certificate of abandonment, that is, that the application had been abandoned—I said I had been to the Rue de Surenne and could find no office, and from inquiries I could find no exist ing company—he said I did not come in time for the meeting—I said the whole thing was a swindle and fraud—there was a somewhat heated argument—he said he would have me thrown out of his hotel—I then left—I did not see him again until this prosecution began—I believe there was some correspondence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in holy orders at Ross, Herefordshire—in July last I saw an advertisement in the daily papers—I answered it and got this reply, dated 8th July, from 154, Great Portland Street (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Wells</hi>) <hi rend="italic">was seeking an investor with</hi> £1,500 <hi rend="italic">to join him in carrying out an invention which would result in large profits</hi>)—I replied to that letter, and on 11th July I received this letter; another on the 12th, and then these two agreements—I signed one and returned it—on the 15th July I drew a cheque for £750 and sent it to the defendant—on the 28th July I got this receipt—I had a difficulty in obtaining it—on the 28th of July I got this letter, enclosing the certificate from the Patent Office, and stating that all was progressing well—on 3rd August I went to Great Portland Street, and there saw the defendant—briefly, I may say, that the prospects of the proposed invention were discussed between us—I was not shown any models there as being models of the invention—I knew nothing specially of engines and models—the invention was to be placed on a steam-boat lying first at Liverpool and then at Plymouth—he said that he had given up work on the premises, and was applying all his energies to the invention—he suggested that I should put further money to promote the success of the invention—he said further money was to be used chiefly for machinery, and also for some slight expenses; for promoting the company—it was to be promoted in Paris; that was to be its headquarters—on 5th August I drew a further cheque for £750, and sent it to him, and on the 6th I got this receipt—on the 10th August I got this letter from Great Portland Street about an agreement, and on 24th August I got this enclosing this agreement, No. 1,354—on 12th September, 1892, I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed</hi> £3,000 <hi rend="italic">in shares, arid stated that cash payment would take place at the end of the month, when the shares would soon double or treble their value</hi>.)—on the 17th September I got this letter enclosing 7,000 shares, for which I sent a receipt—on the 29th September I returned to the prisoner, through his manager, the shares he sent me—I afterwards wrote a letter, registered to an address in the Rue de Londres, Paris; that came back through the Dead Letter Office—I did not see the defendant after that, he wrote me letters—I got no part of my money back—I parted with my money believing the defendant to be an honest inventor needing help—I supposed there might be some profits from the invention, certainly no such profits as he alleged—I believed that there was such an invention, and that there might be profits from it; I believed that there was a company as mentioned in the letters, and that the defendant was promoting it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My object was partly to assist him, and partly to invest the money profitably—I believed the representations made by him—I did not make any inquiries about him, not in time—I began to make inquiries about the beginning of September, I think; that was after my money was paid away—I believed his representations that he had invented something that would be valuable, resulting in future profits—he gave me an impression at the interview I had with him that he was a man experienced in these matters—I had some reason to think so from the general appearance of the premises, and so on—I simply believed the representations he made regarding the invention—</p>

Hill Wells, C. E., naval architect," and some envelopes with "C. Wells, C. E.," printed; envelopes with "Novelty Company, Great Titchfield Street," printed; and also envelopes addressed to "Harvess Security, Piccadilly, at the office of Willing "; and envelopes addressed to Wells, at the Casino, Monte Carlo"; also some Casino admission tickets, and writing-paper with "Wells, Phillimore," and "Wells, Phillimore, and Trench and Co.," printed on the top.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Southampton Street, Fitzroy Square—I am a mechanical engineer—I was five years employed in engineering business in Bolsover Street—the name of the firm was Knoekongner—I met the prisoner there—he had done engineering work for Knoekongner over and over again—I first met him at the beginning of 1887, I believe—I did engineering work for him, for machinery; my governor called it patent machinery; I cannot tell you nearer than that—I made parts of machinery there—there were other workmen at the same time, doing other work—in the time I was employed there, last year, I did perhaps three or four works—that I did for Mr. Wells in the shop; they were bearings and shaftings and cranks—at the end of 1887 I met Wells in the street, and he asked me if I should like to start for myself—I asked, "Under what conditions?"—he said he would make arrangements, You can have three months' start," and if I suited him for doing his work he would keep on giving me more work—so we made arrange ments and I started for myself the next Saturday—he asked me what pay I got in the other place—I told him two guineas for 51/2 hours—but I could not do it for the same money—so he said, "I will give you fifty-two shillings for the time, amounting to 14d. an hour"—I have been an engineer since I was fourteen years of age; I am now thirty-six—I worked for Wells at 142, Great Titchfield Street—I remained in his employment up to November last year—I used to make all sorts of models—he always gave me plans to make his models—as far as I know he used to draw the plans himself—I was not constantly employed in making models, because I had my own work to do for customers, but the most work I did for him—I could not tell how many models I made in the course of the three years—I am referring to a book I keep little accounts in, beginning at the end of 1887, when I started business for myself—I made models during 1888 and 1889—I cannot tell you what models—I can tell pretty well all I did, but not at what time—I made machinery which was to use less steam; I believe that was after 1890, but I could not mention any date—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a drawing</hi>) I made that machine, Mr. Wells made the drawing for it—it was a steam engine; this is not complete, there were two more cylinders on the top—the machine was not ready for work, I never saw it at work—as much as I know, it was for saving steam—he explained it to me—it was all complete, but I never saw it used—I do not know the machine that was made for Miss Phillimore—I made the machine before I saw Miss Phillimore—she came to 154, Great Portland Street, and asked for Mr. Wells, and went away again; he was not there—according to Mr. Wells's explanation, the invention must be valuable; it must work, it cannot do otherwise—I have never seen it since—I never heard of a machine like it since—I did not tell anybody how it was made except my workmen in the shop, who saw it—it was a lot of trouble to do this work—I had to polish everything perfect—I had many drawings from the prisoner for another machine; I had, perhaps, six, eight, or twelve; that was a small machine; I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, of 81, St. Thomas Road., Victoria Park—I am agent for a life assurance company,—I was employed by Messrs. Bayliss and Pearce in obtaining evidence on the Stepney election petition, after the election was over—I had seen Simons several times before the 22nd November—I have known Mr. Bloomfield some years—I believe I first spoke to him about this case on 22nd November—I met him as he was leaving his house, 68, Grove Road—I spoke to him and we walked together to Coborn Road Railway-station—I said, "I did not know you were such a great politician, Mr. Bloomfield;" he said, "I never bother with such matters"—I said, "Did not you vote at the last election; did not Mr. Green fetch you, and did not he wait some time outside your</p>

               <p>house for you?" he said, "Yes, he did"—I said, "There is plenty of money rolling about, I learnt that from the person who was with Mr. Green all day, he told me all about it, "I did not mention his name—he said, "Yes, undoubtedly, I suppose it was six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. "While we were waiting for the train, he said, "When a person aspires to such a position, I suppose he must pay for it, otherwise he can't get it"—When we got near the Bank, I said, "The person who was with Mr. Green told me that as you were getting near the People's Palace, Mr. Green gave you half-a-sovereign; "he nodded his head, and said, "Yes, it is quite right"—we shook hands and parted; that was all that took place—I saw him again two days later, November 24th, on the same platform; he spoke of various matters till he left the train at Bishopsgate, and as we were passing Worship Street I said, "I believe there is a petition coming off in Finsbury;" he said, "I know nothing of that, I know that they are trying to unseat Isaacson at Stepney"—I said, "Do you think they will succeed in doing so?" he said, "They will while people hold their tongues"—I again spoke to him about the person who gave me the information; he said, "You must be very careful"—I said, "The person with Mr. Green told me all about his experience that day;" he said, "You had better be careful, because it must leak out eventually if known to another person"—I said, "I am positive, I am certain he will not speak of the matter to anyone else, as he told me in strict confidence"—I believe he said, "No man would admit having received money, as it places him in a very awk ward position"—I had said, "Would you admit having received a half-sovereign for your vote?"—he said, "No, I shall deny it"—I think he said, "If the person says that I have, I shall call him a liar, and you may tell him so"—that was the second interview—the third interview was on the day he was served with his subpoena, I believe that was December 2nd at the same railway-station—I travel to and fro by that line sometimes—we had the conversation on the platform and in the carriage—on the platform he seemed terribly annoyed at having received the subpoena—he told me he had received it—I saw him served, a man named Murphy served him with it, and then went away—I remained on the platform till the train came in and then we travelled together; he then said, "I understand it all now and you will hear more of this matter, Cohen, I shall not let the matter drop"—he was very much excited and appeared to be speaking to himself, and then he said, "Is it right that you should hear from both sides?"—I said, "Do you mean subpoened?" he said, "Yes"—I believe I told him that he could draw expenses from both sides—he said, "It is a shame for a man in my position to be served so; it is worth. £50 to get clear of this"—and he mentioned half-a-sovereign—At the end of the day I wrote down what had taken place and handed the statement to Messrs. Bayliss and Pearce—these are my original notes of 24th November and 2nd December, which I forwarded to them—he said, "All this trouble is about a paltry half-sovereign, but the matter shall not drop here, you will hear more of this"—he also said he was a man of 30 years reputation in business and it was a shame for him to be brought into it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an impress of my writing—I wrote the notes and made this press copy of the notes of 22nd and 24th—I was at the Law Courts before the election Judges, but was not called as a witness.</p>

               <p>some three or four days without a subpoena—I was employed to get up evidence on behalf of the petitioners: that is a correct description—I was paid by the solicitors—I was employed in October I think—I had known Mr. Bloomfield many years before the 22nd, I had never spoken to him before, but he knew me from my early childhood—I had been in communication with the prisoner before I spoke to Mr. Bloomfield—I had been some six weeks employed by the solicitors to get up evidence for the petitioners—I knew on 22nd December that Mr. Bloomfield's name had been scheduled in the particulars, as receiving a bribe, and that there was a charge to be made against him on the hearing of the petition—I did not know that before I spoke to him—I cannot answer whether I knew on 22nd December that he was to be charged with having received a bribe—on the 22nd when I spoke to him you wish to know whether I was aware that that was one of the charges—well, as I took it at the time, if I could extract something from him, if I learnt something from him, that would make a charge—I met him outside his house, I was going to the station—I went down for the purpose of meeting him because I knew he left his house about 9 a.m.—I went in the hope of meeting him; I waited just a few minutes, two minutes; that was my first conversation with him, walking to the station, then on the platform, nothing was said about the election in the train—it took us four or five minutes to walk to the train from where I met him, and twenty or twenty-five minutes to get to the Bank of England—I say on my oath that during that twenty-five minutes he confessed to me that he had been guilty of receiving a bribe—he has known me all his life—I have known Simons six or eight months—I was with him a good deal in October while I was getting up evidence, also in November and in December down to the hearing of the petition—I am sure he said he would not speak to anyone, because he spoke to me in strict confidence—on 22nd November I sent to Mr. Pearce a full report of my alleged conversation with Mr. Bloomfield that day—I do not think I knew on 24th November that the prisoner had given information to Mr. Pearce against Mr. Bloomfield, I don't think he had personally, and I do not know whether he had communicated with any of Mr. Pearce's firm, the particulars are dated in November, 1892—I do not know that this very serious charge is set out in them in detail—I cannot account for it, unless Simons had given the information.—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he said that person would not speak about it as he had spoken to you in confidence, did you know that you had betrayed the confidence reposed in you; did you lie to him?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know whether it is a question of lying—I scarcely know what to say—I am not aware that I was speaking falsely when I said that on the second occasion, on the 24th, I was going to the City and he called to me on the platform—I believe I was there for the purpose of seeing him and to get into conversation with him if I could and to get further admissions from him if he would tell me anything—I do not see how it was possible to improve his confession that he had received 10s., but I thought he might tell me something else—it made no difference to me which way I went to the station—I say that in the face of the Jury—I went there for the purpose of seeing him-r-on the second occasion I said, "Would you admit having received a half-sovereign?"—he said, "No, I shall deny it," and I put into his mouth, "If any person says I received one I shall call him a liar"—on the third occasion I happened to be on</p>

               <p>the platform about the time Mr. Bloomfield was going—I knew he would be going, and after I had spoken to him, Murphy served him with a subpoena—Murphy knew from me what train I travelled by, I told him I saw Mr. Bloomfield occasionally—I did not arrange with him that I was to go and speak to a person—I did not know Murphy was going to the station that morning, but I knew he had to serve the subpoena—I say now that I did not know Murphy was going to the station; I did not swear a minute ago that I did—I swear that Bloomfield said, "It is worth £50 to me to get clear of it"—I did not tell him I had already sent in two reports against him and was going to send in a third—I talked as if I was friendly towards him and anxious to preserve his confidence, and he turned on me on the third occasion and said that I should hear more of it, and he would not let the matter drop; I made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I do not believe I have used the words "get up evidence," I meant arriving at the truth—I believe other persons were making in quiries on behalf of the petitioner besides me; Murphy was employed in that capacity—Bloomfield did not know that I was acting on the part of the petitioner, it was no part of my duty to tell him that or he would never tell me anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Court.</hi> I went to Bayliss and Pearce because they sent me a letter asking me to call and see them—I did not know them before—I think that was early in October—they knew of my existence because Mr. Samuel Montague, the member for Whitechapel, communicated with them—he sent me a letter telling me so—I have never acted for him in elections, only in registration work, and he always found me most reliable—there is one house between 68, Grove Road and Coborn Road station, it is almost next door, but there is a very long passage, not a sub-way—we travelled 3rd class, and it was very full—I then walked with him from Liverpool Street Station to the Bank of England—we first spoke in the long pas<lb/>sage going to the platform, which is above a quarter of a mile long, but it was on the platform he said, "They are trying very hard to unseat Isaacson" and "I suppose a person must pay for it if he wants to get it"—nothing was said in the train—I then joined him again, and went to the Bank of England, and he said, "The person with Mr. Green tells me that as you were getting near the People's Palace he gave you half-a-sovereign"—I asked him whether he had a vote; he said, "Yes, I voted for Stepney Green"—I then wished him good morning and parted from him.</p>

Kopelewitz gave me no paper to sign before he gave me this one; he did not give me a bluish paper to sign; I did not tear it up—Kopelewitz did not then go into the parlour and write out another paper and come back with it and give it to me to sign—it was raining just a little on the evening of the 15th, not much—I had no cape, only an umbrella—no one led me from Bishopsgate Station to the cabman, who was by the Eastern Hotel—I did not have Kopelewitz arrested for stealing my pin and money on my way to the station because I saw no one, and I was too ill to do anything—he took me into a public-house; there were people there—when I entered the railway carriage I did not shake hands with Kopelewitz and tell him not to forget what he had promised; I said nothing, I could not speak, I was too much upset—he said to me, "I will send you my address"—I made no answer—he was to send his address that I might know where he lived; I did not know the address—he said, "I will let you know my address, and then you will know where to write to me, because I want £5"—I stated that at the Police-court—I said nothing in answer to him—he sent me a post-card to the same effect—I did not say to him, when he said "I shall want £5 of you," "You shall not have £5 and you have robbed me of a pin and my money"; I made no accusation against him—on the way to Kensington I and Mrs. Kopelewitz did not enter a public-house in Hanbury Street, I am sure—I did not then leave her outside the public-house, go home and come back to her—Kopelewitz did not slap my face when he found me in bed with his wife—I did not have Kopelewitz arrested in the public-house in Broad Street because I gave it to my solicitor to do it—I never had my trousers off—I did not tell Kopelewitz "I have got everything except the key of my safe"—I asked Kopelewitz to walk back with me to the station because I was too ill to walk by myself—and I took a cab at Bishopsgate because I could not walk—I don't remember if there was a fender in the bedroom—I think it was an iron poker Kopelewitz had in his hand—I did not know you at all—I did not see you in Brick Lane before the Jewish holidays and ask you to give me Kopelewitz's address at Blyth Road—Kopelewitz's office-boy did not write down the address because you could not write proper English; I do not know the boy—there were no apples and nuts on the table, only the ale and a lamp—when Kopelewitiz struck me I attempted to hollao and I did it the best I could, but I was helpless—at the Police-court my beard was as it is now as nearly as possible.</p>

Between six and seven, when they were at tea, Freedman came and asked for Kopelewitz. After conversation between Freedman and Mr. and Mrs. Kopelewitz the writer went into the parlour and saw Kopelewitz writing on white paper; two or three blue papers were lying near. When Kopelewitz had finished writing he, Freedman, and the writer signed it, and Mrs. Kopele witz made her mark, and Freedman left. Kopelewitz afterwards told the writer that Freedman had called to say that he could not meet the bills, but would pay £5 in a week and the remainder in three weeks, and he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Kopelewitz</hi>) <hi rend="italic">had got the writer's signature to the document in case he did not pay. There was also another letter beginning "My dear parents," and asking for money, as he was without any, and stating that if the verdict went against Kopelewitz he would be unable to pay for his journey, but that if they sent him his fare he should not wait for the verdict, but should start at once; that he had been told he need not fear imprisonment, though Kopelewitz would be liable to a few months</hi>).</p>

Wright and Co., for £197 2s. 5d.—I do not know the handwriting—the drawer's name is not in my writing, nor that of any member of the firm—I know the writing of all of them—it was not authorised by me, and I know nothing about it—I have drawn many bills on Hobbs and seen many acceptances by him—I should say that was Hobbs' signature—at the date covered by the bill no such sum as. £197 2s. 5d. was owing by Hobbs to our firm—there is no record of any such amount in our bill-books, or at all.</p>

               <p>Stewart, in the liquidation of J. W. Hobbs and Co., Limited, which was wound up in September, 1892—I married Hobbs' cousin, and in 1891 he married my sister—from November, 1877 to the time of the formation of Hobbs and Co., Limited, in April, 1885, I was clerk to Hobbs, and in October, 1885, I became secretary to Hobbs and Co., Limited, and so continued up to May, 1892—Hobbs was a builder and contractor at Queen's Buildings, Southwark—in 1883 the Liberator Building Society was in the habit of making advances to Hobbs for the purposes of his business—we used to draw up a list of requirements for. the coming week—the total of the acceptances coming due would be shown on that—this is the estimate for 15th March, 1884 (<hi rend="italic">This gave the totals of acceptances falling due on various days during the week; interest; deficit last week; wages; cheques; anticipated receipts; and special account</hi>)—that is the. form in which they were sent in—anticipated receipts are what were expected during the week—the receipts and requirements were usually about the same; in this case there is a balance of £78—these estimates would be sent in to the Liberator for the purpose of showing what money we wanted for the following week—by this estimate we should want £3,698 for the following week, and our proposal was they should advance the money to Hobbs on the security of these anticipated receipts—the acceptances are supposed to be falling due, which Hobbs would have to meet during that week—on the estimate being sent in the Liberator was in the habit of advancing part of the amount, because some of it was coming from another Company—of the £3,698 12s. 5d. the Liberator would pay about all of the items except those against "Ilford" in, the receipts, about £350—money on that property was being advanced by the House and Lands Investment Trust—the properties named in the anticipated receipts are building estates on which building was going on, and the Liberator had charges on them, with the exception of the Ilford estate, on which the House and Lands Investment Trust had a charge—having sent in that estimate Hobbs would receive one or more cheques in the ordinary course from the Liberator during the week—the following week, after the amount had been advanced, a weekly return was sent to the Liberator to show how the money had been expended; this is the return for the week beginning 15th March; it shows the money actually expended in the ordinary course; the acceptances themselves would be also sent in to the Liberator as vouchers for the payments which had been made; I think they would be sent at the same time as the return—this letter of 14th March, 1884, is in my writing, and is addressed to Mr. Brock, who was either secretary or a director of the Liberator at that time (<hi rend="italic">This letter enclosed a schedule, and stated that after next week there would be a very material reduction commencing in the amount of the bills maturing: that the paid bills would be returned from the bank next day, and would be sent over together with the acceptances for the special sum next week, as Mr. Hobbs had not yet arrived</hi>)—the cheques sent to me were all payable to Hobbs; in the ordinary course they would be paid into his bank, the London and South-Western, Upper Norwood—the cheques were all drawn by the Liberator in favour of Hobbs as advances for the total amount—they would be drawn for the aggregate amount required that week—we should get a lump sum by way of advance, and that would be paid in to Hobbs' bank—I knew Wright as solicitor to the Liberator, and also as financial director or manager of the Liberator at that time—all the cheques I received drawn by the Liberator for advances were signed</p>

               <p>by him—I think he was both solicitor and financial manager—the cheques were signed by him as solicitor and also by a director—usually I applied for them at the office of Bonner, Wright and Co., Adelaide Buildings, London Bridge—I got the cheques there—it was the practice of the Liberator that all these cheques should be sent to the solicitor and handed out by him—I believe that was for the purpose of the solicitor preparing any necessary charge as security for the advance—I knew Hobbs had given to the Liberator a charge or charges upon different estates—as chief clerk with Hobbs I became aware that he owed money to Wright on a private account, apart from the Liberator—that indebtedness was entered in Hobbs' general ledger—I became aware from that book of that debt in 1877, when I first entered the service—I do not know what has become of the book in which those sums were entered; it was in Hobbs' office some time before the Company was formed—I know I saw it in 1884—since these proceedings commenced I have searched for it, along with a lot of old books, and I cannot find it—I began to search about December last—I continued as Hobbs' clerk until the liquidation, but I did not continue as chief clerk—I then gave up that post to a man named Roberts—I ceased to be chief clerk in June, 1884—the book was laid in the office with the other books, and I left it there—Roberts was appointed in my place—In November, 1883, Hobbs owed Wright between £3,000 and £4,000—Wright was pressing for payment—Hobbs' financial position at that time was the same as it had been for some time before—it was always a difficulty to get enough money to pay the requirements—about that date I heard an arrangement made between Wright and Hobbs for the purpose of paying this money, at Hobbs' office in Queen's Buildings it was early in November or the latter part of October, 1883—I cannot remember the exact words, but the arrangement was that the amount should be paid by bills, but that those bills should bear the names of merchants, and not Mr. Wright's own—they were to be drawn in the names of merchants, and then they were to be handed to Mr. Wright, so that when they fell due he could get the money—I don't remember hearing where he was to get the money from—the total amount for which these bills were to be drawn was about £2,250—they were to be drawn upon Hobbs—on the same day I had instructions to draw the bills; I believe Wright instructed me to do so, but there had been previous talk between the three of us as to the months that they should be divided over, and the dates at which they should be made payable—when I was asked to draw the bills I asked Wright if it was not a wrong sort of thing to do—he replied, "Oh no, they are not going to be negotiated at all"—I said, "Well, of course there is no responsibility resting on me"—I think the next evening after Wright had gone I said to Hobbs that I objected, I thought it was a wrong thing to do, the drawing of these bills in such a manner, to which he replied, "What am I to do, he will have his money, and he will have to find it"—I think I had already drawn the bills when I spoke to Hobbs; I had drawn them that day, they were eight or ten, I am not quite positive—I had filled up the bills—I believe I drew them before he said, "What am I to do," but after the conversation with Wright—this list of bills was made out at the time I was speaking with Wright—I believe it is a complete list of all the bills, and is in my handwriting; I drew the bills for amounts which are specified on this list—I believe some of the figures were crossed out</p>

               <p>afterwards, as they became due, or as they were paid—when I filled in the bills I put no drawer's name, but I got them accepted by Hobbs; he accepted them all at one time, and that was at the time that he made the observation I have told.</p>

Shirley, £166 9s."—that is a complete list of bills which were filled up and accepted; at that time they were all without drawer's names, all perfect except that—that list was made about the end of October, 1883, on the same day as the interview I have spoken of—it does not represent the dates of the bills, but the dates they were falling due—at the same interview reference was made to the bill-book, to see what acceptances were coming due in the months mentioned here up to the end of March, 188, and it was then settled as to which month should be entered and the amount that was to be drawn—the amounts appearing in the bill-book were entered on this list in pencil; all the pencil figures represent the amount of the acceptances falling due as appears by the bill-book: I entered them in the presence of both Hobbs and Wright—the ink figures are the same amounts plus the additional amounts that were agreed to be drawn in those bills—this £2,25 Q. is the amount that was wanted to be added to the genuine bills—the entry is 29 in red ink and 250 in black ink and 659 in pencil, and there are two lines where there is 7,050 above it—the 29 in red ink was written I should say: the 29 the last of all would be the date of the month when it would be most convenient to add the extra amount—250 represents the amount to be added the 1st October—£6,869 represents the amount of bills legitimately falling due according to the bill-book in October, and the two lines that are struck through the £6,869 in pencil and over the 7,050 means the amount by which the bills were to be altered in some way or other before October—in each case the next amount is added on and carried out—these are the items in the bill-book—the total at the bottom, 2,250, is the total amount which was agreed to be added on—this "Stock in dock and yards, £12,000" was stated to be the value of the stock of timber in the dock and also in the yard at Croydon, supplied by Hobbs; these amounts of £500, £500, and so on, were arranged partly with Mr. Wright, with the three of us really—these ink figures on the list are Mr. Wright's writing—having got the bills representing the £2,250 accepted, I took them to Mr. Wright's office the next day I think, and he asked me how they were to be signed, whose names—the drawer was a blank; I showed him the list on the front again, and told him the F 2</p>

               <p>names, and he thereupon signed them in my presence, and I left them with him—they had been accepted the day before—these figures 2,251 on the back of this list are mine, and I believe they are the exact total of the bills mentioned—there were two other bills of that character drawn besides these nine; that was done about two or three weeks afterwards I believe; they were drawn in the same way and filled up by me and accepted by Hobbs—the drawer's name is Key and Son, the same as one of these on the list I wrote "Key and Son"—I do not remember distinctly how that came about, I believe Mr. Wright told me he wanted another £250, would I get him another bill, and I did so—it was drawn in two bills, one for £200 and the other for £45 7s. 6d.—these bills are six bills out of the eleven I have spoken of—they are all signed by Wright—this one for £197 2s. 5d. of October 17th was signed by Wright in my presence—I left the bills with Wright—the list I kept—after that date the estimates were sent in week by week to the Liberator for advances; they were usually made out by myself, in consultation with Mr. Hobbs—the amount of the acceptances falling due was inserted in each estimate—that amount included the bills I have spoken of—from that time up to the end of March, 1884, I received cheques from week to week either from the Liberator or the Lands Allotment Co.—the amount was usually a little less than the estimate; that was because they would not give any more—I am not sure that there were any advances from the Lands Allotment Co. prior to 1884—they may have been all from the Liberator, I am not positive—these eleven bills were not entered in the bill-book—they were entered in the office diary—all bills which were accepted were entered according to the dates they were due, genuine trade bills as well as others—I arrived at the total amount of the acceptances in the estimate from the diary—some time in 1883 I was instructed by Hobbs to make a copy of his bill-book, which I took over to the office of the Liberator at 20, Budge Row—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is that copy—I believe that was started just a little before the arrangement about the eleven bills—I can't remember what was said about it, but I know both Wright and Hobbs wanted it—the Liberator wanted it as a sort of check on the account—as long as I had charge of the books I think I used to take over a rough list and enter it up at the office of the Liberator—I believe all the eleven bills are entered in the copy bill-book—I think they were all entered in my handwriting, but I will not be sure without reference—yes, they are, according to this memorandum—Bill No. 2421 is Hoare and Brown, £256 17s. 7d.—that is in my writing and is one of the eleven bills—2476 is Collinge and Walks, £237 16s. lid.—that is my writing—2477 is Mickle-thwaite, £263 5s.—2513 is Hoare and Brown, £493 2s. 5d.—1552 is Key and Son, £285 18s. Id.—2553 is Rocheford, Mount, and Dell, £214—2616 is G. Wright and Co., £197 2s. 5d.—2617 is Bradford and Co., £136 8s. 7d.—2618 is J. E. Shirley, £166 9s.—2714 is Key and Son, £245 7s. 2d.—that includes two bills, but the entry is not my writing but Mr. Brock's, who at that time was secretary to the Liberator—I know it was two bills, from the bills themselves—they were drawn two or three weeks later, in the name of Key and Son, of which I filled up the name—there is a third acceptance of Key and Son, which was drawn by Wright; I only filled up two—Mr. Brock entered those last two in the copy bill-book, because the bill-book would be in the office of the Liberator, and after I had made a copy of the bill-book as it then stood, I believe nearly all subsequent bills were entered by Mr. Brock, not by myself, from</p>

               <p>information I should supply from time to time as to bills falling due—this is the original book I left with the Liberator—this is a letter of 2nd November, 1883, to the Liberator, enclosing this estimate for the week and the weekly return for the previous week from me as clerk to Hobbs, signed <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> Hobbs, George C. Kentish, and addressed to Brock the secretary—that is the ordinary form in which those estimates and weekly returns were sent in—this is the estimate for the week commencing 8th December, 1883; the total of the acceptances falling due is carried out at £2,082 5s. 5d., and includes Collinge and Wallis's bill for £237 10s. 11d.—there are cheques of 8th December, 1883, for £1,000 drawn by the Liberator in Hobbs's favour, and signed by J. Spencer Balfour, director, and H. G. Wright, solicitor; of 11th December, 1883, for £600 in the same way; of 13th December, for £513; and of 14th December for £431 1s. 6d.—all those were paid by the Liberator to Hobbs as advances for that week beginning the 8th—in the weekly return for that week beginning the 8th I see "Acceptances as per estimate, £2,082 5s. 5d."—in the estimate for the week commencing 22nd December the total of acceptances is £759 14s. 3d.—that includes Micklethwaite's bill falling due on 22nd December—these are cheques of 22nd December, 1883, for £600 drawn by the Liberator to Hobbs and endorsed by Hobbs personally (sometimes I endorsed them in his name), and of 24th December for £693 10s.—both these cheques are signed by Wright, as solicitor to the Liberator—this is a letter of 21st December, 1883, from Wright to me: "There is another bill due to-morrow, which I enclose; please let me have cheque for this, G. W."—that refers to Micklethwaite's bill for £263 5s.—I have no doubt he enclosed it in the letter, he says he did—I sent Hobbs's cheque for it on the London and South-Western Bank, Upper Norwood, for the exact amount, I believe—cheques had been sent from Hobbs to Wright for Hoare and Brown's, bill for £256 17s. 7d., maturing on 1st November, 1883, and for Collinge and Wallis's bill for £237 16s. 11d., maturing on 9th December—for the first few, cheques for the exact amounts were drawn, but after a little while it was found inconvenient to pay the amount of the bill, and Wright received some acceptances of another company in place of cheques, and cheques also, but bearing amounts on account, such as it was convenient to draw from the bank—the trade bills, which were sometimes given by Hobbs to Wright instead of cheques, had come to Hobbs in the ordinary course as payments—this estimate for the week beginning 19th January, 1884, shows a total of acceptances £2,089 10s. 4d., including Hoare and Brown's bill for £493 2s. 5d., falling due on 19th January—these are cheques of 19th January, 1884, for £1,000 drawn by the Liberator to Hobbs; of 22nd January, 1884, for £750; of 24th January for £2,736 5s. and of 25th January for £5 6s. 8d.—the total is in excess of the estimate in this return for the same week, the acceptances are entered at the same figure as they were in the estimate—this is a letter from Wright to me, of 18th January, 1884," Dear Mr. Kentish, I enclose bill for £493 2s. 5d., will you please let me have a cheque for it."—that refers to Hoare and Brown's bill for £493 2s. 5d.—this is a letter of 22nd January, 1884, from Wright to me, referring to the same bill: "I am waiting the cheque for £493 odd, in respect of the bill, which you promised Saturday or Monday"—this is the estimate for the week beginning 31st January; the total of acceptances is £1,459 4s. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including</p>

               <p>Key and Son's bill for £285 18s. 1d., falling due February 4th—these are cheques of 1st February, 1884, for 6s. 8d. (I expect that is the balance of some previous week), and of 4th February for. £299 from the Liberator to Hobbs—the weekly return for that week shows the same amount of acceptances—for the week commencing 15th March, 1884, the total of acceptances is £1,525 17s. 1d., including the bill of Rochford Mount, and Dell for £214 due 18th March—I altered the date of the bill, I believe, to more equalise the amount of the bills; I have no recollection of the alteration—on the list it appears as falling due in February—I think in the copy-bill book it appears as 15th March—the whole of the writing is Mr. Brock's—the bill originally stood due in February, and it has been altered to March—in the diary it is entered original as due on 18th March; my impression is that I entered it here as due in March by mistake; instead of entering it as due in February, I entered it as due in March, and when I got the bill back from Wright, I must have then made the alteration of the date in the bill itself in red ink, so that it should look like a bill that was due about that time when they were submitted to the Liberator—I am satisfied it was included in the 15th March estimate, by adding up the amount of the bills which would appear by the bill-book—these are the cheques for the week beginning 15th March, on 17th March,. £895 10s., and on 21st March, £367 7s. 8d.—the return for the week shows the same amount of acceptances—this is the letter from Wright to me of 28th February, 1884: "There was a bill for. £214 drawn on 15th October, 1883, and due on 18th February; will you let me have a cheque for this, or a Brickfield bill. I must press you for those old bills; you really give me a great deal of trouble as to this"—that refers to Rochford, Mount, and Dell's bill for, £214, and the passage, "I must press you for those old bills," means that after these particular bills had been submitted to the Liberator with the other paid bills he wanted them back for the purpose I suppose of destroying them—it was the practice to send with the weekly return all the paid bills as vouchers, being Hobbs' acceptances, if they would in the ordinary course of business be returned to him to be kept or destroyed—the estimate for the week beginning 15th March also includes G. Wright and Co. 's bill, falling due on 19th March, for £197 2s. 5d., and Bradford and Co. 's bill falling due the same day for. £136 8s. 7d.—this is Wright's letter to me of 24th March, 1884: "Dear Sir, you are quite aware I suppose that there are two bills, one of £214 and the other for, £197 2s. 5d., overdue, will you send me a cheque? Do you not want the bills to produce to Mr. Brock?"—that refers to these two bills of Rochford, Mount, and Dell and G. Wright and Co.—I have not got the estimate for the week beginning 22nd March, this is the return for that week; in it the acceptances are shown as. £409 11s. 4d., including J. E. Shirley's bill for £166 9s., due 24th March—the "Shirley" on that bill is in Wright's writing—these are cheques drawn by the Liberator to Hobbs for £350 on 22nd March, £400 on the same day; £328 10s. 3d. on 28th March—the words at the bottom of the return, "Deficit on previous week £985 19s. 10d.,"I take to mean that we did not receive the previous week all we anticipated or asked for, and it was brought forward to this week—it would be the difference between the amount asked for on the estimate and the amount actually advanced—when we did not get the full amount we added it on to the next week's estimate—this £985 19s. 10d. has been</p>

               <p>added by Hobbs himself after the return sheet was made up, before it was sent to the Liberator no doubt—this is a letter of 27th March, 1884, from myself to Wright: "Dear sir,—Will you let me have the bills for which I am to draw cheques so that I can nil up the correct amounts and send them on to you"—on the front of it is written Wright's answer, "You have one, I enclose another"—that referred to some of these bills—on 1st April, 1884, is this letter from Wright to me: "Enclosed are three bills that I have. Do please send me a cheque for last week's bill We must have some money for costs, and Mr. Hobbs arranged on Friday that this cheque should be sent"—I am not, sure, but I believe the three bills referred to were the last three bills, the George Wright, the Bradford, and the Shirley bill—the two bills of Key and Son, falling due on 17th April, 1884, and in which I signed the drawer's name, were included in the weekly estimate sent in to the Liberator—they are entered in my diary as due on 17th May, 1884, as one bill, £245 7s. 6d.—I returned some of the. bills to Wright after they had been paid—I recollect seeing him destroy one of them by tearing it up and throwing it on the fire—I did not return them all to him, and these six produced here are some of those which I did not return—three Brickfield bills were sent to Wright in part payment for these bills—Brickfield bills were acceptances given by the Building Estates Brickfields Co. to Hobbs in payment for goods (principally timber used on brickfields) which Hobbs supplied them with—this is Hobbs' bills-receivable book—on 27th November, 1883,1 find that Hobbs received two acceptances from the Building Estates Brickfields Co., for £250 each; they are entered in his writing, and against the entry in my writing is "H. G. W.," which means that those bills were forwarded to Wright—they were sent in payment of some of the eleven bills, instead of cheques—on February 8th, 1884, there is another Brickfield bill for £250 received by Hobbs, and against it is the same memoranda, "H. G. W."—that also went to Wright on account of the bills—each of the bills would be endorsed by Hobbs before they went to Wright—the memoranda as to the disposal of the bills are made in a column of the book reserved for that purpose, "How disposed of," and the memoranda were made in the ordinary course at the time—I have no recollection of seeing the bills-payable book for years; after the book was filled up it would be put away with the other books; I know nothing of its being destroyed—I have searched for it since these proceedings, but cannot find it—I should make out the weekly returns from the books and lay them all before Hobbs with the other papers; in the ordinary course they would all go before him prior to being sent to the liberator—I used to draw the cheques in payment for these bills along with all the other cheques, and Hobbs would sign them—I believe I said to him that the cheque was in payment of another one of those bills, or of the bills—the cheques were made payable to Wright and in the name of Wright.</p>

               <p>the payee of the cheque would appear in the pass-book, which was made up partly from the ledger and partly from the cheques themselves—in the ordinary course of things that pass-book would go back to the customer—I have not looked for the pass-book, and know nothing about it—on 23rd January, 1884, I find a cheque for £493 2s. 5d. debited to the account under the serial number of the cheque—the name of the payee would be in the pass-book—on 7th April, 1884, is a cheque for £411 2s. 5d., debited to the account—cheques are returned to customers with their pass-books in the ordinary course of things.</p>

Dimsdale's Bank between November, 1883, and June, 1884, one in the name of H. G. Wright and the other in the name of Henry Granville Wright—this is the certificate of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, showing that our Bank makes a return—these two pass-books are correct copies of Wright's accounts, and this is a correct copy of the bank reserved waste-book—on 2nd November, 1883, I find £256 17s. 7d. was paid into the credit of Wright's account—I cannot trace how it came in—on 22nd January;1884, I find a payment in of £537 14s. lid.—I find by the waste-book that that sum was made up of two cheques, one of which was for £493 2s. 5d—on 5th April, 1884, I find a single cheque of £411 2s. 5d. paid in.</p>

I saw him frequently in that capacity—I believe he was also secretary to the Lands Allotment during that period, but of that I am not sure—they had offices in the same house, nominally on different floors, but much of the work of both was done on the same floor and in the same rooms; I know that from the conversations I heard, and from the books and papers which I saw tying in the rooms—I found the business of the two Companies was discussed in the same Board room used by the Companies indiscriminately—I frequently went to the offices, to get money from the Liberator; I only knew the Liberator; we used to get our advances than from the Liberator—I generally saw Mr. Brock, or if he was not there, and sometimes when he was there, Mr. Wright—I did not say that Mr. Wright had offices in the same house at that period—his offices were at Adelaide Buildings, London Bridge—I was employed by Mr. Hobbs before 1883, from October, 1877; he was already in relations with the Liberator—during the years between 1877 and 1883 he was continuously engaged in developing Building Societies—in the earlier part of that period I believe charges on his estates were given to the Liberator as security for advances. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that at the earlier period, when advances were asked for and made, a charge was executed by Mr. Hobbs on the estate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot answer that simply—he did not give a charge for an amount estimated as sufficient to cover the advance which he had; it was a charge to cover any sums that might be advanced from time to time, to include one specific advance, and these words were used" and any further sums that may be advanced"—it was a charge to cover general advances, so far as I saw it—it was a question for them to settle whether they would advance what was asked for, and to consider whether the value of the estate charged to them was sufficient to cover further advance—money was not paid off from time to time, very seldom; for years it was only an increasing indebtedness—I do not know that the Liberator was advised by surveyors from time to time as to the value of the property on which the charges existed. I know of surveyors going down to see as to the weekly draws, that was all; one surveyor was Mr. Howard Martin, after that Mr.</p>

               <p>Bishop, who was in the employ of the Liberator, in later years on the South London estates both Mr. Newman and the late Binfield Bird—he is dead; I believe he was surveyor to the Board of Trade—I remember that Mr. Samuel Walker was consulted—I think between October, 1877, and March, 1883, Mr. Martin acted in that way for the Liberator, and also Mr. Walker—at this period I always understood that Mr. Wright was the financial manager of the Liberator—I learnt that generally in the office, he took the most active part in all matters relating to the advances—I continued in the employment of Hobbs and Co., Limited, until a very late period—I do not know that it was in 1888 that Mr. Wright became financial adviser—no change was made then to my knowledge—I cannot remember that in 1883 no advances were made by the Lands Allotment Co. to Mr. Hobbs, I don't think so; if they were they were made through the Liberator or were special advances on new estates, to purchase them—I do not remember that in the latter part of 1883 the Lands Allotment Co. stopped Mr. Hobbs' building operations; I believe some reduction was made in the amount of work being done—the operations were not stopped on 6th March, to my recollection—I did not know of an agreement in October, 1883, by the Lands Allotment Co., to advance £15,000 to Mr. Hobbs upon a general charge on his property—I do not remember ever having heard anything of that—the names put against the bills in this list <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 4 are in my writing; I was asked to put names; I chose the names, often being asked if they were the names of firms that we were doing business with at the time, and they came into my mind readily—the words, "Stock in dock and yards, £12,000," is in the writing of Mr. Wright—that was put in my presence—Mr. Wright asked what was the value of the timber stock in the dock and yards, and he was told by Mr. Hobbs, after referring to the dock-book, £12,000—I don't know whether that was for Mr. Wright's information only, or whether it was put in with a view to get the resulting figure of £15,000; it was taken to be the value of the stock in dock and yards, and the remark made was that that amount was covered by other material and by the acceptances running to merchants, material used in the various estates—I don't know what they were working out, I know what my impression was, it was to arrive at the amount of the liability on the bills, less the value of the stock in the dock and yards; that brought out the figures of. £15,054—I was not aware that in this memorandum of October, 1883, Hobbs was to get an advance of £15,000 upon a general charge on his property from the Lands Allotments Co.—I am in the employ of the Official Liquidator—I have not the books of that Company; I don't know whether they are here; I should know the minute-book if I saw it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it. (<hi rend="italic">A minute of 8th October,</hi> 1883, <hi rend="italic">was read stating that in consideration of the Company stopping Mr. Hobbs' building operations for six months, they agreed to assist him to take up such bills as would cover advances, not to exceed</hi> £15,000, <hi rend="italic">to be secured by a general charge on his property</hi>)—that does not recall all that to me, it recalls the fact that the work was reduced and also that acceptances were given by Hobbs covering the amount of the advances, which I always understood came from the Liberator—I did not know the amount—it appears that the object was to bring out the total advance to £15,000 as the resulting figure, but I had no knowledge of it—my memory does not enable me to connect that with the advance of £15,000 in the slightest—the state of things was that Mr. Hobbs had £12,000 worth of stock in the docks and at the yards—there were £24,804</p>

               <p>of liabilities coming forward in the six months from October to March—it may be that if Hobbs were entitled to £15,000 advance there would be room for £2,250 to be paid to Wright off the debt Hobbs owed him, but I have no recollection of its having been put in that way.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEMP</hi>. I am in the service of the Official Receiver—I commenced after the Official Receiver paid out the Receiver to the debenture holders—the Official Receiver did not say "Now, Mr. Kentish, are you going to be a witness or a prisoner?" nor anything to that effect—I say the names to the bills were fraudulent, and Hobbs was a party to that fraud and also a participator in the wrong addition of the wages sheets—those sheets were from week to week, and added up by me—for many weeks after the formation of Hobbs and Co., Limited, those wages sheets were over-added—they were over-added I believe from in April, 1885, to December, 1885, or January, 1886—not to my knowledge before April, 1885, except those that were added up some years before, when names were put in by me in about 1880-1881—I have not mentioned that before—I stole part of the over-addition, and handed the rest to Hobbs—in 1880 I put names of men who had not been employed in the sheets, which were kept in the usual way—they were used after the men were paid—they showed what the men had been paid, and something more—the men did not get a penny more than they earned—I added other names, and put sums opposite them—Hobbs got the money so represented falsely—I gave it to him in cash—the sheets were used for the purpose of Hobbs getting, in his private capacity, apart from his business accounts, which were likely to be submitted to the Liberator at any moment, money that he might have by him—the Liberator found the money entered in the sheets—the sheets were submitted to the representative of the surveyor of the Liberator—Mr. Walker was the surveyor and Mr. Burn his representative—I believe they are alive—the money did not go into my pocket—I added weekly, £30 to. £40 to the wages sheets and £10 for superintendence—I have said I did steal part of the money after April, 1885—this went on two or three years—at that time I was not taking any of the plunder—I cannot remember that I remonstrated with Hobbs—I will say I did not—I have no recollection of it—I do not know what my belief was—I did not believe it to be honest, I suppose, because I believed it to be dishonest—that is my notion of fraud—these things occurred twelve or thirteen years ago—I know I was engaged in a great many transactions that were not honest—Hobbs knew of this excess of wages in the over-added sheets going on in 1885—I stole part of the money and gave the rest to Hobbs in cash—he told me to do it—I did not remonstrate with him—I believed it to be a fraud and an unjust thing—Hobbs married my sister Rosa in 1891—before that she was living with my aunt—I think my aunt was very fond of her, and did not want to part from her—I do not know that—very possibly I persuaded my sister to marry Hobbs and my aunt to permit her to do so—I wrote a letter—I tried to induce them to a certain extent—no doubt I gave them my reasons—they would be true and accurate at that time—this is my letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 24th February,</hi> 1891, <hi rend="italic">addressed from Ilford, to "My dear Aunt" and recommended the marriage.

At the time I wrote that, the past was gone, and we were both sincerely desirous of doing what was right. (<hi rend="italic">The letter continued that he would say nothing as to Hobbs' position beyond that he had an ample fortune. Rosa would gain the truest love of a man everybody respected and spoke well of, and he was convinced that by accepting Hobbs she would rise to an honoured position of usefulness that would tend to her true joy and happiness. Disparity of age was not an objection worthy of consideration. To Hobbs she would look up and trust her honour and happiness, and he ms sure she would experience the true bliss of wifehood. Nor were his children any obstacle, as, they were either grown up or at school, and Rosa would soon gain their affections. As to the aunt herself he knew she would experience joy at seeing Rosa the wife of a true good husband of position and homour, and would consent to sink herself to secure such happiness for Rosa</hi>)—I believe Bailey discovered the additions in 1886—I went to Hobbs respecting them—I heard afterwards that Mr. Bailey and Mr. Currie went to Hobbs about it—I will swear I did not say to Mr. Currie, "What is Mr. Hobbs going to do with me?"—when you put that question to me at the Police-court I answered," No, I won't swear I did not"—I did not find Mr. Currie checking those wages sheets—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Kemp asked if Mr. Currie were in Court, and a gentleman stood up</hi>)—I did not say to him, "Make it as light as you can for me," nothing of the kind—I think my memory has improved since I was at the Police-court—I have had time to reflect on the consequences to myself—I cannot help it if they might be serious—Currie said I had better go and see the governor—he did not advise me to go and make a clean breast of it—I was not to see the governor in order to make a clean breast of it—I said at Bow Street, "I won't swear Mr. Currie said it"—I did not say he did—I went to Norbury Hall—I did not go down on my knees and cry and beg him not to prosecute me—I did not say I would redeem the past—I won't swear that I said at the Police-court I would redeem the past, I won't swear it here either—I do not remember saying it; I will not swear I did not—I believe I said at the Police-court that very likely I did say it—Hobbs did not ask me how I came to do it—I did not say to him that I had got into a rash enterprise—I was engaged in a business that was rash, undoubtedly—a rash enterprise was not spoken of then between me and Hobbs—I have no recollection that Hobbs referred to my financial position, or that I did so—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">here read a letter from the witness to Hobbs, dated 26th January,</hi> 1886, <hi rend="italic">in which he stated that he wished sincerely in some measure to atone for the past, that he was deeply sensible of Hobbs' kindness, that he looked on this as the turning point in his life, that he had prepared a full statement of his accounts, and hoped to merit the favours he had received but so abused</hi>)—that was the letter I wrote to the man who was a participator in my robbery—my reason for writing the letter was that until I saw him he was not aware that I myself had been keeping a sum of money; my further reason was because so far as I knew, in the office no one had any idea but what I had taken all the money for myself—I had not said to Currie that Hobbs knew all about it until after I had written that letter; I don't remember saying that to Currie before I went to Norbury Hall; I will not swear I did not—I tried to shield Hobbs, as I had done before in many other things—I don't remember telling Currie before I went to Norbury Hall—I told Mr. Bailey before I went to Norbury Hall—I do not know that</p>

               <p>Hobbs consulted Major Wright, the chairman of Hobbs and Co., Limited and also a director of the Liberator, I believe—I have lectured, not for the Liberator but for other societies, the Band of Hope Union was one—I did not render services to Major Wright to my knowledge—I did not know that it was at Major Wright's suggestion that I was not prosecuted but allowed to remain in the situation in order to redeem my character—I was removed from the position of cashier—I cannot produce any evidence except my statement that Hobbs was cognizant of what I was doing—every sum of money I handed to him was in cash, gold and silver, no notes to my knowledge—my salary at Hobbs and Co., Limited was £300; before it was made into a Company I had £200 from Mr. Hobbs—I was paid monthly—I had made £300 or £400 by speculations in 1885—my wife had no money except what I gave her—I was receiving presents now and again from relatives; I cannot tell you the dates—perhaps I received. £40 or £50 altogether in 1885 from relatives—several Superior-court actions and County-court actions were brought against me in 1885—I cannot remember how many—I don't know the amount of the judgments that were obtained against me; it may be £1,162 11s. between July, 1885, and July, 1886; and between July and November, 1885, judgments may have been obtained against me to the amount of £771 8s. 2d.—I cannot say they were not, and I cannot say they were—in addition to those sums I incurred a bill of costs with Messrs. Miller and Son to the amount of £110 6s. 4d.—I had an enterprise at Antwerp—I was not to my knowledge charged with fraud there—I know Mr. Van Volsen—he did not complain of my collecting their debts, nor did he threaten me with criminal proceedings—he may have talked of them to the man I called my partner; he may have done those things—Mr. Smeaton was my partner; he is dead—I managed to find money to pay the judgments and Miller's bill in 1885 possibly—this letter is my writing, addressed to Mr. Chamberlain—our pay-day was on Saturday—I usually took these moneys on Saturday—some of the falsified wages-sheets were in respect of the Northumberland Avenue Hotel, which was the biggest job at the time—I cannot remember whether Spencer was making a claim against me about that time—someone of that name evidently was—I daresay I paid them off between £25 and £30 about that time—no doubt I told their representative to come to the Avenue Hotel when I should be done paying, as I had done my week's work then—I did not pay Spencer or Spencer's representative moneys which I had taken out of the over-addition—to my remembrance, I was not about the 16th July being pressed for money—to my knowledge the London and County Bank were not pressing me—I have read this letter headed "London and County Bank"—I was not asking them to give me time—the letter says, "I think I an manage £25 on Saturday, if they will give time for the balance," I have no recollection of the matter—it is in my writing—very likely I had overdrawn my account, but I have no recollection—I do not know if I paid them £25 on the Saturday; I did not pay them £25 which I had stolen from the over-addition—I may have paid them, but I did not steal it, as is suggested, nor did I take it without stealing it—I may have squared Smeaton because he was going to try and drag me into an expensive partnership with a barrister—I thought it desirable to square him—he was a sanitary engineer—he always said he was my partner;</p>

               <p>I don't know whether he was or not—we agreed that if the business went on and was successful we should go into partnership—I squared him because, so far as I can remember, he had made some proposals to another gentleman, which I did not approve of, and he said they were too far gone to be withdrawn, but he thought if I squared him he could manage it; I squared him several times. I squared him once by threatening him—I <hi rend="italic">daresay</hi> from the 24th July, 1885, to the 23rd December I had paid my creditors £527 6s. 10d., in respect of actions brought against me; and in addition I had paid some money to Miller, possibly over £70; I cannot remember—the larger bill of Key and Son is in Wright's handwriting—Hobbs knew I had put in those names—at the Police-court I said I believed that Hobbs was a party to the arrangement—it is my writing to all the bills—the names were fixed by the imagination of myself and Wright—Hobbs was present at the time; I swear that—I said at the Police-court, I got the amount of the bills from a small slip of paper Wright and I made up at the time from our own imagination—I protested to both Hobbs and Wright, singly to the best of my remembrance—I protested to Wright in the afternoon at the interview, before I protested to Hobbs—Wright looked at the names I was putting down, and agreed with them; that was immediately after I was protesting—immediately after I had protested Wright asked me what names they were to be signed in, and I gave him the suggested names—when I took the bills over to him the names had not been signed—I took them to his office in Adelaide Buildings—Hobbs did not go with me; I did not fill in the names at Wright's office; Wright filled them in—I had already handed them to him, and, after he had filled them in and he kept them, I cannot say if the bills ever went back to Hobbs's personal possession; they came back in the ordinary course, but I do not know if they came back into his personal possession; I kept them afterwards—I can try to imitate handwriting; I have not got a faculty for doing it, to my knowledge—the two bills of Key and Son are signed by me—I imitated Key and Son's writing, so as to make a very good imitation—no doubt I intended to imitate their writing, so that those who saw it should believe it to be their writing—the Key and Son written by Wright is not an imitation—the two bills, produced were not written by Wright—I have imitated Hobbs's signature,' and Currie has, and others have done it to my knowledge—I have imitated Hobbs's signature on bills—I decline to answer whether the Lion Foundry bill is my imitation of Hobbs's signature on the ground that it may criminate me—this bill for £55 2s. 5d. purports to be drawn by a man named Marple on 6th January, 1885, and accepted by Hobbs—according to the ledger nearly £60 was due to him at that time—there was some dispute about it—Marple had been paid something over £20 at the time that bill was given—I cannot recall the exact amount, it was something between £20 and £30—I put that bill before Hobbs for his acceptance, arid he accepted it—I did not bring it back to him—I have no recollection of saying to Hobbs, "This man wants a bit of cash; will you discount this bill?"—I had not possession of this bill after it was accepted, to my remembrance—I certainly did not say to him, "I have got £30 in the till; if you will give me a cheque for £22 he will let you have £3 discount and I can give him £3 out of the till—I did not ask him to give me a post-dated cheque to put into the till against the £30—looking at this cheque on G</p>

               <p>frequently at the office of the Liberator, Mr. Brock was secretary, and he became secretary to the Lands Allotment Company, whose office was in the same building, but upon a different floor—in the secretary's room of the Liberator the Lands Allotment business was also much discussed at all events; it was the same board of directors for the two Companies, and Wright was also solicitor to the Lands Allotment Company, and I presume, he would have the advancing of the loans by the Lands Allotment as well as the advancing of the loans by the Liberator; I do not know of my own knowledge—I should say I first went to the Liberator in order to get money within two or three years from the time of my entering Hobbs's service; it might have been earlier—but it was somewhere about 1880—from the time I entered the service we always wanted more money than we could get for Hobbs's building operations—from 1877 downwards we were always in want of more money than we could get—Hobbs has been sued for money many times since 1879 to 1881, I should think; I don't think there was much after that, but he was being pressed frequently, and actions were commenced against him by writs—that kind of thing lasted from about 1879 to 1881, and after that we were in want of more money than we could get, but it was not so acute afterwards as then—during the years I went and saw Wright at the Liberator he acted as financial manager; he was almost in supreme control—I have been to see him at the Liberator, at his own office, in regard to advances from the Society, and also, from 1878 to 1883 at any rate, for getting short temporary loans from Wright himself for Hobbs—an account of these loans was kept in the ledger down to 1883—about the 1st of October, 1883, the amount of the loans was between £3,000 and. £4,000 that Hobbs owed Wright upon this private account—that ledger is the same one that was in existence up to 1884, but which I have not since seen—when this list of the bills was written in pencil and afterwards in ink, Hobbs, Wright, and myself were present—Hobbs supplied the figure £12,000 as being the amount of stock in the docks and yard—Hobbs at this time was very active in the conduct of the business, generally from early morn till late at night—he was conversant with the books kept in the conduct of the business—the diary referred to was always lying on his table or desk—the bills-payable book was locked up in the safe all night, but the safe was open all day, and then the book was accessible to him—the bills, the subject of this enquiry, are entered in the diary, not in the bills-payable book, the comparison of the two would have shown the omission—he was conversant with the fact that what purported to be a copy of the bills-payable book was kept at the Liberator—all these documents handed to me are in Hobbs's writing; the first two are apparently rough estimates, the rest are letters, between 1st January and 20th March, 1884; they are all addressed to G. E. Brock, who was then secretary of the Liberator—those are all in Hobbs's writing—I have a recollection of there being a reduction in the amount of work in October, 1883, owing to a reduction in the supply of money from the Liberator—I know nothing of the minute-of 8th October, 1883, in the Lands Allotment book—all my estimates and weekly returns were made to the Liberator—and I know nothing of any estimates or returns made to the Lands Allotment Company—about 1880 and 1881 there were some falsifications in regard to the moneys obtained from the society—that was partly at the time when Hobbs was under monetary pressure—at one particular job, the names of men non-existent were put G 2</p>

               <p>into the sheets and the money put down to them was handed to Hobbs that was at Hobbs' suggestion—I did not participate in any of that money—I began to purloin money in that way in 1885 by a falsification of the wages sheet from week to week; that was at Hobbs's suggestion; he suggested that I should add to the amount of the sheets; there was an opportunity for him making a bit—about the time the suggestion was made his business had been formed into a limited Company, and I was a sort of chief clerk under Roberts, the secretary, Hobbs being managing director of the Company—I believe he was <hi rend="italic">ex-officio</hi> member of all the committees—there were Finance and Works Committees—Hobbs said he proposed to make a bit out of this by an error in the casting of the sheets not by adding names—that fraudulent system proceeded up to the beginning of 1886, and then it was discovered I believe by Mr. Bailey, a clerk in the office of Hobbs and Co.—I believe Bailey communicated with Mr. Currie, and afterwards spoke to me about it—he spoke to Hobbs about it; that was towards the end of 1886, I think—I have not in my mind the date of the letter I wrote to Hobbs—this, of 26th January, is it—the discovery had been made by them, and had been communicated to Hobbs and to me—after that I saw Hobbs at Norbury Hall—I wrote that letter of 26th January at his request—I went to Norbury Hall a few days before and said the matter of the wages sheets had been discovered; he said, "Well, you must stop it"—I told him what I had been taking myself, that I had kept about £5 a week unknown to him—he said, "You had better just write me a short letter acknowledging it; and that was the reason I wrote that letter—it was arranged by us that I should give up all the cash matters to Currie, and clear up everything as far As possible—he did not say what he wanted with the letter—I wrote it within two or three days of the interwiew—I gave up all cash matters to Currie—I continued to receive. £300 a year as secretary to Hobbs and Co., down to May, 1892—my salary was increased after that from time to time, and in addition I got a bonus once a year from the Board—all my indebtedness to the end of 1885 was paid off by me out of the receipts of the business I carried on, and money lent to me—I had from £180 to £200 out of the fraudulent wages sheets—the total amount obtained by them was a little over. £1,000; Hobbs had the balance—I do not remember a cheque for rents coming to Hobbs, being endorsed by me and paid into my bank—I have paid cheques payable to Hobbs into my private account at his request; he frequently did not want some payments to appear in his own accounts: his business account was overdrawn sometimes—the Lion Foundry bill was included among the acceptances sent forward to the Liberator on 10th April, 1884, and the total amount of the advances made on the Lion Foundry went to Hobbs—a cheque would follow, and the weekly return would follow that—Hobbs had the money for it—the Marple bill was included in the estimate, and Hobbs received the proceeds—I cannot identify the estimate in the copy-bill-book of the Liberator—this slip pinned in is in Roberts's writing; he was secretary at the time—during the time Roberts was there, bills payable at Hobbs's bank were presented in the usual way—the Marples bill was paid in to his private account, so that he could get the money for it (that arrangement did not exist in 1883-4), and then, although the bills were made payable at the London and South-Western Bank, Upper Norwood, only trade bills were presented at maturity—I drew</p>

               <p>this Marples bill, and found there was a considerable sum due to them; we settled with them for a lesser amount, and Hobbs suggested to me that I should draw a bill; as he had paid the smaller amount, he could get the rest, from himself in one respect, but from his business account, and of course from the advances made by the Liberator—I acceded to the suggestion and drew the bill in the name of Marples—to the best of my recollection I gave it to Hobbs at the time; he accepted it in my presence as far as I can remember, and took it away; it would come back into the hand of Roberts, and he would send it on—I know Wright's ordinary handwriting—these four bills are not quite in his ordinary handwriting—I made no statement to the Official Receiver, but I did to the solicitor to the Treasury, and I made it of my own free will.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> Sir <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD CLARKE</hi>. I have four bills here, signed in different name? by Wright—there is an attempt in these signatures to rather disguise his ordinary handwriting—I speak of this one of J. E. Shirley—I have a faint recollection that at the time he asked me if that would be recognised as his writing, I cannot go beyond that; I have a dim recollection of it—I am quite aware that not one of these signatures bears the slightest resemblance to the real signature of either of the firms, and that in one case the name of the firm is misstated—I did not quote from the list I had made at Wright's the name of the firm; the list was lying before him at the time—I can't say if I told him "Dell" or "Bell" as the name of the firm—very possibly the mistake was mine—I cannot say if his question as to the signature being recognised as his ordinary writing, was with reference to any particular firm—I did not know at the time that the bill signed W. Rochefort, Mount and Bell was on blue paper, and that all that firm's bills were on white; I did not trouble to look—I have seen a few of their bills; I do not know if they were always on white paper—I have no examples of Wright's writing, but the office is full of them—I should say that anybody familiar with his writing would recognise it on these bills; there is only a rough disguise, but I suggest there is a disguise—I have no writing of his which I can produce to support that.</p>

I was clerk in what was called the Mort<lb/>gage Department of the Liberator Society—the office was at Budge Row—during that time advances were made first to Hobbs and afterwards to Hobbs and Co., Limited, in separate accounts, a general account and a special account, some on surveyors' certificates and some generally on account—in 1883 there was a separate account opened called A. W. Hobbs's General Account—advances made on surveyors' certificates B. were entered and kept separately in a book corresponding with the C. surveyors' certificates and with the estates—the advances were made week D. by week as the certificates came in—these were separate from advances E. made on general account—the weekly estimates have nothing to do with F. the surveyors' certificates.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Sir <hi rend="smallCaps">E. CLARKE</hi>. I was at the Liberator from 1881 to 1891—Wright was appointed finance manager in 1887—he attended almost daily, first as solicitor and then daily from January, 1888, as finance manager, to look into the accounts—one account dealt with advances upon the security of property, and the other with advances from week to week—there were various accounts, all except the general account having reference to estates and upon which surveyors sent in certificates—the Liberator minutes would show to some extent the way matters were dealt with—the Catford, Streatham, and Tooley Street accounts were Liberator accounts, but I think not Ilford, nor the Brickfields Company, Hobbs having no concern in the Brickfields Company—the general account was opened on July 13th, 1883—the accounts were running concurrently—Ilford was, I think, a House and Investment Trust Account—Hobbs's general account with the Liberator was paid off on 22nd January, 1884, by £26,700 cash paid by Hobbs to the Liberator—the charges on estates were dealt with in the solicitor's department—we have no entries showing what the secretary might advance, but the account opened for each estate gives the balance as well as the amount advanced and the state of the account at any moment—the charge made on the first advance would cover future</p>

               <p>advances—I should know of the valuation of an estate-a number of surveyors were employed—on their certifying an amount of work had been done Hobbs would be entitled to draw an amount—there were reports upon the building—some are by myself.</p>

This is the minute of Wright's appointment as solicitor, on 6th March, 1876, at a salary of £1,650, he undertaking to provide offices, clerks, stationery, &amp;c.—this is the minute of 20th December, 1887, of his appointment as financial manager, from 1st January, 1888, at a salary of £500 per annum—the word "financial" in the minute is Wright's—Hobbs got the £26,700 to pay off the Liberator from the Lands Allotment Company, which opened an account against him that same day debiting him with £26,700—this is the entry in their ledger—they appear to have continued to make advances to Hobbs to April, 1885 in five different accounts—the total was transferred back to the Liberator in this way; while the Allotment Company were advancing to Hobbs to meet bills, the Liberator were advancing to the Allotment Company; then in April, 1885, the balance on the Allotment Company's Mortgage account with the Society was retransferred partially to Hobbs's account and partially to other builders' accounts—the greater part to the Liberator—both Companies are in liquidation—Hobbs and Co. 's liability in April, 1885, to the Liberator was about £631,372.</p>

Mr. Bird then reported as to the value of the properties charged to Hobbs and Co.—looking at the minute-book of the Allotment Company of 11th August, 1884, I see "The secretary, brought up the account showing the values of the Equities of Redemption at Coventry Park which had been examined by Mr. Walker, and which formed the basis of the special advances made to Mr. Hobbs, Resolved that the amount be entered on the minutes"—I see various schedules here upon which probably the valuation was made, but I do not see the valuation—I now see "£145,068" in this summary—I cannot take that as the valuation of the property in the schedules; the figures are Kentish's, and I see no confirmation of them here—those figures may be taken as the values plus an amount for stocks in hand and for plant and machinery; a correct value of the estate and stock and plant.</p>

The figure £145,068 in the minute-book appears to be an aggregation of different estates—these are Kentish's figures—there appears to be a schedule putting certain values against certain estates and stocks—it is in Kentish's writing—the minute is: "J. B. Hobbs, the secretary, brought up the accounts showing the Equities of Redemption at Coventry Park which had been examined by Mr. Walker, and which formed the basis of the special advance made to Mr. Hobbs, Resolved that the same be entered on the minutes"—I find appended the accounts to which I have referred show the £145,068, but that account refers to various estates, and the minutes refer to the Equity of Redemption on the one Coventry Park estate—I have not compared the schedule with the other three documents—I can<lb/>not say if they agree—I believe they are all in Kentish's writing—I really do not understand these papers at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am examiner in the office of the Official Receiver in Companies liquidations—I have had to investigate the books of the Liberator, and of J. W. Hobbs and Co., Limited—I have also some books of Hobbs before the Company was formed in April of 1885—I have examined all those books that I could find—I find no books recording advances made to Hobbs by the Liberator prior to 1885—we have some of Hobbs's books before his business was turned into a private Company, but the ledger which should form part of them was not among them—there is no ledger or other book recording advances made by Wright to Hobbs, or recording any payments made by Hobbs to Wright on account of loans, no bills-payable book belonging to Hobbs, from 1883 to 1884 covering the period of those bills—I am acting in the winding-up of the whole of the Balfour group of Companies, nine in all—I have not got immediate charge of the Lands Allotment Company—I have of the Liberator, and of. Hobbs and Co.—the moment a Company goes into liquidation it is the duty of the Official Receiver to take possession of the office and books—in the case of Hobbs and Co. occupation was not taken immediately because there was a receiver for the debenture holders—we have found some thirty books I should think altogether relating to Hobbs before the business was turned into a Company—I have found several Liberator cheques payable to Hobbs between 2nd November, 1883, and the end of March, 1884, amongst the Liberator papers—those cheques were all produced at the Police Court—the cheque of the 3rd December, 1883, could not be found—it has always been missing—all the cheques were made payable to Hobbs's order—some of them are endorsed by him—some are endorsed "Hobbs" by Kentish—one or two are not endorsed at all—Hobbs's books do not show at all how much had been advanced up to that time—it is only in the books of the Liberator that you get it—I found among the books of the Liberator Hobbs's copy-bill-book—I also found the weekly estimates produced here, and a number of others covering that period—I have checked the weekly estimates with Hobbs's copy-bill-book, and I find these eleven bills are, all but two, included in those weekly estimates—I find the two which I could not trace in the weekly estimates, although they are in the copy-bill-book, are Hoare and Brown's, £256 17s. 7d., and Micklethwaite, £263 5s.—the amount of the acceptances entered in these weekly estimates each week correspond with the acceptances entered in the copy-bill-book, and the copy-bill-book includes all the eleven—I cannot identify the exact amount from the bill-book in respect of the two bills I have mentioned—the copy-bill-book corresponds with the total amount of the acceptances which appears in the weekly estimates with the exception of the two.</p>

Hobbs and Co., Limited, was registered in April, 1885, and it was in 1892 that I looked for the books on the winding-up of the Company—some five months before the winding-up Hobbs had ceased to be managing director—what books Hobbs may have handed over to Hobbs and Co., Limited, I could have no idea—I have not been personally at all to get the books—they were found at an old office of Hobbs and Co., at Queen's Buildings, by one of our clerks—Hobbs and Co. had left that office six and a half years before they were wound up—the books were left there—they did not give the office up, I believe—I believe it was empty—Hobbs and Co. had ceased to use them—I do not know if there was any caretaker there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I think Hobbs's position as managing director expired by effluxion of time in May, 1892—he was appointed for seven years in April, 1885—I know that Micklethwaite's bill is not in the estimate for the 22nd December, 1883, because I have taken the copy-bill-book and Kentish's diary which shows the dates of all the bills, and I have endeavoured from this book to make up the amount shown in that estimate, but I cannot—there may be some discrepancies in the dates in the copy-bill-books that may account for it—in the estimates there is no description of the bills except acceptances due, and in some cases it merely gives the total of acceptances for the week, so that on the estimate itself there is no means of tracing them—of all the eleven bills only one becoming due on 22nd December was Micklethwaite's—where you cannot satisfactorily trace a bill through the bill-book as forming part of an estimate it does not follow that it is not in the estimate and that it is not intended to be included.</p>

If anyone had been defrauded it must have been them"—I said, "I understand the Public Prosecutor has been moved by the Official Receiver"—I took him to London—we were met by Moore—Wright was taken to Bow Street, and charged there with Hobbs—Wright made no further statement—Hobbs was on bail from 16th December to 6th January—I think I assisted Inspector Moore in examining the books and papers of Hobbs that were found at Norbury Hall—I did not search myself—the information on which the warrants were granted was on the 10th December—Mr. Bramall was the informant from the Official Receiver's office, and Mr. Kentish and Mr. Bailey.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly cleric to Hobbs, and immediately after the Company was formed I was bookkeeper and clerk under the secretary, Roberts—in September, 1885, I became secretary of the Company—at the time the Company was formed I believe a schedule or list was made of Hobbs's liabilities which the Company had to take over—I assisted in preparing that in company with Roberts and Hobbs—all those liabilities that I made a list of were transferred in due course to the hooks of the new Company—Alfred Axam Hobbs was Hobbs's cousin, and his wife was related by marriage to me—three weeks or a month before the 15th of April, 1885, I saw them both with reference to the affairs of the new Company, by the prisoner's instructions—the prisoner said he had seen Alfred and made it all right; they were willing to appear as creditors for about £2,400, and he asked me to go and settle the details with them—I took a small half-sheet of paper on which a letter was drafted by the prisoner and myself to Alfred Hobbs, and got him to sign it, and I afterwards returned that paper to the prisoner—it was a short letter asking for payment of the £2,405 due—when I took that to Alfred Hobbs I do not remember seeing his wife till just towards the end of the interview—he signed it—the paper said that Mrs. Hobbs was the creditor—within a day or two of the Company being established, after the 20th, when the books were opened, I saw the account which was opened in the journal and ledger under the name of Mrs. A. A. Hobbs—at page 5 of the journal in Roberts' writing is the entry of £2,405 9s. 9d. as a sum owing by Hobbs to Mrs. A. A. Hobbs—I find that sum to her credit in the ledger by J. W. Hobbs—it is opened as a ledger account with her, the commencing entry—on the other side of the ledger I find entries showing how that money has been paid off; on August 1st, 1885, £500; September 12th, £500;. December 24th, £500; March 5th, 1886, £500; March 26th, £416 8s. 2d., making a total of £2,416 8s. 2d.—there is an entry on the credit side of "Interest £10 18s. 5d.," which makes the sums agree—these are the five cheques representing those amounts drawn by Hobbs and Co., Limited, in favour of Mrs. A. A. Hobbs, and signed by Hobbs as a director—I took them to Mrs. A. A. Hobbs, and she or Mr. A. A. Hobbs gave me the receipts now attached—on the last receipt there is a calculation of the interest to arrive at the £2,416—the prisoner told me to calculate the interest on it—on three occasions, I think, they, or Mrs. A. A. Hobbs gave me cheques for similar amounts on her own bank to the order of J. W. Hobbs, which I handed to the prisoner—after April, 1885 I made up the wages sheets and the totals (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEMP</hi>

A. Hobbs to J. W. Hobbs to pay the amount of money he or Mrs. Hobbs had lent, and I handed it to the prisoner—that was three or four weeks before the formation of the Company.</p>

A. Hobbs—Hobbs told me it represented sums of money which Mrs. Hobbs had advanced to him from time to time for the purpose of his business, and that she was pressing him at the time for payment—the cheques subsequently drawn in payment of that amount I entered in the list of requirements for cheques, I believe—I cannot now remember distinctly any direct request of Hobbs for them but I should not put a requisition of that sort into the weekly statement without some special request, because it was not an ordinary payment—as secretary of the company I signed these earlier cheques after the finance committee had passed them.</p>

J. W. Hobbs and Co., Limited, the sum of £500 on account of £2,405 9s. 9d., due to me by Mr. J. W.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and a clerk in the office of Messrs. Fladgate, of Charing Cross, solicitors to the Exhibition Commissioners of 1851, on whose behalf at the end of 1889 I prepared a building agreement between them and Mr. Sari—I produce a copy of the draft agreement—it was signed by Sari on April 15th, 1889—it is an <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> by Mr. Sari to take lands from the Commissioners at a ground-rent beginning at £7,500, and an ultimate agreement for four plots of land mentioned, for 98 or 99 years, with the proviso that the first year's ground-rent is to be paid down as a deposit—shortly before December 18th, 1889, in consequence of a communication from Mr. Sari's solicitor, George Newman was sub-stituted in place of Mr. Sari, and an agreement was completed on 18th December between the Exhibition Commissioner and George Newman personally, of which I produce the counterpart, signed George Newman, and on that day. £7,500 was paid down for the first year's ground-rent—the costs would be paid by Newman—we also received the surveyors' fees—the Commissioners never had any assignment to George Newman and Co., and as far as I know no such assignment was ever made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 49, Parliament Street—at the end of 1889 I acted as solicitor for Mr. Sari in selling an agreement from the Exhibition Commissioners to him and from him to George Newman and Co.—Sari had sent in a tender in April, and to the best of my recollection Messrs. Bonner, Wright and Thompson were the first persons with whom I came into communication—I saw the defendant Wright as re<lb/>presenting that firm—on 27th November, 1889, the heads of agreement were reduced into writing, showing the conditions under which Sari was to sell his interest under the Commissioners to George Newman and Co., Limited—it appears that Mr. Sari agrees to sell all his rights in respect of certain lands for, £16,000, payable at different dates, and some of them at considerable dates after the agreement—the deposit was £7,500, representing a year and a half's ground-rent payable in advance—it was agreed on behalf of Mr. Sari for and on behalf of Messrs. George Newman and Co., Limited—while I was in communication with Bonner, Wright and Thompson, the defendant Newman was I think present on one or two occasions when it was under discussion—I cannot speak quite positively—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my copy of the original document (<hi rend="italic">This was not produced</hi>)—whatever documents I had I handed to the Treasury—I think the original was</p>

               <p>retained by Wright because the receipt for the amount was written across it—I was present at the date of the completion, (<hi rend="italic">December</hi> 18M, 1889) with Mr. Sari, Mr. Newman, and someone from Mr. Bonner's office either Mr. Bromill, the managing clerk, or Mr. Wright, or both—the meeting took place at Mr. Fladgate's, and. £4,000 was stipulated to be paid to me in bank-notes, or Mr. Sari's account, which was paid in two notes of £1,000 and four of. £100, and the acceptances under the heads of agreement to the amount of £12,000 by George Newman and Co., and endorsed, were handed over to me—those acceptances were all met at maturity, to the best of my belief—there were no other cash payments, and the full bill payment was £12,000—I have not heard until this trial of a contract or any interest under it being sold to George Newman and Co. for £26,000, or of any payment of balance in cash being made on account of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Sir <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD CLARKE</hi>. I had nothing to do with it after the money was paid—a question was raised as to whether a Limited Company should be substituted for Mr. Sari, (<hi rend="italic">A letter from Mr. Sari to the Commissioners was here put in authorising them to substitute for his name that of Mr. George Newman, of Budge Row, Cannon Street</hi>)—the Commissioners asked for Mr. Newman's references, and they were given, and on that Mr. Newman's name was put in as the substitute, and after that another name was put in—the negotiations lasted nearly a year between his applying for the bond and it being settled, and ultimately a sale was proposed as he was a very old man—I originally asked. £30,000 for the sale of the interest—while Mr. Sari was in possession, a valuation was obtained from Messrs. Virgo, Buckland, and Garrod, but not on Mr. Sari's behalf; but whether he negotiated with other people I cannot say—it came to Mr. Newman and Mr. Wright through Mr. Steele's agency, a commission agent; he had no interest in the matter; we paid him on commission on our side, and I believe Steele told me that he was paid £1,000 commission on the other side, by the purchasers.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The minute of 6th December was read; it referred to the Albert Hall land, any was to the effect that certain resolutions were carried with regard to the purchase of the land.—The first stood originally, "Mr. George Newman of this Company," but was altered to</hi> "<hi rend="italic">That this Company do purchase of Mr. Newman" an agreement relating to certain lands near the Albert Hall for</hi>£16,000, <hi rend="italic">payable</hi> £8,000 <hi rend="italic">in cash and the balance in bills; that the rent of</hi>£7,500 <hi rend="italic">be paid in advance, and that Newman be indemnified against any liability in respect of the agreement. Wright reported that he was interested to a certain moderate extent in the sum paid for acquiring the contract; and this the Board recognised and approved. It was resolved that application be made to the Liberator to advance the money necessary to carrying out the buildings contemplated, and also</hi> £41,777 10s. <hi rend="italic">necessary to be paid at that time; that the Liberator be offered a bonus of</hi> £25,000 <hi rend="italic">for making such advances and 6 per cent, interest, and that the Liberator should be asked to endorse bills for</hi> £12,000 <hi rend="italic">given by the Company to the vendors and to offer them a bonus for so doing.</hi>)—I find a minute of another meeting on 20th December, 1889, signed by Newman—it contains a report by him that the agreement relating to the Albert Hall land has been signed—on 9th December, 1889, the Liberator drew a cheque for £41,777 10s. payable to George Newman and Co.—Wright at that date only signed cheques drawn on the mortgage account; this is a cheque drawn on the current account—it was the practice to make a requisition to the Liberator for the cheque before it was drawn—this is the requisition for the cheque coming from the solicitors, Bonnor, Wright, Thompson and Co.—the requisition is headed Mortgage Account—I can only assume a reason for its not being drawn on the mortgage account, it ought to have been in the ordinary course of business—the figures are Mr. Herbert Temple's, who was secretary at that time, and head of the mortgage department, and he was promoted about that time—before advances were made on mortgage it was usual for the solicitor to report as to the title—I have searched but cannot find any report made by the solicitor as to the title in this case—the cheque for £41,777 10s. was paid on the 9th, and on the same day the Liberator received from George Newman and Co. a cheque for £25,000—I find on 18th March, 1890, a further sum of £4,000 advanced by the Liberator to George Newman and Co.—this is the counterfoil cheque-book—I find attached to it the requisition for that amount from George Newman—there is a letter of 18th March, 1890, signed by Newman to the Liberator. (<hi rend="italic">This was a reference to the Albert Hall estate, and stated that on the 18th the acceptance for</hi>£4,000 <hi rend="italic">would become due, and asked for a cheque to be able to take it up</hi>)—Newman and Co. had that amount from the Liberator less £22 for fees;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189303060118"/>
               <p>the cheque sent to Newman was for. £3,978—after that further sums were advanced to George Newman and Co., amounting to either £15,200 or. £13,500—I had letters from Newman and Co. from time to time asking for further amounts on account of the purchase—if the letter did not specify for what the money was wanted instructions would be taken from Wright, the financial manager, as to whether the amount then advanced was to be charged to purchase or building account—I have been through all these accounts frequently—I cannot swear that all the papers are here; most of the requisitions are pasted in the book—the ledger would show whether the money was advanced on purchase account, or on building; a separate account was kept of money advanced on buildings, and by comparing that with the general indebtedness you would get the amount—all the advances were made under the superintendence of Wright as financial manager, and by cheques which would be payable to Newman and Co.—the alteration in the minute-book is in Newman's writing, I believe.</p>

In June, 1891, I was head of the mortgage department—at that time the Liberator was in the habit of making a weekly advance of £1,000 to George Newman and Co. for building on the Albert Hall estate, and in the ordinary course I drew a cheque every week for £1,000 for Newman and Co., or two cheques amounting to that sum—on 12th June, 1891, I drew two cheques for. £500 each for theadvance—Wright in the ordinary course of business would come and see what advances were to be made and authorise any particular advance—Wright came on that day, and he and Newman came into the office within a very short time of one another—Wright asked me how much had been drawn, and I said £1,000; he said that would not be enough that week—Wright and Newman discussed the matter, and left the room together; they may have seen some other people about it; I was not present the whole of the time—Wright returned and told me I should have to draw a further £4,100—I commenced to draw a cheque for that amount, and filled up the counterfoil for that amount, and Wright then told me to draw it in two amounts, £2,500 and £1,600, and I drew two cheques for those amounts, making a total of £5,100 with the first £1,000, all payable to Newman and Co.—in the ordinary course cheques drawn in that way for advances would go to the offices of the solicitor to be fetched by the borrower; in this case the £2,500 was either taken away by Wright or handed to someone on his instructions, and the other one sent to Bonnor, Wright and Co. 's office to be fetched by Newman—that would be for the purpose of the solicitor preparing the necessary security—I was told the £2,500 cheque was paid into the London and General Bank by Wright—all these Companies banked there—I cannot say whose account he told me it went to—on instructions or information given me by Wright on 12th June, 1891, I wrote this letter of instructions to Bonnor, Wright and Co., with reference to this cheque—I don't remember seeing Newman endorsing the cheque; I don't remember where I got the information from that he had endorsed it—I gave instructions for an entry to be made in the mortgage</p>

               <p>I desire to amend my yesterday's evidence; I stated that the instructions for all the purchase cheques for the Albert Hall estate were issued under the supervision. of Mr. Wright; I cannot prove that as to the last four or five cheques—I have now made out a list of the cheques which were drawn on account of the purchase of the Albert Hall land and given by the Liberator—I find requisitions from Newman and Co. for those amounts with seven exceptions—I have shown the details—the counterfoils of the cheques are here, and show that they were drawn for purchasing advances apart from building advances, except one of July 22nd '90, for £500; they make a total of £19,500 over and above the cheque for £41,710 spoken of yesterday—I find in the minute-book of the Lands Allotment Company a minute signed by Newman and dated December 3rd, 1889, annexed to which is a letter dated December 4th, 1889, of George Newman, chairman of Newman and Co., Limited, requesting the Lands Allotment Company to endorse the bill and proposing to pay £1,000 for doing it, by draft at nine months from that date—I find in the-books of the Liberator on 6th March, 1876, "Resolved that Mr. H. S. Wright be appointed solicitor, and that an annual sum of £1,600 be paid to him," and on December 20th, 1887, I find a minute appointing Wright manager of the Liberator; the word "Official" being written in his own writing in pencil—the firm of Bonnor, Wright and Co., are appointed solicitors by a minute of January 9th, 1888—I find in the minute-book of the Lands Allotment Company of March 13th 1876, a minute appointing Mr. W. G. Wright, solicitor, at a salary of £350 in the place of Mr. Pattison, resigned; and in the minute-book of Newman and Co., of March 13th, 1886, when Wright, Newman and the secretary, who was another Newman, were present, I find a resolution that Bonnor, Wright and Co., be the solicitors for the Company.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Sir E. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLARKE</hi>. Before Mr. Wright was appointed solicitor he was financial manager, and his firm were the solicitors—in the requisition which makes up the £41,710 there is an item of £202 10s. for solicitor's charges—payments for solicitor's charges go out and remain with the Society, except payments out of pocket—they would be kept by the Society, the Society paying the solicitor—I had nothing to do with the receipt of the requisition or the dealing with it; Mr. Herbert Temple made the alterations; he was the head of the department, and became secretary in 1890—I do not know of my own knowledge on what information he made these figures; he is in Court—I used to see Mr. Wright almost every day: his duties were to attend to financial duties generally; he only had to do with me if I took his instructions for cheques to be drawn—I drew most of the cheques for the Albert Hall from his instructions—I did not attend the Board meetings; there was a summary showing what cheques had been drawn—I have not got any of them here—they were usually prepared by the secretary or by Mr. Temple—Mr. Brock was secretary then; he was here yesterday—I used to see the cash statements in the way of business; they showed the various receipts and payments—they are handed over to the Official Receiver—of £41,710 £25,000 went back as</p>

               <p>bonus to the Liberator—that was bonus on the general undertaking to finance—I presume the secretary would know whether there was any arrangement as to what amount that bonus of £25,000 was to cover somebody must know, I do not of my own knowledge—an account was kept in the book of advances made on the Albert Hall estate; I do not think I made any of the entries, or a very few of them, but when I drew cheques the instructions went from me in order to make up the mortgage account—I saw the account every day, it included every payment made on this account—I do not suggest that any advance was made which was not fully placed on the books of the Liberator—there were two committees, the finance committee and the survey committee—I used to attend the survey committee, because I was in the mortgage department, but not the finance committee—the survey committee used to report to the Board from Board meeting to Board meeting—Mr. Wright did not take any supervision of the books, the secretary had that duty—there were surveyors' certificates for £6,900 on the building which Newman was putting up after deducting the. £5,100—at the time this matter took place a balance of £12,000 was due to Newman and Co., which had to be met sooner or later.—I should take no instructions from New-man in drawing the cheque; he was there—I drew two cheques mak-ing up the. £1,000, and was then instructed to draw for. £4,100 more in two cheques—I had written the counterfoil of a cheque, and that was corrected, and it was divided into £1,600 and £2,500—on June 15th £1,594 8s. came back to the Liberator on account of repayment of other mortgages; that lessened the indebtedness of Newman and Co. to the Society, and on the same day £50 more was paid to the Liberator for interest on the Albert Hall and £2 10s. for law charges—Newman and Co. got their money, and the £1,600 practically came back to the Liberator as another advance—the £1,600 cheque is signed by Mr. Booth, one of the directors, and by the solicitor, and this is my pencil writing on the back; "Albert Hall £1,600, please exchange for cheque value £1,594 8s. to the order of the Liberator Company"—that was written before it went to the secretary, and before it went to Bonnor and Wright—the paying of that money out and in. was practically one transaction I believe—Newman got £1,600, and paid back £1,500 on other accounts—the £1,600 cheque was actually delivered over by me; not to Mr. Newman, we sent it to Bonnor and Thompson—the endorsement was put on on June 12th—the solicitor acting on the instructions in pencil, would hand over a cheque for £1,594 8s., which would go to various mortgage accounts on which Newman and Co. were indebted to the Liberator—I cannot remember whether Newman endorsed the cheque in my presence; I understood the solicitor that it had been paid into, the London and General Bank, by the letter which was read yester-day—I did not know to what account it was going.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. I have seen the instructions by which the cheque on account of the Albert Hall estate was conveyed to the Liberator Society, but I have not gone through the particulars—the total amount by the Liberator was £123,231 18s. 2d.; I am content to take that sum; I have not looked on the endorsements on the mortgages to see whether they are all in order—the £123,000 did not include the £25,000 bonus, that amount is due to the Society after crediting the £25,000 received by way of bonus—I do not know whether I can say that the amount advanced was not advanced as bonus; the £123,000 includes the £25,000</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189303060121"/>
               <p>paid for premium; the £123,000 includes the 7 per cent, interest—Mr. Newman had many transactions with the Liberator, some of them were of large amount; and this £1,594 went in reduction of moneys that had been advanced by the Liberator for other purposes—the certificates given by Mr. Bird were on the Albert Hall estate—some of the directors of the Lands Allotment Company were directors of the Liberator—the £1,000 to be paid to the Lands Allotment Company for endorsing Newman's bills was to be paid by bills—I believe that was afterwards altered to a payment of £1,000; I think it was just immediately after the date of that minute of 4th December that £1,000 was paid to the Lands Allot-ment Company—I supposed that the £2,500 was to be placed at the Lon-don and General Bank—I certainly did not know that it was going to be used for the debt of Mr. Wright—I do not know that £50 covered the whole of Newman's payments as surveyor to the Liberator—I have not calculated it, but I should think he took altogether several hundreds—I cannot point to entries, I may be mistaken—letter No. 30 probably went with the cheque to the solicitors, Bonnor, Wright and Co.—I did not know that it was the practice at Newman's for the secretary to go and get the cheques.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The office of the London and General Bank was in the same building and on the same floor as the Liberator; the Lands Allotment Company was also in the same building—I understood from Mr. Wright that the £2,500 cheque was going to be paid into the London and General Bank—I supposed it was to be paid into the account of Newman and Co.—Wright did not tell me so; he told me simply that it had gone into the London and General Bank—the cheque had been already drawn as an advance to Newman and Co.—he said nothing to indicate that it had gone to anyone else's account—the letter of 12th June was written in consequence of something that was told me by Wright—I should have to ask Wright what had become of the cheque, so as to enable me to inform the solicitors that they were right in getting a charge for it—it was in consequence of what Wright said to me that I wrote the letter of 12th June, 1891—Stocks was secretary to Newman and Co.—the whole of the £12,000 for surveyors' certificates was subsequently liquidated, partly by the £5,100; but fresh certificates were coming in, and fresh pay<lb/>ments—the £2,500 was not paid twice over to Newman and Co., only this one of 12th June, 1891—this memorandum attached to the requisi<lb/>tion for £41,000 is in Wright's handwriting; the increased amount is entered.</p>

I am now in the service of the defendant Newman—I was formerly secretary to George Newman and Co., Limited—in Novem<lb/>ber and December, 1889, I was bookkeeper to the Company—I remember the purchase of the Albert Hall land—in this mortgage ledger of Newman and Co., at page 34, there is an account headed" Albert Hall Purchase Account; there is one account showing the moneys received, and another showing the money paid—on 18th December, 1889, I find the receipt of a cheque for £41,770 10s. from the Liberator Building Society; on 24th March, 1890, a further sum of £4,000, and further sums up to 20th March, 1891, amounting to £12,400; altogether the total is £58,177—in Septem<lb/>ber, 1891, there is a receipt on the purchase account from the Liberator in four amounts: September 4th, 11th, 18th, and 27th, for £2,000 each—all those entries are made without showing whether they are for purchase</p>

               <p>account or building account—the total amount received from the Liberator on the purchase account of the Albert Hall is. £54,177 10s.—it was booked to the building account—there is nothing here to show that it was on the building account, it is simply "cash"—if it was for purchase I should put it down "Purchase," so I took it for building account—"Cash" means building account—whenever "Cash" is found in this book it means build-ing account—the cash-book would show how the £41,177 was disposed of—my pencil entries are in this book (<hi rend="italic">the mortgage ledger</hi>)—this has an entry showing how the £41,000 was disposed of—I made these pencil entries from the cash-book, for my own purpose, only so that I should see at any time how this account was made up; special minutes to show that—£25,000 was paid back to the Liberator, and £1,000 was paid to the Lands Allotment Company for backing the bills, £7,500 for the ground-rent, and, £277 10s. for costs and fees, leaving a balance of. £8,000 entered as cash paid for the purchase of the premises—turning to the cash-book at page 260 the entry shows how the, £8,000 was dealt with: "Johnson and Steele, on account of purchase, £8,000," under the heading" Albert Hall, 18th December"—going back to the mortgage ledger, at page 141, Decem<lb/>ber 10th, 1889, the. £8,000 is entered under the heading "K. B. Johnson Bartleet, to purchase money. £26,000, made up by £8,000 cash, and £18,000 bills—that is under the heading of "Albert Hall land"—there is no record in our books of the disposal of £4,000, the difference between the £8,000 and the £4,000 paid in cash—my instructions to make these entries in the cash-book, which I copied in pencil from the mortgage ledger, would be either from the solicitors of the Company or the chair<lb/>man, Mr. Newman, the defendant—a cheque was drawn by Newman and Co. on the 18th December for the £8,000—this is it, it is an open cheque payable to R. B. Johnson, bearer, signed George Newman and Charles Newman—after that date Newman and Co. accepted bills on account of this purchase to the amount of £18,000, making a total, with those cheques, of £26,000 out of the coffers of Newman and Co., on account of this purchase—two of those bills were discounted by Newman and Co. them-selves, the rest were met at maturity—this cheque for £1,000 was paid to the Lands Allotment Company—in June, 1891, I was secretary to the Com<lb/>pay—at that date we were in the habit of receiving an advance of £1,000 weekly from the Liberator—on 12th June, 1891, I received two cheques of £500 each, and another for £1,600, all marked "Albert Hall"—I went to the office of Bonnor, Wright and Co. to fetch them, in accordance with the ordinary practice, I there saw the letter (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 30) written by Coleworth referring to a further advance of £2,500 made to us that day—seeing that letter I did not ask for the £2,500 cheque, because the letter states that it was delivered into the London and General Bank—I spoke to Mr. Newman about it the first time I saw him, not the same day, within a day or so—to the best of my recollection I brought the letter away from Bonnor, Wright and Co. 's, and showed it to Mr. Newman, and he in<lb/>structed me it was to open an account in the bank in the name of New-man and Co.—I thereupon made an entry in the mortgage ledger, deposit folio 33, "To cash £2,500"—I kept that book—by that entry that £2,500 appears to be paid into Newman's account—when the pass-book came back from the bank I looked to see whether Newman and Co. had been credited with that amount—I spoke to Newman about it at various times; when making up the accounts, between June and December, I called his</p>

Wright—he drew a cheque for £1,000 on that day and paid it in to Newman; we sent the cash; I can't say as to the cheque; I don't say it was paid in gold; I can't say if it was paid in notes; it is not taken through the cash-book; if it was paid into the bank in cash it would appear in the cash-book; probably it never came into the office; from the entry I believe it did not come through the office—we have credited Wright with £1,000, and it had been paid away in part purchase of the Albert Hall land; it was simply brought through the journal, crediting Wright with money advanced on account of the purchase of Albert Hall—I see that, by the book—I should have instructions from the Chairman to make that entry</p>

               <p>—I must have had it from him; the Chairman instructed me to make the entry crediting. £1,000 to Wright—if Wright had in fact paid over a cheque or cash for £1,000 to Newman and Co. it would have appeared in our cash-book, if paid into the bank—if we kept it in the till it would be entered in the cash-book—it does not appear in the cash-book; it is in the journal—I say I do not believe we received. £1,000 from Wright that day—I say we did not receive it in cash—on the mortgage which was executed to the Liberator, I signed a receipt for this total sum of £5,100 on 12th June, 1891.</p>

               <p>6th, 1889, and I know nothing about the resolutions of that date—I find in that minute a report as to various building transactions in which the Company was engaged—there is the Albert Hall land, upon which the chairman would report—Wright also reported on that date on the Albert Hall land—there is a report as to Billiter Street—it does not say by whom; but it was by one of the directors who had charge of it—that was Mr. William Newman—there is a report about Walbrook—it says. nothing about who had charge of that j-but it would be Mr. William Newman—there is a report as to Chingford of which William Newman had charge, also of Catford, of which Mr. Daniel Newmam had charge—there is also Sherringham and Bognor—wherever I find reports made and nothing said about their being absent, those persons were present at the meeting—on 18th March, 1890, there were bills maturing in respect of the Albert Hall—under the heading "Johnson" there are three bills of Sarle of £666 13s., and each maturing on 21st March—they were met at maturity—I also find on that day two bills for £5,000 each, due in respect of the purchase, also given to Newman—they were bills of Sarle and Johnson, endorsed by the Lands Allotment Company—it is reported that they did not endorse all the lot—the Lands Allotment did hack all the bills that Johnson and Sarle had—the £2,000 was a portion of those bills—I do not find £1,000 worth of bills entered as given to George Newman at that time—I find maturing on 31st March two bills of Newman and Co. for £5,000 each, drawn by Byron and Johnson—I have not got who was the actual drawer of those bills—in the bill-book two bills are entered as maturing on 21st March of £600 each—that is in my writing—I have no doubt that those bills were drawn payable on that day—there is no sum received from the Liberator Building Society on account of the Albert Hall estate that is not entered in these books that I kept—I have made no distinction between the way in which the money was applied, whether by way of interest or the building of the houses—every farthing is entered which the Liberator Society advanced in respect of the Albert Hall estate, and since I became secretary all the moneys I received have been endorsed on the mortgage securities, signed by me and then entered in the books—on Friday, 12th June, I knew I had ✗ cheques, two for £500 and one for £1,600—I signed also for £2,500, as having been received by Newman and Co. from the Liberator—I did not get that myself, but believed it would be paid into the London and General Bank-r-having signed for the £5,100, I credited the Liberator Building Society as having paid £500, £500, £1,600,. and £2,500, and they' are on the debit side of my cash-book—I credited myself with the £2,500 in the London and General Bank account, and then posted it to the debit of the London and General Bank, assuming that amount was at the Bank, and that in due course it would be credited in the pass-book—I did not suppose it was put on deposit—when I spoke to Newman of this transaction, lie said he was trying to get the money—at the end of the year he said he could not get it, and it must be written off—This is the entry relating to the £1,000 in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi>) "£1,000 for moneys advanced on account of purchase money Albert Hall, two bills due March 21st, 1891. £500 each."—I suppose I wrote it at the time, 30th June—I take it according to this, that Wright advanced us £1,000, taking these two bills. In the new bills book the entry of the two bills is "£500 each, due 21st March, 1891. Discounted 27.6.90."—I have no doubt Wright dis<lb/>counted</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The entry only shows that Wright had two of Newman's bills for £500 each—the entry from the journal into the ledger shows that Wright paid £1,000 to Newman—the cash-book does not show it—I did not understand that the £2,500 was on deposit in the ordinary sense—the entry in the mortgage ledger is London and General Bank Deposit £2,500—there is no entry of these sums in the books of George Newman and Co. to which the word <hi rend="italic">deposit</hi> is not attached—I said before the magistrate, speaking of this entry in the mortgage ledger, "That represents that the £2,500 has been deposited at the Bank to our credit." I looked for it in the pass-book, because I expected to have it returned out of the Bank and placed to our credit—I did not find it, and spoke to Newman about it—there is a declaration of interest by Henry Granville Wright in George Newman and Co.—William Newman reported on a Building Estate at Chingford—he is another director, also Daniel Newman and Charles and John Henry Newman—George Newman, junior, was secretary at this time, and George Newman, senior, was chairman—he held nearly the whole of the shares—the total issue was 2,500 shares at £10—at the date of the liquidation he held 818—from 1889 to 1891 he held them all—he did not pay any cash for them—there was an attendance-book of the directors which was handed over by Newman to the Official Receiver—I did not see it handed over, nor did I attend afterwards at the Official Receiver's to see if there was such a book—I have not seen it since—the books were always under my notice (<hi rend="italic">A copy of the transfer of</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st December,</hi> 1891, <hi rend="italic">of George Newman's interest to George Newman and Co. was here put in</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I was a director of the Liberator Building Society, and believe I so acted in 1889, when Wright was acting as solicitor and financial manager of the Society—he advised the directors as to making advances on property and reported, as solicitor on the title—the minutes show I was present on 20th November, 1889, when the proposal of George Newman and Co., came before the Board—Wright was there and, to the best of my recollection, Newman—the proposal was that the Liberator should finance George Newman and Co., in respect of the Albert Hall property, and the resolution come to on that day was, that the proposal of George Newman and Co. should be formulated by Wright and that George Newman and Co. should be encouraged to proceed with their proposal—I was present at the Board meeting of 4th December, 1889, and Wright was there—Mr. Binfield Bird, deceased, the surveyor would be there, and, to the best of my knowledge, Newman was present, when a letter was read from George Newman and Co.—the formulated proposal of the previous meeting—it was then announced that George Newman and Co. had arranged to take over the building agreement for the Albert Hall land, and that £7,500 was to be paid in advance and £40,500 would be required immediately to commence operations—I certainly believed it was genuine—"It was resolved to grant the application now made on the terms that the loan be for twelve months, subject to further stipulations as to future bonuses in case of agreement to renew—interest on the whole loan to be at the rate of 7 per cent., per annum"—that resolution had reference to the letter of 3rd December, attached—I knew nothing of the sale of this contract to George Newman and Co. for £26,000—I am not</p>

               <p>aware of any minute authorising an advance in regard to the purchase of this property beyond the £40,500—the next date I find in the minutes is 12th December—this cheque for £41,777 10s. is signed by Davis and Brock, directors, and Mr. Koch, secretary—it is not countersigned by Wright—it was his duty as solicitor to countersign all mortgage cheques—this is not a mortgage cheque—I am surprised to see it—this is the first time I have seen that these figures in this resolution have been scratched out—I had no knowledge that the authorised advance of £40,500 had been increased, on 9th December, to an advance of £41,777 10s.—looking at this counterfoil and requisition attached it appears that a further sum of £3,978 was paid by the Liberator Society on 18th March, 1890—it is recorded that J. T. Wright, the secretary and the surveyor were present at the meeting of the 26th March, 1890, the minute is, "Newman and Co., Albert Hall, advance of £4,000 to pay deposits on this purchase approved"—if my name does not appear I should say I was not present—I know of no division of money under which £3,000 went to George Newman and £5,000 to Henry Granville Wright.</p>

I was present at the meeting of the 20th March, 1889, when the matter was first introduced to the Board; Mr. Pattison in the chair; present Mr. Brock, Mr. Binfield Bird, surveyor and director, Mr. Davis, Major Wright, and the financial manager, Wright—the surveyor at that time would be either Walker or Barnes—I was thinking of another society—I cannot state the details of the proposal—on 4th December, new proposals were made—probably Newman took it on his own account so as to satisfy the requirements of the commissioners, but we never considered that we were to pay more for that—it was merely for the convenience of all concerned—we were not going to buy the property—I do not suggest that in the letter received at the meeting of 4th December—Newman was stating the matter inaccurately—it does not state the amount to be paid by Newman or Newman and Company for this agreement, but it says the agreement in question will be between the Exhibition Commissioners and George Newman—i.e., Newman personally, who agrees to assign to the company—it does not say" for certain considerations," if it said that we should not nave done it—there is a resolution giving details—"the application now made" is for £150,000 upon the surveyor's certificate, an immediate advance being granted of £40,500—that is divided into portions, £25,000 was to come back immediately as bonus to the Liberator—the advance is to bear 7 per cent; £7,500 is required for deposit—£32,500 leaving £8,000—it never occurred to me that this property was going to be bought for £8,000—in September 1890, I was appointed joint financial manager for perhaps a month or two—I had left the Liberator some time and was asked to come back and to assist in the financial managership, as Wright, I understood, was going to Ireland—I think I got £250 a year for it—there was doubtless a deed in respect of the advances made, which would be in the hands of the solicitor—I don't remember seeing it—I will not say that I ever heard or asked how much was given for this property by the persons who were carrying on the building operations.</p>

Wright"—that was not answered, but within a short time of receiving it I saw Wright at the bank, when I believe we had a conversation of the same purport as before—he said the loan was not his, and I again said I could not treat the account in any other way than as a loan owing by him; that I did not know then, and I do not know now, what his arrangements were with Balfour, and that he must pay it—on 12th June, 1891, he brought me this cheque on the bank for. £2,500 by the directors of the Liberator Building Society in favour of George Newman and Co., and endorsed "George Newman and Co."—he said, "This is to pay off the balance of that loan in my name"—I credited and closed his loan account with it, debiting the interest and commission due to his current account, which account was already overdrawn by between £200 and £300—he said nothing about the Brighton Electric-Light Supply shares, and we retained them—I think Balfour's acceptance was returned—George Newman and Co. banked with us at that time—their account was overdrawn to the extent of £25,837 current account plus £47,000 on loan account—the £2,500 was never placed to the credit of George Newman and Co.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> Sir <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD CLARKE</hi>. This account in our books is a loan to Wright, absolutely, and the resolution so refers to it—we should have no authority to deal with it in any other way—the same day the £7,500 was credited to Wright—it went out to Balfour to whom the securities belonged—the bills were also his acceptances—I don't know when the pass-book came to the bank—we could tell when it was left and made up—I don't think there were any transactions with the account between May, 1890, and June, 1891—in May, 1890, there was a balance in Wright's favour Of £8 10s. 10d.—I see there are two little items of interest credited—he had also a loan of £550—that he considered he was responsible for—the interest on the £7,600 was always charged to his account—I do not say he acknowledged his liability in respect of the £7,500, but it always appeared in his pass-book, and he must have known it—I do not know that he always disputed the interest and commission—he did, I think, shortly after the commencement of the loan—I said at the police court" he always refused to pay this commission because he said he was not liable"—I am aware that the Official Receiver of the Bank called on him to pay, that he refused and that the matter is still open—I see in the minute of the 15th April, 1891, referring to renewal of loans, "H. G. Wright, £2,500," and between the name and the amount, in parentheses, "J. S. B."—then comes "H. G. Wright, £550."</p>

I am afraid there is some confusion as to date—in this loan account there are three accounts open there—some portion of it is marked "House and Land Investment Trust" because it was a joint loan—the money went to Newman in each case and was all put to his credit.</p>

I said, "I could not do that, for the London and General Bank was the Liberator's own bank"—he said, "I relied entirely on what Wright told Mr. I signed the cheque and he took it—subsequently I found I could not get the money. I applied to Wright several times on the subject, and he said the money had been applied to the purposes of Balfour, and suggested that I should draw upon him. I did so by a bill for £2,500. It was presented and dishonoured. I spoke to Wright again on the subject, and suggested that I should again draw on him. I drew two bills, one for £1,500 and one for £1,000, and they were both dishonoured. Ultimately I found I could not get the money and I advised the directors, to write it off in fees, but I did not abandon the hope of ultimately getting if—I asked him where the bills were—he said they would be amongst his effects taken possession of by Balfour—I have seen nothing of them.</p>

Block and Co. on order—it has been returned to us by our bankers; is is endorsed—on 28th November, I saw them again at the Corn Exchange; Tallett asked if we had had a bid for them; I said "No"—I wrote to them that night, and on November 30th they came again; and Tallett asked if I had disposed of the goods; I said "No"—I wrote again that evening, as I had sold a portion of the peas for. £19 2s. 8d.—they had got £15, and next day they came to Seething Lane and Tallett wanted £5 more—this is my cheque for. £5 similarly drawn, endorsed and paid—next day, December 2nd, I saw them at the Corn Exchange, and Tallett spoke about bringing another bill of lading to us for 80 bags of beans, and asked me to land them in the same way as the previous parcel—I agreed, but they were not landed; our barge was too late getting to the ship, and they were landed at Brewers Quay instead—Tallett said he should like some money on the bill of lading, could we do it; I said I did not know—next day they came to Seething Lane, and I made them an advance on the 80 bags by this cheque, which was similarly drawn, endorsed and paid—that was the last transaction I had with them—the 60 bags of beans are still at our wharf, and the 80 bags at Brewers Quay—the 60 bags were marked H.

               <p>of lading, which I said was no security, and then he gave me this document "35 bags of beans, we cannot deliver above to Messrs. Woolf and Co., before Monday morning, which we shall do"—I was satisfied and advanced him £10, because I saw they were going to deliver the beans—it was past banking hours, and I gave him cash—on November 1st he came again; I told him I had not sufficient information, but I would let him have another £10, which I advanced by this cheque, which was paid by my bank—on November 28th he came again, and I gave him another £10 by the cheque which has been paid—he came several times after that—he said he had another consignment of 50 bags of beans, and asked me to make an advance just to tide him over for a time—he gave me a sample—I advanced him on those two consignments £34 in cash, and I paid £3 or £4 for expenses, his charges and so on; altogether I paid him £37 3s. 6d.—those goods are now lying at Mr. Burgoyne's, wharfinger, and produce warehouse, Commercial Road, East—there was some injunction or something to restrain them from parting with them—this is Burgoyne's receipt for them—on November 19th this document was signed in my presence: "Burdett and Dusanlier," by Dusanlier, "25 sacks of beans marked P. K., and a bag P. H., on account of which we have received advice from you"—this invoice was given to me by Dusanlier subsequently—I had no other transactions with him—Oudet came occasionally, I under-stood him to be Dusanlier's clerk; he came sometimes with Mr. Sandoz, and sometimes alone—I should say he came in reference to both these bean transactions when we advanced money to Dusanlier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Badget and others, provision dealers, of Bristol—in July last I received a letter from Chevallier and Co., 28, John Street, West Smithfield, which is lost; I sent them prices of ham and bacon in consequence—I then received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Dated August</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th, ordering twenty-five hams stating that they paid through their bankers at seven days, less 11/2 per cent for cash, and giving references.</hi>)—I wrote to the references, and received this letter from Sandoz (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Chevallier and Co. were good for reasonable credit.</hi>)—I received this telegram from Hereford Brothers: "We trusted them to £100: were paid"—we then began to supply Chevallier and Co. with goods—on 7th August we sent ham and bacon value £7 8s. 4d; and on August 30th goods value £32 3s. 4d., £7 13s. 7d., and £14 13s. 10d.—I got this letter of September 2nd from Chevallier and Co. (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the arrival of the goods.</hi>)—on September 5th we sent further goods value £10 19s., and on September 6th goods value £13 19s. 10d., and on September 7th goods value £33 5s. 2d.—on September 9th we received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging the receipt of fifty hams.</hi>)—on 17th September we sent further goods value £10 0s. 7d.—the total value of the goods we supplied was £129 Os. 11/2d., all despatched to London by the Great Western Bail way—we have never been paid anything—I received this letter of 16th September (<hi rend="italic">Apologising for not tending a cheque, as their arrivals of damaged butter and eggs were heavy, and promising to send one next week.</hi>)—on September 22nd we got this letter: <hi rend="italic">u</hi> We have your wire; surprised no letter; we think you are under a mis<lb/>apprehension about sending 100 sides on Tuesday and 100 afterwards; we are quite prepared to send you a cheque on delivery; any further delay will complicate matters and cause unpleasantness"—I have never seen any of the prisoners—I believed there was a genuine firm of Chevallier and Co. 28, St. John Street, and that the references were genuine.</p>

I am a clerk at the London and Midland Bank, Clerkenwell Branch—there was an account there in the name of Chevallier and Co., 28, St. John Street, of which a certified copy is in Court, and I have the pass-book—the account was opened on 29th April, 1892, with £300—a cheque-book was given on May 2nd—from that day to June 29th, £123 8s. was paid in—on the same day as the £300 is credited £100 was drawn out, payable to Sells—four cheques were drawn in favour of Sandoz and two to Lavender—the account was exhausted on July 2nd by a cheque for £10 18s. 1d., when we requested him to close it because we were not satisfied, and also in consequence of numerous enquiries we had made about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Loudon Trading Bank, 12, Coleman Street—I produce a copy of the account of Alexander Sandoz and Co., certified by the manager, which shows that on April 2nd, 1892, £50 was paid in and no other sum whatever—the account was open from April 2nd to June 8th, and between those dates the whole of that amount was drawn out—eleven days after the opening of the account there was only £2 13s. lid.—the account was closed and 4s. 3d. was charged for commission—I do not recognise either of the prisoners coming to the bank—these cheques signed E. Chevallier and Co. are in the writing of the customer in whose name the account was opened—on that cheque being produced I should cash it, and place the debit to E. Chevallier's account.</p>

Mullor came with him—in a few days Sandoz brought Guinat, who gave an order for £4 or £5—the goods were supplied, but I have only received £2 which Guinat paid on account a little time after<lb/>wards—Sandoz agreed to pay cash; I understood him to be clerk or traveller in a small way; he gave his address <hi rend="smallCaps">49A</hi>, Milton Street—I have been there repeatedly and found the door fastened, and a notice on it "Return presently."</p>

Chevallier and Co."—I went to that address, and saw Chevallier and Dusanlier—Chevallier said, "This is a friend of mine," and that he assisted them with his advice—the business was a provision merchant's, and was engaged as corresponding clerk, my salary to commence at 25s. a week, and I remained till the first week in October—I attended daily from nine to five—28, St. John Street, is a three-floored house, and three rooms on each floor, and cellars which were not occupied—they were the only tenants—the front room was used as a store; there were some empty bottles and cases there and a few tins of vegetables—the office furniture was a small desk and a stool—there were empty cases and boxes standing about the place, and anybody coming in might suppose they were full—during the whole time I was there no goods were stored there—room No. 2 was the office where I sat, the room behind that, No. 3, was kept as Chevallier's private office; he attended there from eight a.m. and through<lb/>out the day—he used to take the letters in the morning—Dusanlier occupied the private room, the door of which was kept shut—Chevallier</p>

               <p>wrote letters throughout the day—Dusanlier remained sometimes an hour; he came two or three times a day—Auguste was his Christian name; I understood his name was Bondet—I have seen him reading letters to the firm and correcting letters sent by Chevallier to customers, also give Chevallier money—in the private office there was a double desk and sort of lifting table, on two legs—Dusanlier used to come and sit opposite Chevallier—Oudet called at 28, John Street, two or three times a week—he went into the private room, and sometimes passed the time with me outside—he has been in the private room when Dusanlier and Chevallier were there—he sometimes remained there a quarter of an hour, no more, often less—I did not hear their conversation—he appeared to be a friend—I gathered that he came to pass the time—I have seen Block at 28, John Street, two or three times a week—he was in the private room when Eevahter Dusanlier, and Oudet were there—goods were ordered by letter—I did the writing-goods came to the door; once or twice they were discharged there and immediately taken away—I recollect Paul, the Great Western carman, coming five times—I went once or twice with him to Mr. Webster with bacon and ham in accordance with Chevallier's instruc<lb/>tions—Chevallier went also, and I went to pass the cart over the weighbridge at West Smithfield and pay the tolls, which, being a Frenchman, he could not do—I have also been with goods from John Street to Mr. Harris's—I re<lb/>mained at John Street till the first week in October, when the prisoners left—on the Saturday they left, Chevallier saying he was unwell and would be better away for a day or two—on the Monday I opened the place and did not find them there—Dusanlier called in Chevallier's absence—letters were delivered and taken away in the morning before I got there; I know that because Block asked me to come and meet Chevallier, and he had the letters in his hand—on the Monday morning Block came and asked me to go to Chevallier at a public-house near—I went there, and found Chevallier—he said he wished delivery of goods from Thompson Brothers, of Dundee, which were at Willow Walk, he had a letter from them that morning addressed to John Street—on the Wednesday I went to Willow Walk—on the way I called at 192, Bermondsey Street—Chevallier asked me to call as they were going to see the goods and telegraph for a delivery order—I saw Block and Chevallier at Bermondsey Street—Chevallier told me to telegraph to Thompson Brothers that he agreed the price and would thank them to send the delivery order to Willow Walk—I did telegraph—about three weeks after I left their employment on the Wednesday I saw Dusanlier, who said he had capital that he intended to bank, and start a business in the orange and provision trade—he asked me to become corresponding clerk on the same terms as I had been withe Chevallier, 25s. a week—offices were taken at Monument House on 25th October—the name put up was" Burdett and Dusanlier"—I never saw Burdett—I saw Oudet, the other clerk, who began his duties there at the same time as I did—we wrote letters there—there were two rooms, a private room and an office—Oudet sat with me in the office—an india-rubber stamp was used to sign letters per procuration—Oudet added the initials "E. P."—I cannot explain that—I remember goods coming from Kruger—Oudet asked for his salary oftener than he got it—it was about 25s. a week, but he got it a few shillings at a time—I have been to Hereford Brothers, of Fore Street, Avenue—I saw nobody named Hereford—I have written letters to Hereford—I never came across Mr. Franklin—I did not</p>

Chevallier" looks like his writing—the endorsements on the Midland Bank cheques I believe are Dusanlier's—Dusanlier asked me to write this letter from 130, Gower Street; I refused; he said if I would write an English copy he could write it, and when he got the copy he signed it—I knew Block as La Font—I heard of Gaudet fils as merchants who had given them bills and from whom they were trying to get money—I knew of no busi<lb/>ness done by Gaudet fils.</p>

I went to John Street on 15th August—I saw Block there the next day or so as a visitor—I believe he was an acquaintance of Chevallier, who told me he had lately come from France—Dusanlier quarrelled violently with Block in October, just after I left John Street—I did not know La Font was Block until he started in business as Block—I said at the Police-court that he had taken the name of Block, not that his name was Block—they came to blows, and I do not think Dusanlier would give Block a reference of character after that.</p>

Block and Co. "; no de<lb/>scription—no goods were on the premises, but there was a large quantity of papers and boxes similar to those at Milton Street—I afterwards went with Sexton to 44, Richmond Road, Barnsbury, where Dusanlier lodged, a private house—I searched the room he occupied, where I found a bunch of keys similar to the keys found upon Oudet, and which open the ware-house at 49A, Milton Street, also number 3, Fore Street Avenue, premises lately occupied by Hereford Brothers; that warehouse was completely empty—we also searched the premises occupied by Burdett and Dusan<lb/>lier at Monument House, two rooms on the third floor—in the room marked "Private," which was pointed out as being occupied by Dusan<lb/>lier, were a table, a letter-press, two chairs, and a desk—in the clerk's office was a type-writing machine, one desk, two chairs, and a large quantity of delivery notes and books, some of which, with fine press letter books, apparently belong to Sandoz, of <hi rend="smallCaps">49A</hi>, Milton Street—those were in a cupboard at Monument House, also two letter<lb/>files,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 14th December, I went with Leman to Monument House about 4. 30 p.m.—I met Dusanlier—I asked him his name—he said "Oudet"—I said "Oudet, will you kindly write it?"—he wrote it on this paper—he said, "Why do you ask? I do not speak English"—I told him he would have to go to the Police-station; he accompanied me there—I then asked him in French his name—he said, "Dusanlier"—I then read my warrant to him; he made no answer—leaving him at the station, I went back to the offices at Monument House, where I found Oudet and Davidson—I told Oudet I should charge him with being concerned, and I said, "If there be a Burdett, I presume you are Mr. Burdett"—he said that he only wrote letters and Dusanlier signed them—I returned to the Police-station and brought Dusanlier back to the office, when he said in French to Oudet, "My poor boy, I am sorry I have given your name; I suppose the police have found it out"; and to me, "If I could get the money would not Mr. Brooks cease to prosecute?"—they were arrested in connection with the haricot beans—they were taken to the station and charged—Oudet made no reply—he seemed astonished that he should be charged with conspiracy, quite amazed and astounded—Dusanliner said, "I will try and get the money by Saturday and settle the whole thing; I know I have done wrong"—the same evening I went to 192, Bermondsey Street, the premises of Block and Co.—upon pushing past Dumont I found Chevallier immediately behind the door in the office on the ground floor—I asked him his name—he said "Chevallier"—I said, "Oh, I am pleaded you are Chevallier; I am a police officer; you will have to accompany me across the road to the Police-station," which he did—I first asked him if Mr. Block was in—he said, "No, he is not in town"—I conveyed Dumont and Chevallier to the Police-station—on returning, Block was standing downstairs talking to a Sergeant of the M division—he was taken to the station and charged—he made no reply—I searched the rooms at 192, Bermondsey Street—I found the documents produced marked C1 to C30—they appear to be letters and telegrams from Kroger and Co.—I found a number of press letter copy books, and a quantity of correspondence and banking accounts referring to the business of E. Chevallier and Co., 28, St. John Street, West Smithfield—at Monument House I found the documents marked B1 to B25, being letters from Kroger to Burdett and Dusanlier—I searched Oudet, and found on him the documents produced, including four cards of "Dusanlier and Co., Export and Import Produce Merchants"; six cards of Alexander Sandoz and Co., Exporters and Importers, 49A, Milton Street"; this top of a piece of note-paper with a printed heading, "E. Thompson, The Foreign Produce Agency, 45, Sid-mouth Street, London, W. C. "; a memorandum form from Sandoz and Co., London, to Messrs. Dickens and Co., of Coventry, signed "Sandoz and Co.," of 14th December, '92; two addressed envelopes, another envelope torn open and addressed to Sandoz and Co., 49A, Milton Street, with a letter inside. (<hi rend="italic">Applying for references of Dusanlier and Co.</hi>), and a stamped envelope for reply to H. C. Webster, four pawntickets in the names of James Pyhe, Marius Oudet, and James Morris; a type-written letter from Manchester, of 14th December, signed "A. Sandoz and Co. "; a bill<lb/>head from Manchester, with "Messrs. Sandoz and Co., debtors to Ralph Hurdle, tanner and leather factor, £6 15s. 2d." on it; a similar in-invoice for £38 10s. due to Bateman Brothers, of 9th December; a letter</p>

               <p>from 49A, Milton Street (<hi rend="italic">The one translated</hi>), a letter from the Nether<lb/>lands Steam Distillery Company, addressed to Burdett and Dusanlier, which Oudet tore when I was speaking to him at Monument House—he had appeared distressed, but was cooler then—Leman picked up the letter, and I put it together—I searched 192, Bermondsey Street, and found a large amount of correspondence referring to the business of E. Chevallier and Co., 28, St. John Street; a large number of letters addressed to Messrs. Bondet, 11, Beauchamp Place, Brompton Road, S. W., and signed by Gaudet, of Dijon; a lot of correspondence with the name cut out and "28, St. John Street" still remaining; letters addressed "My dear La Font," cheque-books, banking accounts, &amp;c., of Chevallier; a parcel of blank bills of Chevallier, 28, St. John Street; and note-paper headed "The Foreign Produce Agency," &amp;c.—45, Sidmouth Street is Mrs. Cox's address—I found a number of unpaid bills, and press letter copy books—I found on Dusanlier ten pawntickets, one being for £6 10s. on two diamond rings pawned by Marius Oudet; a card "Chevallier and Co., West Smithfield"; receipts, registered letters, and a letter from a Mr. Wolf—on Chevallier I found a card, "Mrs. Cox, 45, Sidmouth Street," six pawntickets, some cards of Block and Co. and of Chevallier and Co., and note-paper with Block's name on it—I saw Block sign this authority to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> up the type-writer.</p>

A. Hopkins, and with the seal of the Court—he then paid me the principal and interest of the loan, and took the bicycle away.</p>

On the evening of Sunday, 19th February, I was on duty near Battersea Rise with Stephens and Hopkins—I saw the prisoner pass the front of the Freemasons' Tavern, which was well lighted—we followed him—he went through Strathblaine Road—I followed him about sixty yards off—I had india-rubber-soled boots on and plain clothes—he paused opposite a house about the centre of Strathblaine Road, and examined it up and down—it was well lighted—he then went to No. 17, and gave one loud knock at the door—there was a small garden—perhaps it was six feet from the gate to the doorway, and a rather wide path—there appeared to be no answer to his knock—shortly after he gave two knocks louder, and the next I heard was a noise as of a door being opened—there was not more than half-a-minute between each of the noises I heard—I was within 30 yards of him—I got down the other side of the road by climbing from one front garden to another, and got within thirty or forty yards of him—I then saw the prisoner rush out of No. 17—he came straight out through the front door; the gate was open—he turned short to the right, and ran away, and as he did so there was a noise of something like metal being thrown away, and his right hand went like that—I gave chase—he turned to the left into Strathblaine Terrace, and then into St. John's Road, where I lost sight of him—I ran round in the opposite direction, where I knew the prisoner would be likely to come, with the view of meeting him in the tunnel of Clapham Junction—I just had time to get through and on the top of the steps leading to the plat<lb/>form, where I met the prisoner among ten or a dozen people, who were evidently just leaving a train—that was perhaps five minutes afterwards—I told the prisoner I was a police-constable and took him into custody</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Casling, an oilman, of 1, Elsted Street, Walworth—on 28th January I went to bed about a quarter to one—my house was properly locked up—about twenty minutes to six I was awoke by the police—my place was all open—I found the catch of the kitchen window had been forced back—it was fastened when I went to bed—that window and the kitchen door were opened—a panel of the door was broken so that a hand could be put through and unbolt it, and a pane of glass in the shop door was broken, and someone had got through into the shop—the tills had been taken out into the yard and emptied—I had left about £1 in copper and silver in the tills the night before—there was also taken a lady's long cloak, two lady's jackets, an overcoat, a pair of trousers, a pair of boots, two hats, a silver brooch and earrings—these are the trousers—they are corduroy; they were hanging on the guard—they are a very old pair of my son's; but I had mended them and they have been cut down since—these socks were my son's too. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BUTLER</hi> (30 <hi rend="largeCaps">LR</hi>). On 4th Feburary I arrested the prisoner in Phelp Street, Walworth, where he was loitering with two other persons—he was wearing these cord trousers—I charged him with loitering; he made no reply—the same morning we found out about the trousers, and Leonard brought the prosecutor and another witness up, and the prisoner was asked about them, and he said, "I bought them of another man for <hi rend="smallCaps">1B</hi>. 6d."—that is as much as they are worth, no doubt—when I stopped him in street he took this ordinary table-knife from his pocket and threw it away—I picked it up and said, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> What is this t"—he said, "Oh, that is my knife"—I said, What did you throw it away for!"—he said, "I didn't want you to see it"—the knife might be used for pushing a catch back—he was wearing these socks.</p>

About three p.m. on 28th January, the day this burglary was committed, I saw the prisoner at Rodney Street Police-station, Walworth; he gave his wife into custody for bigamy; he was then wearing these trousers—afterwards, when the prisoner was charged, I asked him how he accounted for possession of the trousers and stockings—he said, "It is no use knocking my head against you"—I asked for an account of whom he bought them of, or where he got them from, so that I could make enquiry; he made no reply; all he said was he had bought them—the burglary was effected by forcing back the catch of the kitchen window; it might have been done by this knife, and the panel of the door leading to the kitchen was broken, and a pane of glass in the door leading from the parlour into the shop.</p>
