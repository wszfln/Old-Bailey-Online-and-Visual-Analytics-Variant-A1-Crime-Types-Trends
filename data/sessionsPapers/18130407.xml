             I am an officer of Bow-street office. On the 1st of March last, I went to the house of Miss Brodrick, in <placeName id="t18130407-2-crimeloc9">Grosvenor-place</placeName>

                        targets="t18130407-2-off6 t18130407-2-crimeloc9"/>, to apprehend the prisoner with a warrant. I told him, I came to apprehend him on account of sedition, and I must search the drawers for some papers. This was in the butler's pantry. He opened a drawer where there was some wine in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much - A.Nine bottles; seven quarts and two pints. I asked him who that wine belonged to in the drawer. He said, that Miss Brodrick had given it out to him, and he must account for it. I told him, I must inform Miss Brodrick of it. I suspected it was not so. He said, he hoped I would not; that it was wine he had brought there; it was his own. I then sent up stairs for Miss Brodrick. Miss Brodrick came and examined the wine in his presence, and suspected it to be her's. We examined the inner cellar door, and found the patent lock locked. I then examined the partition over the inner cellar door; two pieces of boards were loose, and the nails which had fastened them were taken out; one of the boards fell down when these two boards were taken away. Any one, by the assistance of a ladder, might go in or out. The wine is here; seven bottles. It is Cape wine, two bottles; the rest is chiefly white wine.</p>
               <p>MISS BRODRICK. Q. Has the prisoner been in your service as butler - A. Yes, about seven weeks before this was discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep your wine - A. In the inner cellar. I had the key of that lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deliver out to the butler a certain quantity at a time for the consumption of the family - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, in your inner cellar, any Cape wine in pints - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the prisoner had been in your service had you ever delivered out any Cape wine to him in pints - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you delivered out any wine to the butler, not Cape wine - A. About three weeks or a month ago, other wine, Sherry or Port.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down to the inner cellar did you find in the outer cellar any wine such as you had delivered out to the prisoner - A. Yes, I believe three bottles of Sherry, and two of Port.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any opinion whether the quantity you found there with the quantity that you had consumed was about the quantity that you had delivered to him - A. I think nearly so. But I am quite certain I never delivered to him any Cape wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cellar door opened - A. Yes, I did. There was a padlock to it, and another lock. I saw a board fall down on Taunton's shoulder, and was surprised where it came from. I never entrusted the prisoner with the key of the wine cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your examining your cellar did you miss any wine - A. I missed twenty-four quarts and six pints.</p>
               <p>JURY. What did the prisoner say to you respecting the wine - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q.to Taunton. Have you tasted whether any of that wine is Cape wine - A. This bottle is Cape wine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the bottles of wine - A.Three shillings the white, and five shillings the red.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the care of the outside cellar, and in cleaning out that cellar the board fell down, just in the same manner as it did to the officer. I mentioned it to the coachman; he persuaded me not to tell my mistress of it, and by his persuasion I went in and took two of the bottles of wine that is here now; the others, the coachman put his hand in and took them. I did not break the premises. If I am suspected of sedition, let me be placed in the illustrious Wellington's army, and see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070004"/>how I will stand in the day of battle. I have lived in respectable services all my life, and never was suspected before.</p>

            . Q. On Saturday, the 13th of February last, were you at the Royal Oak public-house - A. Yes, in Back Hill, Clerkenwell I there met Herbert, Matthews, and Hancock, police officers. Herbert gave me two shillings, and a three-shilling bank token, to purchase a poundsworth of bad money of the prisoner, Jacobs. I afterwards went to Petticoat-lane, and went into the Red Lion public-house, and enquired for Jacobs, of a Jew that was there. I was directed to an opposite public-house, the sign I don't know. I there found Jacob Jacobs. I told Jacobs what I wanted. He told me to go to another public-house. I told him I come for five shillings worth more money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any previous transaction with him - A. I had seen him before, and bought of him twice. I mentioned the name of flats to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are flats - A. Bad shillings. I asked him for five shillingsworth of flats. That is a score. He told me that he would go and fetch them. I had had a score of him before, and I had the same quantity again. He desired me to go to another public-house, and he would come to me and bring them. He said, the public-house the left hand side of Petticoat-lane, the corner of a gateway. He had taken me to that public-house before, which made me know it again. I went there. He came to me in about ten minutes after I was there. He gave me wrapped up in a bit of paper twenty bad shillings. I gave him a three-shilling bank token, new coin, and two shillings. The three-shilling bank token, and the two shillings had been marked by Herbert. Herbert came into the public-house immediately almost after the money was given into my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the score of money - A. The twenty shillings were taken from me by Mr. Matthews.</p>
               <p>JOHN HERBERT. Q. Did you go with the last witness on the 13th of February - A. I did. I delivered to her one three-shilling bank token, the last coin, and two shillings. They were good, and marked. I marked the token with an X. I gave her the money to go and purchase bad money of the prisoner, which she had done before. She went first of all to the Red Lion, Petticoat-lane, on the right hand side going up out of Bishopsgate-street. The Jews directed her to a public-house across the lane, on the left hand side. I do not recollect the sign. There she went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in - A. I did not at that house. She came out and said, all is right. I saw her go in another public-house. (I think it is the Flying Horse; it is just out of the City, in Middlesex), and the prisoner followed her. I went in and called for a pint of porter, and pulled down my hat. I saw the prisoner put into Jackson's hand, a paper. I saw her give him something. After seeing that, I turned upon my heels, and came out instantly. The prisoner came out of the door. I catched hold of him directly, and secured him. Matthews searched the prisoner, and found the two shillings, and the three-shilling token that I had marked.</p>

There were some more silver produced, which he gave the magistrate, and the magistrate put it altogether.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you discover these things taken away - A. Between five and six o'clock on the evening of the 6th of March. I discovered one of the shutters were open; a piece was cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it before that - A. I had been actually in the house a week before that, and on the 6th of March, when I opened the street door, I saw my kitchen door open. When I got on the stair-case, I saw the bed-room door open; then I saw the bed furniture was taken away.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the burglary is out of the question. You saw some of your things that were taken away - A. Yes; the furniture of a bed, a counterpane, were taken from the bedstead, and three or four chair covers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the furniture here - A. Yes, this is it, it is mine, and the counterpane and chair covers are mine. I left them in my house when I had been there and slept there last, before I discovered the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. BURFORD. I produced the bed furniture, the counterpane, and chair covers.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by them - A. The prisoner brought them to my house on the 6th of March, and said he wanted to pledge them for Mr. Battesby. I told him I could not take them in of him; Mr. Battesby must come himself. He said, Mr. Battesby could not come, but Mrs. Battesby would.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070006"/>He went away to fetch one of them. He never came back again to claim the things for Mr. Battesby. I advanced him nothing upon them. He asked me two pound or guineas upon them. Mr. Israel came the same night, and took them away from my house. My wife went to Mr. Israel first, and then to Mr. Battesby. Mr. Battesby said, he knew where the prisoner lived. The prisoner came to me between four and five.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners there on the 18th - A. Yes; they came there about five o'clock. On the 18th of March, I went to my father's house. My father had met with an accident; he requested me to go into his cellar and to do some work, and at the time I went down the prisoner's were in the tap-room, and apparently very much intoxicated. Previous to my going into the cellar, I pulled off my coat and laid it in the bar, in the pocket of which was the pocket-book, and in the pocket were three one-pound notes, and sundry memorandums. When I came up from the cellar, the prisoners were gone and my coat also. My suspicion fell on the prisoners. I and Captain Christie went in pursuit of them. We overtook them on Cock-hill, Shadwell. The woman had the coat concealed under her cloak. We took them into Mr. Roger's, a grocer's shop. I then went in search of an officer. When I returned the pocket-book was discovered. The coat was in the possession of Mr. Rogers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the coat from the woman - A. Captain Christie, in my presence.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROGERS. I am a grocer, and a constable of the Thames police. On the 18th of March, about half past seven in the evening, the female prisoner came into my shop and asked me whether I could tell her of a pawnbroker in the neighbourhood. I told her there were two lower down. She said, she did not wish to go lower down. She wanted to know whether there were any further up. I told her there were several further up. As she turned out, Mr. Fisk came up. He said, this is the woman, and put her into my shop again. I saw Mr. Christie take the coat from her. I believe it was wrapped in her apron. Mr. Fisk said, there is the man that was with her. I took him and brought him in the shop and searched him. In his hat I found a pocketbook, containing three one-pound bank notes, and sundry memorandums, and a pair of gloves. This is the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my pocket-book. I had three one-pound notes in my pocket-book, and no other money. This is my coat; I had it in November last.</p>
               <p>Bourne's Defence. This woman is innocent.</p>
               <p>Ball's Defence. This man brought me the coat, and asked me to pledge it. I did not know but what it was his own.</p>

I told her I did not deal in such articles. She left the shop, and in about a minute she returned again. She asked me if I could tell her where she could sell them. I told her I thought Rosemary-lane was a likely place. She turned rather sideways from me, and held up the skirt of her gown to prevent me seeing what she took. I saw her make a grasp of something then on the shelves. She took two shirts; they are in Court. I rised from my seat instantly. I was in the back room. My son, a little boy of seven years of age, met me, and told me that she had stolen something, which I was sensible of myself. He rather interrupted me from going out of the house. I went out of the house as fast as I could. I pursued her, and took her in Rosemary-lane, near the Hampshire Hog, a public-house called by that name. I told her, that she had got two shirts of mine. I found them upon her. She acknowledged that she had been guilty of the crime, and begged me to forgive her. I told her I had been so often robbed, I was determined to punish her. I value the shirts at six shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. MOSES. I am an headborough. I live near Mr. Wells, Mr. Wells gave me the prisoner. I took her in custody. I saw the shirts under her arm when I came up. I asked her how she came by the shirts. She fell upon her knees and begged for mercy. Mr. Wells gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband let me have them things. He told me he would meet me in the course of an hour; he has never come near me since. I thought I had a right to make money of them. I came to London on the 13th of January, from Dublin. He left me the shirts and the smallclothes. I never took the shirts out of the shop. I wanted to make money of them to go home to Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q.to prosecutor. Are you sure you had these shirts in your shop on the 20th of March - A. Yes. I had them in my shop on that very day. I am sure they are my property.</p>

I was attacked by three men; one of them laid hold of my neck handkerchief, and the other two laid hold of my collar and set my arms fast. They had one hand over each of my shoulders. They held my shoulders so that my arms was totally confined. I immediately called watch. They were at my pockets. I felt my watch go, as I thought, out of my pocket. I felt a pull at my watch-chain, and my watch-chain broke. Here is part of my watch-chain attached to my watch now. There was a metal seal and steel key, and the chain was steel. They took to their heels as soon as the chain broke. I pursued them, crying out, stop thief. I saw the prisoner when the patrol laid hold of him. I immediately told the patrol he was one of them that stopped me. He was taken about five yards from me. I had run with him about twenty or thirty yards or more. I was within a yard of him all the way down the lane, and the greatest distance I was from him was when he was taken; that might be nine or ten yards, or not so much. I never lost sight of him. It was a clear night. I am sure he is the same man that I pursued. There was no one else in the street that I saw, but the three men that stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last felt your chain and seal hang to your watch - A. I looked at my watch ten minutes before they laid hold of me. I looked at my watch to see what o'clock it was. I pulled it out by the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was. I had not drank anything at all.</p>
               <p>- MACKDONALD. I am a patrol. On Sunday night, the 21st of February, I was on duty in Cow-cross, and hearing a person crying out, watch, I ran up. I saw the prisoner running. When I got half way across the road, he stopped. I said, where are you running. He said, I am going home. I said, where are you running. He said, I am going home. I said, I must know first what they call watch for. I took him back to the prosecutor. He said, that is the man. He gave me charge of the prisoner.</p>

            . Q. Did you lose a watch and seals - A. Yes. On the 9th of February, I was returning home to Piccadilly, from Lord Townshend's house. About half past ten o'clock in the evening, I was crossing the end of <placeName id="t18130407-12-crimeloc65">Shepherd's-market</placeName>

I said, no, it was too late to go any where but my own home. They pressed me very much to go with them. I stopped with the tall one, and spoke to her. She pressed me to go with her. I said, it is time for you and me to go home, and when I was talking to her, she said to Featherstone, Sall, come here. When the other prisoner came up they both instantly started, and when I had crossed the market I put my hand to feel for my watch; it was gone; I pursued them. I did not see them from that time until Saturday the 28th of February. We found Featherstone in a street behind Sloane-street, and as soon as she saw me she was very much alarmed. She said, there is a gentleman coming after me. I did not see Stevens until the 1st of March, at the watchhouse in Mount-street. I have never seen my watch again. I lost it entirely.</p>

There were two other women there at the time they came in. The two women were quarrelling with the two other that were there. I desired the prisoner and the two women to walk out. A gentleman came in. I begged his assistance in turning the prisoner out. I took hold of the prisoner's arm. One of the women that came in with the prisoner caught hold of me and twisted me round I caught hold of her arm and twisted her round, to get at the prisoner. She took off both her pattens to strike me, but was prevented by another woman. I took hold of the prisoner. He took hold of the seals of my watch, and cut the ribbon. I saw him do it. I did not see any thing by which he did it. I immediately felt, and found my seals were gone. I charged the gentleman not to let the prisoner out; he had cut my seals off. I sent to the watchhouse for the constable, and on the constable coming the seals were found on the ground. The men and the women appeared to be drunk.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. I went into the house about a quarter past eleven. At that time there might be about a dozen women in the room. It appeared that one woman and the prisoner had a scuffle with the landlord. He in a moment turned round, and said to me, sir, secure the door, the villain has cut my seals off after the constable came. The seals were found and a knife under the bench.</p>
               <p>MR. KENDAL. I am one of the men that came in the house last. We were all very much in liquor together, and the young women were all in liquor. I only know we were all very drunk.</p>

            . The constable found the handkerchief which contained the jacket. The prisoner took the bundle from me, and went up Wild-street. When I came down stairs I could not see the prisoner; I began to cry, and then John Russell, a young man, came up to me. I told him what had happened. After that, I saw the prisoner in Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that took the bundle from you - A. Yes, I am. It was a jacket in an handkerchief.</p>

            . Q. Did you see this boy in the street - A. Yes I was going down Wild-street; I saw the boy crying; I asked him what was the matter. He said, a man had sent him up stairs, and had ran away with his bundle. The boy described the man to me. I saw the prisoner in Monmouth-street. The boy said that was the man. I went over to him, and asked him for the boy's bundle. He said, he had not seen it; he had not seen the boy. I said you must go along with me. The prisoner said, I hope you will not hurt me. I said, I did not want to hurt him, but he must go along with me. He then said, if I would not hurt him, he would give me the jacket, and he wanted me to go into a court in Long Acre. I would not go. I took him into custody, and took him to Bow-street. The prisoner there was searched, and the handkerchief was found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had not the jacket when you took him - A. No. This is the handkerchief that was found on him.</p>
               <p>Nock. That is the handkerchief that contained the jacket; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Russell. When the handkerchief was found, the prisoner said he gave three halfpence for it, to another boy that was playing in the street; and when I asked him if he had the boy's bundle, he said, he would give me the jacket or the money to make it up. As soon as ever the boy saw the handkerchief, he said, that was the handkerchief that the jacket was wrapped in. And the person that belonged to the handkerchief described the handkerchief before she saw it.</p>
               <p>MRS. SMITH. I am sister to the little boy. I gave him the handkerchief to to carry to his brother-in-law. This is the handkerchief that the jacket was tied in. I value the jacket at twenty-five shillings. The handkerchief is of no value hardly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PRICE. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner, and took the handkerchief from him. He wanted to make it up. He told us the jacket should be forth coming. I refused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime.</p>

On the 24th of March, about five o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, when the prisoner came into the shop. As I was going out of the parlour, I saw her take something off the counter, and put it under her petticoats. I asked her what she wanted. She said, she had a pound of butter to sell for twenty pence; we could not agree for the price; she went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any basket in her hand - A. Yes. I went and told my mistress that I suspected that the woman had taken something off the counter. We went directly after her, both of us.

On Thursday, the 4th of March, I observed the prisoner as he was going out with his bread. I stopped him, and told him he had got something of mine. He assured me he had not. I said, I shall see. He kept going forward. I said, you shall stop, and I see what you have got. I saw nothing in his hands, nor did he appear to have any thing in his pockets. He was still going forward to cross the street. I told him to stop. He came back at last, but very unwillingly. Then I laid hold of his hat. It was a high crowned hat. On my pulling it off, there was a bag of flour in it. I said, this is a pretty thing to rob me of my flour. He said, I am sorry; it is the first time I ever did it; he hoped I would forgive him. The bag I put upon the window, and when my back was turned be put the flour out of his bag into the bin in the shop. I sent for the constable. He came, and I gave him in charge. The flour is worth more than fourteen pence.</p>

               <p>MR. HARRISON. I am a pawnbroker. On the 17th of March, between eight and nine in the morning, the prisoner offered me this gravy-spoon to pledge; he asked me five shillings on it.

               <p>Q. What did you do with the body - A. I sent for Mr. Clayton, a grave-digger. I delivered the body and the dress that was upon it to Mr. Clayton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe the place in which you found the body was between the enclosure called the New River head and Islington-road - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The space from the New River head to that road is about three hundred yards, is it not - A. Yes,</p>

               <p>Q. One of the most public pathways I believe near London - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You know at the part above there, at Islington, there is another grating, is there not - A. I fancy not. There is one at Goswell-street-road - another grating.</p>

            . I am grave-digger of St. James's, Clerkenwell Parish. In consequence of being sent for by the two last witnesses, I went to where the child was. I found it laying by the path-way. I took a shell to take it to the vault of the church.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you discribe what was upon the body of the child - A. Yes; it had a bed-gown on, a handkerchief was tied tight round its neck, with the knot under the left ear.</p>
               <p>COURT. There was a knot was there - A. Yes, under the left ear; a black hat on and a small band.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat was it - A. It was a hat formed with a peak in the front; a black beaver hat, and likewise a piece of a band that went part of the way round; it did not go round only just in the front of it. It appeared to be sewed. I did not examine how it was fixed on. A black silk cap under the hat, immediately upon the head, and tied with a string under the chin; a handkerchief round the body with part of a brick in it, about the half of a brick. The brick is here.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. I received the things from off the child's body. I employed a woman to wash the things. This is the half brick.</p>
               <p>Clayton. These are the things that I saw on the body. This is the brick; it was in this handkerchief, round the body, and this handkerchief was round the neck, with a knot under the left ear. These are the stockings that were upon the legs; they are worsted stockings, speckled. This petticoat was on the body, under the bed-gown. This is the bed-gown; the sleeves were cut to get it off. This is the shirt. They were all cut off. These are the stockings; they were all cut off the legs. These were the shoes on his feet, and this is the hat.</p>
               <p>JURY. We shall be happy to know what knot the handkerchief was in - Clayton. It was a knot in this manner; a single knot under the ear. These are all the things that were on the body. I took the body to the vault, and it remained there till Monday morning. On the Monday, a person was sent from the workhouse to wash the body, before it was exposed. It was not exposed till Monday morning, by ten o'clock, as near as I can guess. A vast number of people came to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner saw it - A. Yes; she saw it in the vault after the body was washed. It was about three o'clock in the afternoon on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. What did she say about it - A. At first sight she remained mute for a minute or more, and then she said, that is not my George, or my child; that is too big for him. At this time the dress was upon the body; they were not taken off; they were in the situation as they were taken out of the River, except the handkerchief was loosened that was on the neck, on account of washing the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything said by her about the clothes - A. She was asked the question whether she knew the clothes. She said, no; there was nothing there that belonged to her child. She was asked generally first, and one by one afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was asked one by one, what answer did she give - A. She denied the whole, except when she came to the shoes she made no answer. The shoes was the last question asked her. When she came to the shoes she made no answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now, the handkerchief was on the neck; you say it was tied round, and it was twisted round like a rope - A. Yes, quite twisted.</p>
               <p>Q. The neck was swelled over it, as I understand - A. Yes, under the chin. It was in the front. It had been tied tight round the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the body a great deal larger than you should expect a child of four years old to be - A. Yes, it had the appearance of being larger.</p>
               <p>Q. You have bad experience of seeing bodies that have laid in the water - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person that knew the child when alive would not easily recognize the child so well - A. I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was desired to look at the child, did not she say there was a mark upon my George by which I should know him - A. Yes, and she looked on the left side of the body, under the arm. The clothes were opened by her desire. We could not see a mark of the description that she gave. She spoke of it as a mark that raised on the surface. We could not find that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. The child was in a putrid state. It was leading to putrefaction. I do not know whether you know that has a tendency to obliterate a mark of that kind - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed the jury just now, a sort of knot that was tied under the left ear - A. Yes; it was only tied in one knot.</p>
               <p>COURT. How soon after the child was exposed, which you said was ten o'clock on the Monday, did any person come that recognised it was

               <p>Q.About what time did the prisoner go out that afternoon - A. About half past six in the evening, I understood I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see George and the prisoner that evening - A. At the time I have stated, at that time I saw the prisoner and George. The prisoner told me that she was going to put him in the poorhouse. I went for the purpose of taking my leave of him. I bid him good bye, and told him I would come and see him, and give him some cakes. I expected, from what I learned from her, that he would be put in St. Pancras workhouse. I gave the child some cakes, kissed him, and told him I would come and see him. He had on a black cap, a frock with red and yellow figures. I do not recollect any other-part of his dress.

               <p>Q. When did you see her next - A. Between nine and ten that evening. I let her in when she returned. I asked her what she had done with the boy. She said, that she left him at the beadle of St. Pancras. He was to be sent the next morning in a coach, with some other children, to Brompton, to nurse; that he was to stop there until he was six years old. That was what passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when had you any other conversation with her - A. In the afternoon. I was in my own/ parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. You should have told us that before - A. Immediately after four o'clock in the afternoon she came down stairs, and I called her into my room. I asked her what she meaned to do with the child, as the time was drawing near when the prisoner was going to her place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood that before that time the prisoner was about going to some place as a servant - A. Yes. She then said she went out in the forenoon for some potatoes, and met with a person accidentally that she told her case to, and he desired her to bring the child to him in the evening, between six and seven, and he would get it in, or put it in, without any further trouble. She did not tell me who that person was with whom that conversation took place: I said, I thought it was a providence that she had met with that person. For some weeks she had talked of putting the child in Pancras workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the poor-house of the place where you lived - A. No. I live in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. I have been informed since, the child was born in St. Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I would ask you whether the conduct of the prisoner with respect to this child was of an affectionate nature, or otherwise - A. I never saw the contrary but an affectionate mother. At times she appeared very uneasy about the maintenance and and protection of the child. She expressed herself so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner used she to express herself - A. She said she must get George in the house; she could not afford to keep them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this all the conversation that you recollect having with her previous to the time of your going to see the child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her on the Monday that she went away - A. I do not recollect saying anything to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did she go from your house - A. She went from my house on the Monday afternoon, and returned the Tuesday evening. On Tuesday I had no conversation with her about the child: on Monday before the child was found I had.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a week before the child was found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was it you saw her - A. At Mr. Brookes's in Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>Q.She was servant there, was she not - A. Yes. I merely asked her if she had heard of George. She said, no. That was all that passed about him that time. I never saw her from that time until I saw her at Clerkenwell church. I said, when she was going to put him in the workhouse, that Mrs. Polly would go and see the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. Polly - A. A particular acquaintance of the prisoner. She said, no, she would not. I said, why? She said, because she was so partial to him; she could not leave him if she was to see him. I said then, I would go. She said, I could not see him any time, only from ten to one, on a Friday. I said, I was in business, and confined of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070014"/>week day; I would go on a Sunday. She said, they would not let any body see him on a Sunday, unless they came a great way. I said, what do you call this but a great way. I do not recollect any other words that passed that time. We have talked several times about the child going into the house. One time she said she would go to Mrs. Hudson to ask her to take him to the poor-house. She told me she did go, and Mrs. Hudson refused her, and she did not know who to get to go with him. On Monday, in March, I saw the child in Clerkenwell church, three weeks after the child went out of the house: on the 15th, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you go to the church - A. I think it was a little after one. I went where the crowd was standing, and I requested to be let in. I saw the child. I said, I thought the features were not so much altered but I thought it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the name of the child - A. George.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been said to you that induced you to ask to see the child - A. Yes, a person came into my shop in the morning; she asked me when I saw Mrs. Evans. I told her, on the Monday before. I had heard about the black silk cap; that drew my attention, and induced me to go there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you went there you saw the child, and you thought it was the child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the child, at that time it had on a black silk cap and the hat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the black silk cap fastened - A. It was tied under the chin. It had a bed-gown on, stockings, and shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it on (that you saw) any speckled coloured frock in the way that you described - A. No, it had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any thing round its neck - A. Yes, but I did not take notice what it was at that time. It appeared of a grey colour to me. I took notice of its cap. The handkerchief round its neck appeared tied tight.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the child the first time was it before it was washed - A. It was a little cleaned.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time you saw it did you observe the handkerchief - A. Yes. The handkerchief had been a little removed; there was the appearance on the flesh as if a knot had been tied. The handkerchief was loose. The second time, I noticed the stockings and shoes. The prisoner was there then, and I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the stockings and the shoes before the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your observation that you made in the prisoner's presence with respect to the deceased's cap - A. She denied the child, and said, it is not my child - it is not my George, it is larger. I said, death stretches, and the water swells. I saw she would not own it. Then I said, the cap? She said, he had not the cap on when he went away. I understood her to mean that he had not that particular cap on. I asked her what she had done with it. She said that she had destroyed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at the cap, you remembering what the cap was that he had on, was it, or not, the cap - A. It was the identical cap which he wore in my house. I then said, the hat? She said, it was not the same. She took hold of the rim. She said, it was like it, but it was not the same. I said, the band?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the band of the hat - A. Yes. I had observed the band; the band did not go round the hat. She said, the band that was on it was a little broader. I said, I could not say as to that particular. She then said, that she had taken the band off, and had put on a black ribbon. I then said, the stockings and the shoes? I do not recollect that she answered me any more.</p>
               <p>COURT. As to the stockings and the shoes, were you certain that they were the same - A. Yes; I thought they were the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was that all the conversation that you had with the prisoner - A. I was called up to her before she left the vault. I asked her if I should see her again; yes, she said, she would call upon me as she went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do so - A. She was confined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she inform you ever of her circumstances - A. She frequently told me that she lived upon nothing but bread and tea: indeed that I knew to be true.</p>
               <p>Q.Was she indebted to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that cap - A. This is the cap that was made for 
               <persName id="t18130407-23-person204">

             - A. I gave Mrs. Evans the silk to make it. The border is very particular, and the selvage I remember perfectly, and the strings as well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other part of the dress if it was shewn to you - A. The hat. This is the hat he wore at my house when he went out frequently. It was given to him by Mrs. Turner. I think the band that is on it is the same band that always was on it. The hat was given by Mrs. Turner with the band upon it; and the shoes and stockings I believe to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a child was it respecting its features - A. A fine boy of its age; fresh coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the features able to be traced in the dead child sufficient for you to know him - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. We all know the features alter by death - A. Yes. I knew the child from its features. I have no doubt in the least of its being the child.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have no doubt of that being the child George, as being the child of Mrs. Evans - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you ever observed the child while it was at your house wearing a bed-gown - A. Only when he went to bed; he sometimes of a morning came into my room with a bed-gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the bed-gown upon the dead body of the child - A. I did, but I did not take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the stockings and shoes - A. I have not the least doubt of their being the same that he used to wear. The handkerchiefs I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070015"/>Mr. Bolland. You say this prisoner always held affection to this child, the boy - A. She did. She had also another little child, she was equally fond of that. At the time I went into her room she was preparing to wash it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe anything in this woman that indicated agitation and distress - A. I did not. She staid with me half an hour. I observed nothing of agitation. I thought she was satisfied with sending the child into the country.</p>

               <p>COURT. She mentioned to you that she met with somebody that would take care of the child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards she said she left it with the beadle - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, when she came back, mention to you of having seen the person - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about the person - A. She said he gave her an order to take the child to the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. An order in writing to take the child to the beadle - A. Yes, I understood so.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that she said she had left the child with the beadle of Pancras - A. Yes. She said it was to go with three or four more in the coach to Brompton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who told her that - A. Yes; this person that she met with, he assured her that it was not to go into the house until it was six years old.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the circumstance of the prisoner taking the child away - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening that she took the child away, did anything pass between you and the prisoner - A. The prisoner knocked at my door about half past six.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have an apartment in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Was your wife at home at the time - A. Yes, she was. I stood with the door in my hand. The child was on her right side. She brought the child to bid my wife and I good bye. The child drove near to me. I said, come hither, George, and I gave him a penny out of my right hand waistcoat pocket. The child was dressed in a red ground frock, and some kind of a speckle on it, or a flower. I cannot describe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the frock again if you were to see it - A. Yes, I should. It had a light coloured handkerchief, or a white, tied across his bosom, behind, neatly; and it had this black hat, and the black silk cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again - A. I should. I have seen it often.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that hat - A. That is the identical hat, and that is the cap. I never saw the child after that. I have seen the frock since, at Mr. Thisselton's, an officer of Hatton Garden office. I saw the frock there yesterday afternoon.</p>
               <p>- THISSELTON. I produce the frock. I got it out of the prisoner's box, at her situation at Mr. Brooks's.</p>
               <p>Rawlinson. That is the frock. I never saw any other.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Blakey. Do you know that frock - A. Yes, sir, well. That is the frock he had on when I took leave of the child. There is one place here the child bit out, under the arm, and there is a piece under.</p>
               <p>Rawlinson. I know the frock perfectly well. I am quite certain that is the frock the child had on when I took my leave of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long had you lodged in the same house with the prisoner. - A. I had been there about six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. She had besides this one other child - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she an affectionate mother - A. I never knew any other ways, and also to the infant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you any talk with her about the child when it was going away - A. I said to the child, George, you are going into the country. The child innocently said, yes. I do not recollect anything more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she appear to be an affectionate mother to all of them - A. From all that ever I saw, she appeared to be very kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the children - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased child, George - A. I did, perfectly well.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen George before February - A. I had not seen George since I nursed him in the small pox; that was the latter end of the year, before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the small pox at your house - A. No, at the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after he was found - A. No, sir, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner on Sunday the 21st of February - A. I do, at my own house in Bird's-buildings, Lower-street, Islington. She came about half past seven in the evening; she was alone. I asked her what she had done with George. She said, that the child was taken to the beadle of the parish of St. Pancras, from whence it was to go with a great many more children to Brompton. She said it was gone very happy and comfortable with the rest of the children.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean that it already had gone - A. Yes, in the middle of the week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there anything different in her behaviour at that time to what there used to be before - A. I did not perceive it at all. She said she was going to her service, to Mr. Brooks's in Paternoster-row, on the following Monday or Tuesday, she could not say which. She called upon me to bid me good bye before she went to her place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner any time before the 21st of February - A. Yes, she called upon me on the week day before that, about a week before that, on the 21st was Sunday. About a week before that she came to my house to take tea with me; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070016"/>then asked me whether I could recommend any person to take her child to the beadle, or the parish workhouse. I am not certain which. I told her that I could not recommend her any one. The youngest child was with her at this time. She said she was in a deal of distress of mind what to do with the child; she could not get any body, to take it for her. I asked her why she did not take it herself. She answered, the people of the parish were so abusive to her that she did not like to be brow-beated by them. At the time that she was pregnant with the last child, she told me before she laid in, that her name was changed to Roberts. That was about a month before she laid in. The child was fifteen months old on the 30th of March; that she was married, and her name was Roberts. She said, the last child was by her husband, and her name was changed to Roberts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. It was half past seven when this woman came to your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a road by the New River that branches off into many foot paths - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That road is very much frequented - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she came to you she conversed with you without any agitation, did not she - A. She appeared as comfortable as I always saw her. I never saw any harm of her. She seemed a very industrious person. She stopped with me until ten minutes after nine. There was nothing extraordinary in her appearance.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that hat - A. This is the hat that I gave her; it was my little daughter's and I gave her this piece of a gown that this frock is made with. I gave her one breadth of my gown to make 
               <persName id="t18130407-23-person210">George</persName>
             a frock. The shoes I likewise gave her; they were my little daughter's; the stockings I think were my son's. I gave her two or three pair. I think I recollect these to be one. The hat I gave her, and I am sure with the band. The band is very remarkable; it does not go all round the hat. The band is tinsel cord. When I bought the hat it was turned down; I did not see the band did not go all round. I turned the hat down; I said the hatter was very stinting in his band, not to afford it to go all round. I remember making the observation.</p>

She said she had placed the younger one in the front of the road at nurse; she meaned to pay for it herself. Then I asked her how she had placed George. She said that she had taken him to the workhouse, to the sick-house, at Hackney, through the interest of Mr. Hougham he was to be farmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who Mr. Hougham was - A. Yes, the doctor. The child was to be farmed, and from there to be nursed at Brompton. I told her it was a very good thing, as the child previous to that had been very ill. She said the parish would pay five shillings a week with it. I told her I thought it was a very great interest to have that privilege. She said she was very glad it was so. She wished my son to write a direction for her, for the nurses to come and see her, and to bring the child (George) to her. My son wrote two directions to leave with the nurses of each of the children. I understood it was to find her out. Nothing more passed about the child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I think you say you have known the prisoner better than twelve years - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, during part of the time she has lodged in your house - A. She has, within the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had the opportunity of seeing what her conduct has been to her children - A. Yes; she was very affectionate, and extremely clean and neat in her manners. On account of her manners I liked her; a mild, affectionate, humane woman.</p>
               <p>Q. George was a very fine boy; a fine, cheerful, playful boy - A. Yes; he was a very sensible boy; he was an acute boy. I always thought her an affectionate mother to him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that she came to your house was not she as calm and as tranquil as a woman could be be - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you give the prisoner cotton enough to make two frocks - A. Not two frocks; to make the frock and more. There was not enough to make two frocks: there was enough to make an extra body, not more. The child came frequently with the frock on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know George, her son - A. Yes. I saw her on the 8th of February, at my house. She asked me to take her youngest child to nurse. I said, I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her respecting George - A. Yes; she told me that she was going to send George into the country, thirty miles off. She drank tea at my place. George was with her. I said to the little boy, George, shall not you cry when you go for to leave your brother Billy. The child smiled. The mother made answer, it was going where it would be taken care of, and want for nothing. The child had on a black silk cap: his hat I did not notice. He had shoes and stockings on when he played about the room with his brother. I saw the child on the Tuesday after it was taken out of the water. I saw it in the vault of Clerkenwell church.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your looking at the child were there remaining enough of the features of the child to enable you to say it is the child George - A. I believe it to be George.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 9th of March - A. I did, at the prison. I saw the prisoner last Wednesday week, the day that she was moved to Newgate. She sent for me. I did not say any thing to her about George.</p>

            . I told her I wanted to speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner knew you or not - A. I do not know; I was not in my beadle's dress. As soon as I found that was her, I walked inside and pushed the door too, not to stand and talk in the street. The first word that she said, before any words passed, are you come from the office, or, you are come from the office, I do not know which exactly. I said, no, I am come from the parish of Clerkenwell. Upon that, she walked away from the door, and walked along the passage. I followed after her, and as I went along the passage, I said, there was a child drowned at Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near enough to hear you - A. Yes. She went straight into the kitchen, I following her. When I came into the kitchen, I saw a tall elderly lady, and she said to

             to put her things on, and go along with me. She said, she would. The prisoner went up stairs to get her bonnet and shawl. I followed her out of the kitchen, and waited for her at the bottom of the stairs. She came down stairs directly with her bonnet and shawl. She was not gone two minutes up stairs, and we came out together. In Warwick-lane, a woman was coming down; we passed her. She called out, Sarah. We were in the road, and the woman was in the foot-path. Sarah turned round, and the woman crossed into the road to us; her name is Mrs. Howard, Mrs. Howard said to the prisoner, where are you going. She said I am going along with this man to Clerkenwell, to look at a child that was drowned, as they said it was her's. Mrs. Howard said, when I told you last night I thought it was, but then she was coming to her to tell her it was not George. I said to Mrs. Howard, if you know Mrs. Evans, you had better go along with us to see the child. She agreed to come, and we all three came on together to the church. I let them walk by themselves, and I followed close to their heels. We got to the church. The gravedigger was not there at that time. We went into Mr. Sheppard's, the Crown tavern, to get away from the mob. We went out the back way, and went into the vault; I, and Mrs. Howard, the prisoner, and Clayton. I took her up to the shell for her to look at the child. She stood and paused a little bit, a minute or so; at last she exclaimed, that was not her George. I told her to look at it over and over again. She still persisted it was not her George.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070018"/>As she did not seem to own the child, I told her to look at the clothing, to see if she knew them. She said, no, there was not a bit of clothing upon the child that belonged to her George. I questioned her first with respect to all the clothing, generally, and then I was very particular with her to look at the hat. She stooped down towards the shell, and looked at the hat, but did not touch it. She said, that was not her George's hat. I then asked her if that was not the hat that Mrs. Turner had given her. She said, her George's hat had got a broader band than the band that was on the hat of that child. Mrs. Turner had given her 
               <persName id="t18130407-23-person220">George</persName>
             a hat, but she had taken that band off that was on that hat, and put on a broader, and therefore she knew that was not her George's hat. I asked her to examine the cap. She looked at the cap. She said, it was not her George's cap. I then asked her if that was not the cap that was made out of a piece of silk that Mrs. Blakey gave her. She said, no, that was not the cap. She said, she had made the child a black cap, but the child had more; and the child's hair began to grow, and it was going out to nurse; that she had burnt the cap. I then asked her where the child was. She said her child was at nurse at her aunt's at Brompton. I took my pencil then, and a bit of paper, to take a direction. I asked her what her aunt's name was. She said, Roberts; she lived facing of Brompton church. I wrote these particulars down in the vault, at the coffin. I asked her, whether her aunt was a lodger or a housekeeper. She said, she was a lodger. I then asked her the name of the person that kept the house. She said, she did not know. I asked her what number it was; that she did not know; she believed it was 14, 16, or 18, she could not tell what exactly, but her aunt was well known there; if I only asked for Mrs. Roberts, any body knew her. I then told her that I should go to her aunt's and see whether her child was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say anything to that - A. No. After that, we went into Mr. Sheppard's again, and there Mr Jones, my partner, came in and Mr. Voyce likewise; they two came in together. I then said to Mr. Voyce, I had got a direction; where the child was, and I thought it proper to go to Brompton and see it. I asked Mr. Voyce whether it would not be proper for me to go to Brompton. He said, yes, by all means. Then I left the two women in the care of Mr. Jones, and I went to Brompton, and made the best of my way there. When I came to Brompton I found Brompton chapel, but no church. I enquired at every house where the chapel was. The doors were numbered. I think 11 or 13 is the highest number in the place. I made diligent search. I found no such person as Roberts. I was an hour and a half enquiring all over the streets. I came back again. I saw Sarah Evans next at Hatton Garden office. I told her she might have saved me the trouble of going to Brompton; she well knew I should not find her aunt there. I had been enquiring all about there, there was no such person as Roberts to be found. She said, she did not know; her aunt told her she lived there. Then I asked her directly whether ever she had been to her aunts. She said, no. I asked her how her child came at her aunt's. She said, her aunt had sent a woman for it. I asked her then how long her aunt had lived at Brompton. She said she had not been there above three or four weeks. We then went into the office before the magistrate. I was sent off to find the boy that pulled the child out. I heard no more of the conversation. When I came back again the committment was made out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the cap shewn to the prisoner - A. Yes, at the vault, and the hat was shewn. She said, that she had left the cap off, and she had taken the gold band off the hat, and had put on a black ribbon; and the shoes and stockings were shewn to the prisoner. I don't know what she said about the shoes and stockings.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not tell her that you had seen her the night before, because you had not seen her the night before. The beadle is not correct in saying that, is he - A. I had not seen her the night before; he is not correct in that.</p>

            , in my house, frequently. I have no doubt about the hat and the cap in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did the prisoner go into Mr. Brooks's service - A. On the 22nd of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bring the child George to Mr. Brooks's - A. She had formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the vault on the 15th of March, did you see the prisoner there - A. I did. I saw the prisoner there; she seemed quite composed and calm. When she saw me she said, Mrs. Newman, they say this is my George. I replied, what do you think, Mrs. Evans. No, said she, it is not my George. She said, it was not her child; it appeared much too large. I then desired her to look at the hat and cap. She said she had taken the cap off before she had seen me. When she called at my house prior to this, she said that she was going to send this child thirty miles in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that when she said she was going to send it thirty miles - A. That was a few days prior to her returning to Mr. Brook's. She went to Mr. Brook's on the Tuesday. I asked her if she had heard of the child. She said that she had; he had got down safe, and was well. When I met the prisoner in the vault, and desired her to look at the hat and the cap, then she said in the vault that she had sent him into the country, and the child's hat had a broader band; she had taken the band off and put a black ribbon round. I then said, the shoes? Her answer was, that she had not sent him thirty miles in the country; he was with his aunt at Brompton. I then asked her if she thought it likely that her aunt would come from Brompton to drown this child in the New River. She said, she could not tell, for her aunt was a very bad woman. I then said, that I would not trust a child of mine with a person that I knew to be bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your view of the child did you think it was the child George - A. I thought it was; I would not swear it. As to the hat and cap, I am positive. I had told Mrs. Evans that I would give her a hat of my grandson's. She said, Mrs. Turner gave her that; it would do very well, and the child was to have a new one when he got down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. The prisoner has lived with Mr. Brooks before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother takes care of Mr. Brooks's house - A. Yes, and I always thought her a kind affectionate mother.</p>
               <p>MR. BROOKS. Q. I believe you are a printer in Paternoster-row - A. I am. The prisoner, at the time she was apprehended, was in my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that part of your premises so situated that if she had liked she might have made her escape - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When she was once up stairs if she had chose to evade the officer she might have done so - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brooks, the prisoner has lived in your service before - A. Yes. My housekeeper took her in again. I had a good opinion of her during the time that she was with us.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, from your opinion of her, you are at the expence of defending her - A. Yes. I have that opinion of her that she is innocent.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the body of the child appear to you that it must have lain in water some time - A. Most assuredly. I should suppose the body must have been in water a fortnight or three weeks. The features were very much disfigured at the time I saw the child.

               <p>COURT. Could you form any judgment whether the child died by suffocation or by drowning - A. The putrefaction had so far taken place, from the state of putrefaction, if the child had died of suffocation, if the handkerchief had been tied tight it would have gone through the integument. I cannot say from the appearance whether it was the one or the conjoint effect of both.</p>

She said, that she had no knowledge of them at all. She denied any knowledge of the child, or of any knowledge of the clothes. She always denied the three first times, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning, any knowledge of the child. On the Friday morning, as I was going with her to the magistrate, I asked her whether she had any thing fresh to communicate, and how she felt her mind. She said, perfectly easy and composed. She said, she had spoken the truth, and now I am easy. She said, she had declared all the truth, and whom she had given the child to. That the person she alluded to, as the person she met with on Sunday morning, was Mr. Aris, and that the child was to go into the country by his direction, that she was to meet him the same evening by his appointment in Gray's-inn-lane, but did not meet him, but met a person who said she came from Mr. Aris, to whom she delivered the child. The woman told her, as she returned back she would meet Aris. She told me that she did meet him some little distance off from where she parted with the child. He asked where the child was. She told him that she had delivered it up to a woman that he (Aris) had sent. He said, that was all very right; and that was all that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070021"/>passed between them at that time. I asked her, why she did not make that confession at the first. I said, had you acknowledged the child at first, and made that confession, it would have taken a great deal of guilt off you. She said that Mr. Aris had desired her to say what she had. On the next day, Saturday, I fetched her from the House of Correction. She continued perfectly composed in her own mind. She said she had spoken the truth. I asked her every time in the morning I met her, how she was in her mind. She said she was perfectly composed in her mind, because she had spoken the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whether on the day before she had been examined privately by Mr. Capper and Mr. Webb - A. I understood she had divulged her mind the day before to somebody, and on Friday morning she was quite comfortable.</p>

               <p>Q.And you have since that seen her pretty frequent at different lodgings she had - A. The first lodging she had, I saw her pretty frequent. For the last several years I have seen her but seldom.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a married man - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, Mr. Aris, visiting the prisoner one wet evening about two years ago - A. No, no such thing happened, not as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard her examination. You do not admit that she ever lent you an handkerchief. Now look at that handkerchief - A. I borrowed no handkerchief of her, nor was I ever possessed of such a handkerchief in my life. I never, in all my existence; was possessed of such a handkerchief as that.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer. I formerly lived in in Brook's-market. I live now in Turnmill street, No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Aris in last February - A. Yes. I have known him a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you spend any Sunday with him in the course of February - A. I have been at his house every Sunday except two, in the dwelling where he is now. He went to Webber-street on Saturday, the latter end of January. I removed him there on a Saturday. The next Sunday I did not go, and the second Sunday I did not go there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the circumstance of Aris being sent for at the police-office, Hatton Garden - A. No. I know he has been there, because I have been there myself at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Mr. Aris's house of a Sunday, how long did you stay - A. I did not stay much after eight o'clock, and when I was there Aris was always at home. He staid at home during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it you saw Aris at Hattont Garden office - A. I think it was Thursday that Aris was at Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being at his house on the Sunday before the Thursday - A. I certainly was there, and I dare say he was there, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Were you ever servant to Mr. Aris - A. I had a key at the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with him - A. About a twelvemonth. I cannot say exactly. When Mr. Aris went into the Bench, he sent to me. He had a house for a little time facing the Bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me why you, a green grocer, was always with Aris of a Sunday - A. I might go two or three days of a week, and always on a Sunday I went there to make him a garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Could your shop afford you to go three times a week and always on a Sunday - A. I have gone at eight o'clock in the morning. I might have stopped there an hour; and I have gone there again in the afternoon. On Sundays in February I have been there both morning and afternoon. I have sometimes staid from five until past eight; seldom shorter.</p>
               <p>Q. Aris could not go out on a Sunday when he was in the Bench, and when he was out of the Bench, Aris could only go out on a Sunday. What took your key from you in the House of Correction - A. They were reduced because there were too many, when Mr. Newport took it. I went in afterwards.</p>
               <p>MRS. FINCHER. Q. Do you know the sister of Mr. Aris. Did you ever point out the sister of Mr. Aris to the prisoner - A. No; I never knew her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Aris - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know the person of the prisoner - A. I saw her once. I never pointed out the sister to her. I never saw the sister.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My first defence was false; it was through the threats of Mr. Aris that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070024"/>made it; Mr. Aris was the cause of it. He has threatened to shoot me three times. The first time he threatened me was nine years ago, when I lodged in Cook's-row; and all I have repeated about Pancras parish was by his desire. I delivered the child to a woman by his desire; the woman that he brought to me before, for the purpose of going into the country. I saw the woman that he brought to me, saying, that was the woman that was going into the country to take the child. I had some conversation with the woman concerning her going into the country. I know nothing about the death of the child. I delivered it to the woman according to his desire, on Sunday the 21st of February. I saw Mr. Aris afterwards, and when I met him, he asked me what I would say to the people that knew I was going to get the child into Pancras house. I answered, I would go by his desire. He told me to say to the people that knew I tried to get it into the house, that I had delivered him to the Pancras people, and to those that did not know, I was to say that I had sent him to my own relations in the country. He said, if ever I told any person that he had taken the child he would surely be the death of me; and so he certainly would. He had threatened me many times; that made me make that first report, and that only,</p>
               <p>COURT Q. to Thissclton. The prisoner was in custody when you found the child's frock - A. She was. I never had any communication with her about it.</p>
               <p>MRS. SIMPSON. Do you know Mr. Aris - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of February last, when he was in the King's-bench-prison, did you do some washing for him - A. I did. I washed for him four pocket handkerchiefs; one was a shambray handkerchief. One of the ends of the handkerchief was pointed, and the other round. It was in the form of a half handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this handkerchief - A. This is a shambray handkerchief; it answers the description of the handkerchief I washed for Mr. Aris. I believe it to be the handkerchief. One end of this handkerchief is round, and the other pointed. The colour is a little gone, and laying in water that time it would go. I know the handkerchief by a join in the corner, not by the colour; such things as these are apt to fade, and soaking it in water for three weeks I should think would reduce it to this appearance.</p>

On Saturday the 13th of March, I locked up the warehouse about half past six in the evening, and then left it. I returned to the warehouse on Monday morning the 15th of March. I found the door on a jar, which I had left safe on the Saturday night, and a considerable quantity of woollen cloth was gone; about ten pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you made this discovery, did Harrison, the officer, come to you - A. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I went with him to Grub-street, to a baker's shop. I went up one pair of stairs in that house. Harrison and me went into the room. I saw about five or six persons in that room. I saw Williams and Hand, and three or four more. When Harrison and I entered the door I saw the property. I saw Williams and another jump out of the window. The officer stopped Hand. The rest got by me and got down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Hand dressed - A. He was dressed in a coat; his knees unbuttoned, his stockings were down and he had a night-cap on. He appeared like a man lately arisen from bed. He said, he did not know anything about it; he was obliged to get up in his shirt and to let them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find in the room any pieces of cloth that you had lost - A. I found nine pieces out of the ten I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the ten pieces - A. About one hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find these nine pieces - A. They were not in the same state as in our warehouse. They were unfolded, and pieces cut off; about four yards and a half in length. The marks were taken off, and hid between the bed and the mattress, in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they had been in your warehouse had the pieces of cloth any paper about them - A. Yes. I found them upon Hand, the tailor's shop-board. Hand being a tailor. The officer took care of Hand while I ran after Williams. I catched Williams. He ran down Grub-street, up a court, and tumbled, and I catched him. The others escaped from me.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you know the person of any other besides Williams and Hand, that were there - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Williams before. A No long</p>
               <p>Q. Williams jumped out of the window; how long was he in the room before he jumped out - A. Not many minutes. I am sure it was Williams.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARDOLPH. I am a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 13th of March were you in Basinghall-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there did you observe any person standing in the street - A. I observed Williams standing against the warehouse that I live in, opposite<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070025"/>of the warehouse that was robbed. He was in company with three others that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bar, and see whether you saw him in company with any person there - A. I saw Holmes, Williams and others. I had suspicion of Williams. I saw Holmes with a great coat, which I have seen since. He went opposite to where I live, and spoke to two others. He returned back. I looked after him. I saw him on the opposite side of Mr. Sutcliff's. He took the great coat off his back, and another man put it on in the street, land the man that put it on was the first man that entered the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man that put on the coat enter whose house - A. Enter Mr. Sutcliff's warehouse. He entered the house and brought out cloth on his shoulder, with paper wrapped on it. A second and third went in. They each brought out cloth. I saw Williams go in, but come out without any. I saw him in company with those that did bring out.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had brought out the cloth which way did they go - A. They went down Basinghall-street, crossed Fore-street towards Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the lower end of Basinghall-street is the warehouse - A. It is the last house but one or two to London Wall, and from thence to Grub-street is a very few yards. I saw Harrison, the officer, and told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you the next day see either of the men that you saw do this transaction - A. I saw Holmes the next day near Smithfield, by Snow-hill. I saw Holmes with another man; they crossed over together, as though they were going towards Smithfield. I made all the haste I could to find Harrison.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you saw Holmes the next day, were you positive that he was one of the men that was engaged in this transaction - A. I was very positive.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards were you called upon to see him in custody - A. I cannot exactly say, a week or more; and when I saw him again I perfectly knew him. I am quite sure Williams and him were two of the party.</p>

            . I am a painter. I work with Mr. Alders, in Grub-street. On Monday morning, the 15th of March, I was going to my employ. I went through the courts in Grub-street, into Moor-lane, and then I crossed to Basighall-street. I observed a man of the name of Gill, and Williams, as I was crossing in Basinghall-street. I saw Gill in company with Williams and two others, crossing from the bottom of Basinghall-street. They had two rolls of cloth wrapped up in brown paper. Williams had one load and Gill another. They went through Honeysuckle-court, into Grub-street. I know nothing of this Gill. I followed Williams and the others, and saw them go into a baker's shop in Grub-street. That is the baker's shop that I afterwards went to with Harrison. After I saw them, I went and informed Harrison, and then I went with Harrison to the baker's in Grub-street. I saw Williams jump out of the window. He caught hold of the lamp iron. Harrison called, stop thief. I ran directly the young man came down stairs, and caught Williams. He was brought back.</p>

            . I am a constable. From information, I went to Grub-street. Upon my entering the room, I found the prisoner Williams and two others, and as soon as I entered the room Williams pushed up the window and jumped out. I searched, and I found nine rolls of cloth in the room. Williams was brought back in two or three minutes. I found the marks cut off the rolls of cloth; and in searching the room I found it between the bed and the mattrass. Hand was in the room; he is a tailor. He said he did not know any thing about it; he was called out of bed to let some things be brought in there. I found two great coats in the room, a green and a blue one.</p>
               <p>Bardolph. The blue great coat is like the great coat I saw on Holmes's back when he pulled it off, and another man put it on. The great coat was as like this as can be, with a cape.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. Did you find any paper with marks also - A. Yes. I found them under the shop-board.</p>

He answered, nothing. I told him, I could see something under his coat, and I would feel. I took the decanter from him. I then took him to Mr. Burnell. He begged of the prosecutor to let him go. I took him into custody. We then went to his house, where he lodged, in Labour-in-vain-hill, and we found this water-ewer, and six china cups, and eight saucers. The prisoner was in the Compter when I searched his lodgings.

            . While Hawkins and Mr. Burnell were gone to search the other prisoner lodgings. I stopped about the door. I saw the prisoner come from the side door. I saw that he had dishes. I said, what are you going to make of them. He said, to make a little beer. I said, I will beer you. He replied, pray let me go, and I will satisfy you. I took him a little further. He then tried to get away. Then I handcuffed him, and took him to the Compter. I took from him these half dozen dishes; he had them in his apron before him. I saw him come out of the door with them.</p>
               <p>JOHN LACEY HAWKINS. I searched the prisoner's lodgings. I found these six plates, two bowls, two salt-sillers, and a pepper-box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The half dozen plates my wife bought them; the half dozen dishes were given to me by a man in the warehouse. They pressed upon me for my footing. They gave me these dishes. I was going to take them to a public-house for half-a-gallon of beer.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe them to be mine. We have exactly similar in our warehouse. I had information that half a dozen dishes were taken away prior to the prisoner being detected.</p>

I placed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070027"/>myself on the top of the stairs, in such a condition that I could see all over the warehouse.

I told him, it was of no use denying it; I had seen him take it. He still continued denying of it. He went out of the warehouse into the back yard; Mr. Sheppard and myself followed him. Mr. Sheppard took from him the bladder containing the gin. We live at No. 5, Warwick-lane, Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SHEPPARD. On the evening stated I was in the cellar. I said, William, you have something about you that does not belong to you. He said he had not. I told him I was certain that he had, because he had been seen to go to such a cask. He went towards the yard; I followed him. He drew from his smallclothes the bladder containing the gin. This is the bladder; it contains gin. It was more full at the time, but it was leaky, and it has wasted. It seems to have been made on purpose for the nosel of the cock to go in. He was afterwards taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The bladder I found and the gin. When I went out of doors for this lemon at the public-house, I saw a man come in with a bottle; he set this down; I looked to see what it was. I took it up.</p>

The prisoner was near me; she said, countryman, do not knock me down. I said, I will not knock you down if I can help it, but I have made a little bit of a slip in walking along. She said, I believe you are a countyman by your look. I said, yes. She said, pray what countryman are you I said, I come from Ware in Hertfordshire, my native place. She said she knew some people down there. She said she lived at the back of the Mansion House; she kept a gentleman's house there, if I would walk a little way down with her to take a letter. I walked with her, and when I got into a court she said, Oh, my dear, I should like to go to bed with you all night. I said, if you want to sleep with me you must go to the Bull, at Aldgate. She said, no, I wish you would take a bed here. I said, no, you have taken my money out of my pocket. She said, if she had she would keep it. I called out, watch. The officer came and said, what is the matter. I said, this woman has robbed me of eighteen shillings. He took charge of her. I never felt her take it at all.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you give me something to drink - A. I did. I gave you a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOBBS. I am an officer. I heard the cry of, watch. I immediately ran. I saw this man hold the prisoner by her two shoulders. I asked him what was amiss. He said, that she had robbed him of eighteen shillings. He described the pieces of silver and the rest of the money that she had got in her pocket she was going to pay her rent with. I took her to the Compter. I found upon her the pieces of silver exactly as he told me. This is the money.</p>

I saw the prisoner start from the mob, across the street, to a court where there was a gate to prevent anybody going up. The prisoner made a few steps at that spot. I laid hold of his collar, and I laid hold of his stick. He told me that the man was over the way. I wanted him to give up the stick. He struggled, and got over the way, and when he got over the way we got the stick out of his possession.

We immediately made towards Long lane. We had been but a short way before we heard the call of, stop thief; he has got my seals. I saw the prisoner by himself. We laid hold of him. He made a strong resistance in so doing; his partners came to his assistance. He said, d - n your eyes, mill away. The gentleman that had lost his seals came up. He said, that is the man that has robbed me of my seals. We secured him and took him to the watchhouse. The beadle and the officer of the night went back to see if he had dropped the property.

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse them of taking your horse corn - A. Because, on Tuesday the 23d, I found that I had lost beans out of my barn, and the beans and corn mixed I found that I had lost out of the carter's bin. I went into the loft. I found some beans in a sack, about three half pecks tied up in the sack, upon the beans. On the 27th, I opened the sack to satisfy myself that they were the beans that I had given out. Then I watched, and sat up for six nights, and on Tuesday morning, at half past one o'clock, Hitchcock and David Wells went into my stable. In about ten minutes after, I perceived a stranger go into the stable. I saw Hitchcock go into the loft, and deliver these beans down to Bowden and Wells. The both assisted in taking them down through the hole in the loft. After that

             came out with the beans, and put them down. I immediately charged them with stealing the beans and oats, and called for assistance. I have brought a sample of the beans. I had such beans in my place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How long has Wells lived with you - A. Near six months.</p>
               <p>Q. He was entirely under the controul of Hitchcock - A. Entirely. I looked upon him as a good lad. I believe he was drawn in by the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>Bowden's Defence. I am innocent of the job. On Monday night I was at the Bell public-house, Hitchcock came in. He said, he was going to town. I said, I would go with him, and when I went into the stable he was putting these beans. He asked me to take the beans, and the boy was to show me where to put them.</p>
               <p>Wells was not put on his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your shop open at that time - A. The shutters were down, but the door was shut. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070031"/>door was upon the latch. There was no one in the shop at that time but me. The dwelling-house is over the shop, and there is a communication from the shop to the dwelling-house. It is all under one roof. I was standing in the middle of the shop; I heard a person in the shop, but not until he was going out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the noise of somebody going out, did you look to see - A. Yes, I did, directly. I saw the prisoner going out with two pieces of linen. I have here one under each arm. I directly pursued him, and did not lose sight of him until he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance from the shop was he taken - A. He was taken from fifty to an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the two bundles that he had in the mean time - A. He dropped both the bundles on the pavement, within a few yards from where he was apprehended. One of the witnesses held him while I took the linen in my possession. I have had the linen in my possession ever since. I have kept them in the room that I sleep in. This is the linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm when you went out after him - A. Yes, I did. I called out, stop thief. This is one piece of linen, and this is the other. I knew them by my own mark, which I put on them when I took them in my possession. They are worth nine pounds, the two pieces together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the cry of, stop thief, on this morning that we have been speaking of - A. Yes. I heard at the same time something drop by our shop door. I went to the door and saw these two pieces of linen laying by our door, and I saw the prisoner running a cross the street. I ran after him, and caught him at the corner of the street. I took him from there to Bow-street. There was no sitting magistrate there. I took him from thence to Covent Garden watchhouse. I knew

            , my young man, shewed her the muslin. The young man left the prisoner and was gone to some other part of the premises. I saw the prisoner in a great bustle with her cloak. She had a very large mantle on, and from that I suspected she had taken something. I saw her in the act of drawing her clothes together. I was on the opposite side of the counter, and stood before her. I went to where she was. I turned over the goods to try if I could miss anything. I could not. I looked hard at the prisoner, and was satisfied in my own mind that she had taken something. She after that sat down in a chair; I could see the goods stick out. I then was certain that she had something. I made up my mind. I was determined to search her before she left the premises. She got up from the chair, and went four or five yards. I told her I should like to look under her cloak before she left the premises. She then immediately dropped the goods from under her cloak. I picked them up. She wished me to let her go. I told her I could not. I sent for a constable.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming into your master's shop - A. Perfectly well. On the 20th of February, the prisoner, accompanied by another woman, came in and asked for a piece of muslin. They were shewn her. The woman that was in company with the prisoner purchased a small quantity that came to three shillings. The prisoner purchased nothing. The other woman wished to see some Irish linen. I left them. I had farther to go in the shop for the Irish linen. When I came back, I found her sitting in the chair where I left her. At the time I was gone in the front shop, there was something in the prisoner's conduct that gave me suspicion. The prisoner retired from the counter towards the fire-place. It was plain to be perceived that she had something under her cloak, and when Mr. Stratton. said he wished to search her, she dropped the five pieces of muslin. The prisoner seemed very much confused. I saw it drop from her myself. This is the muslin; it is the property of

               <p>Q. Did the lad go with you - A. Yes; he came with me from Wales.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the lad speak any English - A. No; we came from Cardiganshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any advice - A. Yes. He gave me advice to leave the things with the lad in the public-house while the prisoner went with me. The prisoner and me went out of the house. I left the lad and the clothes in the house. The prisoner and me went to enquire for a person of the name of Bellam.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all acquainted with the prisoner before - A. No, he was quite a stranger. I asked him if he knew such a place where Bellam lived. He said, yes, he would shew me the place. We could not find it. I went into a public-house, and there he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him again - A. No, not until he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with the lad that night - A. No, not that night. I met with the lad on Sunday, at my house in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the things since - A. No, only the handkerchief, and that was found round the prisoner's neck. When I saw the handkerchief at the magistrate's I claimed it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you left in charge any thing at a public-house by Jones - A. Yes, I was left in charge of two bundles: they contained wearing apparel, shirts, breeches, stockings, and a coat of the prosecutor's. After I was left in the public-house the prisoner came to me and said, that I must come to the prosecutor; that the had found the place out. The prisoner took up the prosecutor's bundle, and told me to come on with him. We went on. I could not walk fast enough for the prisoner. He took my bundle likewise, and told me to come along. We called for a pot of beer, and I paid for it. The prisoner gave the bundles to the landlady of the house, and then he took me to another public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses did you go into - A. Three. The last public-house he called for a pint of beer, and left me there. I never saw him after until I saw him before the magistrate. I went to the second public-house, where the prisoner deposited the bundles. I have never seen the bundles again.</p>

I was in liquor when I went into the house; and when I quitted the tap-room, I went into the parlour the four prisoners went with me into the parlour. We drank together. I fell asleep in the parlour. When I was asleep one of the prisoners absented himself his name is Willoughby.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Willoughby came back after you awakened - A. I have been told in about three quarters of an hour. I do not know of my own knowledge. I had fourteen pound in bank notes; two two's and two five's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you so much as that when you awoke from your sleep - A. No, I had not when I awoke. I am sure that I had the notes when I went into the parlour, and some time afterwards, until I drank to that degree that I fell asleep. The landlord had got a five pound note and a two pound note; I gave it to him before I fell asleep to pay part of my reckoning. I know that I had got the other two pound and five pound in my pocket. They were in my pocket, in a piece of a rag. I am confident that I had them when I fell asleep, and at the time I awoke I was alarmed, and told that I had been robbed. I did not know, myself, that I had been robbed, until I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the four prisoners in the room when you awoke - A. No, Willougby was not. I cannot say whether the other three were or not. When I awoke I was without the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the notes since - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the prisoners charged - A. That day; the 16th of last month.</p>
               <p>MR. WICKHAM. Q. You keep this public-house the Eight Bells, do not you - A. I did, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of the four prisoners - A. Perfectly well. I remember their being in my house in company together on the 16th of March.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070033"/>Mackdonald came to the outside of the bar. There were a number with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the parties that went into the parlour - A. The four prisoners and Mackdonald; those are the parties I saw there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they drinking together - A. Mackdonald was drinking a long time. At one time I got a two pound note of him, and another time a five pound note. I wanted the whole of the money to keep for him, and I told him if he wanted to treat his comrades I would give him twenty shillings all in silver. When he gave me the five pound note I saw him have a one pound note and another note. I cannot swear to the value of it. He wrapped up two notes in a rag, and placed them in his right hand waistcoat pocket. He then went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went into the parlour where were the prisoners - A. In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they stay together after that - A. They were some time together in the parlour after that; an hour or two. It is impossible to be correct in stating to time.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time was there any liquor - A. Yes, beer and half-and-half, and they were smoking together. They had half ale and half porter. I was backwards and forwards while they were together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular - A. When I was in in the parlour I observed Willoughby put his hand into Mackdonald's pocket, and take out the tobacco and throw it on the table for them all to smoke. The left hand pocket, not the right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mackdonald asleep then - A. No; he was quite drunk, and the last time I went into the room Mackdonald was asleep in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the prisoners there then - A. No, Willoughby was absent and Todman was absent, and whether Clibbon was about the door I will not swear. Thompson was present. When I went in, Thompson said, Wickham, I wish you had all that man's money. I said, I wish I had it all. I said, there is nothing like the time present; I shall, now he is asleep, take it from him, and take care of it for him. I put my right hand into his right hand waistcoat pocket, where I saw him deposit the notes and the rag, and neither the notes nor the rag were there. I then searched his left hand pocket; there was nothing there. I then said, Thompson, this man is robbed, and I will not stand it. By that time Clibbon came in. After that I went out, and met Todman coming in. I went to the parlour, and locked the door. I had all in the parlour but Willoughby. I said, that man has been robbed, and I will not let any of you go out. At that time the parlour door was locked, and I had the key. An officer came; I told him the circumstance. More assistance came, and they were taken. Then in came Willoughby. He said, what, is the parlour door locked? Yes, I said, it is, but I will unlock it. I unlocked it, and said, I will lock you all in. I gave them all in charge of the constable.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Luke's. On the 16th of March, I was sent for to take these prisoners into custody for robbing Mackdonald. I found Willoughby absent. The other prisoners were locked up in the parlour. I went for three other officers, and when I came back Willoughby had returned. They were all four there. Mr. Wickham then gave me charge of all four. I searched the prisoners. I found nothing upon either of them.</p>

             on the 9th of March last. On that day I carried out flour. I left my barrow by the side of some alms-houses; when I came back the first thing that I missed was two half-quartern loaves. Pugh lived near that way. I saw him and his brother and another lad when I left my barrow, and when I came back I saw the prisoner running about an hundred yards from me. I made all the haste I could, because I was suspicious when I saw the prisoner running. I saw part of a loaf under his arm. On my searching further into the barrow, I missed two quarterns of flour. The prisoner got into his dwelling-house and came out again before I came up to him, and when he turned out he had nothing with him. I asked him to give me back the bread that he had taken from the barrow. He made use of bitter oaths, and said if I came there they would put me into trouble. I told him, he had better give it me back, and I would not take any trouble in it; if he did not I would inform my master, and have him taken up. I went away. They followed me all over Bow Common, calling me names. I went as far as Mile-end. I told my master of it. We got a constable, and we all went down together. We went to the prisoner's dwelling on Bow Common. They live in a caravan. I searched the caravan. There was a quartern of flour found in another bag. My bag I never found.</p>

When we got there we charged him with stealing the bread and flour. The prisoner said, he knew nothing at all of it. We searched the place, and found some flour in a flour-bag, on the table.</p>

He said, nothing at all. I said, I shall not be satisfied until I search you. I took his hat off. These rivets were inside of his hat. I found nine new copper rivets. I asked him how he came by them. He told me he picked them out of some rubbish down by the steam engine, where he was at work. There was not the least appearance of rubbish or dirt sticking to them when I first took them from him. When I took him in custody he said he was very sorry he had done it; he wished he had let the rivets alone. They are the property of the London Dock Company. They were brought in for the repair of the steam engine; it was under repair.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at work at the Engine-house at the London Docks - A. Yes, he was. On the 17th of February, I received eight dozen rivetts; they were cast in the London Dock by their own smith. I missed a dozen of them. I have seen the rivetts produced by the officer. I believe them to be a part of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was ten days at work there as a bricklayer's labourer. I picked up these things. I did not know what use they were. I put them in my hat, and as I was going towards the gate, this man said, what have you got in your hat. I said, nothing. He took my hat off, and found these things. I picked them up out of the rubbish.</p>

On the outside was a strong staple padlock that was forced by a crow, I suppose, or by an instrument of that description.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the padlock fastened - A. About an hour and a half before it was done; when we shut up. Two packages were stolen, one package contained ninety-five pieces of cambric muslin, and the other bale contained ten pieces of woollen cloth. The muslin was worth sixty pounds, and the other twenty pounds and upwards. I have never found any of the property.</p>

The prisoner went in, and when he came out he brought a barrel out on his shoulder; then about half an hour after one the prisoner and Smith came together again. They then both went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where they went to - A. No, I do not. About half after one, they came again. Then Smith went into Mr. Eykin's; he brought out a barrel the same as the other. Two officers, Carlisle and Tillcock came up at the time. I spoke to them. They secured the property about three parts across the sheep-pens in Smithfield, where the prisoner pitched it. When Carlisle and Tillcock came up to him the prisoner attempted to run away. They took Smith; Griffen ran away.</p>

I observed these men about a week or ten days before coming of a morning or loitering about there, and sometimes down lower, backwards and forwards. On the 13th of March, about half after one, Smith crossed the way, and I saw Smith go into Mr. Eykin's warehouse; he brought out a barrel upon his shoulder. When I saw him come out, Carlisle and Tillcock come to my house. I told them, and they followed him. Smith went to the sheep pens and pitched it.</p>

            , SENIOR. I came there at half past one o'clock. From information of Mr. Wootton, I followed Smith in the sheep-pens, where he pitched it. I asked him what he had got. He said, a tub of saltpetre; he got it from Mr. Hilliker's, St. John-street; he was going to take it to No. 6, John-street, Bishopsgate-street. I asked him if he had got a bill of parcels. He said, no, and directly he put his hat on and run away.</p>
               <p>- TILLCOCK. When Smith ran away I had the care of the cask it. This is the cask.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I have no doubt that is our cask. I lost three. The firm of the house is the same I mentioned in the other trial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday morning I went into the Half Moon, Smithfield, and while I was having my breakfast one of Mr. Browning's porters asked me if I had got any employment. I told him I had not. He told me to come at half after one o'clock, and take a cask of saltpetre to No. 6, John-street, he would pay me. The porter's name is Freeman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson. Freeman left us and went for a soldier before this.</p>

The officer who gave the information brought the remnants of that piece of fustian; his name is Forrester; and we also found a dozen pair of cotton stockings in his Sunday coat pocket, in his box.</p>
               <p>Q. When did these stockings come into your warehouse - A. The Saturday before, and this was on Monday. They have the number belonging to the parcel that they came in, which number was missed, and when we added that dozen to the rest of the parcel, the parcel was complete.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that dozen pair of stockings - A. Fifteen shillings: they are worth more than that. I value the fustian at forty-five shillings; it is worth more than that. In the prisoner's box was long lawn woollen cord, diaper napkins, and stock receipts to the amount of four hundred pounds stock, one hundred and ninety pounds of which his father left him, and he certainly is a very careful man.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his wages - A. Twenty-eight pounds a year and his board.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had found these things what account did the prisoner give - A. He acknowledged they were our property.</p>

I said, he had made good haste; I hardly supposed he could come back in the time. He said, that he had run all the way from our house to Bond-street, for the gentleman was waiting to see the articles. I asked if he lived at Mr. Butt's at the present time, for I had not recollected seeing him from Mr. Butt's house for a considerable time; some other person had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070037"/>the habit of coming from Mr. Butt lately.

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Thursday, the 25th of March, I was sent to Mrs. Thiot's house. She stated to me that the servant had robbed her of two bottles of wine and one bottle of rum, and her cap. I searched the prisoner, and found on her two muslin handkerchiefs belonging to Mr. Abbott. I searched her bundle; I found a pair of stockings, stated by Mrs. Thiot to belong to a person that had left her house. I then asked the prisoner where she had been sleeping out on the over night. She said at Mrs. Mosely's, Bird-court, Philip-lane. I then, in company with Branscomb, went to Mrs. Mosely's. I there found a sheet marked in red ink, with Mrs. Thiot's name, a pair of blankets, and another cap sworn to by the prosecutrix, and several other articles belonging to other gentlemen who have left town. These are Mr. Abbott's handkerchiefs.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Saturday, the 6th of March, I, in company with Branscomb, was attending the bankrupts in Guildhall. I observed the prisoner coming down the steps under the clock, and seeing him rather in a bustle, and knowing of him, I told my partner that I thought something was amiss. We let him go down the steps by the Town Clerk's office, into Basinghall-street; I then followed him to the corner of the White Bear, Basinghall-street. I laid hold of him, and I unbuttoned his coat, and immediately perceived this book half way in his breast pocket. I asked him what he had got there. He immediately began to cry. I gave the book to Branscomb, and proceeded to search him. In his pocket I found a little silver, and a pair of scissars. I then took him to the Compter, while Branscomb went to Guildhall to look for the owner. This is the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my pocket-book; I lost it in Guildhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070038"/>- BRANSCOMB. I know no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Saturday being a leisure day I went to Guildhall to hear the trials. I came out of Guildhall, and picked up this pocket-book on the steps. I came out, and went into Basinghall-street. Mr. Brown tapped me on the shoulder with a cane; he said, Isaacs, what do you do at Guildhall. I said, nothing but to hear the trials. He opened my coat, and took the pocket-book away, and afterwards he took me into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a great coat that belonged to your master on the 13th of February last - A. Yes, I wore it on the evening of the 12th of February. I did not miss it until the next day. I left it in the stable; me and my wife live over the stable. On the 19th of February, as I came home through Temple-bar, I met the prisoner and another man in company. The prisoner had this box coat under his arm. I came up to them. I asked them if they had that box coat for sale; they said they had just bought it. I said, I will buy it of you if you will let me have it for a fair valuation. They said they wanted only one shilling for their bargain. I said, come into the next public-house and I will pay you for it. We went into a public-house; I told the landlady to bring in a pot of beer. I put the coat on and buttoned it up. I said it is a very good fit. I shut the door upon them. I said you are both my prisoners. They both said they bought the duplicate of the coat of a man; the men said they would go quietly with me any where. I took them to Bow-street. This is the coat. It is my master's coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of stealing the coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been in the course of dealing with Mr. Hankin - A. I have; I know the prisoner as his clerk. In the month of January last, I was indebted to Mr. Hankin fifty pounds and upwards for flour that I had bought of the prisoner as Mr. Hankin's clerk. On the 26th of January, I paid to him twenty-one pound. I recollect making the payment very well.</p>
               <p>THOMAN HANKIS. I am a mealman in Hertfordshire, my accompting-house is in Bishospgate-street; it is 108, and three or four doors from the church. The prisoner was employed by me, as clerk, in London, he was my clerk down to the 19th of February; he was employed to sell flour and receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of January last, was Mr. Easton indebted to you fifty pounds and upwards for flour - A. Yes, I attended in London every Monday and Friday, at my accompting-house, in Bishopsgate-street; I had other clerks besides the prisoner. When I came to town on the Monday my clerk should pay me the money they had received on the Friday and Saturday, and they were to pay on the Friday the money they received on Monday. On Friday, the 28th I was in London, he should have accounted to me for the money he received of Mr. Easton, he did not, until the 19th of February. I was not apprized by him of his having received any money of Mr. Easton. I questioned him about the money of another customer, after that I called upon that customer, and within two or three hours afterwards I saw the prisoner. I then told him there was something amiss, and I said, be cautious what you are at, he was flurried and acknowledged that things were not as they ought to be. Having other clerks at the desks I took him into another room. I then said, Mr. Toft, what have you been doing. He then told me that he had embezzled money to a considerable amount. He wished me to let it stand over till Monday, then he would settle the account to the amount of three hundred and twenty pounds. This sum of Mr. Easton's was part of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

            . A woman gave the information of the prisoner stealing the cloth, about half past eight at night on the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this linen - A. At the corner of the window inside, close to the door; it was standing up in a whole piece. The prisoner crept inside of the shop on his hands and knees, and took the linen. I had seen the linen safe in its place about half an hour before the woman gave the information. In consequence of what the woman told me I ran out of the shop; the prisoner was half way down Jury-street. The door where the prisoner took it from is in Jury-street. I pursued the prisoner about ten yards from the shop, he was running when I caught sight of him; he dropped the linen while I was pursuing of him; he was stopped in the Minories by the officer, and the linen was picked up and delivered to Kinnersley the officer. I was quite sure it was the linen that had been in my master's shop shortly before.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. I followed the prisoner as well as Kendrick, and I gave charge of the prisoner. When I saw the linen in the hands of the officer I saw my private marks upon it. This is the piece of cloth, it has my own shop mark upon it. The prisoner begged for mercey, hoped I would not prosecute him, but send him on board the tender. I value the piece of linen at about thirty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor said he did not wish to punish me if I was willing to go on board the Tender. I begged for mercy, and said I was willing to go on board.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the City of London. I met the prisoner on the 30th of March, in the evening on Holborn-hill, this side of Field-lane; he had these wrappers on his shoulder, and seeing him go towards Field-lane I thought all was not right. I asked him where he got these wrappers, and where he worked. He said he worked for Mr. Stapp, the wrappers were is own property, they were perquisites. I told him I knew his master well, I would give him the trouble to walk back. I took the prisoner to Mr. Stapp's shop, and one of the clerks said they were no such thing as perquisites. The prisoner told a gentleman in my hearing where he lived, I think his apartment is in Cow-cross. I went to his apartment and found this cheese in a butter-flat, it weighs about eight pounds. One of Mr. Stapp's shopman asked him if he could account for that. He said he bought it of a young man in the street. I asked him if he should know the young man again. He said he did not think he should.</p>

            , esq. or bearer, two thousand and ninety pounds eleven shillings." Mr. Cook having forged this check, which you now produce, in the name of John and Hatches Tower - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What was done with the forged check which you looked at just now - A. I understood that Cook was to deliever it to Kennet, in order to send it for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. What next then was done about this check - A. I took a furnished apartment in Francis-street, Bedford-square, for Kennet, as I understood that apartment was afterwards occupied by Kennet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. How do you know it was occupied by Kennet - A. Cook informed me it was, and a clerk was hired.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were you present when the clerk was hired - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever converse with Kennet upon the subject of the clerk being hired - A. I did. It was intimated by Cook to Kennet that he should hire a clerk for the purpose of negotiating the draft, and a clerk was hired and sent to Messrs. Glyn and Company with the draft.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you see him sent - A. I saw the clerk afterwards when he had got the money. The first time that I saw the clerk I saw him in Newport-street: that clerk's name was Pollard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had there any conversation taken place between you relative to the dress that Kennet was to be in - A. There had. We met at the house of Birdett, and also at the Bedford coffee-house, in Southampton-row. It was there agreed for Kennet to disguise himself in a suit of clothes, a coat of a drab mixed colour, a light waistcoat, and drab-coloured kerseymere pantaloons. It was agreed that he should have a wig and common green-glass spectacles. The clothes were procured by a person of the name of Hudson, a tobacconist, in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. These clothes were to be obtained for this particular occasion, were they not - A. No, for another occasion of a similar nature. They were obtained for a forgery that was never committed.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not the clothes that Kennet used to wear - A. No, they were not. We entered into an agreement that Kennet should hire a clerk, and send him for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see that person act as clerk - A. I did, that person turned out to be Pollard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you talk about the draft - A. In our conversation we talked about the forgery: we talked of it being committed by Cook. The clerk did so present the draft, and it was paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When did you see that clerk - A. I saw him afterwards somewhere in Tottenham-court-road, and followed him to Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Tottenham-court-road is near Francis-street A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that - A. On the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Pollard - A. I saw him on the evening of the 27th at the same lodging in Francis-street. He had been, as I suppose, with Kennet. I saw him in Francis-street, coming from a house. The next time I saw him was on the following day, previous to his presenting the draft. I saw him in Newport-street, previous to his presenting the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you saw him the next day in Newport-street had you seen Kennet - A. I did, on the morning of that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Kennet say - A. It was merely stated that Kennet was to send this clerk with this forged draft. Nothing else passed at that time, as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Where on that day did you see the clerk - A. I saw him in Newport-street first about the middle of the day. I saw him go into a boot and shoemakers shop. He was coming in a direction from Francis-street. He went into the boot and shoe makers; there I left him for a time. I was watching him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had it been agreed upon between you that you should watch him - A. It had.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were you watching - A. To prevent the possibillity of detection at the banking-house. I was to follow him into the banking-house, to see if the draft was paid, but I left him in Newport-street. I afterwards saw him in Holborn, in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-court-road. I met him there by design.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to go from Newport-street and take your station in Tottenham-court-road - A. It was presumed by us that the money was paid, though we first thought it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Then you had seen him go into the shoe makers - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go into the bankers as you had proposed - A. Because I did not think he was going to the bankers. I was to go to the bankers to see whether it was paid or not, and if it was paid I was to inform Cook of the circumstance, and if it was not paid I was to inform Cook that they might get out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed he was not going to the bankers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you go to Holborn - A. To see whether he came where he was ordered to come. I went to Cook, and informed him that I thought the money would not be paid; in consequence of which we went away. It was afterwards thought by the whole of us, comprising Kennet and Birdett, Cook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070042"/>and me, that the money was paid. In consequence of that a note was sent to Francis-street, desiring the clerk to bring the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who wrote that note - A. I am not able to speak to that positively. One of us four wrote that note.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you will know when you see it. Look at that note; is that it - A. This is it. I cannot swear positively to the writing. If it is Kennet's it is disguised: it is not his usual writing. I believe it to be Kennet's. I cannot speak positively that it is his writing. The note read by</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Directed to Mr. Pollard, No. 13, Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>"Sir, I request you will come to me at the White Hart, the corner of Warwick-court, Holborn. This is marked C.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. to Richardson. That note was for the purpose of the clerk coming to the White Hart, the corner of Warwick-court to bring the money - A. Yes. I saw the clerk then near Tottenham-court-road, as if coming to Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Tottenham-court-road - A. For the purpose to see if the clerk came alone with the money. It was settled by the whole of us that I should go and watch in Tottenham-court-road. I did, and when near Tottenham-court-road I watched him into Holborn, and in Holborn he accost-me, asking me which was the White Hart coffee-house. I went on the way to the White Hart. He asked me the way to the White Hart. I accompanied him to the White Hart, and went in the coffee-room with him, and staid a few minutes, and drank a gill of wine. I heard him enquire for Mr. Blunt in the coffee-room. I then returned to Chancery-lane, leaving him in the coffee-room. I returned to Chancery-lane, at the Six Clerks office; there I saw Cook in a coach. I informed him, that in my opinion the clerk was there with the money. I only saw Cook: Kennet might be in the coach; I did not see him. I informed Cook that I believed he had got the money. I then left Cook, having agreed to meet again at the house of Birdett some time afterwards on the same day, in order to share the money if it was obtained. I went then to Ship-yard, to Birdett's: the whole of us were present; Kennet, Cook, Birdett, and myself. I believe I got there first. I think Cook and Kennet came together, and Birdett.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Kennet, at that time he came to Ship-yard, dressed - A. I think, previous to his coming there he had changed his dress. I am not able to speak positively whether he came in his dress or not. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him in this transaction with that dress on - A. I think I had. I know I had, some time before this transaction, seen him with this dress on. At Birdett's we divided the money. Three of us received six hundred pounds each; me, Cook, and Kennet received six hundred pounds each, and Birdett two hundred and ninety pounds. The eleven shillings was not brought in question, and I think some time after we divided the money we separated.</p>
               <p>Q.How was this money produced - A. It was produced in fifty pound notes: they were in a pocketbook. I cannot recollect who produced the book. I think it was mentioned that the pocket-book belonged to the clerk. It was there agreed it should be sent back to the clerk with a little money in it for his trouble; what that sum was I cannot immediately recollect; it might be one or two pounds. I think Cook was to do that; I am not positive. We shortly after separated.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you go by - A. At that time in the name of Rivers in the purchase of stock.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did the prisoner go by - A. I never knew him by any other name than Kennet. In this transaction he went by the name of Blunt, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him use any other name - A. I have heard him called by the name of King, but not in any transaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You seem very much at your ease in all this story. When were you taken up - A. For what, sir?</p>
               <p>Q. You may well ask that question: When were you taken up last - A. Some time in January.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon very many charges of forgery - A. Upon a charge of forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, and I take it for granted, you thought you should not have the good luck to be transported this time. In short, you began to expect you should be hanged - A. What my expectations were I cannot state.</p>
               <p>Q. You began to think your time was come - A. I cannot say that. I certainly felt aukward sensations, as any man in my situation must have done.</p>
               <p>Q. I think so: whereupon you said you could tell a story - A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the bargain that you made at last - A. I do not know any thing of a bargain. It was agreed that I should be an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You have, in point of fact, made many confessions of many forgeries that you have been concerned in - A. I have, in point of fact, admitted that I have been one in this forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. You would much rather anybody else should be hanged than yourself - A. Any man in my situation would have done that.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN POLLARD. Q. I believe now you live clerk with Messrs. Lee and Company, wine merchants - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the beginning of the year 1811, were you in want of a situation - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You put an advertisement in a paper - A. I did, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and see whether that is your advertisement - A. That is the very identical one. (Read.)</p>

               <p>"If B. P.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070043"/>will call upon Mr. Blunt to-morrow, in Francis-street, Oxford-street, he may meet with a situation that will suit him."</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving that letter did you go to Francis-street - A. I did, on the following day, at the time appointed on the 27th. I there saw a person calling himself Blunt. He was dressed in a light drab coat, and also pantaloons of the same colour: they were kerseymere pantaloons. I think they were rather lighter than the coat. I cannot say any thing of the waistcoat, the coat was buttoned over it. He had on green spectacles; they were somewhat like goglers; they were tied with green silk to keep the dust out of the eyes; it was tied on with green silk, so as to go over the nose and eyes. He wore a carrotty wig. There was a great deal of hair upon the head; it strikes me forcibly that it was a wig</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what passed between you and the person calling himself Blunt - A. He said he wanted a clerk. He asked several questions of me; with whom I lived. I told him that I lived with Messrs. Lee and Company, whom I am still living with now, at Bath, and that I was superseded by a nephew of Mr. Lee's, in consequence of which I came to London to get a situation. He stated to me that he was recently from the West Indies, where he had been living twenty-one years or thereabouts, and he was just returned; that he had a series of accompts to settle that he wanted me to do with him at his leisure, when he could have me with him. He enquired after my reference in town. He asked me what salary I should expect to have. I would not fix upon any salary until I knew his employment, by way of saying something. He asked me if an hundred guineas would do for me, and to dine with him occasionally, to which I said, I thought it would. He made an appointment for me to call on the morrow, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with him - A. Half an hour, or a little more. When I came in he asked me to sit in a chair. I stood instead of sitting. On the next day, the servant let me in. He said, his agent had been enquiring at my town reference, and my character proved to be satisfactory; then he told me he had got his boxes coming from Portsmouth or Liverpool. He seemed to be at a loss when I should commence employment with him. He said something about calling on the morrow, before he fixed any thing else. He asked me if I was engaged for the afternoon. I answered him in the negative. He said he had a little business that he wanted transacted in town, he should be obliged to me to do it for him, to which I readily consented.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that business - A. He had then laying before him, on a table, a paper, pens, and ink, and on the paper there was something written on one part of it. He finished writing that. He broke a piece off, and wrote the whole of another. He asked me then if I knew where Birchin-lane was. I answered in the negative. He asked me then, if I knew the Royal Exchange, or Cornhill; to which I said I did know perfectly well. He then 
               <persName id="t18130407-71-person632">drew</persName>
             a piece of paper out of his pocket-book. This was on the morning of the 28th, as far as my recollection will allow.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the paper that he drew from his pocket-book - A. He said it was a check upon the house of Messrs. Carr Glyn that he wanted to get cash for.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper - A. It corresponded with this, and the same date, and worded verbatim the same, and the same amount. I believe this check to be really the same. He told me that I should take it there to Birchin-lane; they would pay me; that the bankers clerks were in the office, acting; and that they would pay me in large papers.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is bills of large amount - A. Bills of large amount. He said, large papers, for which I was to go to the Bank of England, and get them exchanged into smaller ones. I asked him what smaller ones. That he left at my option. He then took up a paper that he had furnished writing, which was that I was to go to Moorgate coffee-house, the corner of Fore-street, Cripplegate, near Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, is that paper that you hold in your hand the paper that was part written that he finished when you went in - A. It is. He wrote another, which is 
               <persName id="t18130407-71-person633">

After he gave me that I was to come to that house; I was to go directly into the coffee-room, and there I should find him, because he should dine there with a friend if it was a fine day. Then he put this in my hand. This he writ in my presence,

            , esq. No. 13, Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. This, I presume, he wrote merely that I should not forget the direction where he was. They were all the directions he gave to me at that time. I was with him about an hour, or three quarters of an hour; then I quitted there. He told me the direct way for me was through Holborn. On my going out of the room I could not open the door; he rung the bell for the servant. The servant came, and the door was opened, and the servant of the house asked me if I had agreed to come into his employment. I communicated to the servant of the house that I was going to Birchin-lane. When I came out it began to rain a little; I went to my lodgings at Mr. Abbotts. I staid there about an hour. I communicated to Mr. Abbott where I was going, and shewed also the check. I put on a great coat, and also took an umbrella with me, as it was rainy, and I went to No. 20, Brewer-street, Golden-square, to acquaint another friend with my proceeding, to tell him that I had employment. I also expressed my sentiment somewhat to Mr. Abbott; I thought it a great trust to be put into my hands before my new employer had my original character. I went from Brewer-street to the bankers, and presented the check to the clerk, and he paid me. I went to the bankers, Messrs. Carr Glynn and Company, presented the check; it was paid me in two notes of one thousand each, a forty, and a fifty pound note, half-a-guinea and a sixpence. I went from there to the Bank of England to get them changed.</p>

               <p>Q. There, I believe, it is necessary for you to put your address - A. When I came there (I never was there before), I was a stranger which office I was to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070044"/>to. A gentleman there informed me that I was to write my name on the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these notes, and say whether they are the notes that you received from Messrs. Glyn and Company - A. These are the two thousand pound notes. I wrote my name on them, and Blunt's address. I wrote no name on the smaller notes. I thought they were small enough. I only, changed at the Bank the two thousand-pound notes. I got twenty fifties, thirty-three thirties, and a ten. On one of the papers I made a calculation how many notes I was to have.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes that you received at the Bank - A. I put them in my pocketbook. In my way to the Bank, Mr. Abbott gave me a note to leave at a house in Leadenhall-street; that minute was put on at Mr. Abbott's. I put the notes in my pocket-book, and put the pocket-book in my breast pocket, inside. When I came from the Bank I went to Moorgate coffee-house, and when I came there, instead of doing as he directed me, I went and asked the landlord if there was such a person there. Instead of going into the coffee-room, I named a gentleman with green spectacles. He said, there was no such a person there, and it raining I was not urgent in my enquiry. I went from there directly to Francis-street. When I got to Francis-street he was not there. I arrived at Francis-street about twenty minutes after three o'clock. I rang the bell. The person of the house opened the door. Mr. Blunt was not there. I understood from the people of the house that he went out soon after I went. I sat there until half past five in possession of the money, in his room. I at last received a letter. This is the identical letter; it is marked C. This letter appointed me to meet him at the White Hart. In consequence of my receiving that note I left the house, and went directly through Gower-street, and in my way to the White Hart I met a person that since I know to be Richardson. He was walking the same way gently. I have seen him repeatedly to-day. When I came out in Holborn I rather gained upon him, and at Holborn I was at a loss which way to turn, either to the right or to the left. I asked another person passing by, the way to the White Hart; they could not tell me. Richardson stepped up, and said, who do you enquire for sir. I said, for the White Hart, Warwick-court, Holborn. He said, that he was passing by the house, and he would take me with him; and on his way there he asked me if I had been in the country, and how dirty it was. He said, he came from Brentford that day, where he had been on business. I asked him with respect of the house, the White Hart. He said, that it was a respectable house, that gentlemen resorted there. He asked me if I was going to meet a gentleman there, or going on business. I said I was going there on business to meet a gentleman. I expostulated with him that he was taking me too far from the house. I suspected him, and thought he was not an honest man. When he came to the White Hart he shewed me the White Hart. He said, there is the White Hart, sir. I went into the house, and enquired for Mr. Blunt, a gentleman in green spectacles. They said, there was no such person there. Richardson told the waiter to bring him a noggin of wine, and he heard them tell me that there was no such person there. He was present at the time; he called to the waiter to know what there was to pay. The waiter said, some pence under a shilling. He gave a shilling, and the change he said he would give to him, and he went off. I was very uneasy; what to do I did not know. I considered with myself whether it was not best to return to my lodging. I went out of the door, and stood waiting a little bit. I saw Mr. Blunt, my employer; he was coming across the street with one arm a-kimbo. He was the same person, and in the same dress. He was coming as if from Chancery-lane. He was in the middle of the horse-road, in Holborn, before I saw him. He came on to me. I stepped off the door, as if to meet him. He beckoned to me, and said, have you done that little business for me, continued walking, and told me to come round the corner, in Warwick-court. I told him that I had done the business, and told him how and in what manner I had the notes, saying, if he thought proper if he would have them there I could give them him in my pocket-book. I took my pocket-book out as I was speaking to him. He said, going into a coffee-house, he did not like to do it. He asked me, if it was convenient for him to keep the pocket-book until the morrow, until I came to him. I told him, that it was. I gave him also half-a-guinea in gold and a sixpence in silver, that made eleven shillings, and I gave him the pocket-book. Then I parted with him. He said then, I shall not want you now until the morrow at eleven o'clock. That was the last time I saw him in that dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, look at the prisoner, and say what you believe - A. I believe him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt - A. A trifling doubt. The green spectacles and the habit altogether makes a little difference, but I believe him to be the identical man, knowing by his side face from his cravat. There is a flagginess about his chin, and his handkerchief is over it. When he was writing for me the Moorgate coffee-house direction I took notice of his side face.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw him again - A. The last time I saw him in the habit and the green spectacles was on the 28th of February, 1811. I think it was the 3d of February, 1813, he was exhibited before me again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you hear him speak enough so as to recollect whether it was the same voice - A. I did not hear him enough to say it was the same voice. After I gave him my pocket-book with the notes I went to see some friends. I went home to my lodgings between ten and eleven o'clock. When I came in there I received my pocket-book done up in a brown paper parcel, and a seal over it, and two one-pound notes were in my pocket-book, and I believe a few things that were in it prior to that. The note is;</p>
               <p>"Sir, I found by a letter from my most particular friend at Liverpool, she is very ill, whom I must go to see; am not certain when I shall return. I am, sir, your friend.</p>

Carr Glyn and Company. I communicated the whole circumstance to Mr. Abbott, and by his advice, I went to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you the next day go to the banking-house where you received the notes - A. I did, and communicated the circumstance. I got them to write the drawers name, Mr. Trowers. When I went to Mr. Trowers. I found the bankers clerk there, before me. I communicated the circumstance and delivered over the papers to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Mr. Trowers, that you had lived with Lee and Company - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Two years before February, 1813, you had seen somebody, that you now think is the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you were a stranger in London - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see more than one person at that house except the person that opened the door - A. No, only one.</p>
               <p>Q. That person of course you had never seen before - A. I had never seen before.</p>
               <p>Q. No doubt you took an accurate description of the man - A.Particularly so.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had made this disclosure to the banker, you returned into the country - A. In September I returned to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many examinations you underwent, at Bow-street - A. Only two that were put down; I was asked a few questions.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days did you go to the office - A. Twice only.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might you and Mr. Nares personally communicate upon the subject - A. Twice latterly; the first was in 1811.</p>
               <p>Q. I am talking of examinations of this year, did that impression remain throughout the examination, or did you alter your opinion; on your looking round, you said Richardson was the man - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man pointed out to you - A. He was, by Mr. Nares I think; I first thought he was not the man. My opinion before I left the room was, that he was the man. On the second examination, upon nature consideration, I believed him to be the man that I saw in Francis-street. I really believe now, that to be the man that I saw in Francis-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was present when that draft was brought for the purpose of being copied - A. I do not recollect any one but Richardson and myself Richardson gave it me. I made a copy from that draft, and filled up that check.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you obtain the blank check - A. I had some by me. I do not remember how I obtained them. It was proposed that Richardson should hire an apartment for the prisoner, Kennet, and that the prisoner should go to the apartment and the next day the clerk should be procured. The clerk was procured: and I believe, the next day this draft was presented by the prisoner. Whether I gave the draft to the prisoner or Richardson, I have it not in my memory; we were all together. It was planned altogether that the prisoner should be at that apartment, and the prisoner was to go by the name of Blunt. He was to tell his own story, and his dress was settled. It was something of a drab coat, I do not exactly recollect the colour; drab pantaloons and hessian boots. It was a disguise for a purpose that never took place. He wore his own hair, but he had a wig and green spectacles. I saw him in this disguise at the Bedford coffee-house, Russel-square. The clerk was hired on the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Bedford coffee-house the day before the clerk was hired - A. Yes; the clerk was hired and I think on the following day the draft was given to the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave the draft to the clerk - A. That I cannot say; I understood Kennet; Kennet was to deliver the forged draft to the clerk. Kennet was to transact the business with the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. How early upon that day, in which the draft was presented, did you see Kennet; I am speaking of the day in which he got the cash - A.Between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw him at the Bedford coffee-house: that was by appointment.</p>
               <p>Q. You all knew that was the day upon which the draft was to be presented - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to the Bedford coffee-house, was he in his usual habit, or the disguise - A. In the disguise.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purpose of your meeting at the Bedford coffee-house - A. It was for the purpose of the prisoner taking the check, to give it to the clerk. I went with him, part of the way, from the Bedford coffee-house, to Francis-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you dropped him, I saw soon on that day did you see him again - A. It might be in two hours afterwards. I beg your pardon, I am incorrect.</p>
               <p>Q. You went part of the way with him to Francis-street, and there you left him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take him up again - A. In<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070046"/>about half an hour; he came to me in Francis-street. I was to wait for him there, within sight of the house</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the young man come from the house - A. No, I did not. When Kennet came to me, he said, he had sent the note by the clerk. We agreed to take a coach, and go to the back of the Bank, Princes-street, and there to wait, to know whether the draft was paid, or not; we were to know that by Richardson, and a man of the name of

               <p>Q. How long did you remain in Princes-street - A. I suppose, three quarters of an hour. Richardson and Birdett came and said, they suspected the clerk suspected the transaction, they had seen him go into a house in Newport-street, and therefore suspected that there was a suspicion of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time, that Newport-street was the lodging of the advertising clerk - A. No. We went to a public-house, and concluded that the business was done away with, and all failed. It entered into our minds that the money might still be obtained. I thought it was a neglect in the man that was sent, for this purpose, that they had kept good look out, and at the

            , Robin Hood-court, Shoe-lane, at a public-house, it was agreed that a letter should be written. The prisoner wrote that letter, I think, (I am not confident,) for the purpose of giving it to a porter to carry to Francis-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or Birdett write a letter which was sent by a porter to Francis-street - A. There was no other than one letter written or sent.</p>

I saw him go into the tavern, and some little time after I saw him come out of the tavern and go up the court. I beg your pardon, that was Richardson.

               <p>Q. Who produced the money at Birdett's - A. Whether it was Richardson or Kennet I do not know. I think it was in a pocket-book.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. In a mixed coloured coat, rather light, a slouched hat, green spectacles, and a light coloured wig. A person came as a servant, him in. He staid about half an hour. Mr. Blunt went out about half an hour after the servant went. The servant told me he was going to the Bank, for two thousand and ninety pound, odd money. I never saw Mr. Blunt at the apartment again.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, in Newport-street. The young man, Pollard lodged at my house. He called at my house on the 28th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070048"/>of February, in the morning; he after that went into the City.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive a parcel that same evening - A. He did; his pocket-book, and other papers. I advised him to go to the bankers, the next morning; he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. That is the evidence on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent of this charge.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JAMES. I am a lace and fridge weaver, in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you considerable transactions with Kennet when he was a tradesman - A. I had, and I was a creditor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your transactions in business give you an opportunity of seeing his hand writing - A. I have seen his hand writing, and have transacted business with him upon that hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been applied to by Messrs. Kay and Freshfield - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I show you the letter A first, do you or not believe the paper marked A to be his hand writing - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, making an allowance for disguise being used, and it is written larger, do you find any letters in his hand writing - A. Not any in the paper marked B. There is not any impression in my mind that is, his hand writing, and the paper marked C, to the best of my recollection, not any in that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper D next, look at that now sir, as to any part of any one of them, do you find the hand writing of Kennet - A. I do not alter my opinion in the least. They were shown to me, and that was the answer that I gave first. In my judgment there are none of them his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Did you know that Mr. Kennet was in custody, before the application was made to you; whom did you communicate to before you had been applied to by the solicitor of the Bank - A. Mr. Hill called upon me, to get me to make a claim, that I had of Mr. Kennet.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the age of the claim - A. I have the note in my pocket. I think it must have been twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard anything about liquidating the draft, until after your old friend was charged with a forgery - A. It was mentioned before. I think some debts were in the habit of being purchased a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of your debt - A.Eighteen pounds two shillings and ninepence. Mr. Duff gave me to understand, that there was money lodged in the Court of Chancery, that would pay twenty shillings in the pound, about eighteen months or two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You had heard nothing of it until about three weeks ago - A. It might be that time. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your debt been paid - A. My debt has been paid. I received fifteen shillings in the pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to keep your promissory note in your pocket - A. I was not asked for it; I gave a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I should like to know, how a gentleman is approached under these circumstances - A. I think the solicitor for the prisoner saw me first, before the solicitor of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mr. Kennet was sent to prison, did his solicitor wait upon you - A. I am sure I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the honour of knowing Mr. Hill before Kennet was taken in custody - A.No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Hill upon his first introduction to you, tell you, that your old customer was in custody, charged with a forgery, and that you, and others would be applied to, to know whether it was his hand writing - A. Upon my oath, he did not. The first time was concerning the liquidation of this draft. He came to know what I would take. My answer was, that I had reason to believe the estate could pay twenty shillings in the pound, and that I would not take less.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to refuse to sell your debt, when your debtor found his way to Newgate - A. Because five shillings was offered. I took fifteen shillings in the pound.</p>

            . Q. I believe you lived in March last, at Mr. Carpenter's in Fleet-street - A. Yes. I quitted my place in March last.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you in your pocket, when you quitted your place - A. I had ten pound in the morning of that day, I left my place on the 11th of March, and on the 12th, I met the prisoner. I then had ten pound in my pocket. I saw the prisoner about half past seven, in the evening of the 12th. I met the prisoner just about Fleet-market, he passed me several times, he asked where I was going to; he pushed by my pockets, and asked me whether I had any money in my pockets. He went by me a good many times, and then came and took hold of my hand, and led me round the Old Bailey. He asked me if I had got any money; that was at the time that we were going round the Old Bailey. I told him yes, I had some money in my pocket. Then he said, we should go into some public-house, and have something to drink. I told him I could not; I had no time. He pressed me very much, and accordingly we then went into a public-house, in Newgate-street; there we had six penny worth of rum and water, and during the time we were drinking that, he pulled out a very large pocket book, with three folds, a black cover, it turned over three folds. There were a great number of notes, in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070049"/>pocket-book. He said, there were five pound, twenty pound, and thirty pound notes. He gave me one, and asked me for small change. He said, he had no small change. I told him he had better get change at the bar. He said he was a captain on board a ship, and that his ship laid in the East India Dock. He gave me a five pound note. He put the note in my dress, and said he wanted small change for it. He told me not to doubt his word; it was a five pound note. I told him to go to the bar. He said he would not go to the bar. I had got some money, and I was to give him my money for it. Then the prisoner paid for the rum and water, and we went out of the house. As soon as we got out of the door he asked me for my money. He gave me another five pound note, and told me to give him all the money I had. I gave him all I had except one shilling. He would not go any where to have it counted; he would have it out of doors. I had nine pound of silver in the morning when I went out, and a one pound note. I had spent about five or six shillings in the course of the day; I am not sure which. I gave him all my money but one shilling, and that he asked me for a great many times. I asked him to go in somewhere and put his name to the notes. He said he would not; I need not doubt his word; he had plenty about him. We went down Cheapside, and then he turned down St. Paul's church-yard, and then he went away. I do not know where he went to.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed anything particular about his person - A. Yes. he had lost a little bit off his little finger on the left hand. I observed that when we were sitting in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes he gave you - A. I put them into my pocket. I had no others. I had only those two that he gave me. On the next evening I went to a straw-bonnet shop in Leadenhall-street, a Mr. Bramwell's; there I went after a bonnet, and offered to pay for it with one of these notes. There it was perceived that the note was not a good one. They sent for an officer, and I was taken to a jail almost opposite of the Mansion House. When the officer said it was not a good one, I said if that is not a good one I have got another; I had them of a gentleman in the street, and I had given the full value for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the person that gave you the notes to the officer - A. I did not at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the prisoner was brought into the Compter had you told anybody about his hand - A. I told Mr. Chamberlain about his finger, and as soon as I saw the prisoner I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon was the prisoner brought there after you was there - A. I was taken about eight o'clock in the evening; I think the prisoner was brought in about two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner after he was brought in - A. About eight o'clock in the morning. I knew him as soon as I saw him, and I told the turnkey of the jail that he was the man that I was brought in for. The prisoner, soon after he saw me, he told me to go into the yard. I went with him. He told me when I should be taken up to have my hearing the next morning, not to say that I had been in service and had left my place. I was not to say that I gave money for these notes, if I did I should have fourteen years transportation; it used to be seven, but now it was fourteen. He told me to say that I was a girl of loose character, and that a gentleman made me a present of these to go and sleep with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Lord Mayor did you tell the story that the prisoner told you, or the story that you told now - A. I told the story I did now. I told the truth.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate young woman. I met with the prisoner about eight o'clock on Saturday evening, this month. I met with him at a public-house by Fleet-market. He asked me if I was an unfortunate girl. I told him I was. He asked me if I would go in keeping with him. I told him I did not intend to go in keeping. I intended to go home in a short time to my relations.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any refreshment with him - A. Yes, two glasses of rum and water, and while we were drinking the liquor he produced a black pocketbook. I saw there were in it a number of notes, a great many like bank notes. He told me he was a captain of a ship, and had been abroad for a long time, and had been taken by the French, and was in prison a long time. He said, his ship was in the East India Dock. He held up his hand, and shewed me his finger where it had been shot. It was the finger next to the little finger; the first joint was off: whether right or left I could not tell. He then pulled out a great many notes. He said he was a money kind of a man. I told him it was not a proper place for him to expose his money. He said he had only three halfpence in change; he had a great many notes. I paid for the two glasses of rum and water, then we went to my room. He wished for more drink; I sent out for it. Then he told me that my place was not fit for a gentleman to stop in; he would rather go to an inn. There was three shillings and sixpence in liquor, making the debt from him to me five shillings and sixpence in the whole. Then we went out together. He asked me if I had any change about me. I told him I had none; I would get the landlord to change the notes. He told me not to go to the landlord; he should go to an inn and change the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you expected to pass some time together - A. Yes. My room is in Charles-street, Drury-lane. We went down Holborn, towards Fleet-market, and when we came up to the watchhouse in Holborn he struck me, and told me if I did not go about my business he would do for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he shewn any disposition to quit you - A. Yes. I did not like to quit him without my money. He told me to stop a little; he was going to turn the corner a minute; he would return, and then he went to run away from me. I stood still until I saw him run, and then I went after him and caught hold of him by the coat. He called the watchman and gave me in charge. I was taken to the watchhouse. He made his charge at the watchhouse that I meaned to rob him, and that he had property about him. I could not afford to lose five shillings and sixpence. I stated my case to the constable, at the watchhouse.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070050"/>The watchman said I was a likely girl, and he had better give me the money and let me go about my business. Then we were both turned out of doors. When we came out of the watchhouse I told him if he had a home I would follow him until I had my money. He would not let me catch hold of him. I followed him as far as Smithfield, and when I got near to a watchhouse he began to say he was sorry for what he had done. We went up a court; he said there was a house there we could go in. I saw no house, but a poor place. He conducted himself with impropriety. He took out his notes, and pretended to give me a five pound note for what had past: he asked me if I had any change. I had only a farthing in my pocket. The watchman came up and took us both to the watchhouse, because I began to make a noise. I staid in the watchhouse till the morning; the prisoner was taken to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young person accosted me in the street; she asked me to give her something; I told her I had no money to give her; she said she would not leave me without. By these words a watchman came up. When I was taken to the watchhouse she stated that I had been with her, and that she had given me five shillings. I was so intoxicated I spoke more than what I ought to have done, by that means I was sent to the Poultry Compter. I never received a farthing in the world of the other girl, and what she has sworn against me is all false.</p>

I live in the front room, two pair. I went down one flight of stairs, to the person below. I looked out; I saw a strange woman coming down. I went up to my room, and missed the watch out of the case; it stood on the table. I directly went after the prisoner, and told her that she had got my watch. She said, she had not. The people came round her; she said, I had better take her in somewhere for a proper person to search her. The officer wanted to take her into a public-house; she said no; take me to your room. She dropped a three-shilling piece, and with the other hand she laid the watch down, on the chair in the room. This is the watch, it is my watch. I saw it in the prisoner's hand, and I am sure it was taken from off the table. It was not on the chair when I went out of the room.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 25th of March, I was sent to the Queen-head, at Knightsbridge. The landlord told me he had got a woman that he believed had stolen a shirt, and the next morning the prosecutrix said the shirt was hers, and it proved to be taken from a line. It was very wet when it was found. She had taken it to the pawnbroker; the pawnbroker would not take it in, because it was wet. This is the shirt.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my shirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the shirt between Knightsbridge and Chelsea. I gave the officer four shillings and the duplicate, there is only one shilling deficient.</p>

               <p>MATTHEW KIDGER. I am serjeant of the watch. On the 19th of March, the prisoner and Mr. Dawson were going up Holborn. I saw Mr. Dawson was rather in liquor; I followed them, suspecting something might be the case. The prisoner and Mr. Dawson walked under a gateway; in two minutes the prisoner run out. I saw something shine in her hand. I took the prisoner, and took her up Fox-court, and took from her a silver hunting watch, with a gold chain, seal, and key. This is the watch.</p>

            . Q. In the month of September, 1812, were you acquainted with the prisoners - A. Yes, I knew them some years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you also acquainted with a person of the name of Cook - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you engaged with them in any transaction, with respect to Ladbroke and Company - A. I was engaged with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you ever saw that check drawn - A. I possibly might, it was drawn by Cook. I received it from Cook; and after I had so received it, by appointment, I met the prisoners at the Horns tavern, Doctor's Commons. On the morning of the day, that the check was presented for payment, it was there arranged between me and Webb in what manner the business should be done. I think Brady was present at the first part of the conversation. It was arranged that Webb should go to the Angel inn, in Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-grand, and from there send the check for payment, by a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the check produced at the Horns tavern - A. I think not. I had it in my pocket. Webb and I left the Horns tavern for the purpose of carrying this into execution. We went together to the Angel, in our way there I gave Webb the forged check. Webb went into the coffee-room of the Angel first, and I after him. We took our seats in different boxes, to give the appearance of not knowing one another, as I was to follow the porter. That was preconcerted. I called for a glass of sherry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Webb, in the Angel, do anything<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070052"/>- A. I heard him desire the waiter to send the porter. The porter came in. I saw him give the check to the porter, and I think he desired him to go and get the money for it. The porter took the check and went out, and as soon as the porter was gone I left the room to follow the porter. I followed the porter as far as the Poultry. Webb quitted the coffee-room shorty after me, and joined me in the same street. He walked with me to a public-house in St. Martin's-le-grand; there I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked with the porter as far as the Poultry - A. I did. That was after I left Webb, and I think I saw Brady in the Poultry. I remained in the Poultry a few minutes, until I saw Brady.</p>
               <p>Q. What part in the transaction was it agreed that Brady should perform - A. It was agreed that I should follow the porter into the banking-house, but I did not do so. Brady told me he had some business at Ladbroke's, and that he should go to the banking-house instead of me, and he followed the porter to the banking-house instead of me. I went into a house near the spot. He soon after came to me at that house. He told me that he believed the check was not paid. I left him instantly, and went to the house where I had left Webb. Webb and I went to the Horns tavern. At that time none of us were taken. After that, I was taken in custody upon some charge, and I made this disclosure.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember in the beginning of the month of September, the witness Richardson coming into your coffee-room - A. I do. I think Webb came in first. Webb sat in the box next the door. Richardson sat in the third box. Webb called for a glass of sherry, and Richardson called for a glass of sherry. Webb asked me for the porter that we send of errands. I called the porter. I saw him speak to the porter and send him off. The porte went out of his errand, and after the porter was gone, Webb and Richardson paid me separate, and they both went out; and shortly after Mr. Gillman; the banker, came in with the porter. Richardson and Webb never returned again. This was on the first Monday in Bartholomew-fair time. I do not recollect the day of the month.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is that gentleman - A. Positively I could not swear to him, I had but one minutes sight of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Richardson there - A. No, not at that time, not until I saw him at Bow-street. I think the man that gave me the check was more jolly than Webb. I never saw Richardson to my knowledge until I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. This person whoever he was gave you a draft, did he - A. Yes, for seven hundred pounds sixteen shillings, and I went to the banker, Messrs. Ladbroke's, in Bank-buildings, it was handed from one to another, and at last refused. Mr. Gillman told me it was a forged one; he went back with me to the Angel, and the gentleman that gave me the check was gone.</p>

It was; and upon the examination of it, I believed it to be a forgery.

Yes; I think Brady is very much like the person, but he is very much altered. He is about the same size. He is like him, but I cannot say with certainty that he is the man. I saw Brady about two months ago. I then said he is like him, and I think now he is like him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you in the month of September at your inn - A. Yes. I suppose he came to my house in a coach. I found him in my house when I came down in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after the 1st of September was it that you saw the prisoner - A. About two or three days. I cannot swear justly to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a week - A. I think not. He came to me on a Saturday morning. He stopped and dined with me. I sent to the market; I saw his sister; she was standing there selling butter. I told her there was some person belonging to her at my house. His sister came to my house and when she came he met her in the gateway an kissed her. He went home with his sister. It is only about three miles from where the sister lived. I saw him on the Monday again.

               <p>Q. Have you any reason for remembering that day in particular - A. The three first days in September my family were mowing of barley, and on the Saturday he went home with me from the market; he spent the sabbath at my home, and my husband observed if it was a fine day on Monday we all of us were to turn out to assist in turning the corn. When the morning came, it was a fine day; I mentioned it to my brother. He said he would walk out, and he walked out. I saw no more of him till the next morning. He returned to Mr. Waddington's, as we understood from him. He continued coming backwards and forwards to our house ever other day until the latter end of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, look at your brother and tell me whether he is different in person now to what he was then - A. He was poorly in health then, and thin as he is now.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 6th of March, I went (in company with Leadbetter, Cartwright, and Wilson) to <placeName id="t18130407-81-crimeloc413">No. 14, Little Wild-street</placeName>

When we came up there we found a key in the door, in the front garret door, on the outside, whether in turning it to open it we had locked it. I knocked at the door and heard a voice say, who is there? I knocked again. The voice again said, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070054"/>is there. I then said, Wheeler, it is me, or us, open the door. I had a warrant, and knew the name was Wheeler. I put my foot against the door, and open the door went. When we came into the room the younger prisoner's wife was in the room with a child in her arms, and the younger prisoner was in the room with a short jacket on, and a white apron before him. Wheeler, the elder, was not there. Wheeler, junior, was secured. Every one of the officers were then in the room. We then proceeded to search. The first thing that caught my eye was a cutting engine, in the corner of the room, which is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light in the corner. Could you see distinctly what it was - A. Yes, I could plainly see what it was from a window in that room. I am acquainted with a cutting engine. There was a lathe fixed in the middle of the room, or nearly opposite of the window. A bench was before the window, with a vice fixed to that bench. This is the cutting engine.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain to the court the use of that cutting engine - A. This is called a dab; this was fixed in, and this is called a bolster; it was at the bottom, but not screwed. The top one is called a dab, and the bottom one a bolster; it works by the force of a screw. The piece of metal is put between the dab and the bolster; the dab forces into the bolster by the force of the screw, and cuts the metal into a round blank. On the same board were these other cutters, which are of the size of blank shillings. These are dabs and bolsters of the size of a shilling; here are three. This litter here was found in the engine. Here is the drawer that goes in undeneath; the blanks from the metal were found in that drawer, and these are the blanks that were found on the board close by the engine. On that day we matched a great number of these counterfeit blanks to the dab; they corresponded. These coppers in the drawer are cut into blanks. This drawer, they are copper, and in that there are more than thirty or forty of mixed metal. The waste of the metal is called sissel. The sixpences fits the round space in the sissel. The lathe is for the purpose of turning the edges. Here are sixty-three counterfeit blanks, with the edges turned by the lathe. This one was in the lathe at the time. I took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of perfection is that and the others you have just now produced - A. They are towards conclusion. A very little thing to be used to them would bring them to the colour of silver; the edges are turned. On the top of the lathe, besides them sixty-three, were a great number of blanks with the edges apparently turned. These others were laying on the lathe; some of them appear not to be edged. After I had searched the room, and put the officers in possession, I went down stairs into the front two pairs.

             owned the goods, and I have some receipts to show that the furniture is his in that room. He and his wife lived there. I searched the drawers in the two pair front room; I found fifty counterfeit shillings finished, and fourteen sixpences. Here they are. They are fit for circulation. To bring the silver to the surface aquafortis would be used. I found this pocket-book with two others, containing receipts of his landlord, and here are two punches for stamping letters on the counterfeit money. After I had searched the two pair of stairs front room, and secured the implements, I sent two officers down into the one pair, and when I went down there I found the elder Wheeler in their custody. That was in the back room one pair of stairs. He rented the one pair back room and the garret. I found the elder Wheeler without his coat. I searched the drawer in his presence. I found twelve counterfeit blanks of the size of a sixpence, and I found twenty that apparently appeared to be brace buttons. They were with holes in them, and too thick to be used in coining. The old Wheeler was secured, and so was the young one. These things I found, and all the things I found have been kept by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the garret situated with respect to light - A. It has a window in the middle which lets in a good light. The cutting engine could not be viewed from without, because there was a parapet wall besides a curtain that hung on the nearest side of the window to the cutting engine, and there were a great number of stains on the cloth that hung at the window. This leather was nailed inside of the door, over the key-hole, with three tacks, so that nobody could see into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sort of cutting engine that you have seen used for the purpose of coining - A. It is. I have seen many like it where this kind of business has been carried on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners say any thing, as you recollect - A. Their behaviour was remarkably civil; no men could behave better.</p>
               <p>DANIEL LEADBETTER. I am one of the marshalmen. I accompanied Armstrong and the other officers. I saw the things. I was not in the two pair where he found the things. I was up in the garret at that time. I found a quantity of punches and pots in a box. I found them in a lidge, close to the window. There was a bench also. This was in the garret, where the cutting engine was. I saw this cutting engine fixed there. I found some bags with two sorts of emery. I also found three or four crucibles, one with some white powder in it, and this one appears to have melted metal. I found thirty or forty blanks in the window in a paper marked, but I counted sixty-three blanks. I saw one blank fixed in the chops of the lathe, and on the top of the lathe was some file dust. This bottle, containing quicksilver, was given to me by

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the City. I went into the front garret with the other officers; we all went in together, and after that I went into the one pair back room with Wilson. There was the elder Wheeler, his wife, and a daughter, and another man; they were coming to the door, hearing us come down stairs; I immediately pushed in and handcuffed him and the other man together. I searched them, and found nothing upon them; the elder Wheeler was in his shirt sleeves, without his coat, and his spectacles on his forehead, as if they were thrown from his eyes. After taking the elder Wheeler I went into the front garret again. We began to pack up the things that were found in the press, and which I now produce. I found this sissel upon which the blanks are cut out. On the floor, by the side of the press I found some files, and a winch to take the press down. They are all here. I conveyed the elder prisoner away in a coach. He said the officers had behaved remarkably civil, and had done their duty as men, and he said if people played at bowls they must take rubbers.</p>

A varity of manufacturers have a cutting engine. I always understood Wheeler the younger had the garret. one time when I was waiting for a gross of week, the father came up and asked the son for six weeks rent.

I agreed to sell him nine pound, and he wished to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070056"/>take it without paying for it.

I met him again in a few minutes; I believe he went into Crutchedfriars. I met him again coming over Tower-hill; I followed him into Old Gravel-lane, into the shop of Mr. Edmond's where he sold the honey for fourteen pence a pind, and when he came out of the shop I lost sight of him. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

I gave him fourteen pence a pound; for the honey This is the receipt he gave me for it. The honey weighed between eight and nine pounds. The boy came in and told me the circumstance. I told him to pursue the man, instead of that he kept talking, and the man got off.</p>

            . I am a warfinger. On the 3d of March, I was passing Upper Thames-street, near the end of Bull-wharf-lane, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I met the prisoner Lewis with a mat on his shoulder. I watched him. He went about twenty yards down Kennet-wharf-lane, and there he put it down. The prisoner, Wainwright, came towards him in a similar direction very fast; he asked Lewis if all was right. Wainwright assisted Lewis with the mat on his shoulder. Wainwright proceeded in the direction that he came. Lewis proceeded to a public-house the corner of Couzens-lane. Dowgate-hill. I then procured two constables to watch, and I went to Messrs. Cattley's; they said they missed a mat of tallow. I pointed out the prisoners to the constables.</p>

On the 3d of February, about half after five o'clock in the afternoon, Hack delivered me the key of the warehouse; I went down stairs about half after six, and found the warehouse door wide open, and the warehouse had been robbed. Upon examination, I missed thirty-three pieces of printed cotton, about two thousand yards, value 100 l. two pieces of calico, fifty-five dozen and eleven habit-shirts, worth about 20 l. and between thirty and forty muslin dresses.

            . I am a tailor. I live in Still-alley, Hounsditch. On the 3d of February last, the prisoner came to my house, be brought a sample of printed cotton, what I call mock marsello, for waistcoats. I did not deal with him on that day. On the 17th of February he came to me again, and asked me to buy some mock marsello. He said it cost him ten-pence; I gave him eleven-pence a yard. He offered me thirty pieces or more. He told me that I must cut them up into waistcoats. I told him that I should call for the patterns at his house. This house is the corner of Cutler-street, Hounsditch; and when I was at his house I asked him if I could get discount if I sent them abroad. He told me I could not, for all the fag ends were cut off. I took the patterns, and went with the patterns to Mr. Jeffery, in Cheapside, (where I deal,) and afterwards I shewed Mr. West the patterns. It was arranged between Mr. West and me that I should deal with the prisoner; I told him I had no money; he furnished me with bank notes for the purpose. I then went to the prisoner's house. I saw him in the evening; he gave me two pieces of goods that is one hundred and six yards; I gave him five pounds; I paid him with the bank notes I had been furnished with; I came out of his house with the two pieces; Mr. Davis stopped me with them. I gave Mr.

            . I am a ward beadle of Aldgate. In consequence of information I went to the house of Levi on Thursday the 18th of February. I fixed Forrester at the front of the door, myself at the left; Collins stipped by me, and I passed him once; Kinnersley was in Still-alley. Collins came up the passage again, in company of a little girl of the name of Garcia; they were coming close together; the girl had a roll of cloth. I asked him what he had there; he said a piece of mock marsello; he told me he bought it of the prisoner; he took me to the prisoner's house. I went into the prisoner's house, into the back kitchen, there I found the prisoner's daughter, a girl about fifteen; I took the candle off the table. The prisoner's daughter, said you must not go up stairs sir I immediately went up stairs, Forrester close to my heels. I found Levi at the top of the stairs, endeavouring to pass me. Forrester cried, you cannot go by, and then I recognised him; I laid hold of him, he squatted down directly; each of his legs got between two broken bannisters; I used entreaties to get him up, and in a moment the front room door bursted open, there I saw in that room about a dozen women playing at cards; the whole body of the ladies came out of the room, and we were completely surrounded; the prisoner's wife got between me and the back door, in which room I saw a woman that turned out to be the nurse; the nurse threw herself immediately upon me, the prisoner's wife asked me what I wanted to do with her husband, did I want to kill him. I told her no, but I was determined not to loose him. The prisoner's wife began to holloa out in the Dutch language, throw it out of the window. I know the language. I said I will throw it out of the window for you. I told her I knew the language, it is the same that was used to the three reams of paper. I desired Forrester to draw his sword; at last the prisoner got up. I took him into the back room and searched him. He produced his pocket-book out of his side pocket, in that pocket-book I found a two pound note; I sent for Mr.

            , who was down stairs. I shewed him that two pound note, he identified it; it has his initials on it. He said he had given it to Collins in the morning. I have it ever since. I then went to search his house; I went towards the bed; the prisoner's wife said, my bed is not fit to be touched; take care of my child. I told her I would not hurt the child. I turned up the bed clothes, there I found the bed compleately doubled in half, and the child lying upon the bed; the bottom part of the beadstead was quite vacant; it appeared as if a quantity of things had been laying there. Kinnersley came up and told me they were throwing goods over into the next yard. I sent Forrester and Kinnersley for them. They will give you the account of them. I had them all brought to my house, seven pieces of goods.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Mr. Davis. When Collins came out of the house he passed me. The girl had got the marsello. He said to the girl, let us make haste and fetch another piece. After this I found Mr. Davis and the other officer had got into the house. I was at the bottom of the stairs, to see that nothing passed. When I had been there a quarter of an hour the nurse came down puffing and blowing, as if she had been at work very hard. At nine o'clock the watchman came and told me they were throwing the goods into another house. I went into the next house but one; in that yard one piece of goods came upon my head. I found seven pieces of marsello there that appeared to have been thrown out of some window. They appeared to me to come from the next yard adjoining to Levi's yard. I got upon the top of a shed there. I saw three women and a man carrying them. As soon as they saw me they cried, there is a man come in. They immediately went in, and I saw no more of them. There is something of a communication at the back of the houses. I saw them carrying a good way along. I brought away all the goods.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the girl with Collins go into Levi's house empty handed, and come out full handed. When they came out I entered the house. As I was going up stairs, Levi was making his escape down stairs. He said, let me go by. I said, no, go back. I took him up stairs on the landing-place, and there a parcel of ladies sallied out. The prisoner's wife sister asked me if I was going to kill him. I said, no, if they would be quiet it would all be settled. Levi sat on his backside, with each leg through the bannisters. The ladies began to lay hold of him. I was obliged to be resolute. Then he got up and said he would shew us all over the house. We went into the front room and the back room, and found nothing. We stopped a little bit. He had some refreshment. I went down stairs. Some of the people said, we shall all be taken up; they are throwing the goods into our yard; they said, we will not have them in our yard. Then they throwed them into another yard. I went through the second house and sat upon the goods. I sent for an hackney coach. I took them to the watchhouse and locked them up. They are here.</p>
               <p>SOPHIA GARCIA. I went with Mr. Collins to Levi's house. Mr. Collins went into the house and brought me a piece of mock marsello to carry home. Mr. Davis stopped me the second time.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Lerimer. The prisoner, with another boy, came into my master's shop. The other boy was standing by my mistress; he asked her to cut him a rasher of bacon, and while my mistress was doing it the prisoner was sitting on the counter; he reached his arm over to the back shelf, and took these farthings. When I saw him take the farthings I went to the door immediately to stop the prisoner from going out. He came to the door and knocked me down. He was pursued and taken. I am quite sure he is the person. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the farthings - A. He dropped some at the door, and the others he chucked over the alms-houses. One hundred of them have been recovered. These are the farthings; they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner - A. Only by seeing him bring work to the shop. The prisoner worked for Mr. Tilbury, of South-street, a coach-maker, and he used to bring work to the deceased from Mr. Tilbury. On Thursday, the <rs id="t18130407-90-cd459" type="crimeDate">11th of March</rs>

                        targets="t18130407-90-off457 t18130407-90-cd459"/>, at four in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop where the deceased was at work. He brought a lamp socket with him, a socket of a gig, that was for the prisoner to make a pair like it. The prisoner and the deceased had high words about some screw bolts. They each gave one another the lie. The deceased said he would not do anything for the prisoner, and desired him to go out of the shop. Very high words passed. The prisoner refused to go out of the shop, for which the deceased said he would give him a good hiding if he would not take the law of him. The prisoner replied that he would not take the law of him. They had still higher words. The deceased said he would give him a good punch of the head if he would not take the law of him. The prisoner replied again that he would not take the law. The deceased had the tongs, with hot iron in it, on the anvil. He put the hammer down, and reached over the anvil, making a sort of a push in a defensive way, to turn the prisoner out of the shop. At that time the prisoner was too far from him to receive any assault. At that moment the prisoner struck the deceased on the left temple with the iron lamp socket. The deceased staggered back senseless for some seconds. He came to, and followed the prisoner across the shop with the tongs, which he let fall by being struck, and when the deceased was going up to attack the prisoner a second time he fell. The prisoner only struck the deceased but once. I lifted the deceased up, and set him on a block. I took a pair of scissars, and clipped away the hair from the wound. The wound was just above the left temple; I washed it with a sponge. It appeared a sort of a confusion, not a cut, about an inch and a quarter in length. I was going to dress it; I thought it was something serious; I did not. I then tied it up with clean linen, and directed him to go to the surgeon. He did not go direct to a surgeon, but went directly to Marlborough-street office. He returned back within half an hour I should suppose; I asked him what the surgeon said. He said he had not been. I understood he had been to the office. I desired him to go immediately, and sent a boy with him to shew him the doctor's house. I followed after him. The surgeon was not at home. They immediately sent for Dr. Lee, the doctor of Mount-street work house, and Dr. Lee sent the deceased to St. George's hospital.</p>
               <p>MR. STOCKWELL. I am the surgeon of St. George's hospital. On the 11th of March, the deceased was brought into the hospital about five o'clock in the afternoon. I discovered a small incissed wound on the left temple, as if given by some sharp instrument, about three quarters of an inch in length. I did not probe it. There was no appearance that indicated a fracture. I simply dressed the wound. About a quarter of an hour after his admission he had a strong convulsive fit, from which he was shortly relieved.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to account for that convulsive fit - A. Yes. I conceive the brain sustained a deal of injury from the blow. He had no return of any injury in the head during the remainder of his life. About a week after he was brought in he was attacked with an inflammation of the lungs, and notwithstanding every means that was employed it increased, and his death took place on the 25th of March. After his death I opened his body. On examining the chest I found evident marks of inflammation of the lungs on the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in your opinion, was the cause of his death - A. From the inflammation of his lungs I should suppose, and in my judgment that inflammation could not proceed from that wound in the head.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HARE. I am cashier to Messrs. Biddulph and Company. On Monday the 15th of March, the prisoner presented to me this bill of exchange for sixty-three pounds. I suspected it to be a forgery, and told him it was necessary to send to Mr. Thomas, the person that it purports to be accepted by, to make some enquiries respecting it. I desired him in the mean time to walk into the lane room. A person was sent to Mr. Thomas. In the mean time I asked him if he knew the endorser. It appears to be endorsed by Henry Gilbert. He said, he received it from Mr. Gilbert, who was a glover on Holborn Hill. I asked the prisoner his name. His answer was so indistinct. I am not sure whether he said John or Jeynour, that he was a glover, and resided in Berkshire. About this time Mr. Davis arrived, Mr. Thomas's partner. I put this draft into his hands. In consequence of what he said, it was found necessary to send for Mr. Tedbury, Mr. Thomas's clerk. Mr. Tedbury came. He said it was not the hand-writing of Mr. Thomas. The prisoner was then taken to Bow-street and committed. I am acquainted with Mr. Thomas's hand-writing; the name I do not think is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You, of course, was not certain of Mr. Thomas's hand-writing by sending for somebody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070060"/>else - A. I had no doubt in my own mind at that time.</p>

The prisoner confessed she had pledged the other things at Mr. Barker's, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>- BURGESS. I am shopman to Mr. Barker, pawnbroker, in Holborn. On the 18th of March, the prisoner pawned a shirt, and tablecloth, and a towel. I lent her ten shillings on them. These are them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all mine; they are marked with Indian ink, in full length, except the tablecloth. I can swear to them all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer found some things; he said, if I confessed the rest it would be the better for me.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 1st of December, Mr. Armstrong gave me two marked shillings and two three-shilling pieces. I then went to the prisoner's house, in Pump-court, Golden-lane. I asked her if she had any shillings or sixpences, bad ones. She told me that she had only four shillings. She gave me four shillings, and I gave her the two marked shillings that I had received from Armstrong. Then Mr. Armstrongs, the father and son, and Bishop came into the room, and the four bad shillings that I had from her Bishop took out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went there had you any more money than was marked by Armstrong - A. Not any of any kind.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. On the 1st of December, I gave Roach these two marked shillings. They are marked with a P, a scratch, one is; and the other is marked with W B struck on the head. These marks were on them when I gave them to Roach. I searched Roach very particular before I gave them to him; he had no money of any kind. I then gave him the two marked shillings, and two three-shilling pieces. I, Bishop, and my son went with Roach to the prisoner's house. Roach went in. We had agreed with Roach before that; when he had purchased he was to cough, and after we had waited a few minutes we heard a cough. My son and Bishop went in. I went in last. When I came into the room my son had got hold of Mrs. Joyce.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mrs. Joyce before - A. I had seen her, but I was not acquainted with her. Roach was in the same room, very near her, and two men on the other side of the room. As soon as I went in, whether she caught my eye or not, her hands dropped these two shillings; they fell on the ground; I picked them up. They are the two identical shillings that I gave to Roach; they are two good shillings.</p>

I immediately laid hold of the prisoner's wrists, and out of her hands dropped two shillings, which my father picked up. I then told her to stand up, that I might search her, and when I got her in the middle of the room, from some part of her clothes dropped these three counterfeit shillings. There were two men in the room: nothing but good money was found upon them. On my searching the room, in a drawer I found two counterfeit sixpences.</p>

               <p>JOHN HERBERT. I am an officer. I was with the officers in this business. Hancock assisted me in taking; Cunningham. I saw M'Hugh when he was taken, I saw him bring his hand from his breeches pocket, and throw some money down. Hancock had hold of Cunningham; he stooped and picked some of it up, and some were given him by another person.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the twenty shillings found on Jackson, and tell me whether they are counterfeit - A. They are all counterfeits, and appear to be of the same sort, they are fresh now, and on the examination they appear never to have been in circulation; they are common metal; they are washed on the surface with a solution of silver; and the other twenty they are of the same description; they appear to be counterfeited in the same way.</p>

Yes, it was brought to the barge by Whitefriars; our barge was laying by the New River wharf, delivering iron pipes, on the London side of the River; who brought that timber there I don't know; I was in the cabin, somebody called Hearn; he went out of the cabin to the man. I did not see the man that brought the timber until he was going away. Hearn came to me and said there was some timber. I said who is it for; he said it was going to Brentford with the barge, to go by Pool's boats. I asked Hearn if there was a note. Hearn said the note would be at Brentford as soon as the barge. We took it up to Brentford. I afterwards saw Honkins come and claim the timber.</p>

            , the prisoner; I am positive he was the man; he asked me how far it was to Bow. I told him two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark - A. It was a fine evening, but the moon did not shine; there was a number of shops open with lights in them. I observed his person; he was conversing with me full ten minutes. He said it was a long way, was I going so far, he wished to have company. I told him I was not going there. I did not want to converse with him. I wished to avoid him.</p>
               <p>Q. About what part of the town did he begin conversing with you - A. About the beginning of Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he keep walking by the side of you, addressing you - A. For about half a mile beyond Whitechapel church. I had no idea that he was a thief, or anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pay particular attention to his person and features - A. I did not, still I am confident that he was the man that was walking so far with me. When I turned out of Whitechapel-road to go into Union-street I was going direct home from Whitechapel, down a street on the right.</p>
               <p>Q. That would be your regular way home - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was going to Bow, there you must part - A. Yes; I walked up the street some time; I looked behind me and saw him following me there, I then was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had you gone down this street before you observed that he was behind you - A. Not more than eight or ten yards, and I was then nearly within a few doors of my home. It is a narrow pavement there, on account of some iron rails. He pressed upon me very close there. I conceived as if he wanted to get by; I then felt his hand in my breeches pocket. I turned round and seized him instantly; at the instant I seized him I felt a blow. He took his hand out; I saw no person near me but the prisoner. I was kicked behind or struck; I had a blow on my belly also.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that no other person acted with the prisoner - A. I can't tell; I saw other person. If there had been any no other person, I think I must have seen him; as I fell he got my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You fell by that blow, did you - A. I fell on my knees and my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the watch was not taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070064"/>until you received the blow on your person - A. I felt the watch go as I received the blow on my person. I felt the watch go from my person; I immediately gave the alarm of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He ran off, and I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. As he ran off, you had an opportunity of seeing whether there was any other person - A. There was no other person. He was taken within fifty or sixty yards of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him - A. No, I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch recovered again - A. No, nothing but some papers and receipts. I never saw the watch again; some papers of mine were found in the street. My watch had been in my fob, and my papers in my right hand breeches pocket, where I felt his hand. There was a boy that saw the prisoner throw the papers away; after the papers were found they were given to Mr. Nalder; Mr. Nalder gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped the prisoner - A. A young man that was passing by; at the moment a police officer came up. I gave charge of the prisoner to him for robbing me of my watch; the prisoner said nothing. The prisoner was searched; there was nothing found upon him. I have never seen my watch from that time to this.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I am an officer of the Thames police. On this night, I was at the sign of the Prince of Hesse; about sixty yards from Greenfield-street. I heard a noise; I went out; the prisoner was then just stopped; the prosecutor came up and gave him into my charge for robbing him of a watch, chain, and seals.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What watch was it - A. A gilt watch, two gold seals, a gold key, two gold rings, and a gilt metal chain; worth nine guineas altogether.</p>
               <p>Edwards. I then took the prisoner into a public-house and searched him; I found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that had hold of him when you first came up - 
               <persName id="t18130407-97-person884">A. James Tweed</persName>
            ; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any papers upon the pavement - A. They were given to me by the prosecutor, which were found, as I understand, by a boy, which boy is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's person before - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker. I live at No. 11, Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields. On the 23d of February, I was going up Plummers-row, near Greenfield-street. I heard the cry of stop thief, and seeing the prisoner running, I run to him and stopped him. He said he was no thief and no murderer. Mr. Pennington came up about a minute. He told me to hold him fast, that he had robbed him. I then conveyed him to a public-house. Edwards came up, I delivered him up to Edwards.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BAILEY. I am a watchman; my beat is in Greenfield-street. I heard Mr. Pennington call watch, and stop thief. The prisoner was running at that time. I sprang my rattle, and immediately followed the prisoner; I saw the prisoner stopped. I was within an hundred yards of him.</p>

               <p>Q. When he was stopped was there any other person running at the cry of stop thief - A. No. At the time Mr. Pennington cried stop thief, I saw the prisoner strike him with his fist; he staggered, he did not fall. I was as near him, as I am to you.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, as you were as near to him as you are to me, you can tell me whether there were any other person on the spot except the prisoner and the prosecutor - A. I saw another person near him when he struck the prosecutor. I do not know who he was nor which way he went. I followed up the prisoner until he was stopped. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>HENRY MUMFORD. I live at 88, Greenfield-street. I was eleven years old last November. I knew Mr. Pennington before this happened. I saw Mr. Pennington on his knee, and I saw a man run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what occasioned him to be on his knee - A. No. The man that ran away ran round the corner of Fieldgate-street. He saw the watchman, and then turned back, I saw him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man that was stopped - A. I do not know. The man that was running was stopped. I saw the man drop the papers, and I picked them up I gave them to Mr. Nalder.</p>
               <p>MR. NALDER. These are the papers that were delivered to me by the last witness. I marked them, and returned them to Mr. Pennington. One is a bill of exchange for twenty-five pounds; the others are receipts.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had these papers about me at the time I was assaulted. I know them to be my papers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in Greenfield-street, about twenty yards from a public-house door. I was talking to

            . There was a cry of stop thief; four or five people passed me. The young man stopped me, and as soon as I was taken to the public-house the prosecutor said, that is the man that robbed me. In about half an hour they handcuffed me, and took me to the Thames police office. In the morning three young men came up. They would not let them speak. Mr. Nalder said he would send them on board the Tender.</p>

I left the house soon after twelve o'clock. I locked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070065"/>door, and put the key in my pocket. I returned a little after seven o'clock; it was dark then; the lamps were lit. When I returned I heard a rattling among the shavings. A person bolted out of the coach-house. I live in a room over the coach-house. I shut the coach-house doors, that nobody else should come out, and I called out for assistance, and I saw the two prisoners, Imber and Gard. I took Imber from behind a door in the stable, and

            . I am a coachman. I live in this Mews. I assisted in taking the prisoners. They were taken in the coach-house. I heard Marr crying out, thieves. I ran with my pitchfork in my hand. We found a sack on the stairs; Marr said it did not belong to him. We went into Marr's bed room; the door was open. I catched Imber behind a door in the stable. I told him not to resist, if he did I would run him through with the fork.</p>
               <p>Imber's Defence. I am innocent of this robbery. I have been acquainted with a young woman; I intended to make her my wife. I was well persuaded that the prosecutor had persuaded her to leave me and to live with him. On Sunday she told me she would leave me and go with the prosecutor. I told her if she did it would be at the hazard of her life. We went to the prosecutor's premises. I thought I heard her voice. I knocked; no one came. I wanted to get her away, and that is how I was found in the premises. I am no thief, and never had any intention of robbing any one.</p>
               <p>Gard said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Imber called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . On the 9th of January, me, Brown, Amos, and Merritt, met at the Coach and Horses, in Carnaby-street, kept by Mrs. Parkinson. I lodged there. We met about eleven o'clock in the morning the first time. Amos, asked Brown whether he had any picklock keys to unlock Mr. Smith's door, in Green's-court; he had been there twice before to look at this apartment. Brown said, he had; he would bring them in the evening. Brown went out of the house, and went to Paddington. We appointed to meet at five o'clock in the evening, at the same public-house. We met about six o'clock. About twenty minutes after eight we all went to Green's-court, to the house of Mr. Smith. We lifted up the latch; we proceeded into the passage; Brown opened the parlour door in about two minutes with two picklock keys. We all went into the room; me and Brown went in first. Brown brought out the sheets, and I brought out the bed, and gave them to Amos. I went in again to fetch the bolsters and pillows. I brought them out, and gave them to Merritt, and he went away with them. Merritt had the blankets and all. When we had taken these things, Brown told them to go to Saunders's, in Dudley-court, Crown-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Saunders - A. He keeps a chandler's shop there. He is absconded. We went to Saunders. Saunders refused to purchase them. He told us to go to Mr. Whitfield, and he would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whitfield is the gentleman that is indicted for the receiver - A. Yes, he is a farrier; he lived in Crown-street; he is gone off too. We took them into Whitefield's yard, and opened them. Brown asked two pound for them; he said he would not give two pound, he would only give twenty-three shillings; he paid with a pound note and two eighteen-penny pieces. He paid me and Brown at the door. We then went to the Cart and Horse public-house, St. Giles's, and had a pot of beer. From there we went to the Coach and Horses, in Carnaby-street. We all four went back there, and Merritt slept with me all night in the same bed. We changed the one pound note with Mrs. Parkinson, and divided the money. We sat up till one o'clock there.</p>

            . I am a butcher. The cows were brought to me about half past four on the same morning, in New Inn yard, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were they brought - A. By the prisoner at the bar, and offered for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in calf - A. Yes. He asked eight pounds for them. He said he brought them from Mr. Greenhill. The gentleman ordered him to bring them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Greenhill - A. No. I told him I should keep them and go to Mr. Greenhill. As I was going along I stopped at Bow-bridge, at Mr. Handcock's, and asked him whether he knew any thing about two cows that his drover brought down. He said, yes: there had been a gentleman enquiring about two cows that he had lost out of the marsh. I told him I had got them at home. The prisoner brought them in. Before Mr. Cole came the prisoner brought a bill to receive four pounds upon the two. It is put bullocks in the bill. I did not give him any money.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not fit for the butcher, were they - A. No; they were too heavy in calf. I am sure the prisoner is the man that brought me the cows, and offered them for eight pounds, and they were the cows that were claimed by Mr. Cole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. You thought the prisoner a sensible man - A. I thought him a madman.</p>

            . On the 18th of March last the prosecutor came to my house, he informed me he had lost two cows. I went down to New Inn yard. The witness, Young, delivered the cows to the prosecutor. They are the same cows that the prosecutor swore to at the office.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have no doubt about the two cows. I have had them since Michaelmas. I had them in the marsh all the winter. I saw them there every day. They were worth from fifteen to seventeen pound each if they had good luck in calving. They were small cows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. When had you seen the cows before you lost them - A. The day before I saw them in the marsh. I had a key of the marsh-gate. The gate was taken off the hinges to get the cows out.</p>

             also agreed to go. He is a butcher by trade. I was to go on horseback. Kibbell went in his own cart to bring the goods from the shop. I met with Norman between ten and eleven, just as I got in Watford. He told me that Roome and Kibbell were waiting at the last public-house in the town. I went with Norman to the Horns public-house. We found that Kibbell and the cart was gone, and we went down the lane to Rickmansworth. The cart stood by the pound, under some trees that is beyond Watford. After that, I, Roome, and Norman came into the town, to Johnson's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Kibbell to do - A. He was to wait with the cart until Roome fetched him. I and the others broke into Mr. Johnson's house. We broke into the back part of the house a little after twelve. We took the shutter down. Roome got into the accompting-house. I went round to the front. He opened the door, and let me and Norman in at the front door. We then began to pack up the goods in the shop. Roome went out to fetch Kibbell and the cart. He was gone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; he came back, and said he could not find Kibbell or the cart any where. We then broke open a stable in the Red Lion-yard, took out a horse, and took the cart by the stable door. Norman and me loaded the cart, and Norman and Roome went off with it. I staid behind with my poney, to acquaint them if there was any alarm. There was no alarm. I rode after them, and overtook them on Stanmore Hill, and when we got within a mile of Edgware we overtook Kibbell and his cart. I think that was about four o'clock in the morning. We drawed up the cart along side of his, and put the goods into his cart, and turned the horse and cart we had brought from Watford, down a lane leading to Hendon. Norman asked Kibbel what was the reason he left town. He said he was disturbed by some people, and was driven out of town. Then all went on to Crown-street, Soho, to one Solomon. We brought the cart up to the door, unloaded it, and sold the goods to him, I think for something better than sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a dark lanthorn with you - A. Yes; we left that in the house, and we also left a crow at the Red Lion, where we borrowed the horse and cart. In January, afterwards, I was taken up; I confessed this and many other transactions.</p>

When I came near the pound I saw a horse and cart on the other side of the road, by the trees. I went up to the cart; it had no name or number on it. There was a man inside; I asked him if he was going to St. Alban's. He made no answer. It was a deep roomy cart, like a butcher's cart. I thought he was a poacher. He asked me what o'clock it was; I told him past one. It was then about half past eleven. I told him one, in order to get him on the road. He then went gently on the road. I followed him five or six hundred yards through the town of Watford. He went on towards London. I thought he had the appearance of a butcher. I have seen the cart since at the office.

I heard the plates rattle in my pantry. I halloaed out, who is it in the pantry. I spoke loud enough for the prisoner to hear. Nobody answered. I ran to see who was in the pantry. He got to the side door, and in the passage, before I got to the area door, I heard the silver rattle. I ran up the area steps. I ran over two large gravy-spoons that had fallen from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them fall - A. No, I did not. They were on the area steps. I saw one spoon fall from one step to the other. I pursued the prisoner; he ran very fast indeed. He had got about forty yards when I overtook him. I collared him, and took him to Marybone watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself when you laid hold of him - A. He said it was through want. I never lost sight of him from the area steps until I collared him.</p>

On Friday, the 2d of this month, about half past six in the evening, the two prisoners came into my shop, and asked to look at some black silk stockings. My young man shewed them several parcels; they had come for three following days for black silk stockings; I had suspicion. I gave the young man two fresh dozens of silk hose, that I might know what was in them; the price that we charged for the stockings was eleven shillings, and twelve shillings. I went to Stone; she said, I will take this pair; and in rolling the parcel up, there was two pair missing. The eleven shillings stockings were marked with two diamonds at the top; the twelve shilling were all marked with four diamonds at the top. Gray said she would take a pair of them; she did, and paid for them. I missed two pair out of that parcel. On the next morning I went to Hancock the officer; I gave him the address of the prisoners; about an hour after that, Hancock sent up for somebody to identify the prisoners; my young man went. The officer found part of the property.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel between you before this matter happened - A. No quarral at all; he told me he owed me an old grudge. This happened on the 20th of February, about ten o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before that time on that day - A. He was drinking at the public-house. I had been his company. About ten o'clock I came out of the public-house, to go to my home; I had been drinking with my father, my father and I drank about six or seven pints between us. I was quite sober, as I am now. The prisoner was in the public-house at the same time. I never spoke a word to him. I separated from my father; as soon as I came out of the public-house, I bid him good night, and he bid me good night; I was going home; this public-house, the Red Lion was about a quarter of a mile from my home. The prisoner was outside of the door of the public-house, before I got out, he was quarreling with another man, and in my way home, the prisoner overtook me; he pushed me out of the road with his elbow. I told him to be quiet, I did not want any words with him. Then he got before me, and stabbed me. He said, d - n your eyes, I owe you an old grudge, and I will pay you before I go. I looked up at him, and said will you? He said, d - n my eyes if I do not. I went to put my beer down; he stabbed the knife into me immediately, and when I had set my beer down he stabbed this left side of me. I did not then know that he had a knife in his hand. I can shew the wound now; it went through all my clothes. He said, come on. I said, you have done my business. When he said, come on, he had the knife drawn, stretching his arm out. I begged of him to let me go; I did not think I should live until I went home. I told him he had done my business. He said, if he had got his hedge bill he would cut my head off. Then he went along to his own gate. I followed behind him. My house is further than his. He stopped at his own gate. I said, are you not a pretty fellow; you have been falling out with other people. He said, if he had his hatched out of the house he would strike me dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was intoxicated - A. I am sure he was not. I got home without receiving any further injury from him. The blood flowed very fast from the wound; I found myself very weak. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070069"/>ed by for three weeks. I dropped down as soon as I got in doors. The doctor was sent for. I kept my bed for a fortnight. The surgeon is not here. He said it was within an hairs breadth of my life. The prisoner in the public-house had some words with my father. He accused my mother of taking a bundle of wood; my father took my mother's part.</p>

He asked for a quarter of a pound of iron wire; that would be three-pence. I told him I would serve him directly. I was serving a customer at the time, and another was waiting. I left him at the counter. He was of one side, and I the other. There is a recess on the counter, about a foot high. There is some holes in that recess with locks in these holes. They were within reach of where he stood. I gave the drawer to the customer. I was first serving for him to take an article out. He asked me to get a handle to it. I went to get an handle to it, and then I went to the vice, to put the handle on. Mr. Read told me the prisoner had taken something. I asked the prisoner if he had got any thing of mine. He said, no. I observed his pocket bulky. I put my hand down, and felt something hard. I told him I insisted on seeing what was in his pockets. He pulled a paper parcel out of his pocket, and put it on the counter. I took the goods, and said, is not that my private mark. That parcel contained box locks. I told him, I thought that was not all. He pulled out another paper that contained box locks. He afterwards took out two more papers. Three of the papers contained twenty-five box locks and one paper of desk locks.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On this day I was in Mr. Bond's shop. I saw the prisoner there. There is a place on all ironmongers counters, which we call pigeon-holes. I was at that place; I saw the prisoner take three papers out of the pigeon-holes, and put them in his pocket. I and Mr. Bond challanged him with it. He took the papers out of his pocket, and tried to shove them in the pigeon-holes. I did not see him take the fourth.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other person in the shop except Mr. Bond and yourself - A. No. I came into the shop; the prisoner had a little bit of wire in his hand. He asked me to serve him. I got a bundle down that was not exact the size. I was going to get another bundle down, and Mr. Read challenged him with a paper parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him move towards the pigeon-holes - A. While I was serving him he had his hand over the place. I did not see him move his hand into the pigeon-holes. I afterwards saw the papers taken out of his pocket. I am quite sure they are my master's property.</p>

            . On the 12th of March I and Dawson were serving in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you serve him - A. No. Between five and six o'clock I was called into the shop, saying, they had detected the same man that had been there before, taking something. They had taken several parcels out of his pocket before I got into the shop. He was stopped at that time. He was in the shop when I first saw him. I saw him take out of his pocket a paper parcel; that paper contained drawer locks. That is all I know of it.</p>

            . Q. You are servant to these gentlemen - A. Yes. I saw the prisoner come into the shop. I knew his face perfectly well, but I did not recollect that he was the man that was stopped before. I was the only person in the shop at that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070070"/>time he asked for two sheets of glass paper. I had to kneel down behind the counter to get it. He was exactly in the same place he was before, with his arm upon the pigeon-holes; then he asked for a file handle, for which I had to go round the counter to get it, the glass paper was two pence, and the file handle; one penny. I went round to serve him the handle. I thought he jumped up to the counter very quick, which gave me suspicion. He gave me a shilling to pay for the glass paper, and the file handle, he laid out three pence. I went to the bottom of the shop to call the porter, as I had no halfpence to give change. The prisoner gave me the shilling; the porter went out to get change, and brought it back for a bad one. He gave him an eighteen-penny piece, for which he got change. The prisoner then pulled out a watch; he said the evenings drew in. I gave him the change, when the porter came in, and when the prisoner went out, I observed him stopping about the door; he did not go away. I looked round, and I missed one paper of locks from the pigeon-holes. I ran out of the shop: I saw him about three or for doors further on. I laid hold of his arm: I said, my friend I believe you have some paper parcels in your pocket, belonging to our shop. At the time I was speaking to him the mouth of his pocket was open. I saw the paper parcels in his pocket; he did not speak a word; he came back to the shop again with me, and when he was brought back to the shop he pulled out two paper parcels, and throwed them on the counter. I picked them up directly; they contained box-locks. These paper parcels have my masters private mark upon them; in another minute he pulled out another paper parcel, and after that Mr. Woodward came in, and at that time he pulled out another.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what did the four parcels contain - A. Box-locks, and desk-locks. They were counted at the office; the watchhouse keeper had them; he is not here; he is so ill he cannot get out of bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodward. The watchhouse keeper had them till Thursday morning, and when I received them of him I received the same paper parcels that were delivered to him. I produce them; there is twenty-seven box-locks.</p>
               <p>Q. What would they cost you - A. Nineteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You have laid them at twelve and sixpence - A. And thirteen drawer-locks; they would cost seven shillings to sell again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking that day. I was in a state of intoxication. I did not know what I was about.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Prior to the 3d of April, had you missed any quantity of flour - A. Not me, Mr. Curtis had. I concealed myself in the accompting-house; the window in that accompting-house commanded a view of the sack, and nine other sacks; that sack in particular. The two prisoners were in the employ of Messrs. Curtis; Whittaker was a furner; he stands at the mouth of the oven, and throws the biscuits in. Cole, the boy, is called a parting boy, to part the biscuits, for the furner; he is an assistant to the furner; they work a great part of the night usually, and when they have got a certain quantity, they carry the biscuits up into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the place where you were command a view of the place where the biscuits were deposited - A. He must pass me. I saw him come up about a quarter before twelve, on Saturday night, bringing up each, what we call a cotchet of biscuits. Whittaker had a candle in his hand; they went to the left, and shot the biscuits out of their bags, but instead of going down stairs proceeded to a sack of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a sack of flour, in which they had any lawful business - A. No, it was not the flour that we use for biscuits, it was fine flour, kiln dried; what we use for biscuits, is called middling; that is in a bin; it pours down a hole into the trough where they knead; another man kneads the flour, and the boy's business is to divide the biscuits to the furner, that chucks them into the oven. There are three men and a boy in every gang.</p>
               <p>COURT. Out of them four, one kneads it into the trough, two mould it, then it gets to the furner, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070071"/>goes into the oven - A. Yes. When they were at the sack of flour, I saw Whittaker hold the candle while the boy, Cole, took out the flour; they came towards the accompting-house, in a manner that made us think they were alarmed, and thought they were discovered. Whittaker came to the accompting-house with the candle towards the window, to look in; I and Mr. Curtis drew back; we could see the candle not the man; after he had looked he went to the sack again; at that moment Mr. Curtis raised his head, and prevented me seeing what they did, but I saw them at the sack long enough to take some more flour; they then went down stairs and left this sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they put the flour that they took out of the sack - A. I thought it was a bag, but it proved to be the boy's apron, which had been part of an old sack; they took it down stairs with them. I and Mr. Curtis came out of our hiding place, and went after them. and when they had got down in the bake-house, Mr. Curtis asked them where the bag of flour was, that they had brought down; they pointed to some empty bags, and said, there: the flour was not there; the flour was on a table behind one of the men, in the boy's apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity - A. A little better than three pound and a half; it was fine kiln dried flour exactly the same as was in the sack that they had taken it from. Mr. Curtis expressed his indignation to him; Whittaker said it was only a little flour he had taken to make a cake for his tea.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, besides wages, allowance is made to each of the men for bread money - A. Yes, three halfpence per day.</p>

            . Q. You, with the last witness, was watching - A. I was; I saw the boy take the flour, and the old man held the bag. I went down stairs and brought the flour up. Whittaker said it was only a triffing thing, if I would not take him in custody he would pay me for it. I said I certainly would not do that; he must go to the police-office, and I was certain it was not the first time that we had been robbed; he had been at the sack before. He declared it was only took to make a cake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the sort of flour that he would take to make a cake of - A. He had no business with that flour at all; he had no business to take any flour to make a cake to eat; they all are allowed three halfpence a day bread money, besides their wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you weighed the sack - A. The sack was weighed about three nights previous; we found the deficiency to be forty-seven pounds weight and a half of flour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Forty-seven pounds weight and a half. Do you permit your men to take what flour they please, and make what bread they please - A.Certainly not. The door was not locked that night.</p>
               <p>Whittaker's Defence. I worked fifty-three years for Mr. Curtis, and his grandfather; I never robbed them of one penny. I only took a bit of flour to make a cake. In the night locked up as we were, I told Mr.

               <p>WILLIAM HUGGINS: I keep a horse and cart, and remove things for people that employ me. I live in Green's-court. About the 5th of February, the prisoner Smith came to me to hire my horse and cart, to move some goods; he told me to come to Hanover-square. I put the horse in the cart, and went to Hanover-square, between five and six in the evening. I stood up close to the rails of the square. Reeve came and brought me three tables, and I put them in the cart, and told me to go on. On the next day I went with my cart to the same place. Reeves brought me a card table, and a pembroke table; Reeves told me to take them to my house until the next day, and then he would send Mr. Lawrence for them. Lawrence came to me about four o'clock in the afternoon, and told me to bring the two tables to his house; and when I took the tables to his house, I met Smith by the Marsh gate. Reeves helped me to load the cart. Smith was not there at all.</p>

I went to Bow-street office, got a search warrant, and went, accompanied with two officers, Mantz, and Donaldson, to No. 26, St. John-street; and in a closet in the garret we found some goods, which we have here, my property. We took the goods away with us. I produce them. Here are a variety of lengths of silk cut off.</p>
               <p>MR. DONALDSON. I and Mantz took the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070072"/>in custody. In the prisoner's box we found a silk handkerchief, and a towel, belonging to Mr. Shears. I asked her if she had not left some things at a place. She denied it. I then said, suppose we go to No. 26, St. John-street. She then said, send for my master, Mr. Layton, and I will tell you all about it. She told Mr. Layton that the other servant girl that had gone off, had taken as much as her. Mr. Layton, thought the prisoner had brought the other into it. Mr. Layton got the magistrate to discharge her, as I found a small portion upon her.</p>

            . On the 25th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was stopped by two men, as I was walking down <placeName id="t18130407-111-crimeloc573">Nightingale-lane</placeName>

Brown and Wheeler; they said nothing to me, but pushed me against the wall; I looked in their faces, and said, gentlemen, I beg your pardon, let me pass. Northall then came; he laid hold of my watch and seals, and pulled it out with a jirk, and at the same time I received a blow under my right eye. I laid hold of Northall, and holloaed out murder, and thieves. One of them knocked me down. I think I received the first blow from Wheeler, and the second blow from Brown. They knocked me down, and pushed me about in the middle of the road; they gave me several hard blows upon my right arm, and told me to make no noise. I was obliged to let Northall go on account of the hard blows on my arm. Then Northall began to run, and I followed him; he ran into Swan-street, from there to Butcher-row; there is a place called Mountsgate-cooperage; he ran down there, there is no thoroughfare; the gates are shut up. He was there apprehended; he hid himself in a corner close to the gate he was taken by me; and

            . On the night mentioned, I was passing through Swan-street; I heard a voice call out murder, and stop thief; I heard somebody running behind me, which proved to be afterwards the prisoner Northall. Mr. Newman came up without a hat, calling out stop thief; Mr. Newman and I was partly together; we continued the pursuit. The prisoner ran up Swan-street, turned round to the right, up East Smithfield; then he ran up Mount's-gateway, and put himself close into the corner, where the gate opens. Mr. Newman, and I seized the prisoner, and conveyed him to the watchhouse. I assisted in bringing in the other two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the others - A. When Mr. Newman got into the watchhouse, and Northall secured, he then gave a description of the other two prisoners. The two patrols, Lane and Brown, assisted in taking the prisoners into the watchhouse. Brown the patrol, came into the watchhouse; he informed us, that he had seen two men pass by, and seeing them apparently to be agitated; he followed them into the Seven Stars, in Swan-street. Brown the patrol did. That is what he told us, and in consequence of information given by Mr. Newman, we went in pursuit of the other two prisoners; we went and found them in the Seven Stars; the two patrols took hold of the two men, and we conducted them to the watchhouse. The prosecutor saw them when they were brought in, and said they were the men that assisted in knocking him down. After they was were secured, we got a candle and went to where he knocked down; first we found the stick laying in the mud; his hat was brought by a woman, and on the spot where we found Northall, Lane the patrol picked up the gold seals; I saw that. I was by the side of the patrol.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a patrol. When first I heard of the robbery, I went to the spot. I saw the two prisoners, Brown and Wheeler, go into the Seven Stars public-house. I followed them in; I noticed their persons, and their dress. I then went to the watchhouse; Mr. Newman informed me, that he had been robbed by three or four persons; one he had got in the watchhouse. I then asked him whether he could describe to me any of the other parties. He told me, one was as tall as himself, the other was a shorter one. I told him I believed I could fetch them up. Accordingly Mr. Knowles, and a gentlemen, that had been hustled in Nightingale-lane, accompanied Lane and me to the Seven Stars. I asked the two gentlemen to point out any men in the room that they had any knowledge of; they pointed out Brown and Wheeler. I then with the assistance of Lane, took them to Mr. Newman, and he immediately, upon seeing them, said they were the men that assisted in robbing him. The prisoner said nothing to that.</p>

On the 25th of March, between ten and eleven in the evening, I was going my round; I heard the cry of murder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070073"/>and stop thief. I directly ran to where the cry was. Mr. Newman and Knowles had just then taken Northall into the watchhouse. I followed them into the watchhouse. We searched Northall; nothing was was found on him. After that I went with Brown, and brought up Brown and Wheeler to the watch-house; and after we had secured the whole three, we went down to Mount's-gateway. I found two gold seals, a gold key, and a metal chain. I shewed them to Mr. Newman; he said they where his. I produce them.</p>

This young man came to see me; we went over the water together; we stepped into a public-house, the sign of the Spread Eagle; there we stopped together from half after eight till eleven, and then I asked him whether he was willing to go home, and on our return home we called at another public-house to have a pint of beer, there the watchman came in and took us. I am as innocent as a child unborn, so you may do as you please with me; if you hang me tomorrow, I care not.</p>
               <p>Wheeler's Defence. On Thursday I went to see this young man at Dock-head; I stopped there until he came from work. We crossed the water, and went to the Spread Eagle to have a pint of beer. We stopped there from half after eight to eleven. In our way home we called in the Seven Stars. We had not been there five minutes before the patrols took us.</p>

On Friday the 11th of December between the hours of five and seven, the prisoner came to my shop; she asked to look at some lace, at which time my shopman, Martin, was shewing some lustre, among which was a piece upon a roller containing twenty-two yards black. She had a child with her, which she put on the counter near to where the lustre was. She paid for the lace which she purchased, and some time after she left the shop, I missed the lustre in question; my suspicion fell on the prisoner. I went to the different pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood, giving the description of the prisoner; I went to Mr. Attenborough of Crown-street. He informed me that a woman answering the description had pawned ten yards of black lustre the preceding evening, and there were ten yards pawned at another shop, by another woman, answering another description. I asked him to let me see it, and when I saw it, I had no doubt it was mine. I lost twenty yards; he had ten. I desired him to detain the prisoner when she came to the shop again. She was detained on the 17th of February, by Mr. Attenborough.</p>

On the night of the 4th of April, four men came up to me, and began to shove me with their elbows, jostling me from one side to the other. They pulled my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they strike you at all - A. No, they did not. I was in company with two young men; they went away. I was following them. They came up to me, and said, these two gentleman wanted to insult you. I said, they did not want to insult me. They then hustled me about from one side to the other, and one of them took my watch from me. I immediately seized the man that took my watch from me, and I saw him give it into the prisoner's hand. It was not the prisoner that took my watch. I ran after the prisoner, and cried, stop thief. The prisoner ran up Oxford-road. I ran until I was stopped by a young man that picked up the case of a watch. I I lost sight of the prisoner. I have seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>- HALL. I am clerk to Mr. Shuter, a barrister. On this night I was coming down Oxford-road; I heard the cry of stop thief. I perceived two people running very hard towards me. I stepped of oneside, and let the headmost one pass me. That was the prisoner. I turned, and ran after him. After getting the distance of seven or eight houses I perceived him put his hand down his right side, and threw something down the railing of an ironmongers shop; it ran on the pavement. The witness, Lewellin, who was running after him, turned back. I still continued after him, and seeing the prisoner was going to run up Hanway-yard, I seized him. A watchman came up. I led him to the spot where I saw him throw this something down. I still held him. Lewellin then shewed me the case of a watch. We knocked at the ironmonger's shop door. The prosecutor went down to see if they could find the watch in the area. I was standing outside, I saw Lewellin pick the watch up through the iron bars. The prisoner was then taken to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a tailor. On Sunday night, the 4th of April, I heard the cry of stop thief, about eleven o'clock. I ran to the middle of the road. I observed a man coming as hard as he could run. He turned to Oxford-road. I ran after him, and about four yards in Oxford-road he fell down. He very soon got up, and run on. I ran after him until he got to the founders; I was then within a yard of him. I observed him put his hand in his pocket, take out the watch, and throw it down the area. I picked up the case. I pursued him, and I saw him stopped by Mr. Hall. I returned back to where I picked up the case. The watchman rang the bell. The watchman, I, and the prosecutor, went down. I found the watch in the cellar.</p>
               <p>- NEWBURY. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody. The watch and case were given to me. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             took the pot and drank out of it. After that, another young man paid for another pint. In about a quarter of an hour the lamp was put out, and then the candle on the other side of the room. They were the only lights in the room. I then felt four or six hands about my mouth and my pocket, as if to keep me from making a noise, and in an instant I felt the watch go from my fob. I called out to the landlord, whose name is Lancaster, not to let them out. The door was open, and they all went out, as far as I know. The landlord was at the door. I went out, and my hat was left in the room by some means of other. I called for my hat. The landlord went into the taproom; he throwed my hat out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again - A. I did. I went as far as the corner of Goudge-street, there a person of genteel appearance asked me what was the matter. He asked me if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070075"/>would come to Marlborough-street in the morning, and get a warrant, and he would put the warrant into execution. I went further; I met another man; he said, have you lost a watch. I said I had. He said, if I would meet him at the corner of Blenheim-street by seven o'clock in the morning, and a little further on I met Jones. He said, if I would come at seven o'clock in the morning I should have the watch. In the morning I went and met the man at the corner of Blenheim-street; he asked me for a guinea; I gave him a pound note and a shilling. He gave me the watch, but not the seal. He said somebody else was concerned in it; he had the seal. This is the watch; it is my master's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see George, Jones, or Weaver, have your watch - A. No; they were in the room at the time I lost the watch, and Jones put out the lights.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the room - A. Fourteen or sixteen persons.</p>

She then asked me to cut her another five-pennyworth; she had a friend waiting outside; she would go and call her in, and as soon as she was gone from my house I missed my watch from off the mantle-shelf. We pursued her into the next street. She came back with me, and asked me what I wanted. I told her that she had taken my watch from off the mantle-shelf.

On the 8th of March, in the afternoon, when I first saw the prisoner in the shop, I saw her put something into her pocket-hole; it was something black. The young man was gone to the other end of the shop to fetch her some coloured silk handkerchiefs to look at. When the young man came back she asked to look at some black silk stockings. I fetched her some. She said they were not good enough. The young man went out, and fetched two parcels; they were not good enough. She desired him to go out and fetch her some better. She took one pair of black silk stockings, and put them under her handkerchief. She said, they were not good enough; she sent him out again. She then took another pair. She sent him to get some white silk handkerchiefs, and while he was gone she took the silk handkerchiefs from under her arm, and put them in her pocket. She looked out what she intended to purchase, and desired him to send them to to No. 17, Glasses-street, Piccadilly. She went out of the shop. I went after her. I asked her to walk back; there was something of a mistake. She said she would not. I told her she must. I brought her into the shop. I was going to take them from her. Mr. Allen said, I must not search her; I must send for a constable. Oh, no, said she, I will give you what I have got. She dropped four pair of silk stockings, and five black silk handkerchiefs. These are the stockings and handkerchiefs. They are the property of Mr. Allen.</p>

            , at a public-house door. They stopped me, and asked me, would I have any gin. I said it was rather late. I wanted to go home to my lodging; if it had been earlier I would have no objection. Quick caught me by the right shoulder, and Williams by the left. They brought me into the Coach and Horses yard, from the public-house door; there was a light in the public-house, but the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the public-house door to the Coach and Horses yard - A.About twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How could they drag you twelve yards. Did you resist - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity to cry out, had not you. Did you know them - A. They were quite strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way they do in your country, because it is an odd way in this country. Did you strike either of them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were after consenting to their getting you there - A. No, not in the least, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed the watch box, did not you - A.No. William Quick gave me a dig, and tripped up my heels, and knocked me flat on my back. I came to the ground. He catched hold of me by the handkerchief, clapped his hand upon my mouth, and as I shifted my head to call out he shifted his hand, and when he got his hand upon my mouth, John Williams bound my knees. He put his head upon my belly. I had thirty-six shillings in my pocket. He took away from my pocket a two foot rule, and six three-shilling bank tokens. Then he and Quick ran away. I jumped up immediately after they left me. I ran after them. They ran down Charles-street, towards Newton-street. Charles-street goes into Newton-street. Williams was a little before Quick. I catched Quick by the breast at the corner of Charles-street, at the Newton-street end.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you catched Quick had you called out watch - A. I was not able to cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite capable of jumping up and running after them, then what should hinder you from calling out - A. I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes a little wonder in the transaction - A. I did not know that there was any assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a different story from what you told me a moment ago; you told me you were not capable of crying out - A. I thought I should come up to Quick before the watch came up to him. I cried for Mr. Orton; he came to my assistance, and lling was secured; then the patrol came up to my and I gave charge of Quick for robbing mor and Quick gave charge of me. The patrol took us both to the watchhouse to have it decided.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop, the corner of Newton-street. About one o'clock I heard Cogan call out for assistance, and said he was robbed. I opened my door, and ran to his assistance. I have known Quick a long time; he is a printer by trade. I never knew him work at it. Cogan is a carpenter; he works for a man in the Horse-ferry-road. Cogan has been a customer of mine a fortnight. He told me that Quick had robbed him of eighteen shillings and a two foot rule. Cogan was all over dirt. He told me the money was taken from him in the Coach and Horse yard: they got him down and fastened on him by the throat; his throat was scratched and bleeding.

            . I am a patrol. I was coming my regular round; I saw Quick in custody of Cogan. A number of people were round him; some were persuading Cogan to let him go. The moment I came up they gave charge of one another. I think Cogan gave charge first. I took them both in custody, and took them to the watchhouse. I searched Cogan. I found his pocket torn, and his back all over dirt. He appeared as if he had been down. I think Roberts searched Quick. No money was found upon either of them.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse keeper. At the office, Cogan took his handkerchief off, and shewed what manner his throat was in. Since then it has turned blue, and a little part scratched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Saturday evening I went to a public-house to take a pint of porter with a few friends, with several of the trade that came from the house where I was an apprentice. I stopped until eleven o'clock. On my coming down Charles-street the prosecutor laid hold of me and asked me for his money. I asked him, what money, and told him I had no money. Mr. Orton came out; he insisted upon the prosecutor taking me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Oram. What is the sign of this public-house in Charles-street - A. The Bull's Head, it is about ten yards from the Coach and Horses yard. There is no watchman stationed in Charles-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cogan. You did not indict Williams - A. Yes. On the Monday following I went before the grand jury for Quick. Williams was not taken at that time. On Thursday last I indicted Williams.</p>

I saw Quick and Williams; I am sure as to the person of Williams; I took particular notice of him. They asked me, if I would take any gin. I said it was rather late; I wanted to go home; I said if it was not late, I would have no objection. They caught me on each side; Williams on the left, and Quick on the right. I looked at Williams; because he was the tallest; he is as tall as I am. When they first laid hold of me, I was at the public-house door; then they dragged me to the Coach and Horses yard. I kept my foot to the stones, as I went along, to prevent their dragging me along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out at this time - A. No, I did not. When they got me to the Coach and Horses-yard, Quick gave me a dig in the neck, and he tripped me up. I was no sooner on the ground, than he laid his hand on my neck, and his other hand upon my mouth. When I was down Williams bound my feet, and laid one hand upon my belly.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean that he tied you with any cord - A. No, he put one knee on my knee, and the other knee upon the small of my belly; then he took eighteen shillings, and the two foot rule, and tore the pocket away at the same time. They ran away immediately. I jumped up, and pursued them both. Quick was the nearest to me; I laid hold of him; Williams got away. I saw Williams between eleven and twelve o'clock, in the yard of this Sessions-house; he was going to carry Quick a pot of beer, and a pipe of tobacco. I told the patrol he was one of the men. Williams was the man that took my money away. I described Williams to the patrol, and to Orton, to be a man of a sandy fair complexion.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Williams - A. On the Saturday that Cogan was robbed, I saw Williams twice on that day, in company with Quick, and on Saturday last, I saw Williams carrying a pot of beer through the Sessions-yard, to a prisoner. I told Roberts, I recollected that to be the man that I had seen twice with Quick; on the day that Cogan was robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to see Quick. I asked him what he was in custody for. He said it was a row, between him and some man in Charles-street. He would not tell me the particulars of it. I came here, to hear the trial, along with four men that worked at the same office. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

            . I am a printer. I work in the same office with the prisoner, at Mr. Auld's, Greville-street, Hatton Garden. On Saturday night, the 3d of April, after we had done work, the prisoner took a walk with me up to St. Giles's. It was about ten o'clock, when we went; we were paid late at the office. We went to the Cart and Horse, public-house, Tottenham-court-road; we stopped until twelve o'clock we then went to the Compasses, White-hart-yard; there we had two pints of ale; we stopped until one o'clock, and came away together, to the top of Gray's-inn-lane. We parted there. I saw him go towards the City.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer; I carry on business at Reading. In the month of February I hired the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you hired him, after you and he agreed for wages that he was to receive, was anything said about the mode of payment - A. Yes; the prisoner said he should like to take it when it was something considerable, once in three months: that he had a freehold estate of fifty pounds a year; therefore he should not want his wages but once in three months, but in the interim, if he should want a pound or so, he should always ask for it. He came into my employ on the 1st of January. I came to town on the 24th of February, and on the next day, I received a letter from my wife, which induced me to look out for the prisoner. I went with a coach to the corner of Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the amount of wages he was to have due to him - A. The balance was about six pounds. He was only five weeks in my service. I was to pay him two guineas a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he left the country did he make any application to you to discharge the balance - A. None whatever. I went in an hackney coach to the corner of Sloane-street. I saw a gentleman's carriage go down he road; I saw the prisoner in that coach. I got out of the hackney coach; I then went to the gentleman's coach; there I found the prisoner, and the carpet; I immediately said, you infernal rascal, I have a letter in my hand, and it is just enabled me to stop you. I immediately pulled the carpet out of the coach, and the prisoner got out likewise. I then said, I would take him to the magistrate; he said he would not go. I went to a magistrate; and when I returned the prisoner was gone. I afterwards watched daily for the prisoner, at Basing-lane. I found him there on Monday, the 1st of March. Immediately as the prisoner came into the Inn-yard, I went up to him. I told him, he had given me a great deal of trouble, but now I hoped he would go with me, as I was determined to take him to Bow-street. At first he said he would not go. I told him I had that in my pocket, that would make him go, but I did not wish to make any noise in the street, if he would go quietly. I told him that to induce him. I had neither fire arms, or warrant. He agreed to go with me; and I wished to go the nearest way. I told him if he would go quietly with me, we would go to Bow-street; he broke off, into lanes, and narrow passages; that I had not been accustomed to. He said he wanted to call upon a person of the name of Taylor to accompany him to Bow-street. I went on with him as far as a court at Charing-cross. He went up the court; I followed him. About the middle of the court he turned round, and gave me two violent blows on my head, and knocked me down. I called murder. There were a great many persons came round at the bottom of the court. I went down to the bottom of the court, and asked the bye standers, whether they knew of an officer. An officer was procured. I went with the officer to the door of the house that was open, at the top of the court; I saw the prisoner, a man, and a woman. The officer took him in custody; the officer said, I had charged him with a felony. The officer took him to Bow-street; I accompanied them. The prisoner was examined before Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever made any application to you for wages - A. Never for the balance. The 24th of February, was on Wednesday. On my coming to town for two or three days, I told him I should stop in town until Saturday. On account of the assizes being a busy time, I asked him whether he should want any money, between that and Saturday. He said no, he did not. I throwed down a pound note; I said you had better take that in case you should want any money, between that and Saturday. He said, no, he should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever, before you came to town, apply to you to purchase a piece of carpet - A.Never; nor did he ever ask me to take a piece of carpet out of the house, nor did he ever mention his intention of coming to London, or that he ever meaned to leave my service. I never was so much surprised as on receiving the letter from my wife; I read the letter three times over; I could not believe it. I had just given him a fresh job to do, which would occupy him till my return. I value that piece of carpet by the invoice, at sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LYNE. I am a porter in the employ of Mr. Webb. On the 24th of February, I was porter to Mr. Webb, and on the 24th of February the prisoner desired me to take this carpet to his lodging. I took it out of the door, where the women work. He gave me no orders which door I was to take it out. I had no reason for taking it out that way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did your mistress send you to get that carpet back - A. Yes I could not get it, because it was taken up stairs, and Marr had secured it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you in the warehouse one day, when your master and Marr ever talking about this carpet - A. Yes. The prisoner said he could not give more than five shillings a yard for it.</p>

               <p>GEORGE CLARK. I am coachman to Mrs. Crosssley, 67, St. James's-street. I had been out with my carriage, on the 26th of February. Some days I go twice a day to Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking up any man, with a carpet - A. I do; the prisoner appears to be the man; he looks much elder than I thought he was. I cannot swear to the person. I drank with the man, he was in the tap-room, when I met with him. He said he wanted an hackney coach, and there was not one. I took him to Brompton; then my fellow servant called an hackney coach. At that time gentleman came up, and opened the carriage door; he said his property was there. The man said it was not his property. They both said it was their property. Mr. Webb pulled the carpet out, and desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070079"/>me to take care of it while he got a constable. The prisoner said it was his property, and then ran away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>MR. MONK. I am an officer of St. Luke's, and an acquaintance of Mr. Wright's. In consequence of suspicion I went to Mr. Wright's on the 10th of April, at half past four in the morning. I was let in privately by Mr. Wright's son. I placed myself on the top of the oven. The man in the bakehouse did not see me. I was laying on the top of the oven concealed. After I had lain there some time the watch went past five; some time after I heard a foot coming round towards the back of the oven, where I was. I saw a man get up a ladder to an upper warehouse, where the flour was kept. Then he came down again; then I heard a violent wrench, and a door opened. I saw the door open. The door then shut. The person went to the place from whence he came. I heard him say, he is not there, or is not come, to some person, but to whom I cannot say. In a minute or so he came back. I heard the footstep and I heard the door open. I saw the top of the door open and shut, and somebody looked out. It opened again, and I think shut again. I heard him say, where have you been? The other said, I am just come. I saw Downing come in. I looked up, and I saw Hawker and Downing with a bag. Downing took a bag up, and Hawker opened the door, looked out, and shut the door again. I then saw Downing go out with a bag under his arm, and as the door was shutting I caught hold of Hawker by the collar. I opened the door, and called to the officer outside waiting, to take hold of that fellow, Downing. Downing was brought back with the flour. The flour bag and all weighed fifty-five pounds. Hawker trembled and said, he was very sorry, and hoped his master would shew him mercy. Downing said not a word. Mr. Wright hearing me, he came. We were all in the bakehouse together. After that I took them to Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>- GOLDSMITH. I am an officer. I was stationed opposite Mr. Wright's bake-house. I saw Downing go into the bake-house; he had no bag of flour when he went in. I saw him come out; he then had a bag of flour under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Hawker look out before Downing came in - A. Yes. I had seen him look up the street and down the street.</p>
               <p>MR. WRIGHT. I am a <rs id="t18130407-123-viclabel644" type="occupation">baker</rs>

            . I am just turned of eleven. I am servant to Mr. Barrett. He sent me with a bag of plate to St. James's-street, Piccadilly, about a quarter before eight in the morning. I met the prisoner in Castle-street, Holborn; I asked him the way to St. James's-street. The prisoner answered, he would shew me. He said he wanted two shirts fetched in Drury-lane, and if I would fetch them he would give me two-pence. I was to ask for the name of Mrs. Smith, at a house in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane, and if they said any thing I was to say they were for Mr. Smith, a coachman, at Temple-bar. He told me to give him the bag in his hand; he would hold it. I made answer, I will not give you the bag out of my hand; I will take it up stairs with me. The prisoner said, they will not give you the shirts if you go up with the bag; they will not think you come from me. I then said, I will leave the bag on the one pair, and go up to the two pair. I went to the house, and left the bag on the one pair of stairs, and when I came down I saw no bag. I went to the door, and saw no man stand there. I ran out, crying. A man asked me what was the matter. I told him a man had taken my bag. He asked me the description of the man and the bag. He told me he saw a man run up the court with a new damask bag. He took me to Bow-street; there they said it was of no use unless I went to my master, and got the description of the things. I went to my father first, and then to my master, and my master went up to Bow-street. None of the things have been found. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you the shirt - A. No. They said they knew no such person.</p>

            . On the 22d of February, I was in White Hart yard; I saw the prisoner come out of the house the boy has described, with a bag hanging down. He turned up Round-court, and in about two minutes I saw the boy coming out, crying; he said a man had run away with his bag. I took the boy up to Bow-street, and gave information there, and when the prisoner was taken they sent for me. I am sure that is the man that run out with the bag. He had a drab coat on. There was not a man passed but the prisoner.</p>

He said the prisoner Gage and a man of the name of Tilley, and Cliff, he discovered on the morning of the robbery with the goods in their hands; they there threatened him with his life if he made any disclosure of what he then saw, and by way of shewing their confidence in him they gave him one piece, and that piece he acknowledged to have pawned at different pawnbroker's. That is all that transpired. I do not recollect that he said any thing further at any other time. We took him to the office. He there said as before me. His examination was taken down in writing, and he would have signed it, but the magistrate would not let him.</p>

I asked their names; the tallest said his name was Jones, that he lived with Mr. Maxon, and that the boots were their perquisites, on my looking inside of them; I observed the name of Col. Deane, on them, that did not agree with their story; they said they were made some by one maker, and some by another. I observed they were all made by one maker, of the name of Powell. I put the boots of one side, and sent one of my men for Lee, the street-keeper, and sent the boots up to Mr. Powell, to know who they belonged to. The two prisoners ran away.</p>

I observed the prisoner in company with two others, walking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070082"/>along Princes-street; when he came to the corner of Mr. Mollard's house, he drawed a ladder out of the area. I came out of the house I was in. The others said, here is Bond, and run away. I took the prisoner with the ladder on his arm.</p>

The prisoner Feron and the other that is not taken, went from us; Hill advanced towards us; I took hold of him by the collar, and under his arm, he had these two cushions. I asked him how he came by them. He said, a man said to him, soldier, do you want a job; he offered him a shilling to carry them to Mr. Barber, in Whitechapel, a coach-maker.

            . I am an officer. On Friday the 19th of March, I was standing at the Bulls Head tap, Petticoat-lane, about nine o'clock at night I observed the prisoner come in with something under his arm; he put it on the stairs; he called for a pint of porter; he stopped about five minutes. I thought there was something not quite right; I felt the parcel that he put down; it contained something heavy. I asked the prisoner, what he had put on the stairs. He said, cheese; he said he got it from his masters warehouse, in Whitechapel. I took him in custody. He took me to a warehouse belonging to his master; he knocked at the door; he said it is all shut up. I said, this not where your master lives; this may be the warehouse. He then dropped two of the cheeses against the door, and made an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070083"/>attempt to get away; he still held one of the cheeses in the wrapper, and the other two a gentleman took up. I took him to Mr. Larking, and asked if he knew that man; he said yes, he was his carman. I asked him if he had sent him out with any cheeses. He said, no. These are the three cheeses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are our cheeses, all of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The warehouseman gave me these cheeses, and desired me to take them to the Bulls Head tap, and to put them on the stairs; accordingly I did.</p>

It was put in my sty in the night. I got up about eight o'clock in the morning, Harris and Moore said they had put a sow in my sty; they asked me to let it stop there a day or two. They after that asked me to buy it. I refused. After that I saw Harris and Moore, and Ive, at the Crown public-house. Harris asked me to heat some water to scald the sow. Ive said he would satisfy me to heat the water. I said, if I do it, I will have ten shillings. I went home. Moore and Ive came to my place about four o'clock. Ive killed the sow, the others assisted him, and it was agreed that I was to cart the pig to Ive's house, in Ears-court, Kensington. About half past six o'clock the next morning we wrapped the pig up in cloths, to keep it clean; we put it in my cart, and I took it to Ive's house. Ive is a butcher. He and Harris took it out of the cart. I went to the public-house, Moore and Harris followed; Harris pulled out three one-pound notes; he changed one note, and gave me ten shillings.</p>

He said, some mutton; he brought it from Portpool-lane; it was a loin and a breast; he said it was given him; he then said, by Mr. Summers's man. I took him to Mr. Summers's; he then pointed out Eaton. I told Eaton I must take him in custody, and while I was tieing Faircloth's hands Eaton made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070084"/>his escape. He was pursued, and brought back.

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of February, about half past one o'clock in the morning, I was going home from my benefit society; I saw two pieces of timber against the pales, and the prisoner was standing under the timber. I asked him where he got it. He said he picked it up. I said, it is an odd time of night to carry it. He came from under the timber, and lifted up a stick to make a blow at me, and another man made off with his piece of timber. I thought the timber did not belong to them. I called Mr. Baldock's man, and we secured both the pieces of timber. The prisoner and the man had left them on the green plot. I secured both the pieces of timber, and put them in Mr. Baldock's area. This was on the 9th of February. The prisoner, Withers, was taken on the 21st, and then at the watchhouse I asked him what was the reason he did not let the timber alone the second time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldock. On the 21st of February I was alarmed by a noise. There had been two pieces of timber lodged in my area by Cull and my man twenty minutes before four. I got out of bed opened my window, and saw the timber moving up. I am a constable. I went out of doors with my staff in my hand, and turning into Portman-green I passed a man. I did not see the prisoner with the timber on his shoulder. He heard me coming, and threw the timber off his shoulder. I asked him what business he had to come to my area to take the timber out. I secured him, and told him to go quietly with me. He said, it is you, Baldock, is it? Then I lodged him in the watchhouse, and I and Langley, the constable of the night, took the timber to the watch-house. This is the timber.</p>

On the 8th of March, about half after eleven at night, the prisoner went into my house; he called for a glass of porter, and was served with it. After he drank it I stood with the door in my hand to let him out. He snatched the watch out of my pocket, and ran off. I pursued him, and called stop thief. The watchman stopped him, and took him to the watch-house. I am sure he is the same person. I had seen him several times before at my house.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARKER. I am a patrol. The watchman brought the prisoner to me. I took him to the watchhouse. He called me of one side, and told me where to find the watch. The watch was about thirty yards from the watchhouse, in the kennel, and there I found it. I then took it to Mr. Price. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Since I have pleaded not guilty, I have considered my situation. I am determined not to insult my maker nor the court. I joined the company of those which I thought to be my friends. I therefore implore the mercy of the court to send me as a marine, and it shall be the constant study of my life to be a useful member of society.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 20th of February, about half past three in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Drury-lane; each of them had a bag. I asked them what they had got; they each answered, grub. I took them to the watch-house, and made them empty their bags. There were three quartern loaves, a leg of mutton roasted and cut, a veal pie, some fresh butter, and some cheese. Roberts said they were coming down Charlotte-place, some boys were before them, and dropped these things, seeing him in a watchman's great coat they ran away. They picked them up.</p>

They were all in five-shilling papers. I turned my back to go into the parlour; a gentleman came in; he said, have you lost any thing. I looked upon the counter, and said, I have lost some papers of halfpence. He said, he saw a man go out with them; his son and the officer had gone after him. I went out, and the officer had taken the prisoner in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. From information I watched Mr. Sheppard's shop; I saw a man come out. He looked round, saw me, and then he mended his pace. Another man was with him. They both went up Drury-lane. I took the man that came out of Mr. Sheppard's shop, and searched him. He had nothing on him. I pursued the prisoner, and took him in Wych-street. Directly I laid hold of him he threw the halfpence in the street. I picked up seven shillings and seven-pence. Here they are.</p>

               <p>JOHN HERBERT. I am an officer. On the 25th of March, about five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in Old Gravel-lane, with this bag of oats. I asked him where he had got it. He said unlawfully. I asked him where he worked. He said at Mr. Johnson's; he was a sand-moulder; he had been at work there from three o'clock in the morning. I asked him if he brought the corn from there. He repeated that he had got it unlawfully, and he hoped I should over look it. I told him I should take him into custody. He said if I did, he should be transported. I took him in custody; he made great resistance. I got him as far as Mr. Johnson's foundry-gates; he said he worked there. I took him in there with intention of putting a pair of handcuffs on him; he made his escape from me in the factory; he got over some gates, at the back of the premises. I then went to his house; his lodger told me that he had gone to work; his wife came down stairs; I told her I was an officer, and I had apprehended him for felony; and I must go up stairs to see whether he was in the house, or not. I was going up stairs; he stood on the top of the stairs, and swore if I offered to come up, he would blow my brains out. He pointed either a pistol or a blunderbuss at me; I am not certain which. On seeing fire-arms presented to me, I drew back. He told me all the officers in London should not take him, without killing some one. His wife went up to pacify him. He told me if I would take a one-pound-note and settle it, he would surrender to me. I directed a watchman of the office, to fetch me firearms. He then, by the intercession of his wife surrendered himself. I took him in custody again, and searched him. I found in his possession a key which unlocked Mr. Johnson's corn-bin. I then searched his house; I found about a peck of the same kind of oats in a tub in the washhouse, and two chissels for cutting iron. The blunderbuss and pistol were laying on the chest on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you compared that corn - A. Yes; and it corresponds with the corn in my bin. We lost the lock and key of the corn-bin about three or four months ago. I had this lock put on it; and this key found on the prisoner, would open it, and I verily believe every article here is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to call one of my shop-mates up, and as I came back, I found this bag of oats.</p>

The prisoner came in and had a pint of beer, and a pipe of tobacco, he paid for it, and as he went out I thought he had something sticking out, more than what he ought to have. A short time after that, I missed my shoes. On the 7th of April, I met him, and took him into my house. I sent for an officer; he denied taking them; he afterwards conffessed to the officer and me, that he took them, and sold them in Field-lane. I have never seen my shoes since.</p>

            . I keep the Peacock, in Gray's-inn-lane. On yesterday week, I heard the dog bark, between eight and nine in the evening. I went up stairs, and searched about. I saw the bundle in a corner of the privy, and the prisoner was sitting on the seat. She had fastened herself in, in such a kind of a way that it was different to open the door where she was sitting. I asked her what she was doing there. She said, I have not been robbing. I have nothing upon me. I gave her in custody.</p>

I saw her take the watch from his pocket she immediately said, there goes captain Thompson. She went down Fox-lane with the watch in her hand. I went and took the watch from her; I took her to the Crown public-house; and the prosecutor did not seem willing to prosecute. I left the watch there with the publican. I have the watch. The prosecutor is gone away. The prosecutor was very drunk.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 21st of February, I was on duty in Ratcliffe Layer, and seeing the prisoner coming along with the bundle I asked him what he had there. He said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070089"/>some old rags that he had picked off the dung-hill; he said he was going to sell them. I examined the bundle, and found it to be hemp and flax. I asked him to shew me the dunghill. He took me to Mr. Cooper's ground. He went down to the bottom warehouse. He said he lifted up the bottom shutter, and got in there. I then went and informed Mr. Cooper of it. This is the hemp and flax.</p>
               <p>JAMES EMERY. I am a flax and hemp dresser; I work for Mr. Cooper. I know nothing of the boy stealing the hemp. I keep the keys of the warehouse. The prisoner's father lives in the ground; he works for Mr. Cooper.</p>

            . I am a lighterman. I carry on my business at Isleworth. I employ a number of sacks; I never sell them; I frequently miss them to a large amount; to the amount of two or three hundred pounds a year, by being stolen from the house. I lost a vast quantity last year. From information, I procured a search warrant, and took two officers to search the house of Lunnis, Queenhithe. I saw the defendant there; he said he expected us; a person came from Abingdon to tell him. We there saw a quantity of sacking under a great deal of rope. They were very good sacks: they were cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks did you find these pieces to make up - A. Five or six.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen. I went with a search warrant to Lunnis's house. Mr. Lunnis met us at the door; he opened the door with a key. I told him that I had got a search warrant. He said he expected a visit of that sort. He said, a person came from Abingdon who told him that Mr. Friday had been to Abingdon in the sack mending room. We found these two pieces of sack, and several other pieces of sacks under some old ropes. These are the pieces of sacks. I asked the defendant if he kept an account of the persons he bought his goods of. He said, no; he brought them of people indiscriminately.</p>
