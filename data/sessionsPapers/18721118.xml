I am in the employment of Mr. Boughton, the lessee of Hounslow Heath—I am paid wages by him for keeping the Heath, to look after the fences and the cattle, and to prevent trespassers—about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of 13th October the three prisoners came on the Heath, and were proceeding to walk across the Heath—I told them they were trespassing, and they had no right there.; they said, with an oath, that they were there, and they meant going—I told them they would be liable to be turned back again, and while I was telling them that, Linsey drew up close to me, and hit me a violent blow in the mouth with his fist, and I was knocked down immediately, and seized by all three prisoners; they all three closed in, and kicked and hit me with violence, and said "We have got you here in a good place now; we will do for you"—they all three said that—they kicked me in the eye, which bled most fearfully; I have the scar, and you can see the place now—one of them, I don't know which, said "Well, he has got enough, we have given him enough; we won't give him any more," and another said "I shan't take any farther part in it"—I don't know which it was said that; I was almost insensible at the time—I got up on one knee, finding they had left me, and Linsey then returned and made a most violent strike at me, but missed me, and threw himself right upon me—I had not done anything to them before they assaulted me; I had not put my hands to them, or attempted to; I merely told them they had no right to pass—I got up, and proceeded home as well as I could, and lost about a pint and a half of blood—I gave information to the police, and saw them in custody the same evening.</p>

I am the prosecutor's son—the prisoner was in his service—on 31st October, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was present at the loading of the prisoner's van—there were forty-five packages of tea, consisting of nine chests, thirty half chests, and six boxes—before loading, I counted the packages as they were piled in the warehouse, and found the number correct—after that I took the delivery-note, and checked every number—I helped to put them on the van, and after they were loaded I got up and tallied them, and found them correct—the nine chests were at the bottom, and the half chests at the top—they were loaded from our warehouse—we are City carmen, and they were to go to Ward's Wharf; for the Civil Service Co-operative Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Lambert, and live at 9, North<lb/>port Street, Hoxton—on 17th July last I let my back parlour, with the use of a, sitting-room, to the deceased girl, Ellen Moore—she gave that name—I had not known her before—the prisoner joined her on the Saturday night—I believe she went to meet him—that was the first Saturday after she came—he continued to come every Saturday afterwards, and stayed till Monday—on Saturday, 14th September, he had been there ten days—he stayed that Saturday night and the Sunday, and until Monday—I did not see anything of him on the Monday morning—I saw the deceased about 11.30 that morning; she was coming up stairs from below, with a jug of water, to her room—I saw her go into her room, and saw nothing more of her till 2.30—I then heard the report of a pistol—before I could get up stairs there were three reports—they appeared to come from their room—I went to the door, and tried it; I found it was locked—I tried to break it open, but found I could not—I ran to the street door, and called for help—a man named Barrett came up, also Alexander, and Mrs. Brett and Mrs. Howard, two neighbours—I went for a policeman and somebody went for a doctor—when I got back the room door had been opened, and I saw Moore coming from the room, bleeding very much from the cheek and from the eye—I caught her in my arms, and sat her on the stairs for a second, and then took her down into my room—she managed pretty well to get down the stairs by herself—I gave her some water, and the neighbours bathed her face—while she was there I went up into her room alone—I saw the prisoner</p>

I did not know anything about a female—he said "The girl that I have shot"—with that in came Mrs. Lambert find asked if I would go down stairs and see the girl—I did so, and afterwards returned into the room where the prisoner was—he asked me if I would give the girl the ring out of his pocket—I said ho, if he would wail, some one would be there and go to his pocket for the ring—he asked me a second time, and soon after that Mrs. Lambert came in, and he asked her to go to his pocket for the ring, and she did so—I saw her show him the ring, and she said "Is this the ring?" and he said "Yes"—he said "Good God, I must have been mad to do such a thing as this; I shall get seven years for it at the least"—before this, when I came up, he asked me how the girl was, and I told him she was much better than he was, but to keep himself quiet—he wanted to rub his forehead where he was wounded—he told me that his revolver laid under the table, and to be careful of it, as there were two charges in it—Mrs. Lambert picked up the revolver and gave it to me, and I put it in my pocket—I afterwards gave it to the police—the prisoner asked me if I would give him some brandy—I said "No, that is more than I can do"—the doctor and the police came in shortly after, and the doctor ordered him some brandy.</p>

On Monday, 16th September, just before 3 o'clock, I went to 9, Northport Street, and into the room on the ground floor, where the prisoner was—the surgeon was there attending to him—I afterwards saw the girl below—the pistol was handed to me by Sergeant Goodyer—I produce it; it is a seven-chambered revolver—I found that five of the chambers had been discharged, and two were still loaded—I told the prisoner I should have to take him to the hospital—I sent for a cab, and carried him into it—on the road to the hospital his head was covered up with a handkerchief; he uncovered himself, and looked out—I said "Your name is Augustus Elliott"—he said "How did you find that out?"—I said "The woman told me"—seeing that he looked respectable, I said "Are you a gentleman?"—he said "No, I am not a gentleman, but my friends are very well off"—we went a little further, and then he said "I did not buy the revolver with the intention of shooting her, but to take with me to America; we had a few words, and I fired at "her three times and myself twice"—I said "If you are a gentleman, I will telegraph to your friends"—he said "Oh, my friends will find it out soon enough by the papers in the morning"—in his coat pocket I found a box of cartridges—I have tried them, and they fit the pistol; they are the same sort as the ones that were extracted—I left the prisoner at the hospital, and returned to the house and examined the room—I found an indentation in the party-wall about 4 feet 6 inches from the floor, such as would be made by a small bullet—Mrs. Lambert gave me a bullet; I should think it was one that had been fired—on the 8th October the prisoner was taken from the hospital to be charged with this offence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased and I used to go out together to the Grecian Saloon—I don't know that the prisoner was some time in America, only what the deceased told me—I knew he was away—she used to tell me that he used to go away—when he was in England he used always to come on a Saturday night to the Grecian to meet her, and then go home and stay with her till the Monday—he seemed to be very fond of her, and always acted as a gentleman towards her—he always treated her with kindness and affection in every way—I was not with them at all during the last ten days—I only saw them in the evening when I used to meet them at places of amusement, not to speak to them—they were out late every evening—I don't know whether he had been drinking a good deal, or whether he was spending his money freely.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and am now living in the country—on 16th September I was house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—between 3 and 4 o'clock that afternoon the prisoner and the deceased were brought there—I examined the deceased—she was wounded in two places—they were two gunshot wounds, one in the left cheek, and the other had pierced through the left eyelid—she was in a state of partial collapse when she came in—I had to administer stimu<lb/>lants till 8 o'clock in the evening—she was placed under chloroform, and the bullet was extracted from the upper jaw; that was the one that had entered the cheek; I produce it—I examined the wound in the eye—I found that the bullet had passed through the eyelid and into the eye, and so into the head—I was not able to do anything to that wound—she pro<lb/>gressed as favourably as possible under the circumstances, until 2nd Octo<lb/>ber, when I resigned—I did not see her afterwards—another gentleman took charge of the case then—I examined the prisoner when he was brought in, and found two wounds on his forehead—they were both gunshot wounds,</p>

I live at 40, Ive Street, Chelsea, and am the wife of a cab-builder there—on Thursday evening, 7th November, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I went by Oakum Street, which is close to Leader Street, and saw a "Guy Fawkes" and two clowns—the tallest of the two clowns caught Robert Pasley with his feet in the side, near his stomach, and he fell down—I mean that he kicked the child—the child went towards the gate, and he could not stand, and fell down by the gate—the prisoner is the clown who did it—the boy fell first, and the prisoner fell across him—the prisoner got up, and ran after the "Guy Fawkes"—the boy crawled to the gate—some one came up and rubbed his side, and he said "Don't rub me there; that is where he has kicked me"—I saw no other boys, and saw no one doing anything to the prisoner.</p>

I live at Fulham—on Thursday night, 7th November, a little before 9 p.m. I was called, and found a little boy on a bed writhing in agony; he was cold and pulseless, and complained of great pain in his side—I found no external marks, but great tenderness on pres<lb/>sure on the right side of the belly—that would not be a likely place to show a bruise, the elasticity of the walls of the stomach would prevent it—a sharp-pointed boot would have produced a mark, but a dull heavy blow would not—he died the following night Friday, and on opening the cavity of the abdomen I found the intestine bunt; it was a lacerated kind of tear, and there was a quantity of fetid matter and faces—that was the cause of death—the laceration must have been the result of some direct external violence; some heavy pressure—a fall and being run over by a man would produce it—I have seen a waggon wheel which passed over a body produce the same result—it would be too much of a guess whether it was more likely to be produced by a kick or a fall.</p>

He suggested the case of a man pursuing another down stairs, who falls and is then bitten by a mad dog, and dies; death could not there be said to be the act of the person pursuing him. The blows in this case were outside the stable, and it was no fault of the prisoner's that the deceased fell under the horse, nor was it proved that the prisoner knew that there was any horse in the stable. Death did not, therefore, flow out of the act of the prisoner, so as to constitute manslaughter. (See</hi> "Russell on Crimes," vol. i, p. 854.) <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOUGLAS</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter at a restaurant in the Strand, and am a native of Hanover—on 9th August I was coming over in the boat from Ostend to Dover, and saw the prisoner and a young man named Herman Nagel on board—we got into conversation, and I came with them to London, and took them to Cline's Hotel, Finsbury Square—they said that they came from Hanover and were going to America—there was another German and his wife with us—we were living at Dover, and they asked me to come to London with them, and act as interpreter—we arrived at the hotel on Saturday, 10th August, and about 10.30 that day, May and myself, and the German and his wife, all went out together to make purchases—the young men brought no luggage with them, only a few books—May bought a six-chamber revolver in Oxford Street, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I do not know the name of the shop—we were all five present—he had said in passing other shops that he should buy one to <hi rend="italic">defence</hi> himself from pick<lb/>pockets—he also bought a tin box of cartridges—they both bought some portmanteaus and shirts, for which they spent, I suppose, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before they started that morning, May changed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in thaler notes—a thaler is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—next day, Sunday, I walked to Hyde Park and other places with them—on the Monday we went to the Crystal Palace, and in the evening to the Surrey Gardens, where there was shooting going on—they both shot, and I noticed that Nagel shot from his left shoulder and May from his right—we went from the Surrey Gardens to Cremorne, and got there about 9 o'clock—in the refreshment-room there we met three girls, who turned out to be Burgess, Gordon, and Curtis—the young men did not speak any English, and they asked me to make acquaintance with the girls—I found out that Burgess was a German, and May entered into conversation with her—we were, perhaps, half an hour at Cremorne, and on arrangement was made with Burgess that we should go next day to where they lived, 21, Langton Street, Chelsea—May made that arrangement; he had the address, I think; and next day, Tuesday, we all went there—they spent some money at Cremorne and the other places, but not so very much—we all remained at 21, Langton Street on Tuesday night—we found Burgess, Gordon, and Curtis there—they occupied separate rooms; Burgess occupied the ground floor, and May associated with her; Curtis occupied the first floor, over Burgess's room, and I took up with her; Gordon occupied the ground floor back, and Nagel took up with her—we all slept there that night, and the next day the young men brought their portmanteaus to that house—I was with them when they left the hotel—I did not see who paid the hotel bill; I did not—May usually carried the money—we all slept in the same house in the same way on Wednesday night—we went about together on Wednes<lb/>day, spending money and seeing sights, and about 2 o'clock on Thursday I went with them in a cab to Euston Square Station, with their baggage—they both said that they were going to America—the German and his wife</p>

I had not come from Germany, but from Belgium—I was there six months—I had been in England before, and was in the Union Club, at Bradford—these men were perfect strangers to me when I met them on board the steamer on Friday night till the following Thursday—I paid my fare by the steamboat, but paid nothing after I kept company with them—they gave me their names in Dover—Nagel usually carried the money—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Tuesday, 12th August, and May paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Thursday when they started for Liverpool—I mean to say that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all I had from them—I said before the Coroner that Nagel bought the pistol, but I was not sure—I gave my evidence last Friday to the Solicitor to the Treasury—I said before the Coroner that Nagel bought the pistol, and always kept it; I changed the names, I made a mistake—I, knew that the proceedings before the Coroner were on Nagel's body—I said before the Coroner "They had some 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English paper;" I meant that May had—May did not complain that I had taken some paper money from him, and also a 50-thaler piece—he did not say at any time that, in changing money, I had cheated him out of a 50-thaler piece—I did not change his money, he changed it—he never complained of my doing so—they had some cards printed at the Crystal Palace, with their names on them, but I did not know which was May and which was Nagel—I heard them call one another by their names, but I always thought May was Nagel—they called each other Herman Nagel and Paul May—I heard the names, but it was always in my mind that May was Nagel—that is the reason I give for saying before the Coroner that the other man bought the pistol.</p>

               <p>before, and Nagel went to Gordon's—on the next day, Saturday, May left his watch at a jeweller's in the Strand to be cleaned, I was with him—on the Monday they went out by themselves; they said they had been out on business—on the next day I missed their overcoats, and in the evening their railway shawls—I did not notice whether Nagel had his watch that day—he generally had his coat unbuttoned, but he then had it buttoned, I thought it strange, and asked him the time, and he said he did not know—I did not see him use his watch—they went out again on the Tuesday, the same as on Monday—May had a long chain which I missed on the Tuesday evening—he used to wear it—I first saw the pistol on the Sunday; they had it in their hands once or twice a day, loading it and unloading it—I first saw it in the sitting-room—it came out of May's portmanteau; it was loaded then I believe, and he unloaded it—Gordon and Nagel were there at the time—I told May to put it away—he said he did not want to put it away, and he kept loading and unloading it—I do not remember what he did with it, as he went into the other room for some time—I was in my room about half-an-hour or so, and then I heard some words in the other room, and went in and saw the pistol still in May's hand—I wanted him to put it away, and he would not do so—he was walking up and down the room, and at last he laid it on the armchair, and covered it over with his handkerchief, and I said to Gordon, that if she could, she had better take it away and hide it somewhere—I asked May to go into the other room with me, and while I was gone Gordon took the pistol up stairs to her own room—May returned from my room into the sitting-room, and when he missed it he was very much annoyed about it; he wanted me to give it to him, and I would not—he had a wet handkerchief in his hand and he hit Gordon in the face with it, but I do not think he did it inten<lb/>tionally—this was close upon 10 o'clock at night—Gordon and Curtis still occupied the second floor on Tuesday, and I the ground floor—when this took, place about the pistol Nagel said in May's presence that he had better go up stairs and leave them until the morning, and he went up stairs and Gordon too—May and I remained down stairs—on the following morning, Wednesday, May was very cross again, and said he would not eat his break<lb/>fast till he had the pistol—we used all four to breakfast together—I told Gordon she had better go and fetch it, and save any more words—she went up stairs, and I think Nagel went up too, and unloaded it—he came down and gave it to May, and at that time it was unloaded—when May got it, I believe he put it in his portmanteau, I don't exactly recollect—I saw a small box of fifty cartridges in May's possession, but I did not see him with any loose cartridges—May had a green or blue bag for the pistol—we all four breakfasted together on Wednesday, and May and Nagel went out together about 12 o'clock, and returned close upon 6 o'clock—I had been at home all the time—May returned in a Hansom cab about 1.30, as he had forgotten something—he went into the bedroom, and went out again—I did not see what he took with him—the cab was waiting for him—he was alone in the cab—they both returned about 6 o'clock, they were on very good terms—I went out about ten minutes afterwards, and went to Cremorne Gardens, leaving May, Nagel, and Gordon behind—I did' not notice whether Curtis was in the house when I went out—I was sent for to Cremorne close upon 10 o'clock, and returned at once to my lodgings; but I did not know what it was till I went into the room—I first went into my sitting-room; there were five or six people there, but I do not</p>

               <p>remember who they were—I was called up stairs, and went up into Gordon's room, and saw Nagel on the sofa; he appeared to be dead—May was in bed, I did not at that time see that he was wounded—I stayed in the room, and this letter was shortly afterwards brought to me by Mrs. Curtis and Ellen Gordon, with some pawntickets in it—I translated it to the police—a shell box was pointed out to me as the place where it was found—the letter was not there when I went to Cremorne, because I took a stud out of the box then—I had not seen May writing that day, but I have on other occasions—I have not seen enough of his writing to know it—I did not see the pistol that night—May remained in Gordon's room to be attended by a surgeon—next morning I asked him who wrote the letter—he said that he wrote it, and Nagel wrote on the the other side—he said nothing further about the letter at that time; but on the Saturday I told him he had put everybody to great inconvenience and trouble—he said "Why?"—I said "Because of the letter you left before"—he said "Why?"—I said "Because of the amount named," and that we did not see anything of the amount mentioned there; I was alluding to the 2,000 thalers—he said that they did not bring that money when they came to us, but they had been to two or three other places, travelling about, before they came—he did not say that they had been spending money—he said "Why did you show any one the letter?"—I said "I did not see the letter myself, it was in other hands than mine"—nothing further passed between us—when we went out together, May paid for the different things—he paid Nagel's and Dircks' expenses, as well as his own—presents were bought for me, and Gordon, and Curtis, which May paid for—May never told me why they left Germany, or what they were—he said they came from Berlin—the pawntickets were in the letter when it was shown to me.</p>

On the night of 22nd August I was called to 21, Langton Street, about 8.40, and was directed to the top floor—I found in the room Ellen Gordon, the prisoner, and Nagle—no one else—Nagle was lying on the sofa, with his right hand extended towards the bed and his head resting on his right arm—his legs were drawn up slightly on the sofa—his body was altogether on the sofa, no portion of it touching the floor—blood was issuing from his mouth, and he was lying on his right side, facing me as I went into the room—his left arm was down by his side, his head towards the foot of the sofa, and his feet towards the head, towards the fireplace—he had his coat and waistcoat on—no necktie or collar—the coat and waistcoat were lying over the place where he had been wounded, but his shirt was unbuttoned—he was quite dead—I examined him, and found a wound as from a pistol shot in the left breast—that was the only wound I saw about him—the prisoner was lying with his head under a round table at the foot of the bed, his feet under Nagle's feet, under the sofa, nearly as far as the knees—he had got his trousers and shirt on—his shirt was open, unbuttoned from top to bottom, and a hole in the left breast of the shirt, as if from a pistol-shot—he had received a wound on the left breast corresponding with the hole on the shirt, and had the appearance of being in the exact spot as the other man's—there was no other wound found upon him—his coat and waistcoat were on the table, as if they had been taken off and carelessly thrown there at the foot of the bed—when I went in Gordon was attending upon him—his shirt was slightly scorched, and there was a hole through it about where the wound was, but it was not over the wound when I saw it—there was no smoke or mark of fire on Nagel's shirt—I did not see any corresponding hole in the shirt or any mark of fire—it appeared quite clean—the flesh appeared to be black round the orifice—I should think it was black from smoke—the appearance of burning and smoke was also on May's shirt—when I had been there a few minutes a medical man named Irving came in—he did what he could to May, and gave him some brandy and water—I saw the pistol, when I went into the room—this part of the butt of the pistol was close to the foot of the bed<lb/>stead, the muzzle pointing towards Nagel's right hand as he lay on the sofa, in that form—it was nearer to May than it was to Nagel—if his hand had been stretched out he could have touched the pistol, and barely touched it—I sent for Dr. Godrich, and he came about 9.20—I pointed out to him the exact spot where I picked up the pistol—I had removed it—it was in my hand then, and I described to him how it was lying—I did not know Irving before—I don't know where he is now—I have made every effort to find him—he was there that night about two hours—he was there when Dr. Godrich came—he described himself as a medical doctor belonging to the Royal College of Surgeons, but I have some reason to doubt that—I had an address that he was living at Somer's Town—I went there, and he was denied—I could not find him—after this White, the police-constable</p>

               <p>arrived—I searched the clothes of the men—I searched Nagel first—I found a portmonnaie and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, and a small comb and looking-glass joined together in his trousers pocket, and this pistol-case or cover in the right pocket of his coat—it will fit the revolver—I also found a watch-key—on May I found a portmonnaie, two hotel bills, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse and a knife—I have the hotel bills here, and I produce all the things that I found—they are both for Cline's Hotel—one is for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they are not made out to any name—when Dr. Godrich came May was put to bed and attended to—at that time White was called down stairs by the women; they afterwards came up with him, and he produced a letter and handed it to me—this is it—it contained these four pawntickets—I gave it to Burgess and asked her to read it—she read it in German to May and in English to me—I can't tell you what answer he made; she did not tell me—I went away about 2 o'clock in the morning, taking the pistol with me, and I have had it since—I examined it and found it loaded in three chambers—in two chambers the caps were exploded—there was one chamber not loaded—it is a six-chamber revolver—it was quite clean—I should think the pistol had never been fired out of before—the two chambers which had been fired looked as if they had been fired recently—they have never been cleaned since—the two with the white deposit in are the ones that were fired—it is a pistol with one barrel and six chambers, and has a repeating action—it is not necessary to cock it each time—after the letter had been read it was given to me, and I found in it four pawntickets relating to the pawning of two coats and two shawls on 19th and 20th August, at Wither's, King's Road; two in the name of May and two in Nagle's name—at the same time I was shown the portmanteaus—I found a number of things; books—I found some bills in May's portmanteau; nothing of any value—I found a cartridge in May's portmanteau similar to those with which the pistol was loaded—I have a box of cartridges also—there are forty-four in the box, and they fit the pistol—an inquest was held—May remained in the house until 29th August, and he was then taken to St. George's Hospital and remained there till 2nd November, then he was taken to the police-station, and the following Monday committed for trial—I have got the coats and shawls which answer to those pawntickets—I got them at Wither's—the box of cartridges was given me at Scotland Yard—they were left there by a cabman—on 23rd of August I was present when the prisoner was examined before Mr. Curzon at 21, Langton Street—Mr. Curzon is a county Magistrate living in the neighbourhood—May was then supposed to be in a dying condition—his deposition was taken in the usual way—he was sworn, and he made a state<lb/>ment, which I wrote down as it was translated by Mr. Albert—I produce that statement—the prisoner signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On Wednesday last, 31st inst., I was with my cousin, Herman Nagel, in this house; before this time we had made some purchases, and amongst them a revolver. I don't know for what object my cousin bought the revolver. He went out alone to purchase it. I think he bought it last Friday. On Wednesday last we had been out. Before that day we had been to many places of amusement. On Tuesday we had been to the German Waiters' Club to look for a place as waiter, and we were told to come again about 6.30. On Wednesday night we had a bottle of champagne. After that my cousin went up stairs; I followed him five minutes after. We had cried over our unfortunate position for some time. We had tried, by every means in our power, to find a place, but in vain. We had no more money. Herman Nagel did not tell me of his intention</p>

               <p>to take his own life nor to shoot me. We were alone in the room crying, when he (Herman Nagel) fired upon me (May) and then upon himself. He had placed the pistol in such a manner as to cause him to die instantly. After he had shot me I had still enough <hi rend="italic">conscienceness</hi> left to see him place the pistol upon himself. I also heard the report of the pistol shot, but I was at that time lying on the ground. That is all I know about it I make this declaration under the belief that I am in danger of death, from this wound I believe that I am now lying on my death-bed.")—I have seen the model produced—the furniture and the condition of the room represents the state of things when I went in that day—I instructed Blake to make the model.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Gordon was in the room when I went in first; that is all; everybody else had left the room—Irving attended on the men a little—he had been there before I arrived, I believe; I don't know it for a fact, I heard so—he came in after I had been there about three minutes—May's shirt was open—the bullet had passed through the shirt—the shirt was fastened by studs—I have got them here—the bullet had passed through the shirt into the body—the doctors suggested the examination of the prisoner on the 23rd—Dr. Godrich thought that he was in such a position that it was necessary to take his statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 140, Fulham Road—on the evening of 21st August I was sent for to 21, Langton Street, about 9 o'clock—I was taken to the upper room, the second floor front—Mr. Irving was there at that time, and Borne of the girls, and the policeman Gill—I saw the two young men lying in the room—Mr. Irving left, as the policeman had sent for me—I am divisional surgeon to the police—the bedstead was on your left side, with its head against the north wall—there was a passage between that and the sofa—on the sofa laid Nagel, with hit right hand extended over that passage; across his feet laid May, with his left hand partially extended towards the same point at which Nagel's hand was spread over this passage—the pistol was lying rather nearer to May's hand—Nagel's right hand and May's left were pointing to the same point, because May was lying at right angles, with his head towards the door and away from the window; his feet were towards the window, under the sofa, and his head nearer the door—May's left hand pointed in the same direction, between the bed and the sofa—when I saw the pistol it was lying between the left hand of May and the right hand of Nagel—that was about the place in which Gill pointed it out—it was further from the hand of May than the girl Gordon spoke to; it was pretty nearly midway between the two hands—Nagel was quite dead—May was in a state of syncope—I attended to him—the coat and waistcoat of May were off—the shirt had been pierced, evidently by a ball; round the orifice of a ragged wound, about a quarter of an inch in diameter it was all blackened, as if by the combustion of powder—Nagel's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187211180044"/>
               <p>coat and waistcoat had not been taken off—his shirt was loosened, and I should think that the shirt had been moved by the left hand whilst the wound had been made by the pistol with his right, because there was nothing intervening between—the chest was blackened precisely the same as May's shirt was, and there was no entrance of the ball through the shirt; the shirt was clean—I agree with Gill—the pistol would have laid in such a position as it would have fallen from Nagel's hand had he killed himself and thrown his right arm out—his right hand was extended, pointing over the passage between the bed and the window—his hand was extended right across the passage—he was lying on his back, and his head a little bent to his right shoulder, and his right hand extended in that way, and that was deluged in blood—he had evidently been dead about an hour, or perhaps not so long as that—the head was lying rather over the right shoulder—the arm was very nearly clear of the head—I could not ascertain the direction the ball had taken in Nagel's case unless I had examined the body—I did examine it afterwards—I then found the ball had taken a direction begin<lb/>ning on the left side of the chest high up on the third rib—it had not fractured the rib—it had made a round hole through the third rib, at the edge of the rib—the circle was not quite complete—the ball passed below the root of the lungs—it went through the front of the great aorta, which is a continuation of the heart itself—it went out at the back of the aorta, lower than where it entered, showing that it was still going downwards, and to the left; it then smashed the angle of the eighth rib, within about an inch or two of the spine, and was cut out at the loins, about half an inch from the surface—it went downwards, as though the pistol had been held in this direction—he must have shot himself—no one could have shot him—there is the bullet, showing the immense force with which it impinged upon the rib—it was flattened on one side—these conical bullets don't fly off at an angle like the round ones—you can see it is flattened on one side, where it hit the angle of the eighth rib—it weighs a quarter of an ounce—the bullet would be projected with the conical side forward—the eighth rib is a very thick one—I cannot say how this burr on the bullet would be occa<lb/>sioned, further than its meeting with great resistance there—it just passed over the heart, the same as I apprehend that May's passed under the heart; it was a course downwards, inwards, and backwards—I say that he must have shot himself—I formed that opinion from the direction of the bullet—unless May or any person had gone round to his right shoulder and shot down in the same manner as he would have shot himself, it is clear no one in front of him could ever shoot a bullet in that direction—nobody shooting at him point blank opposite could have inflicted that wound—it must have been done obliquely, and the pistol lay just where a man in his agony would have thrown it—I have no doubt that he shot himself—that is my conclusion—in coming to that conclusion I have taken into consideration the place where I found the pistol—I think the tremendous blow must have knocked the life out of him almost in a minute, and in the agony of the moment he would have thrown the pistol where it was—he might have been shot by a person standing above him on the bed, but that is an extreme possibility—he must have been on the sofa, because he could not have moved after the blow—he must have dropped, unless he was lying flat on the sofa—I say it is far more probable, seeing the position he was in, that he shot himself than that another person got into a very peculiar position so as to shoot him—I was not told that the pistol had been moved</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187211180045"/>
               <p>until I heard it in evidence—I was not told so in the room, nor at the first inquest—quite irrespective of the position of the pistol, I should have precisely the same opinion—if it had been thrown half-way across the room it would have made no difference whatever—the bullet might have passed an inch above the aorta—it was not in the arch of the aorta, but in the descending portion—the aorta is the great artery of the body—it is a continuation of the heart itself; it pumps out and empties the body in a minute or two—May was lying quite senseless on the floor when I went in, and I believed, from looking at the wound, the heart must have been pierced; the pericardium—he was, in fact, dying—after getting some brandy down him, however, He revived, and we got him to the sofa—he was wounded about two inches and a half below the left nipple, and if he had been expiring instead of inspiring, I think the heart would have been wounded, it was so nice a point as that—the bullet is still in his body—I have no doubt it had gone in horizontally, but I could not tell—round balls are erratic, but these conical bullets are not, they will go through any<lb/>where—if the side of the bullet struck on the edge of the rib, it perhaps might be deflected—he had inflammation of the pericardium afterwards, as well as the diaphragm, and a large quantity of fluid in the chest, so that the heart was pushed down from the left side to the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been forty-five years in practice, and have had considerable experience in that time—I have been perhaps for twenty years divisional surgeon to the police—in all cases of violence and wounds I am called in to attend police cases, and have had considerable experience in that branch of the profession—I was examined before the Coroner, and gave evidence there—when I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Nagel I did it for the purpose of satisfying myself as to who caused his death; that was one of the great matters—I asked the Coroner to allow me to examine him, as as to give an opinion of the direction of the ball—I could not give it without—it is from that examination that I give the decided opinion I have to-day—my impression at first certainly was that Nagel must have shot May and then himself—it is very likely that I expressed that opinion before the Coroner, it seemed to me the most probable—after a day or two I thought May in great danger, and directed an examination to be made of him by the Magistrate—I thought him in extreme danger—he was taken to the hospital as soon as thought him well enough to be removed, and was attended by the hospital surgeons—it was about a week before I had him been removed—I then gave up my charge, and had nothing more to de with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If I had found the pistol where the woman says it was found, on the left side of May, and close to him, I should still have the same impression that Nagel shot him, because that would have been just the position in which I should fancy in the agony, the spasmodic effort of getting rid of the pistol, it would have been thrown by Nagel, assuming it to have been used by him—I should have expected it to have been on the right side of May, if he had shot himself—I have beard that it was found close under his left side—I don't think that would alter my impression at all as to who shot first—I should still say that Nagel first shot May and then himself—I could not conceive anything more horrible than the wound the man had received and the shock to his system—if he had had a pistol in his hand shooting himself, the spasm of the arm would have thrown the pistol 3 or 4 feet further than I found it—the real position of the pistol would not signify—its position did operate partly on my mind from</p>

               <p>its being on the left side of May—I don't think he would have shot with his left hand—that was my conclusion, and it is unaltered—if May had shot himself, I should have expected the pistol to be on his right side—I did not say anything to May about his state, because he could not speak English—I told Mons.

               <p>not interfere about his defence, that that must rest entirely with his friends and relations, and I advised him to write to his father—he afterwards made a statement to me quite voluntarily—he said "Well, sir, I must tell you the whole truth; Herman Nagel did not shoot upon me, but shot first upon himself—I then took the pistol in one hand, and opening with the other my clothes (he accompanied that with a proper gesture), I shot upon myself; it was by this very reason that the pistol has been found close to my hand."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the prison only to see after his bodily con<lb/>dition, because he had complained at the Police Court that he was not in a state to leave the hospital and enter the prison—I had no intention of rendering him any legal assistance—I will not say that I have stated before to-day that he said "It was by this reason that the pistol was found close to my hand," but I complete now my evidence—I told Mr. Wontner, on the 15th, what the prisoner had said to me on the 8th—I did not then tell him that the prisoner said "It was by this reason the pistol was found close to my hand," because at that moment I did not think of it—I did not ask the prisoner any questions or tell him to tell me the truth—I had no idea that he was going to make any statement to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and was servant to Mr. Henry Trimble, at the Pier Tavern, at Woolwich—the prisoner is his son, and lived there with his father—on Wednesday, 23rd October, I went to bed about 10.30—the prisoner had gone out and had not returned when I went to bed—about 1 o'clock or 1.30 he came to my bedroom, and knocked very loud, and said "Phoebe, get up, the house is in flames"—I immediately got up, and went to my mistress's bedroom door and rapped very loud, and said "Mrs. Trimble, get up, the house is on fire"—I then went and fetched water—I was afraid to go into the room—it was the next room to where I slept—I knew that by the smoke on the landing coming from the room—I saw the prisoner as soon as I went out of my own room—he was standing at the bedroom door with a lighted candle in his hand—I went down stairs and Miss James and I fetched some water—I did not do anything with the water; Miss James did; I was afraid to go into the room—the prisoner was standing at his mother's bedroom door then—Miss James took the water into the room, and I stood on the landing—Mr. Trimble came up then, and looked at it, and then we called Mr. Baggott in, and he came up, and then a policeman came in and they fetched some more water—I went into Mrs. Trimble's bedroom—the policeman put the fire out, and then the prisoner and the police went down into the kitchen—I went down—they stood talking, and then fetched some more policemen in—he was then taken into custody—I went to bed again about 4.20; about 5 o'clock I heard something like crackling and burning—I immediately got up, and went down to my mistress's bed-room—Mrs. Trimble and her granddaughter put that out—I went into the room—the partition was on fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not swear that the bedclothes were in a heap; there was too much smoke—we soaked them well with water after I had stamped upon them, and we looked round, but did not see any more fire—I went to the police-station with the prisoner's father—the prisoner asked him if he charged him with drunkenness—on the way to the station the father walked with me, and he offered me a half-sovereign not to criminate him—he was rather an aged man, about sixty—he said "Ain't you a police<lb/>man?"—I said "I am not"—he said "I will give you a half-sovereign if you don't criminate me"—I did not mention that on the first evidence—the father did not appear against the prisoner—when he said he would charge his son, the prisoner said "You will be sorry for this," and the father said he had lately insured the house, three days before, for 940<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him to be careful what he was saying—the father committed suicide a few days after he had charged the prisoner—I saw the room after I had put the fire out—we searched all over the room, and left it safe, as far as we could see—the prisoner produced his shirt at the hearing before the Magistrate; it was all burnt.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector R.</hi>) I came into the police-station at Woolwich when the prisoner was there—the sergeant in charge, the prisoner's father, the constable, and Baggott were also there—the sergeant had not entered the charge because he wished to consult me previously—the prisoner was then is the dock, and his father was standing by the side of him—I asked the father to explain to me the circumstances of the case before entering the charge—he then made a statement to the effect that the prisoner came home between 12 and 1 o'clock, that he came down stairs to let him in, that the prisoner required some drink, that he prevented him from going behind the bar, that the prisoner took the measure and drew some liquor from the engine while standing outside and drank it—he then asked for some lucifer matches—he (the father) told him that there was a light already in the room for him—the prisoner said "I want some matches, for I intend to set the b—house on fire to-night"—the prisoner heard all this, but he made no answer—he had been drinking, but in my opinion he understood perfectly what was said—the father said the prisoner then went to his bedroom and he went to his—some short time after an alarm of fire was given, and he, the father, went upstairs to his son's bed room and found him standing outside his bedroom door—he said to his son, "What is the matter?"—he replied, "I will set the b—house on fire, and you will be able to get the insurance money now"—the prisoner said, "You intend to charge me, do you?" and the father said "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Abbey Street, Bermondsey, and am a purveyor of cat's meat—on Sunday evening, 3rd November, I was in Lant Street, Southwark, about two or three minutes to 11, returning home—I received a violent blow behind the head—I fell, and, getting up, I caught hold of the male prisoner behind me—I then saw the woman; she bit me in the eye—I had a struggle with the man; I had him with one hand, and protected my watch with the other; his shirt gave way and I fell, and the man and woman hit and kicked me—the man kicked me—I called "Police!" as loud as I could, and they ran away—the police came up, and I gave information and described the man—I had been robbed of a silk pocket-handkerchief which I had safe a few minutes before—I did not notice the woman's face, but I noticed her dress—she had a black shawl, a kind of cinnamon or brown dress, and a print apron—I went to the station and saw the man about twenty minutes after; he was brought in, and I identified him as he came in—I was sent to the hospital, where I was treated by the house-surgeon, and remained there till 1 o'clock the next day—from the hospital I went to the Police Court at Stone's End—I saw the male prisoner amongst about twenty others, and I picked him out—I was bruised all over from the kicks and the hit the woman gave me in the eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was very much alarmed—I have never been served so before—I was obliged to call out, I thought I was going to be killed—it was a little bit dark that night, and it was rather a darkish place—I had only been drinking in a moderate way—I had been into two public-houses, and had a glass of ale in the usual way—I did not have any spirits—I only had a pint and a half of beer the whole day—I had been about with my cat's meat in the morning, and then I went home, and had a cup of tea</p>

               <p>—I am quite sure I did not lose the pocket handkerchief—it was in my left-hand outside pocket—I had never seen either of the prisoners before that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were lamps about—I should think I was attacked within half-a-dozen yards of a gaslight—I could see the male prisoner, and he is the man—after the remand I received a visit from the woman and three men—she was dressed the same as she was on the Sunday evening—she said "Will you be a little bit lenient with my husband, as we have two children, and if you don't be hard against him we will make a recompense of what little loss was done in the damage?"—I told them of course the ease was not come off, and I had got it to consider; I did not want to be paid for what was done—she said it would not have happened if I had not pushed up against them, and as they had had a little drop to drink, that was how it occurred—I did not push up against them; that I am quite positive about.</p>

I was on duty in Lant Street—I heard a cry of "Police!" and ran up—I saw Cripps doubled up against the wall, crying out "Police!" and groaning—he was crouching down, as if he had received a kick in the stomach—he complained of having been robbed, and gave me a description of the man who had committed it, in consequence of which I apprehended the male prisoner about twenty minutes afterwards—I took him out of a house about 30 yards from where I found Cripps—I believe he lived in the house—I found him behind the door—I saw the female prisoner in the room also—I took the man to the station, and the prosecutor identified him—the prosecutor was taken to the hospital, and on he Monday morning he was taken to the Police Court—the prosecutor was not there when the case came on, and the man was remanded for a week—the prosecutor came in the course of the day—he was then shown the prisoner in the cell, and he picked him out from about twenty others—I saw the female prisoner in the course of the day—she wore a black shawl and a dark dress, and print apron—she was taken into custody on the 11th, the day of the remand.</p>
