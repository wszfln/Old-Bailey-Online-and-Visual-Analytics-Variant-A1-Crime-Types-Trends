                  </hi>. I live at 6, Durham-place, Dalston; I was formerly a farmer, residing at Chingford, in Essex. In June, this year, I was desirous of emigrating, and sold off for that purpose—I intended to proceed to Port Philip, in Australia—on 25th June I was passing through Austin-friars, and saw a board hanging out in the yard, against a tree, at No. 6—there was a large placard on the board, with red letters, on which was "Gold Mineral Company," or something of that sort—it was about emigration—it said the vessel was going to Port Philip—I did not read it—I went upstairs to the second floor, into what appeared to be the office of the company—I saw the prisoners, and three other persons—Mr. Greenwood was one—the title of the company was on the doorposts of the office—I spoke to Mr. Tripe, and asked him about the vessel going to Australia—I told him I had seen the board below, and asked him if he had anything to do with it—he said he had, and I told him I wanted to go to Port Philip—he said, "<hi rend="italic">We</hi> have a vessel going"—I asked him how much he would take us for—he said, "25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each"—I asked him how much he would take off for four to a certainty, and it might be six, including myself—he said he would take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each off—I asked him to take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each off, and he said very likely he would, but he would see when we came to pay the money—he gave me this bill, with a dietary scale on it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it says they allow a bottle of wine a week, and a pint of beer a day—I was attracted by that; I thought it was very good living on the water—I am a Welchman—I asked him when the vessel was going, and where she was—he said she was going between the 15th and 20th July—(he had named the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> to me)—I wanted to go and see the vessel, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185209200002"/>
               <p>wrote this bit of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it me—he said she was at the West India Docks—it has on it, <hi rend="italic">"Camilla</hi>, W. I. Docks, Import Dock"—he said it was a very quick voyage; she had come home ten days sooner than any other one had come from Sidney here—I asked him if it belonged to a good firm—he said the company was very respectable; that there was a lord belonging to it; they were a gold mineral company; and that they had engaged the ship—"In fact," he said, <hi rend="italic">"we</hi> engage the ship;" and that it had been surveyed, and found all right; he did not say by whom—it was next day, when we went to pay the money, that he said there was a lord belonging to it; I had asked him if it was safe for me to pay my money—I cannot remember what I said, it is so long ago—I did not see Montague the first day—after that conversation with Tripe, we left the office—a man named Barker was with me—I went with him to the West India Docks, and went on board the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and next day we went to the office again—we met Tripe coming out into the street, as we were waiting for another person to meet us—I told him we were coming to pay him the money, but we were waiting for another man to come up, and I asked him what he would take off—I said he must take off 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, as there were four of us to pay the money—he said, "It is a great deal to take off, but I will do it"—he ran indoors, Barker and me remaining outside—he came out again, and said, "I have made it all right with Mr. Montague;" that he was going on business, and we had better go upstairs—he then went away from the officer—I went upstairs with Barker and Wagner, and saw Montague, in a private room, not the room in which I had seen Tripe—I told him we were going to pay part of the money for the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, to go to Australia, and said, "My name it Jones"—he said, "Oh, ah, it is all right"—I said, "I suppose Mr. Tripe settled the fare with you how much I am to pay?"—he said, "Oh, yes"—while we were talking, Tripe came in, and I said, "You said, Mr. Tripe, you would take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each off, did not you?"—he said, "Oh, yes, that is right, Mr. Montague"—I said, "I saw the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> and the mate, and he said it was all right; they have been looking at it; they have settled with it to go out—Montague and tripe said it was a very fine qcick-passaged vessel—Montague said the vessel was engaged by the company to go out—I am sure of that; and Tripe said also the vessel was engaged, but he did not tell me who by, but he was present, and must have heard what Montague said—we were to pay 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—that was the half of the passage money—I laid the money on the table—Tripe counted it, and Montague put it into the drawer, wrote this receipt and gave it to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—Australian Gold and General Mining Company, 6, Austin-friars, London, June 26, 1852. Mr. J.

               <p>Australia," I believed him, and when Montague told me so the second time, I believed it, or else I should not have paid my money—I believed the representations they made—afterwards, in consequence of something that occurred, I made inquiries of various persona, and, about a fortnight after paying the money, I went again to Austin-friars, but could not find the defendants; they hsd left the office—there were other persons inquiring as well as myself—I eventually found out that the offices were removed to 26, Harp-lane, from the clerk to Tripe and Montague, whom I happened to meet that day—Harp-lane is near the Custom-house—I called there several times, and eventually saw Tripe—that was six or seven days, at near as I can recollect, after I had paid the money—I asked Tripe about our money back—he told me Mr. Montague had all the money—I said, "Mr. Tripe, I am come here after my money; I understand this vessel it not going at all," or something like that—(there were three men with me out<lb/>side)—he called me into the private counting-house alone, and said he was very sorry he could not pay the money then, but not to make any noise about it—I said I would not make any noise if he would pay me the money—he told roe Mr. Montague had all the money, and was at Bristol; that he (Tripe) was going to charter a vessel, and he expected Montague back every day—I told him he was telling a falsehood, for that Montague was in Whitecross-street—Tripe then said he was—I again asked him for my money—he said he could not give it to me; he had not got it; Montague had it—(previous to that I had been to Montague)—I said I would go to Montague"—I went, and found him in Whitecross-street prison—I told him I was very sorry to see him there, and said, "I have come after my money; Mr. Tripe says you have got it"—he said he had not; that Tripe had it—he said Tripe had every<lb/>thing, and that he was taken there for debt, for the rent—he said he would write me a letter directly to Tripe, to give me the money back—his wife wrote the note, and he signed it, and gave it to me—he begged me not to be too hard upon him, for the sake of his wife and children—he said I was to be quick, and with<lb/>out doubt Tripe would pay me the money back; that he should be very sorry that any bother should be made about it, or for his name to be published—I said I wanted my money—I took the note to Tripe the same day—I did not get the money—when I delivered him the note he said he had not got any money; that Montague had the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not know what 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—other persons were with me when I went back to Tripe—we all went to Captain Lane, the Government inspector of emigration, next day, and the matter was brought before a Magistrate.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185209200004"/>
               <p>a company, and whether it was respectable, for the purpose of governing me in my conduct—I meant, if they were not respectable, not to part with my money—no prospectuses were shown me with the names of persons as directors on them—Tripe told me there was a company, and that they were sitting twice or three times a week—he did not show me the names, but he told me some of them—he said Lord Kilworth was one—he did not give me his address or show it to me—he said Major Hawkes was another—he did not give me his address—he told me Mr. Edward Rudson Read, wine merchant, of Mark-lane, was another—and that Captain Smith was one—he did not tell me that Charles Brown was another—he said John Lutwyche was one—he did not say of Hendon—he did not tell me that the Hon. Charles Plunkett, or Mr. Hud<lb/>son, or Richard Burton, were others—he told me that Mr. Greenwood was secretary—Mr. Greenwood was present the greater part of the time when the representations were made; not every time, but twice or three times—he was present on the 25th and 26th at Austin-friars—Barker, a friend of mine, was also present—Greenwood was present during the whole of the conversation with Tripe on the 25th, and on the 26th he came in when I was paying the money—I saw no gentlemen during any of those periods besides Tripe and Greenwood—I saw three or four young men sitting there writing—I saw Major Hawkes at the Mansion House—I do not know Lord Kilworth—I heard the Alderman say something about him—his name was mentioned pub<lb/>licly before the Alderman, and the names of Major Hawkes, Captain Smith, John Lutwyche, and Mr. Greenwood also—I do not recollect that Mr. Rudson Read's name was mentioned—Tripe never told me he himself was a director—I treated him as a clerk in the employment of the company—Tripe did not refer to Greenwood, on 26th from time to time before he answered my ques<lb/>tions—Greenwood did not, when the vessel's name was mentioned, write the piece of paper which enabled us to go on board—he put these figures on the back of it, remarking that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was too much to take off—Barker was present—I am not aware that Greenwood and Tripe spoke together after Greenwood had written the figures on the paper—I cannot pledge myself whether they did or did not—90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned, but I do not know whether by Green<lb/>wood or Tripe—Tripe told us he would let us kuow next day whether they could take 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was spokesman for the party—I asked what they would take half a dozen for—I do not know which of them it was answered "140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—all the money was paid to Montague—Greenwood was present at the time, walking backwards and forwards—he is a man of about fifty years of age, I should imagine—I went on board the vessel, and saw a person on board who said he was the mate, and that the ship was engaged—I have never seen him since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the firm of Messrs. Willis and Co., ship brokers, of Crosby-square. In June last they were brokers of the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, which was lying in the West India Docks—if any arrangement had been made with reference to the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, it would have come under my cognisance in the regular course of business—I have seen both the defendants—I saw Mr. Tripe first; it was at the office of what I believed to be the company, in Austin-friars—I went there in, consequence of receiving two notes from Mr. Tripe—I believe those notes are destroyed; I have tried to find them, but have not got them—I have searched in all likely places—I put them in my pocket, and as I am in the habit of destroying anything that is of no use, I have no doubt that they are destroyed—they requested me to call on Mr. Montague at the office—it was in consequence of the second letter that I went—I believe it was on 25th June, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—that was the first time I called—I saw Tripe there—he brought me into a room marked "Board room," and there I saw Mr. Montague—I told him I had come in consequence of those notes to learn what he had to propose for the <hi rend="italic">Camlla</hi> (the notes had mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>)—we had a general conversation, the words of which I do not remember—he said he would send us a positive offer the following morning by 10 for the charter of the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and the conver<lb/>sation ended—Tripe was present during the whole of the time—there was a sum spoken of, for chartering the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, about 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I think I said we should expect about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were various sums mentioned during the conversation—I heard nothing more from the defendants about the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>—that was the first interview; I had a subsequent one—there was no propo<lb/>sition sent to us the following morning—the other interview I had was in consequence of it having come to our ears that passages had been engaged for the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>—that was about fourteen days afterwards—I saw Mr. Monta<lb/>gue at the same office in Austin-friars—I told him we had heard it, and we could not allow it, and I came to see what he had to say before we took steps to put a stop to it—he said, as near as I can remember, that he understood that passages had been taken, and that he regretted it, and would take care it should not happen again, and that the money should be returned—that was all that passed between us—Tripe was not present at that interview; I have not seen him since—the 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would have had to be paid for the chartering before the vessel was permitted to go on her voyage—I had never given any authority, either to Tripe or Montague, to engage berths in the <hi rend="italic">Canilla</hi>—I have told all that passed on the subject.</p>

               <p>the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and previously for another vessel, over a period occasionally of three weeks or a month; it came to nothing—I saw Greenwood at the office of the company, the second time I called—I spoke to him, but nothing on the subject of the chartering—I saw a gentleman, who was afterwards pointed out to me at the Mansion House as Major Hawkes; he was writing at a table in the office, in the board room—I did not see any of the other directors that I am aware of—I saw no prospectuses there—I did not see one at the Mansion House—I saw one, I think, here last session, at the time we were waiting for the Grand Jury—there no doubt would be a mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, but I am not aware of the fact—he would be the officer in command in dock, when the captain was ashore—the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> are Fletcher and Sons, of Limehouse; a negotiation could have been opened directly with them—the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> had not been advertised at that time—in chartering a ship, any man can act as broker who can find employment for a ship—we were not employed by Messrs. Fletcher to let the vessel; we had no authority to let it without their sanction, but we knew if we could let it the Fletchers' would be extremely glad to avail themselves of our services—the broker is asked if he can recommend a vessel; that was the case in this instance, we were asked to recommend a vessel; there are plenty of brokers in the City of London, to any of whom these parties might have gone—a deposit of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be sufficient to secure the ship; a deposit of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might, but that question was mooted by me with Mr. Montague—I did not hear anything said about the company, I took no note of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver. In June last I was desirous of send<lb/>ing a nephew of mine out to Australia—on 28th June I was going along Lime-street, and observed a board in front of No. 8, with two bills on it; one was of a ship going out, and the other was headed "Australian Gold and Emigration Company"—I did not read any more—I went into the house, No. 8, and found Tripe there, and a little boy—I asked Tripe if they had any vessels going to Australia—he said yes, they had got a very nice one just come home from Valparaiso, and that she would be going out to Port Philip about 20th July—I asked the name, and he told me it was the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi>—he did not say whose ship she was, or who had the management or ownership—I talked about hiring a passage for my nephew, and asked him the price—he told me, for the open steerage, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked if I could see the ship, and he went with me and my nephew to the City canal, where we found a French vessel of that name—I went on board of her—Tripe accompanied us, and</p>

               <p>went over the vessel—it was not fitted up—he said the Government offcer Would soon be over it no doubt he wouid pass it, and she would be readyfor the dry dock in afew days—I understood him that the company had engaged the ship, that he was engaged by the company, and that the company had chartered the ship—I will undertake to swear I understood him to say that the company had engaged the ship, and she would go out in a very short time—he used the word "chartered"—he gave me no further information of what the company was, or who composed it, but I understood from Tripe that they were a respectable company—I found a French crew on board the ship—I spoke about that to Tripe, and he said that in the charter half the crew were to be English—I did not then arrange with Tripe to pay the money for the passage—we came back to Lime-street, and I wanted to see a dietary scale; he gave me a bill, and said the dietary would be the same as the <hi rend="italic">Abel Gower</hi>; then, after some conversation, I asked him if he could give me a list of the company; he looked about, but could not find one, but he told me they were perfectly respectable gentlemen—I told him as the Govern<lb/>ment officer had not yet passed the ship, as soon as he had done so, if he wrote to me I would come down and pay the money—he said the company could not do that, because there were only two or three places va<lb/>cant, and they could not keep them for me; and on those terms I was obliged to pay the money to secure a place—I then paid half the passage money, amounting to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"No. 18, Lime-street, June 28, 1852.

               <p>interpreted it, that the vessel was chartered to go to Port Philip—the captain is a Frenchman—the vessel was not chartered on 22nd June to go to Port Philip—I saw both the defendants at Austin Friars—they said they had merely gone on board to look at our ship among a number of others; which was satis<lb/>factory—I asked them what was the utmost price they would give for the ship, provided the owners would allow her to go to Port Philip—(they had said no<lb/>thing to me about chartering the vessel before that)—they said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a registered ton—the vessel was 384 tons French register, 464 English—I informed them that I would communicate with the owners, and immediately I got a reply I would let them know—on Friday the 25th I saw Mr. Montague twice, to the best of my recollection, and Mr. Tripe once—Mr. Tripe was in the outer office—he conducted me into the board room, where Montague was—there was some conversation about chartering the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi>—the negotiation went on from the 25th to 28th, but no arrangement was concluded about chartering the vessel—it went off for want of a sufficient guarantee—I asked them for the guarantee—I asked them if they could give me the names of four of the directors, and their signatures to this document, by which I meant the signa<lb/>tures of the directors themselves—they did not produce the signatures of any directors to me—neither of them undertook to do it—that was suggested on the last occasion, the 28th—Mr. Montague said he could not ask for it, but he pointed to a sum of money lying on the table, which was to be at our dis<lb/>posal on signing the contract, and which was stated to be 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they offered no guarantee of any kind—that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be the first instalment if the matter was carried out—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was drawn up by me as the terms on which the vessel was to be chartered—the whole sum would hare to be paid before the vessel finally left the docks—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit would have entitled them to sell berths, provided she had gone through the regular survey by the Government—it was on the morning of the 28th that I saw Montague—Tripe was not with him—I cannot charge my memory whether Tripe was with him on the 28th, on the second occasion—Tripe took part in the conversations—he suggested different things—the negotiation was broken off on the afternoon of the 28th—it was in the morning that the guarantee was first mentioned—we did not break off in the morning—this charter was drawn up on Saturday afternoon, and I left it for Mr. Montague's perusal on Monday morning, he asked me if I would have the goodness to leave it, as he had to see a friend about it, and I left it, and went again in the afternoon—Tripe had called on me during the negotiation—on Saturday afternoon, the 26th, he called at our counting-house—I did not enter into proposals with him—Montague promised to be with me at four o'clock in the afternoon, but instead of his keeping his promise, Mr. Tripe came with some<lb/>body else, and I declined entering into it with him—I was rather angry that Mr. Montague did not keep his appointment, and refused to have anything to say to them—the party who came with him was Mr. Railton—our firm is Batten and Edwards—I never authorized Montague or Tripe to dispose of berths on board the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi>—she is now on her way to Calcutta—we acted as brokers for the owners, and she was chartered to Calcutta—I did not see Montague or Tripe after the 28th till they were in custody—I did not hear that either of them had sold any passages on board the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi> until they were in custody—if we were the brokers of a vessel which had been chartered, it would not be at all necessary that the parties who had chartered the vessel should com<lb/>municate with us about the passage; it is just like a person letting a house, they can do as they like with it after they have got it—it is marked out by the Government inspector to carry so many passengers.</p>

About 3rd July Mr. Tripe called on me; I did not see him the first time; he called again next day, and I saw him; he seemed to be in a hurry to take an office, and mentioned about pay<lb/>ing a quarter's money in advance, but I did not like to urge him for it as he appeared to be very respectable; he wanted to know when he could come in, whether he could send any furniture in—I said, "Yes," he might send it in that day if he liked—I asked him for a reference, and understood he would pay me a quarter in advance—he said I was to refer them to him—I could not make it out—when he took the office, he wished to have a writer to put the name up; he told me to put the name of Montague and Co. up—there was no reference at all—he came in in the course of a day or so after that, and began to have the place fitted up—the first time I saw him he mentioned about the writer coming to put up the name, and the writer came and he gave</p>

Julius Tripe, and Co."—that was about a week or nine days after 3rd or 4th July—Montague did not come there at any time—I never saw Montague till I saw him standing where he is—Mr. Tripe used to come there every day, and I saw a good many persons coming in and out of the office, but I do not know their business—Tripe remained, it might be, about three weeks after the name of "C. Julius Tripe and Co." was written up—he did not sleep at the house, he only occupied it as an office—I did not know of his leaving, he gave me no notice of it; his father attended when he left the office—I have had no money in advance, and have been paid no rent.</p>

I have no recollection of such a letter as the witness Waterford speaks of coming into my possession—if there had been, I have no doubt I should have recollected it—I remember the examination of the two defendants at the Mansion House, before Sir Robert Carden—it was at his instance that I first attended to watch the proceedings, and in the discharge of my duty as City Solicitor I afterwards conducted the case—this indictment was preferred under my directions.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the Magistrate in attendance at the Mansion House when this subject of complaint was first brought there—there were several hearings before me—Lord Kilworth and other directors attended before me; they were never in custody on any charge—summonses were issued to them, I think to all whose names were mentioned as directors, during the examination, but I believe it was from the prospectus that summonses were issued—I believe summonses were issued to all whose names were in the prospectus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. On 14th August, about twenty minutes before 4 o'clock, I saw the prisoners, and another man who was not taken, at the corner of Fenchurch-street, in Gracechurch-street—I saw the prosecutrix, the two young men placed themselves before her, and the female placed herself by her side, and put her left hand in her dress pocket—the prosecutrix moved about two yards away—the two men followed her, and the female prisoner again went and placed her left hand to the right hand side of the prosecutrix's dress—the two men were at that time in front of the prosecutrix—they all three moved away, and the female and the two men appeared to speak together—the men then walked together down Grace-church-street—and the female went up Fenchurch-street—I spoke to the pro<lb/>secutrix, and she felt her pocket—in consequence of what she said I followed the female, and saw her walking with another female, and she was imme<lb/>diately joined by the male prisoner—I went up to the female, and said, "I want that lady's purse that you have got"—she said, "What purse; I have got no purse;" and at the same instant I observed her arm moving under her shawl—I pushed her on one side, and saw the purse on the ground—the pro<lb/>secutrix said, "There is my purse"—she stooped down, took it up, and gave it me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

This occurred on Monday morning, 16th Aug.—we had gone to bed as usual on the Sunday night—about 12 o'clock at night he said he must pray, that he had got but an hour to live, and he got out of bed and prayed till about 2 in the morning—I said to him, "If you wish to pray, I will not prevent you from getting up, Knight"—I begged of him to lay still, but he got out, and remained out until near 2, praying—I then asked him to come to bed—he still said he must pray—he went downstairs, he said he was going down to the closet, which I believe he did; he came up again in a few minutes and got into bed, and laid till about 5—he then got up, and said he must dress himself—I asked him not, I said it was too early to dress himself—he said he would light a fire and make me my breakfast which he was always in the habit of doing, I having the rheumatic gout so bad—I never get up till 11, and every day he always made my breakfast for me, and waited on me—he stood for some time with his back towards the fire<lb/>place—I still asked him to come to bed, as it was very early in the morning, it was too soon to get up to his work—he said he would light a fire—I saw him standing with his back towards the fireplace, when I felt a blow on my head—I was still in bed—he was about two yards from me—the blow caught me on the side of my head; he made a dart from the fireplace to the bed, but he had not said anything to me—I saw nothing in his hand, but I afterwards found this ball (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying in the bed beside me—it is part of a chimney ornament—we had had it in the place for years, it was kept on a table by the side of the bed—after receiving the blow I got out of bed, and tried to get towards the room door, when I recollect his following me, and seeing a knife in his hand—I do not recollect his stabbing me in the room, a little girl of mine unlocked the door, and I got on to the landing; he followed me on to the landing, and I then recollect his using the knife—I was very faint from the blow I had received, but I have a recollection of feeling it in my shoulders, as if I was stabbed—I bled a good deal—I felt very faint—I had struggled a good deal, and I am very much afflicted with the gout—I had had a struggle with the prisoner in the room—that was after I had got out of bed, and as I was going towards the door—when I was on the landing, I recollect Mr. Green's room door opening, and seeing Mr. Green and his daughter standing there—they lodged in the next room—I do not recollect whether they came to my help; I recollect seeing the door open, and them both standing there, and the door directly closed—I called out, "For God's sake fetch a doctor!"—my husband ran downstairs—the next thing I recollect was, that I was on the bed—Mr. Brown, a medical man, attended me.</p>

I was lodging at 2, Brookes-gardens, in the next room to the prisoner and his wife—on the morning in question I was awoke between 5 and 6 o'clock, by loud cries of "Murder!"—I listened for a moment, and found they came from their room—I immediately went to their room, and knocked at the door—the door was shut, the little girl came to the door and opened it—I did not go in—I saw the prisoner with his wife down on the ground, with her head towards the door, with his two knees on her breast—I said, "For God's sake, Knight, what is the matter?"—he in<lb/>stantly jumped up, and said, "You b—, I will do for you now," taking a weapon from off his bench—I could not observe what sort of weapon it was—he rushed at me, my daughter slammed the door to, as I went back into my own room—he had not the weapon in his hand when he got up from his wife, that I saw—he is a watch finisher by business—the weapon he had was one of those things that he uses in his work, a spikey thing—it was not this knife—I afterwards opened my door again, and he had then got her on the landing between my door and his door, and I saw him stab her three or four times—I saw the weapon he had then—it was this broken knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she bled profusely—there was blood on the wall, and floating on the ground—he then went away down the gardens—I called out "Murder!" and Mr. Simpson stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 2nd Sept. I was in Tabernacle-walk, and saw the boy running, and the prisoner after him—I saw him follow him across the road for about twenty yards, as near as I can say; at the end of those twenty yards the prisoner overtook the boy, and hit him on the right side of the head, and with that the boy leaned towards the wall, and laid him<lb/>self down on his left side—I only saw one blow—I should say that hit him at the side of the ear—I did not think anything about it, and went away—I have known the prisoner by sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The boy was brought to me; he was collapsed and in a dying state—I administered stimulants, and did what I could for him—he lived not more than five minutes—I afterwards, in con<lb/>junction with another gentleman, made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was nothing about the body to cause death, but a rupture of a vessel in the base of the skull—the blood vessels of the brain were turgid, and the conse<lb/>quent effusion of blood was the cause of death—there were no external marks nor anything unhealthy internally—I have heard of the blows the deceased received, they might have produced such an injury—I believe a blow was the cause of the rupture of the vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say a vessel of the brain could be ruptured by any blow that would leave no external mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when there is considerable effusion of blood immediately—there was no extrava<lb/>sated blood, it was fluid—I never met with a case before where there was a vessel ruptured by a blow which left no external mark, but I have heard of such a thing—the boy was not so old as fifteen or sixteen—he was a boy of general good health, not of a particularly full habit of body—I did not see anything in the internal organization of this vessel to rupture it easily—it was the artery leading to the brain on the right side—that was the only artery which was ruptured—a shake would not cause the rupture so easily as a blow—in consequence of the rupture there was no external mark—supposing the boy was running very fast, and suddenly dropped down, that would be very likely to cause the rupture.</p>

               <p>he was minding the horse—I am not in the habit of frequenting this public house—I had been there once before this night—this was the first time I had ever drunk with Sheen—Place is not here to-day—there was no one else drinking with us—there was no other man or woman talking to us—I swear there was no woman talking to us at the Champion—I had been to the theatre before I went the first time to the Champion, which was at about twenty minutes to 10—we went to the theatre at about half past six, and first left when the first piece was over, about half past 9, I suppose—I stayed in the theatre from half past 6 till half past nine without coming out—I had not been to any public house before going to the theatre—there was no dis<lb/>turbance in the theatre between me and a person there—there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in which I took part, neither me nor my friend—when we got back at first the curtain had been drawn up, and the performance was going on—we did not find that some persons had taken what we called our seat—we had no alter<lb/>cation with any person there about the seat we had left—we stayed at the public house about five minutes the first time—we had some gin—there was no woman there drinking gin with us—this is the first time I have ever appeared in a court of justice, either as witness or in any other character—I swear that—I have been here as a witness once before, not in any other character—I swear I have not been tried for any offence—I never had anything to do with a robbery on the Great Western Railway—I was never tried for it—I swear that—this robbery took place somewhere about 1 in the morning—the second visit to the public house was about three quarters of an hour after the first, past 11—the performance was over at about half past twelve—we had some beer at the second visit to the public house—nothing else, and nothing at all the third time—I only took a drop of beer on each of those occasions—I did not drink anything to make me at all intoxicated—I was not intoxicated—I was as sober as I am now—I live at my father's house, 3, Paul-street, Portman-market—I had not parted from my friend a moment when Sheen came up to me—I cannot say whether my friend was out of sight—I did not scream out the moment I was throttled; I could not—Sheen's fist completely prevented me from screaming—it is dark at the corner where I parted from my friend—there is no lamp there—I had gone a step or two when I was assaulted—there was no lamp where I was assaulted—all the time Palmer was rifling my pockets Sheen was holding me violently down, throttling me—this happened about 1, and we had left the Champion at about half past 12—I did not look at the clock when I left the Champion—I imagine it was half past twelve from the time I stopped in there, and the time I came out of the theatre—I saw Hobbs, the policeman, about fire minutes after the occurrence—if any one says I was drunk, or even <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>, it is false.</p>

About 1 o'clock the prosecutor came to me in Earl-street, Lisson-grove, which is sixty or seventy yards from Little Church-street—he was not drunk, but he had been drinking—he was very much excited; I should say the excitement was from illusage—he showed me his neck, and there were red marks on it as if from pressure—he was crying—he made a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horsekeeper, and live at 25, Little Church-street. On Wednesday, 18th Aug., I was in Little Church-street all the even<lb/>ing, waiting for Mr. Harwood coming from the play to take his chaise away—about 20 minutes to 1 o'clock, as near as I can say, I saw the prisoners and another person, who I have not seen since, in Little Church-street—they were all three walking abreast up the street towards Exeter-street—I saw a scuffle between the prisoners and some one else inside against the post; I cannot say who it was with, and two or three minutes after, Dowse, the pro<lb/>secutor, came down and fell at our feet—Clements, my fellow servant, was with me—we were nineteen or twenty yards from where the scuffle was—Dowse was sober—his eyeballs were ready to start out of his head when he fell down, and a person said, "Let him lie, he is drunk," and four or five minutes after he got up, and said, "I am not drunk; I have been robbed of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I had known the prisoners, I suppose three or four months, by going to the public house to have a pint of beer after my work, and have seen them there—after the scuffle, the prisoners disappeared in a very mysterious manner—I could not see which way they did go—I went up to see which way they did go—I am rather lame, and cannot go so fast as some people—I cannot say whether they ran or not—I walked towards the spot, but could see nothing of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 20, Wylde-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. On Tuesday, 21st Aug., about a quarter to 8 o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing, I was passing the end of Nottingham-court, Castle-street, Long-acre—I beard a noise, and on turning my head to look down the court, I observed three men standing; one a little distance from the wall, and the two others facing him—one of the men, the farthest from me as I stood at the court, I have since learned is named Neasby—the prisoner is one of the others, and the deceased, Lucas—I saw Neasby strike Lucas with his hand or fist; I am not certain which, and after that I saw the prisoner strike Lucas in the mouth with his fist, and he fell, and the back of his head came on the flag stones—I saw the prisoner, apparently in a great passion, taking off his coat in a hurried manner; that was after Lucas had fallen—he made towards Lucas to strike him on the ground, but he did not strike him—there were no other persons there at that time, some persons came round afterwards—when Lucas was struck by Neasby he slightly staggered—it appeared to me as if he received the blow like a man that was not sober—it was in consequence of the prisoner's blow that he fell on the back of his head—very little time lapsed between Neasby's blow and the prisoner's—I passed through the court, and went for a policeman—Lucas laid on the ground some minutes—when I returned he was taken away.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 31st Aug., a little before 8 o'clock, I was looking out of my window, and saw Lucas—I only knew him as a neighbour, by seeing him—he was standing by his door smoking his pipe—he lived at Neasby's house—I saw a quarrel between Neasby and one of his lodgers—Neasby hit Lucas on the side of the face, and in the room of Lucas turning round to hit Neasby again he struck Mullins; when Neasby struck Lucas, the prisoner went in at Lucas right and left; he caught him in the mouth, and knocked him flat on his back, and his head fell against the stones—the prisoner then pulled off his coat and hat and threw it against the wall, and was going to hit him again, but the mob hallooed at him—that was when Lucas was lying on the ground insensible—he laid there between three and four minutes, then they took him up and rested him against the wall, and his head dropped on his left breast—I did not hear him speak after that—Lucas was in liquor—the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Lucy's-buildings, Laystall-street, and am a drover. The prisoner is my stepson; I married his mother—up to 8th Aug., when this occurred, we had always been good friends—he has three sisters, also the children of my wife by her former husband, Ellen is the name of one of them—I have no children—on 8th Aug. the prisoner came home about half past 6 o'clock in the evening—nothing of any importance occurred then—about half past 7 he came home again, and brought a female with him—I had not seen her above three or four times before—they had tea together at my house, and we had a pot of beer together—he was not tipsy then—he went out again, and returned between 11 and 12 alone, and very tipsy—he spoke very much against his sister Ellen, and called her names, and I took her part—she was in the habit of coming to see her mother—she was not there then, she had gone home; she was in service at Islington-green—I do not recollect what it was he said—I and my wife went upstairs to go to bed, and the prisoner remained downstairs—we occupied two rooms—I had got my trowsers off, and I spoke to him as he was below; he could hear me—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, you have taken your young woman home, then?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, just merely out of a bit of a joke, "I have seen that young woman in her <hi rend="italic">smock</hi> many a time"—he then began to call me names, and abuse me, and his mother spoke to him, and said, "Why, you foolish fellow, you don't suppose for a moment that he has seen her without one"—he began abusing me and calling me names, and I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, I won't have that noise there, I want to get up early to go to my work"—he still</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185209200058"/>
               <p>kept calling me names, and I got a little <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> out of temper—I said, "I won't have that noise there; I shall come downstairs, and see if I can't alter it" he replied, "If you come down near me I'll alter you"—I then ran down-stairs with my trowsers in my hand—he heard me coming and got out of the room into the court—I put on my trowsers, and went and saw him standing in the court with something in his hand, I could not see what it was distinctly—he said, "If you come out here, I will run you through"—I said, "You will? I ain't afraid of you"—my stick stood in the corner behind the cup<lb/>board door, and I took that in my hand and went out into the court—I cannot say whether I struck him or no with it first, but he came and flew on me and plunged an instrument into my side, I cannot say what it was—when I first went out at the door I recollect seeing my stick fall—we struggled together, close against my own window—I was clinging to him—he said, "Let me go"—I never answered, and when he found that I would not leave go of him, he gave me another desperate stab in the side—I then let go of him, and staggered to the opposite neighbour's window and fell on the ground, I bled very much—there was nobody there to part us—I laid on the stones for some minutes, and was then put on a barrow and taken to the hospital—I have been there ever since, and have come from there now—I did not, to my knowledge, strike the prisoner at all with my stick; I had it in my hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Edwin Nellis, of 24, Lucy's-buildings, nearly facing the prosecutor's. On 8th Aug., about a quarter past 12 o'clock, I heard cries of "Murder!"—I looked out of window to see what was the matter, and saw the prosecutor's wife in the court in her nightclothes—she was crying "Murder!"—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor wrestling with a stick—that continued some few minutes—the stick was then thrown on one side, and the prisoner left the prosecutor—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand, or whether he had done anything to the prosecutor—the mother fetched the prisoner back—he was running round the corner, as if he was going away—I believe the prosecutor bad not been stabbed then—the mother brought him back—she then went indoors, and looked out of window crying "Murder!" again—the prisoner and prosecutor were both in the court, and were struggling together under the window—the prisoner then left the prosecutor, and directly he left there was an immense pool of blood—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand—after following the prisoner a certain distance, the prosecutor came back, pulled his shirt off, and gradually sunk under the opposite window, and there was another pool of blood there—he was taken indoors, and his wife came out and said, "Some one has mur<lb/>dered him, will not any one come to my assistance?"—the prisoner was not there then—I went and saw one of the wounds, and tied a cloth round the place to stop the bleeding—that wound was in the left side—he appeared very much exhausted, but I believe he was sensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser by trade, and live at 28, Great Saffron-hill, Holborn. On 6th Sept., between 4 and 5 o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, I had occasion to go to a lodging house at 16, George-yard, White-chapel—I knew somebody who was lodging there—when I got there I saw the prisoner lying down on a form by the fireplace asleep—I sat down on a bench opposite to wait for my friend, as he was not here—after I had been sitting there about five minutes the prisoner awoke, and said, "You b—y wh's get, what do you want here?"—I said I had called to see one of the travellers—he told me to go out—I said I should not go out till I thought proper—he immediately stood up and walked across to a kind of bench or settle where knives are kept, took up a knife, and tried it with his inger—he put that one down, and took up another—he then came up to me, and said, "Now I will see whether you will not go out"—he put the point of the knife so close to my face that it just raised the skin—I had not said or done anything to provoke him—he then rapidly drew back the knife, and made a plunge at my face—I put my head on one side when I saw the blade coming, and put up my hand to save my face, and received a wound just inside the knuckle joint of the thumb—upon that I jumped up and struck him with my left hand—that was after I was stabbed—Sergeant Price, who happened to be inspecting the house at the time, rushed into the room, and took the knife out of his hand—I gave him into custody—I have been under the care of a surgeon since, at the London Hospital—the wound is not well yet—I have suffered a great deal of pain from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Jolly Farmers public-house, 58, Cumberland-market. On 11th Sept., about half-past 2, or 3 o'clock in the morning, I found Williams and Mr. Griffith in my house—I cannot say what time they came in—I found them in the bar when I came downstairs from attending on some<lb/>body—as I was standing at the door, Harding came—I required them all to leave my house, and they all left together, within two minutes, or a minute—there was nothing served after I told them I wanted to shut up.</p>

On that Saturday night I was on duty dt the Hive, in the Edgware-road—I heard a noise at the beer-shop, and hastened to the spot—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor grasping together—there were more persons there, but none near them—they were outside the beershop door—I saw them grasping together—I took out my staff, and said, "The first man that strikes a blow, I shall interfere with him"—I put my left hand towards Freeman, and, on pulling him back away from Farrell, I found my left hand all covered with blood—Freeman called out directly, "I am stabbed, policeman!"—he ran into a house next door—I looked after him to see if he was wounded, and I then immediately turned round and took the prisoner—I took him to the station—he was very violent on the way, and said, "By God Almighty, if you let me go, I will murder some of them!"</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Kingsbury. I was at Mr. Brittnal's beershop on that Saturday night—I was outside—I saw the prisoner come out, and I saw him pull a knife out of his pocket and stab the man—it was a shut-up knife—he opened the knife, and directly Freeman came out he followed him—the prisoner came out first; then Freeman came out after him—the prisoner opened the knife as soon as Freeman came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Park. On Monday afternoon, 30th Aug., about 4 o'clock, the prisoner Price came to me, and said her mother had been dead four years; that her father was sick in the hospital; that she had been without food two days; she had two sisters at home, and the woman of the house threatened to turn her out; and she begged very hard of me to buy a pencil of her, which I did—I asked her if she would like to have a situation—she said she should be very glad, and that a man named Davis, of Rosemary-lane, could give her a character—I said, if that was the case, she had better come into my kitchen, and help the servant—I asked her if she could recommend me a laundress—she said she could recommend Mrs. Simpson, who lived in Haydon-street—I knew nothing of the prisoner before. but she seemed to tell such a pitiful tale—I gave her my card, and sent my servant with her to go to Mrs. Simpson's, but she left my servant in the Minories, and she returned; and the prisoner returned, after about an hour, with her father, who she had told me was ill in the hospital—they left, and she came again on the Tuesday after, at 7 o'clock in the morning—she went to her work—I went upstairs, and about 11 o'clock she called me down, and told me the laundress was waiting for me—I went, and found the prisoner Reid sitting in the kitchen—I said, "Are you Mrs. Simpson?"—she said, "No, ma'am; I am Mrs. Reid, and I have washed before for you"—she said Mrs. Simpson was ill, and could not come, and had sent her—I had no recollection of her having worked for me, and asked her, but said she might have done so—my servant brought the things which were to be washed down-stairs; and while Reid counted them, I took a list of them and gave it to her—there were eight pairs of stockings, fifteen shirts, nine handkerchiefs, and several other articles—I gave them to Reid with my own hands—on the Wed<lb/>nesday evening I sent Price with another bundle of clothes to Mrs. Reid, for</p>

               <p>her to wash, and to tell her I wished to have the former bundle brought home on the Thursday—she returned in about an hour, and said she could not find her—I then went with her, but could not find her—a woman she represented as her mother went with us, and we went from one place to another with her till between 11 and 12 at night, but could not find her—at last she took me to Somerset-street, and knocked at two doors, and said Mrs. Simpson was gone out, but she could give me no account of Mrs. Reid—Price then knocked at a door, and three ladies came out, and she then began to cry, and said that was not the house, in fact she did not know which it was, and in consequence of that I took her to the station-house—on 2nd Sept. Reid was brought to my house by a policeman—I went with them to the station, and Reid there said she had never had my clothes—I have not seen the clothes since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hurley, a cow-keeper, of Spitalfields, and am about twenty years of age. I know the three prisoners—on Monday, 16th Aug., I was in company with Mulloney and Collins—I knew Collins before, but not Mulloney—there was a third person with them—I do not know his name—he is not here—I played at skittles that evening</p>

               <p>with Collins and Mulloney at the Buffalo, in Skinner-street—I lost 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that evening—four of us played the first game, and I played Mulloney after that—we played two and two the first game, and afterwards I played Mulloney—he won the money of me—that was all the money I had with me—I parted with them about 9 o'clock—Collins proposed our meeting again on the Thursday night, but I could not go before the Friday night—Mulloney bad betted that if we met on Thursday night I would not knock the skittles down in five throws for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he betted with me, and we were to meet on the Thursday, but I could not go—on the Friday evening, about 8 o'clock, I was passing by Bisbopsgate Church, and fell in with Mulloney and Collins, and a friend of theirs, the same man who had been with us on the Monday evening—we went to Long-alley, to the Dolphin public-house—Collins went in first, to see whether we could have the ground—he came out, and said they would not let him have the ball to play with—we then went up higher, to another public-house, where the ground was shut up, and we could not get in—then we went up to the Skinners' Arms, in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate, and bad a game, all four of us, for a glass of brandy and water—I and the strange man beat—Mulloney paid for the brandy and water—then Mulloney and I played for half a crown—the potman held the stakes—I won that, and Mulloney paid me, at least the potman handed over the stakes to me—Collins was gone away then—he said to us, "Wait ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I will go up to my uncle's and borrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and back you to play Mulloney"—we were in the skittle-ground, playing, when he came back—we then left the Skinners' Arms, and went to a public-house in Acorn-street, but there was no skittle-ground there, and we all came back again to the Skinners' Arms—we were in the taproom, and had a pot of half and half—Mulloney paid for it; and shortly afterwards Ridgeley came in—I had never seen him before—he talked like a countryman, and wanted to throw weights along with Collins, half a hundredweight—Collins said, "Come, let us get him out into the skittle-ground"—we went into the skittle-ground, and they wanted it to themselves private; but so many people came in, that we came out again, and went into the Sun Tavern—it was then nearly 10 o'clock—Ridgeley ordered a glass of brandy going in, and said we wanted the skittle-ground to ourselves—Collins played a game first with Ridgeley, and gave him two <hi rend="italic">chalks</hi> out of three—there are three chalks to a game—the one who gets all the skittles down in the least number of throws gets a chalk—while one had to get three chalks, the other only had to get one—Collins beat, and then he persuaded me to play Ridgeley—I commenced playing with him for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the game Collins won was for a glass of brandy; and then Collins and Mulloney both betted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on me—they betted the same as I did, that I would win with Ridgeley, but Ridgeley won—after that Collins persuaded me to play him for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would back me for the same—I paid my 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Collins held the stakes—I did not see him pay the money over, but I put mine into Collins' hands, and he said he had got it all right—then Collins persuaded me to play for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said he would back me for the same—Ridgeley won it—I paid my 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Collins, who held the stakes, and they made believe to pay their bets into his hand—I do not know whether they did or not—I saw no money paid over to Ridgeley—Collins and Mulloney both persuaded me to play with Ridgeley for another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said I could beat him—Collins persuaded me to give him a chalk—that was after Ridgeley had beat me twice—they backed me that game even with the chalk against me—I had given him a chalk all along—Collins said, "Bet him the same again; you will beat him the next time"—I deposited my 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Collins—I won that game, and</p>

               <p>got my 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then we played for another pound, in the same way—the others betted just the same—I lost that game—Collins persuaded me to play him for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Ridgeley giving me a chalk, and they would back me with the same—I agreed to that—they each betted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Collins held the stakes—I deposited my 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him—the game was played—Ridgeley won—Collins then said I had only given him one sovereign—I said I had, for I had only got one farthing about me—(I had no more money)—I searched my pockets, to satisfy him, and said I had given him the whole of the stakes—afterward he said, "Yes; I have got it all right"—I saw no more of my two sovereigns—they did not propose to play any more when I had satisfied them I had no more money—they wanted to go—we were going out; but there was an officer in front of the door, and another behind it—I had not sent for them—I afterwards found that there had been a policeman on the ground some time—they were all three taken into custody, and I followed them to the station-house—as we were going, I saw Ridgeley swing his hand out, and heard some<lb/>thing like money <hi rend="italic">jink</hi>—we all stopped—a policeman put down his light, and I picked up a coin, and gave it to Towsey—the landlord then picked up another one like it, near the same place—I put it into my pocket, and next morning gave it to Towsey, at the ansion-house—these medals (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are what I picked up—they were not in this state then; they were brighter, and looked like gold then—on the previous Monday, when I was with Collins and Mulloney, Mulloney said he was a silversmith, and lived in Bishopsgate-street, and Collins said he knew he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Sun public house, Bishopsgate-street. On Friday evening, 20th Aug., about half-past 10 o'clock, the pro<lb/>secutor and prisoners came there—they went towards the skittle ground; when they got to the taproom door they asked for a light, and the gas in the ground was lighted up for them—they made the remark that they had got a <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>, and they were to send them some beer out—I cannot say who said it—Barker followed the potman in, and the prisoners stopped to make that remark—I expect that a <hi rend="italic">"mug</hi>" means a fool, but I do not know—there were several parties in the taproom, and one or two were going into the ground at the same time—I was five or six yards off them, and they could not see me—Ridgeley said to me, "Bring in a glass of brandy and water, Governor," and I sent it in—I knew him, he had been at my place playing at skittles about a week before—I had never seen Barker there before—I called Ward, a policeman, who was passing, and told him what I had heard; he was in plain clothes, he went in and stood by the skittle ground door, which is all woodwork—he could hear plainly what was going on, but could not see—he stood outside the door, it opens inwards—I went into the ground when the officer was there, and they asked for another glass of brandy and water—the skittle ground is glazed and boarded up—when I took the brandy and water in, Collins was saying to Mulloney, "Give me my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back again, I won't bet."—Ridgeley and Barker were playing—the play was over about 12—they were going away, and were stopped by Finnis in front of the bar, and taken to the station—I went after them—at the corner of Sun-street, I heard something resembling money, and they all stopped—I asked a policeman for his light, we looked, and Barker picked up a counterfeit medal resembling a sovereign, like those produced, but much brighter, like a new sovereign—I thought it was a sovereign at first.</p>

On 21st Aug., the prisoner entered my shop about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—he inquired the price of silver pencil cases with penholders attached—I told him the price, and showed him some—I put a tray of them on the counter—he did not like them, and he required to see a second case—I removed a second tray from the window and set them before him, and I replaced the first tray in its original position—he did not like any that were in the second tray, and he wished to purchase a penny penholder—when he purchased that, I noticed the stone of a pencil case glistening under his arm—when he was about to leave the shop, I stretched out my hand and removed the pencil case from below his arm—I called a policeman and gave him into custody—the officer took the pencil case; this is it—it is the property of myself and partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Dr. Bunce, who lives at Woodford. On Sunday evening, 12th Sept., about half-past 6 o'clock I was passing through the hall and saw a man's shoulder in the pantry—I went back and looked, and saw the prisoner there—he put two forks in the breast of his jacket—I cannot say whether they were silver, as there were some plated in the box—I closed the pantry door—it had been open before—I saw him through the open part—he was trying to conceal himself behind the door which opened inwards into the pantry—I closed the door, and rang the dining room bell—it was a hand bell, which was standing close by the pantry door—on my ringing it Dr. Bunce came to my assistance—I told him there was a man in the pantry, and he held the door—a policeman came and took the prisoner into custody—I counted the forks in the box after the prisoner had left the house, and found I had the right number there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 310). On 14th Sept. I was on duty near the East India Docks, and met the prisoner and another man—the prisoner was carrying this brass engine-bearing in a basket—I followed him into a beer shop—he then came out and stood at the door, and beckoned to a marine store dealer that I knew, and that caused me to have a strong suspicion he had something in the basket which was on his back—I felt it, it was heavy, and I said to him, "What have you got here?"—he looked at me, and said, "A bit of braes; my foreman gave it me to take to the foundry; come back to the beer shop, and I will show you"—I went back, he pointed out a man, and said, "That is my foreman"—I said to the man, "Is this your property in this basket?"—he made no answer—I said, "Come, let us know?"—he then said to the prisoner, "You take it where I told you"—I said, "If you are his foreman, why don't you come with him?"—he made no answer, and I said to the prisoner, "You were going to take it to a marine storeshop, and I shall take you to the station"—he said, "Don't take me there, and I will take it to the foundry, where I was ordered to take it"—he then took me to Mr. Stewart's brass founders, at Black wall—I there saw a gentleman belonging to the foundry, and asked him in the presence of the prisoner whether he had done any work for Mr. Peto, and whether he was casting anything for him—he said he had not done any work for him, and said, "Oh! that is stolen, no doubt; you be careful of the prisoner, and take him to the station house"—I took him to the station, and then went after the man he called the foreman, but I have not been able to find him—I have ascertained he was not in Mr. Peto's employ—I have compared this brass with an engine, and find the mark "Z" on it corresponds with a "Z" on the engine.</p>

The prisoner is my brother—in the beginning of this year Mr. Bratt, in whose service I had been many years, opened a shop for me in boots and shoes—my brother had been a boot and shoe maker, and in consequence of that I took him into my service to manage the business—he was in great distress, and out of employ, and told me he was starving—except in managing the business he did not in any way add to the sales—owing to his conduct the business did not prosper, and I was compelled to give it up—on 24th April I went to the house several times, in order to in<lb/>duce the prisoner to quit possession, but could not get in; and he threatened me with the knife and hammer, and to break my head—I then went with a possession-man from the County Court—I sent him to knock at the door, because I knew if my brother saw me he would not let me in—he got in, and I followed him—directly we got in my brother took up a boot tree, and threatened to break the man's head with it—the man was turned out, and I was left—my brother then took a ball of wax that was lying in a tub of dirty water, and said, "Look here, you b—y w—e, I will make you eat that for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I sat down in a chair, and said I should stop till I got some one to assist me, and then he swore again at me, came behind me, and took hold of me round the arms and shoulders to thrust me out—his wife was present hallooing out very bad language, and encouraging him to turn me out—he then took hold of me very violently, and threw me on the floor on to a lot of shoemakers' lasts, where I fell, and was very much bruised—I got up and sat down again, and he took my shawl off me, and threw it out into the road, and at last he took hold of me again and thrust me out into the street, he kicked my bonnet, and he bruised my arms very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Barr. On 31st Aug., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was going into the Pavilion Gardens, at North Woolwich, and saw the prisoner there—I had a gold watch with a chain to it, which was round my neck, and a bunch of coral trinkets—the prisoner snatched my watch from my side, and broke it from the chain—I caught hold of his arm, saw the watch in his hand, and said, "You little villain, you have got my watch"—he said, "Me, ma'am?" and while I held his arm he dropped the watch into the side pocket of a man who was standing before me, I took it out immediately—he then turned round again, and snatched my chain from my neck—it had been separated from the watch by his snatching the watch; the ring of the watch had broken—he got the chain and ran away with it in his hand, and a gentleman in the crowd ran after him, brought him back, and he was given to a policeman—he dropped the chain a few yards from where I was, and my daughter who was with me picked it up—this is the watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the Magistrate ordered them to be given to me.</p>

Last Sunday fortnight, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I came out of my own house and walked up Nelson-street—I know Ferris—I saw him at his own house in Nelson-street, that was before 6, as I passed; he was standing at his own door—I did not go into his house, or stop with him at all—I saw him next when I came back from the Clarence—I did not go into the Clarence, but I was standing at the Clarence, and Ferris was not there, no more than you were—when I came back from the Clarence, I met him right up against the Windmill, at the corner; it was then between 7 and 8—between the time I saw him at his own door and the time I saw him between 7 and 8, I had not seen him at all—I said to him, "Patrick, there is such a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at the Clarence, you had better come right home again;" and he said, "I will."</p>

About 8 o'clock in the evening I saw the three prisoners together—they walked up Putney High-street; they came back again, and separated—I saw Ann Moore go into a baker's shop—she was in some little time—she came out again and joined James Moore, who was a few yards off—they went up the town—I followed, and saw them turn up Wands worth-lane—I then saw the last witness, and was speaking to him, and John Moore came up and turned down Wandsworth-lane—we followed him, and they stopped at the end of Frogmore—it appeared as if James Moore passed something to John Moore, and John Moore went round Frogmore—Ann Moore and James Moore went through Love-lane to High-street, Wandsworth, and there it appeared James Moore passed something to Ann Moore—she went into Mrs. Knight's shop and stayed there some time—James Moore passed by, and he came back and looked in at the window—Ann Moore came out and joined him—I took James Moore, and on the way to the station I found four half crowns in separate pieces of paper in his jacket pocket, and at the station I found one half crown and one shilling in his left trowsers pocket—he said his father gave him them to take out—I found some good money on him as well—we then went to the town and took John Moore coming along—one shilling was found in his jacket pocket, wrapped in a piece of paper—he said at the station that he knew nothing of the other two prisoners, and James Moore said, "You told me that you married my mother two years ago."</p>

This shilling that was uttered is counterfeit, and this found in the possession of John Moore is also counterfeit—amongst the coins found on James Moore one shilling is counterfeit, and from the same mould as that uttered by Ann Moore—two of these half crowns are of George the Fourth, from the same mould, two are Victorias from the same mould, and one of George the Third—all are counterfeit.</p>

Between 10 and 11 o'clock, on that Sunday evening, I was passing the Shards Arms—I saw Sheely go into the house, and saw Juniper go in—I saw him come out again—and when he came out there were a number of Irishmen standing outside the Shards Arms, in the Park-road, throwing stones—I did not see the stone that struck Juniper thrown, but I saw a stone hit him which caused him to fall—I and Collis took him to Mr. M'Donald's—when I lifted him up, he had no life in him at all—he was so till I took him to the doctor—his head was lying on my shoulder—I went in with him—I saw the wound on his forehead dressed; it was a very severe wound indeed, about an inch and a half long—we had a difficulty in getting in at Mr. M'Donald's; and he said he would not dress the wound.</p>

On 24th July, the prisoner and two others came to my shop, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning; the prisoner asked for some oysters—I told him I had sold them all, I had none left—they had three bottles of ginger beer, one bottle each—the prisoner said he would give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for some oysters, and he would stand 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—they then began tossing among them<lb/>selves—the prisoner appeared to be drunk, the other two were sober—the prisoner lost several times—they laid two pieces under their hand on the counter, so when the prisoner called anything they pulled one off the counter, and shifted them so that the prisoner could not guess right—I thought he was in liquor, and I objected to their tossing—I desired them to leave, and said I would not have them there—the prisoner went out, he left his cane on the counter, and came back for it—the other two remained there—when the prisoner came hack the conversation turned about quoits; the prisoner said he would bet me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I could not throw a quoit fifteen yards—they then all three went outside the door, and I heard the other two say, "We may as well have a new hat a piece out of him?"—the prisoner was ahead of them—I said to my <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> in the shop, "They want to rob that man"—I put on my hat and followed them up the terrace—they were all three together then—I was close to them—they began talking about quoits again, and they asked the prisoner to put a sovereign into their hands, and he did so, and they wanted me to put another one with it—I refused, and told them to give the man back his money—after we had passed two or three words they gave the prisoner back his sovereign—the prisoner went on a little distance, and I turned down one of the side streets, and returned back to my shop—I saw the prisoner again on the Monday following, but before he came a strange person came to my shop—the prisoner came in afterwards—he stood looking at my shop, which I was having altered—he walked up to me and said, "I beg your pardon, but was I here on Friday night, or Saturday morning?"—I said, "Yes, and I was very sorry to see the state in which you was—he then said, "I have lost my cane, and I would give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to find it; do you know anything of it? did I leave it here?"—I said, "No, you did not"—he said it was a cane his father gave him, and he should not like to</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman P</hi> 369). On Wednesday 25th Aug., a few minutes before 12 o'clock in the day, I was on the canal bank, at Peckbam—I saw two lads exposing themselves on the bank—I was in plain clothes—they appeared to be from fifteen to seventeen years old—I spoke to them,</p>

               <p>and took them in custody—I took hold of one hand of each of them; while I had hold of them the prisoner Kimber came running up, and asked sme what I was going to do with the boys—I told him I was a police constable, and was going to take them to the station house—in reply, he asked me to let them go—he said, "We were lads ourselves at one time"—I told him I had taken them in custody; I could not let them go—he then told them to lie down—I asked them to go quietly to the station, as it would be better for them if they did—the boys then seemed to come along—Kimber then said, "D—n your eyes you shall not take them," and he caught hold of the boy that I had by my left hand and pulled him away from me—he next took hold of the collar of my coat with his left hand, and took the other lad with his right hand—several men who were in a barge very near the place called out "Down with the b—r; down with the b—r!"—Kimber then pot bis foot between my legs, and endeavoured to throw me down—I was compelled to let the boy go to defend myself—I then took took hold of Kimber, and told him to consider himself in custody for rescuing the two lads—he said, "I will rescue you, you b—r," and he threw me down—I believe we both fell at that time—I got up, and we fell eight or nine times—while I was down he jumped on me, with his knees several times on my bowels—he pressed very heavily—I called for assistance on Mr. Bourne, to aid and assist me, in the Queen's name; and he went to the station-house—I called on the men in the barge to assist me—they did not assist me; they said, "You b—r, we shall not assist you"—the last time I fell, I fell on my back, and Kimber jumped on me with his knees, and I was hurt very much at that time—when I got up I saw Pike, whom I had not seen before—he said to Kimber, "Run, you b—r, run!"—a lad came up, and I heard him say, "Here is a policeman coming!"—I then caught hold of Kimber by his coat, and Pike struck me in the breast with his right hand, and pulled Kimber away with his left hand, and said, "Let go, you b—r"—I believe it was with his open hand—Kimber then ran away—Pike struck me very hard, I reeled against the fence, and Kimber got away—I said to Pike, "I am a constable"—that was just after he had struck me—he did not strike me after I told him I was a constable, but he pulled off his jacket, and said, "I am enough for you, you b—r; you can have a <hi rend="italic">go</hi> at me if you like"—he was coming up towards me, and I pushed him away—I did not say anything at that time—after that he put on his jacket, I believe—he was advised to go away, and he went away, in a direction towards the barge, in which the men were who had called out to me—several persons followed him—I produced my warrant card—I went to the station—I had a violent pain in the bowels—I could scarcely stand or move—I then went home—I vomited and spat blood, and have done so a great deal up to this time—I have not been able to resume my duty—I have beenunder medical treatment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Kimber</hi>, When I came up to you, and asked you what you were going to do with the boys, you said, "Whad odds is it to you?" you never told me you were a policeman till the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was all over. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I told you I was a police constable before you touched the lads—I did not strike you at all.</p>

               <p>On 25th August, I was in the garden—I saw the policeman take two boys, and lead them along the side of the bank—I saw Kimber come away from the barge, and rescue the two boys from him—I saw him struggling with the policeman, and saw them go down, I did not notice how many times, I thought not above four or five—at the second fall that they had, I saw Kimber was undermost—and he kicked at the officer's head, but his head was down, and the kicks went behind his pole—he kicked at him three or four times—they struggled and got down again—they struggled three or four times before they got to the corner of my garden, and there they fell down very heavily on the footpath, and the constable was undermost—I saw Kimber get up and run away—Pike came up just at the time Kimber ran away—I believe there were some words between the officer and Pike, but there were so many people crowding round, and talking, that I could not hear what they said—Pike came up and prevented the constable going after Kimber—I saw Pike pull his left arm out of his jacket.</p>

On the day in question, I saw the officer on the bank of the canal—he was taking two boys, one in each hand—Kimber came up and told the boys to lie down—they did not lie down, and Kimber immediately laid hold of one of them, and pulled him away—the constable laid hold of Kimber with the same hand that he had held the boy, but he found him too strong, and he was obliged to let go the other boy—a struggle ensued—they were up and down several times, and I saw Kimber kneel on the constable several times—he usually kneeled on his bowels—Kimber was usually uppermost—I should say there were fifty or sixty persons round—Kimber ran away; I do not know why—I was fifty or sixty yards away—I saw the constable afterwards, he appeared to be very weak.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Canal-place, Peckham. I saw some one coming along with two boys, and I afterwards ascertained it was the officer Lane, he had one boy in each hand—Kimber came up behind him, and took hold of the boy on the left hand side, there was a severe scuffle—he took the boy away, and the end of the scuffle was blows—the two boys got away—there were heavy blows between Kimber and the constable—when they fell I walked up to know what was the cause—I only saw the first fall—the constable called for assistance in the Queen's name; and there being so many people round, I said I would go to the station, and when I came back I met the officer—he was in a bad state, he had had very severe falls; he was very much exhausted.</p>

I was sent for to attend the officer, Lane—I found him lying on a sofa—he complained of violent pains in the right side, and pains about the abdomen, but especially of the pains on the right side—he seemed very feeble—he vomited blood and passed blood otherwise, and he has continued to do so till within the last few days—he was in a dangerous state during the first eight days, since that he has progressed favourably, but it will be some time before he will be able to do his duty—the wounds were of an inter<lb/>nal character, producing haemorrhage from the bowels—to have produced such results the injury must have been very severe.</p>
