             . On Sunday Morning, the 18th of last Month, I sent my Servant into my Grounds to fetch up eighteen Sheep; I did design to go to Smithfield with two Calves, so I thought I would take some Sheep with me. My Servant brought but seventeen, and told me one was missing; upon which, I told them myself, and thinking perhaps I might get it again, I obtained a Warrant from Justice Clitherow to search for it. I had some Suspicion of Dean, and Flexmore's Father; and I went to Dean's House, and after we had examined him, and his House pretty rightly, he confessed that he,

I brought Dean behind me to Town, and told him he had as good tell me what he had done with the Skin, and he said, Master we threw it into a Cart-rut ; and the next Day I sent my Boy, and he pulled the Skin out of the Rut, with a Fork: It was in a by-lane where Carts do not go sometimes for two Months. He found the Skin and shewed it to me, but I can't swear it was mine, for it was cut into ten Pieces I believe.</p>

            . About five or six Weeks ago I had been out about some Business, and had drank too much, and the Prisoner enticed me from Place to Place, to go to her Lodging with her. Accordingly she took me to a House in Rag-Fair, and there picked my Pocket while I lay backwards on the Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you seize her?</p>
               <p>Herne . It was two or three Hours afterwards before I could, for she ran out of the House. My Money was in three Papers, and I had put it into a Bag to pay three Persons that I dealt with.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business are you?</p>
               <p>Herne. I am Master of a small Vessel, and trade from London to Ipswich; and this Money I brought from Ipswich to pay away - I have never had it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going through Rag Fair for a Pound of Mutton Stakes, and met the Prosecutor , he was pulling some Women about, and me among the rest. I asked him what he wanted? he said so and so, and went to be rude with me, but I got from him. He watched me Home, and I was no sooner got up Stairs but he followed me, and swore he would lie with me. There was another Woman in the Room, whom he desired to fetch a full Pot of Beer. I told him I would go myself, and he gave me a Shilling, and I brought him the Change.</p>
               <p>Herne. There was another Woman in the Room, but the Prisoner was the Person that did the Fact, and we never had any Drink, or any Thing at all. <rs id="t17411204-3-verdict13" type="verdictDescription">

I dropped my Watch in the Grass , thinking to save it, and I had a Bottle of Brandy on my left Side, and Warner took it out of my Pocket, and the other took 5 s and two Box Keys. Warner happen'd to see my Watch lie in the Field , and he said , D - n me Jack , here, I have got his Watch! come along Jack! and then I saw them go along the Field together, and presently I saw a Man lying at length, and heard him cry O Dear! Upon that one of them said, he had a good Mind to turn again and shoot him through the Head, and the other said, he deserved his Brains blown out, and they would do it. I passed them, and went up to 'Squire Edward's Brewhouse, at the Woolpack, for some of their Men to come and see what was the Matter with the Man, and while I was there the Man himself (

He said, he had been robb'd, and I told him, I believed they had broke my Skull, but I would go back and see for my Meat and Potatoes. After they had robbed me, Warner said, here comes another, and I turned my Head as quick as he spoke, and saw Mr. Blackburn in his white Apron, and he told me, he had lost his Watch, and five Shillings, a Half penny, a Pocket-piece, and a Quart of Brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after they had robbed you?</p>
               <p>Shippey . Not two Minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the same Place?</p>
               <p>Shippey . I believe it was ten or twelve Yards distant .</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the Place where Blackburn was robbed ?</p>
               <p>Shippey . Yes, they ran from me to him. Warner ran first, and as he was going along, I took him a Drive to knock him down, and I hurt my Hand in two Places. He had a Horse-Pistol in his Hand, and when I took him that Blow, Newman knock'd me down again; I can't tell with what, for I lay senseless.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they the Persons that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Shippey . Yes, Warner came up to me, and ran his Pistol to my Breast: I said, Friend, I have nothing about me worth your taking. He put his Hand into one Pocket and found nothing, but in my other Pocket, I had three Shillings, which he took from me, and I believe he would not have taken my Meat, if I had not struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before Blackburn was robb'd?</p>
               <p>Shippey. Yes, as soon as he had taken the three Shillings out of my Pocket, he said, here comes another, and I turned my Head , and saw a Man in a white Apron; so I took him a Knock, and thought I would have another when Blackburn came up, imagining he might take my Part; but they knocked me down, and immediately went up to him, and the last Words I heard them say, were, D - his B - d, I have a good Mind to go back and shoot him through the Brains, for he deserves it. It was a Star-light Night, and the Watch were going Twelve when we came through Wood's Close.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards?</p>
               <p>Shippey. Warner was sent to the Gatehouse, and Newman to Bridewell, and there I saw them the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Newman. Please to see whether it was a Starlight Night.</p>
               <p>Shippey. It was a Star-light Night.</p>
               <p>Warner. Did it Rain?</p>
               <p>Shippey. No.</p>
               <p>Warner. I hope you will look into it, and see whether it did or no.</p>

            . I know no more than that I have seen the two Prisoners together Day and Night. - I am a Marshal's Court Officer.</p>
               <p>Warner. He is a Thief-taker .</p>
               <p>Revington. Mr. Blackburn was at our House, and left Word that he wanted to speak with me, and when I saw him, he informed me he had been robbed by a Man in a blue grey Coat, and another in a brown Frock. Afterwards hearing that these Men were taken, I desired him to go and look at them, and I went with him and Shippey , and they were positive to the Men. I have seen them frequently in the Street passing and repassing in the Night-time.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business had you up in the Night-time?</p>
               <p>Revington . I have attacked some of their Kind before.</p>
               <p>Jury . Was there a mix'd Company when Blackburn picked them out at the Gatehouse ?</p>
               <p>Revington. I was not directly in, because Warner threw a Pipe at me, and swore he would do me a Mischief, but there were several Prisoners about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body shew the Man to Blackburn?</p>
               <p>Revington. No, he challenged him himself.</p>
               <p>Q. To Blackburn. Did any Body point out Warner to you?</p>
               <p>Blackburn. No, I just look'd at him, and he said D - n your Eyes, you Rogue, what do you look at me for? I saw Newman in Tothillfields Bridewell; Revington was with me , and I found him out myself.</p>

It is a House where they sell Drams, and I thought it was kept by another Person. I dismissed the Woman whom I had with me, and went towards the Fire-side, and turned up the Flap of my Waistcoat, and saw my Watch was there. The Prisoner then desired me to go with her into the Passage just by the Door, and we had not been there above three Minutes before she picked my Pocket of my Watch, and she gave me a Shove and ran into the House. I followed her, and just as I came to the Door,

Finding she was gone, and not being willing to lose my Watch, I said in the public Room, I would give any Body a Guinea to have my Watch again, and no Questions asked. Upon this she came down Stairs rectly, and I pulled out my Purse to have Change for Half a Guinea: She seeing my Purse, called me into another Room, and I thinking to have my Watch again, went into the Room with her, and there she picked my Pocket of my Purse and Gold. I missed it that very Minute, and ran after her and caught her. I came to Town on the Sunday Night before, and brought this Money with me, and was pretty much fuddled when this happened. I seized the Prisoner a second Time, and Nodder came and struggled with me, and she got away again. I can't tell what Nodder is; I never saw him before that Night, but I can swear to them both. I saw there was nothing to be done, so I went to call Assistance, and got Mr. Roach and Mr. Sumner to go with me, and with some Difficulty we got into the House. We went into a Room and found the Prisoner, and seeing Nodder's Hat and Wig lying on the Chest of Drawers, we asked her where her Husband (Nodder) was? She said he was gone out, but after we had set a Watch about the House, we went into the next Room, and there was Nodder by the Fire Side. He robb'd his Eyes as if he had been asleep, and

               <p>Bowers. I am sure as to the Watch, but it is a hard Matter to swear to the Money. I told the Constable and all of them, what Pieces I had lost before they went to search. These Things were not found upon Nodder, but in the Fire Place by him, and on searching him we found a Purse and some Money in his Pocket. I can't swear that they were mine, but he said he had pawned his Hat and Wig for 2 s. just before.</p>

               <p>Burnham. How do you know but that Woman might take your Things?</p>

            . I am a Robe maker, and happen'd to call in at this House to see for my Bed-fellow, because I knew he was drunk that Afternoon , and he used to keep Company with a loose Woman that used that House. At Nodder's Desire I sat down by the Fire Side about two Minutes , and the Coachman (Bowers) came and sat down on the other Side of the Fire. He sat about a Minute, and went out again, and Burnham and he were both missing. After they had been out two Minutes, or something more, I heard some Body run up Stairs very fast . There was a Screen by the Fire, and I could not see whether any Body went out with him, but he came in presently, and said she had robb'd him of his Watch. Nodder said there was no Body come in there, Bowers insisted that there was, and upon that Nodder wanted to let him out at the Passage Door to see for her there. Bowers would have it, that she was gone up Stairs, upon which Nodder took a Candle off the Counter, and went up Stairs, but would not let him go into the one pair of Stairs Room, because (he said) they must be gone up higher. I went up to the one pair of Stairs, but Nodder and the Prosecutor went up higher, and when they came down again, the Prosecutor pulled out a Guinea on the Counter, and said he would give it for his Watch. Immediately Burnham came down, and he told her she had got his Watch, and he would give her a Guinea to let him have it again . He called for a Quartern of Shrub, and had Change for half a Guinea: she seeing his Money said, Come hither my Dear, I want to speak with you! Upon which they went backwards , and staid very near a Quarter of an Hour, and then I heard her run out crying, D - ye if I will be served so. He follow'd her, and said she had got his Money. Nodder said, no Body had got his Money; but however I saw the Prosecutor bring her into the House by one Arm, and Nodder and he had a great Struggle, and got her from him. Then the Coachman (the Prosecutor) went out to see for his Friends, and Nodder fasten'd up the Door. I did not care to stay in the House any longer, so I bid Nodder give me a Dram, and let me go out. He was very unwilling to let me go, but at last he did; and when I came out, I saw the Prosecutor and Roach together While we were talking together , I happen'd to see this young Woman that my Shop mate keeps Company with. Nodder had refused to let us in again, so she open'd the Door for us, and when we came in we found the Prisoner Burnham a Bed, and I saw the Watch found in the Chimney, and the Money in the Ashes.</p>
               <p>Burnham . How long has he known me?</p>
               <p>Sumner . I never saw her but once before that Sunday Night.</p>
               <p>Burnham. Did he see me go into any Company with the Coachman ?</p>
               <p>Sumner. No, Nodder came up to me as I sat in the Watch-house, and said, if I would keep silent , his Wife should make me a Present.</p>
               <p>Nodder. Ask him whether I used the Coachman ill?</p>
               <p>Sumner. Yes, he got the Woman away from him.</p>

            . I live at the Lamb-Inn, the Back of St. Clement's, within five Doors of the Prisoner's House, and my Servant being gone to see what was the Matter , I went to fetch him Home, but being acquainted with the Coachman, I staid to assist him. The House was beset with Watchmen, and the Door in the Passage was bolted, but we got it opened, and when we came in, we saw Nodder in the Room below Stairs: He rubbed his Eyes and yawn'd , and ask'd what was the Matter The Prosecutor said, he had been robbed, and on searching the House, I found this Watch on the Edge of a Brick between the Closet and the Chimney, and in the Chimney Corner I found four Broad Pieces, and three Guineas.</p>
               <p>Bowers. This Watch is mine, it was made by one Davis.</p>
               <p>Roach. Nodder stood by me when I found these , and he bid me look in the Fire, so I took the Poker and stirred the Fire, and found two Moidores, and two Guineas more. After I had found the Watch in the Chimney, I began to look for the Money, and Nodder desired to speak with me in private, and he said, If I would disperse the Watchmen, the Money should be forth coming. I told him, we must have it now, but he said, there were some Females concerned in it, and they were the Devil to deal with.</p>
               <p>Burnham. Did not I desire to be stripp'd and search'd?</p>

            . On Monday Evening about eleven o'Clock, or a small Time before, John Bower came to my House, and told me he had been robbed: The Robe-maker (Sumner ) came by at the same Time, and we got him to go along with us. We got two Watchmen to stand and secure the Fore-door, and then a Woman came by that used the House, and by her Means we got in. When we had got in, we went into</p>

               <p>the back Room, and found Burnham a bed, and on going into another Room , we saw Nodder sitting by the Fire-side , as if he had been asleep, and he pretended to be ignorant of our Business. We searched about, and at last my Brother found the Watch in the Chimney , and among some Dirt there were four thirty-six Shilling Pieces and some Guineas found . I took particular Notice of them, because Williams took them out , and he being a Stranger, I imagined he might Pocket some .</p>

             confirm'd the above Deposition, with Regard to the finding the Prosecutor's Money .</p>
               <p>Burnham. The Prosecutor came into our House with two Women, and had some Shrub, and changed Half a Guinea for it. They sat some Time, and at last went away together, and some time afterwards he came in again , and charged me with robbing him of his Watch . It is something very particular, that this Man should lose his Watch , be gone from me, and say I robb'd him, and afterwards fuster me to take his Money. I should be glad to know what Freedom there was between us.</p>
               <p>Bowers. There was going to be a pretty deal of Freedom, but I lost it in the mean Time.</p>
               <p>Mary Lane. I live in Peter street, St. James's. I lived with Mrs. Burnham last Summer, and I was in her Family before I lived with her. On Monday last in the Evening, I believe it might be something after eight o'Clock, I saw the Door open, I happened to be coming along, and dropped in there, and saw Mr. Nodder in the Shop. - I knew him before, for he lodged with her when I was her Servant. She keeps a Shop, and sells Liquor , - I don't know what, - common Liquor, - Gin I believe; but however , this Coachman came in, - he had a laced Hat on then, and he asked for one Mrs. Shaw. He was drunk, and two Women followed him in, and one of them sat in his Lap. He went out, and when he returned, he said, he had been robbed, and I am sure the Prisoner was not in his Company a Crum of a Minute. He accused me first, and when Mrs. Burnham came, he accused her; but before he went away, he desired to have a Dram, and be Friends . I know two or three of the People that were there; you, Sir, I knew for one, and this Man in his own Hair was another, and I will take another of you if that be all ( to Roach ) you told me, if I offered to appear you would hang me, and the Beadle of the Parish said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine the other Woman robb'd Bowers ?</p>
               <p>Lane. Yes, I fancy so.</p>
               <p>Q. And left the Watch and Money for some body else ?</p>
               <p>Lane. I can't tell as to that.</p>

            . I know but little of Burnham , but Nodder I have known about a dozen Years, and never heard any Body accuse him of any Thing of this Kind. He kept a Public-House in Fleet Street a little while ago. - I have heard that he stood on the Pillory , but not till within this Month .</p>
               <p>Roach . Lane was in the House, and behaved in a very insolent Manner, and we desired the Justice to commit her to Bridewell, but he would not commit any Body that might be a Witness for the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Burnham. They said before the Justice, that I should keep my Christmas in another World, for they were determined to hang me.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Viel. These Gentlemen said no such Thing as she charges them with, and Lane was the most impudent Creature that I ever saw, and the Reason I did not commit her, was, because she was to be an Evidence for the Prisoners.</p>

            . About half an Hour past nine, the Prisoner Waters came to my Door, and call'd for a Pot of Beer; I keep the Six Canns in Holbourn. My Maid was not so quick in drawing it as she should have been, and so I went myself, and I heard a Woman say, D - you don't stay for the Beer, but come along. He immediately went away from me towards the Cloaths Shop by Little Turnstile without drinking the Beer, and presently afterwards the Prosecutrix came up and said, she had been robb'd of her Cloak.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Waters. The Prisoner Waters keeps a Lodging House in Goldsmith's-Alley, and his Wife having lent a Gown to one who had lodg'd with him, he and his Wife, and I, and the two Prisoners went to see for it. It will be a Fortnight next Monday; I really can't tell what Time of Night it was, but I believe it was between eight and nine o'Clock. They got pretty much in Liquor at the Woman's House in Black Boy-Alley in Chick-Lane, and as we were coming by Mr. Ward's Door, Waters said he would have a Pot of Beer; his Wife thought he had had enough, and was for getting him along. The Prosecutrix happen'd then to come by, and looked at us. I asked her what she look'd at? and she said something, I can't tell what it was, and I struck her on the Side of the Face: then Ann Lee came up to her, and gave her another Knock and tore her Cloak off, and then we ran away after Waters and his Wife, who were gone a good Way before. The next Day I went to Water's House to see how he did, and was taken up for this Fact.</p>
               <p>Lee. What Gown had I on?</p>

             . On the Tuesday Morning after this Affair happen'd , I and my Headborough had a Warrant, and went to Waters's House We found the two Women Prisoners, the Evidence, and Waters's Wife drinking Tea together. Lee was not in the Warrant , and so we only took Waters, his Wife and the Evidence before the Justice, but it appearing upon the Examination that Lee was concern'd, I went to the House for her. There was a Fellow in an Apron with her, and I was pleased to swear a little, and so got her away. She seemed to make Words that she should be taken before the Justice, and Hunt left behind, so we took her too. When they came before the Justice, Hunt said, that

            . I took up Waters and his Wife, and carried them before Mr. De Veil, who committed them to New Prison for further Examination. The Evidence happened to go by my Door in the Afternoon, and I took her to the Round-house, 'till next Morning. We afterwards went to Waters's, and took the two Women Prisoners. Hunt desired to be made an Evidence, and it was agreed, that she should be one; so she told where the Cloak was pawn'd for 3 s. and it was found; but it afterwards appearing that she was deeply concerned in this Affair, the other Wom an was admitted an Evidence.</p>

            . The two Women Prisoners pawn'd this Cloak with me for three Shillings. I asked them who owned it, and Lee said it was hers. The next Day the Headborough came with Hunt to my Shop to take out the Cloak; I knew the Woman again, and delivered it to them directly.</p>
               <p>Hunt. You can't say I brought the Cloak!</p>

The next Morning I went to Breakfast at this Gentleman Mr. Waters's House, and while I was there, the Constable came and took the Gentleman and his Wife away. As to this Cloak, the Evidence over-persuaded me to pawn it, and Hunt went with me.</p>
               <p>Hunt This young Woman asked me to go with her to pawn the Cloak, and I did very innocently, for I thought it had been her own.</p>

            . On the 15th of last Month, between 7 and 8 at Night, I was knocked down in a Field behind the Two Loggerheads , going to Shoreditch, by three Persons. I received a Cut upon the Left-side of my Head, so that you might see my Skull very plain, and they took from me my Shoes, a Pair of Silver Buckles, and this Pocket Book, which my Master gave me that Morning for Memorandums for planting Flowers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to you when they first attack'd you?</p>
               <p>Gray. They knock'd me down before they spoke, and then I believe they said, D - him, keep him down.</p>
               <p>Lacock. Ask him how he came by his Pocket-Book again?</p>
               <p>Gray. It was produc'd before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Lacock. It is very hard to swear to such a Book with no Writing in it.</p>

            . On the 15th of Nov. the two Prisoners and I were at Mr. Freeman's, a Publick House in Bishopsgate street, and saw Mr. Gray come in, and he being pretty much in Liquor, we pretended to see him Home. We went as far as the upper End of Brick Lane into Swan-Fields , and I had hold of his Arm when Lacock knock'd him down with a Mopstick, and we both tumbled into the Ditch together. Then they took his Shoes and Buckles, and this Pocket-Book. I have known Shuffle about 12 Months; he is a Velvet-weaver by Trade. Lacock I have known ever since Mackarel Season; he used to sell Things about the Streets, and we had been drinking together, and had no Design to do any Thing before Gray came into the House, and then we took Notice of his Silver Buckles, and agreed to take them.</p>

             . On Wednesday Night last, I was in Company with a Man , and the Prisoner Lacock came and said he had committed some Robberies, and was desirons to leave off this Course of Life, and he made an Evidence , and if we would come next Morning to his Lodging, we should find the other Prisoner and Standley. Accordingly we went and broke the Door open, and found Lacock in one Room, and Standley and Shuffle in the other. He (Lacock) own'd to me, that he himself knock'd the Man down with a Mopstick , and that the Buckles were sold for 4 s. 6 d and the Shoes for 1 s. We carried them before Mr. Deveil , who perceiving that Lacock was the very Person that knock'd Gray down, he refused his Information, and admitted Standley an Evidence. This Pocket-Book I fetch'd from Standley's Wife, according to his Direction; she was very scrupulous to let me have it, but I brought it away with me. Here is a Memorandum in it, knock'd down Sunday Night, and I suppose that relates to this Robbery.</p>
               <p>Standley. I wrote these Words in it myself</p>
               <p>Q. to Wornel. Did Shuffle say any Thing before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Wornel. He desired to be made an Evidence, and said he could make the greatest Discovery. All of them owned it before Mr. Deveil.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Veil. These three Men were brought before me before we knew the Person that was attack'd. They all own'd the Fact, and called him by the Name of Blake, a Gardiner at Walthamstow . I put them into the News, and the next Day the Prosecutor appear'd against them.</p>

I saw Dutton with the Watch in her Hand Mr. Rose was very much in Liquor, and she bid him good Night, and ran 'cross the Way directly, and bid the other Woman run too. I perceiv'd by that that they had robb'd him of his Watch, so I went up to him, and asked him if he had lost any Thing? He said he had not, but as soon as he had felt in his Pocket, he attempted to pursue the Prisoners, but being very much in Liquor he fell down. Dutton ran up Warwick Court by the White Hart Tavern, and as soon as I had seized her, I asked her for the Watch, and she pulled it out of her Bosom and thrust it to me.</p>

               <p>Fish. She did not go away, but staid in the Court. This is the Watch I had of the Prisoner, and before Rose felt for it, he told me the Name on the Dial-Plate.

             . I was Constable of the Night. The Prisoners were brought to me by Mr. Rose and Mr. Fish, and charg'd with robbing him of a Watch, and the Guts of a Watch besides. Rose was very much fuddled: He had fell in the Kennel, and was so muddy, that he could not see out of his Eyes. When he came to himself, he describ'd the Watch, and I took the Prisoners to New-Prison that Night. The next Morning they were carried before Justice Paulson , where the tall one Dutton desired to be admitted an Evidence; but Bessier charg'd her with taking other Things from the Prosecutor, and she appearing to be the principal Person, the Justice refused to admit her Information.</p>
               <p>Dutton. I had been with this young Woman to see her Mother, and coming through Lincoln's Inn-Fields, this Gentleman called after us. His Hat fell off, and I put it on again several Times, and left him. A Man that knew me happen'd to stop me in Holbourn , and the Prosecutor over took me. He put the Watch into my Hand, and in the mean Time Mr. Fish came up, and asked him if he had not lost his Watch? The Prosecutor said, he knew who he had given it to, and it was safe. He pulled his Handkerchief out of his Pocket, and the Guts of a Watch left out with it. I would have given them to him again, but he said they were of no Consequence, and I might keep them.</p>

That it was for this Reason, (the Crimes of Forgery and Perjury being so frequent, the Error that flieth by Night, and the secret Transactions by which the Lives and Properties of every Man were in Danger) the Punishment which was extremely mild, was not thought adequate to the Crime, and therefore the Wisdom of the Legislature, thought fit by an Act of this present Majesty, to make this Offence Felony, without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
               <p>That this Law was to be in Force for five Years only, but before its Expiration, the good Effects of it were perceived, and it was therefore revived, and made perpetual, by another Act of the 9th of his present Majesty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Act of the 2d of the King which made this Offence Felony, and the Act for the reviving and making the same perpetual, were read.</p>

Lee was not there when the Will was first brought; he came to account for the Error in it. I got the Executrix sworn before Doctor Chapman, and then I observed a Mistake of John at the Bottom, instead of Peter, upon which I applied to the Register's Clerk who told me that Error must be accounted for.

They went away that Time, and the next Day Dominick brought the other Prisoner Lee to me, - I can't tell whether Kelly was present then. I am certain Lee was, for I took particular Notice of him as he came into the Court. He pretended that his Name was Welch , and that he was one of the subscribing Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Council. Did he make any Affidavit that Night?</p>
               <p>Mr. Taverner. No; he seemed to be in Liquor, and I told him the Thing he came about was of a very serious Nature, therefore I would not draw an Affidavit for a Person in such a Condition. I appointed him to come some other Time, when he was perfectly sober, and I think the next Morning he came, and I took Instructions from him, and had him sworn to it. This is the Affidavit, he swore to it by the Name of Welch, and I have attested it.</p>

             , came to my House. We had a good deal of Discourse about going to the Navy-Office, and they asked me to go with them. I told them, I had some Business with my Coal-Man at Billingsgate, and would walk so far with them. At their Desire I went with them as far as Tower Hill, and they attempted to go into the Ship, but there being some Company there, we came out again. We then went to the Tyger : that House was full of Soldiers, and therefore we adjourned from thence to the Three Crowns in Thames-street. We call'd for a Pot of Beer, and then Lee said to Fitzgerald, Dominick! you know what we come about! why don't you do that Thing? So I will, said Fitzgerald; upon which he took a Paper out of his Pocket , which I found to be a blank Sailor's Will. He filled up the Spaces, and made the Mark, and then James Lee signed it in the Name of Welch, and

               <p>Ecklin. I am in a manner very sure of it, for in rubbing it to make it look old and dirty, they tore it here before they carried it to Mr. Taverner's; besides Fitzgerald said to me, Come Mr. Ecklin, won't you be a Witness to this Will? Why, (said Lee) you may as well, for we received Money but last Week on such an Account as this; no Body can be a Sufferer, for this Money goes to the Chatham Chest , and the King never pays twice. I desired to be excused, and then Fitzgerald said, I am but a poor Man, and there is a good deal of Wages due to this Man, and if I knew that any Body would discover, I'd run a Knife into him.</p>

She telling me that her Child had net eat a Bit of Bread that Day, I put my Hand in my Pocket, and offered her a Penny. She refused it, and said, that would hardly make her drink, but she had an Apartment hard by, and desired me to go with her. At her Request I went with her into a House in <rs id="t17411204-22-cd97" type="crimeDate">Holford's Alley</rs>

She took me into a little Room and called for a Dram, and then she wanted me to give her a Present. I refused, upon which she knocked with her Heel, and somebody below cry'd, Above! D - n you, above. Immediately I missed my Watch, and the Prisoner left me, and I being afraid of my Life, stole down Stairs as if I had been a Thief myself. The Prisoners were taken afterwards, and Watson confessed to me at Mr. Rice's in Vinegar-Yard , that she took the Watch from me, and gave it to the other Prisoner before she got off the Stairs, and that she was to have 5 s. Poundage for pawning it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Watson. Ask him whether an old Woman did not go into the Room to take the Candle away?</p>
               <p>Head. No.</p>

One Friday Night after 10 o' Clock , - I can't tell the Day of the Month, Mr. Head came to my House very melancholy, and complained that he had lost his Watch. He said at our House all Night, and the next Day he went to find out the House. They say one Lyons keep it, and one

Accordingly she sent for Dogget , and she denied she had it; but Watson wrung her Hands and cried and begg'd of her to let Mr. Head have it again, and notwithstanding all that she refused. Then they were carried before the Justice, and just as they were going to be committed, Dogget said, we might send to the Parliament House in the Strand for it; but no Body would go for it, and so they were sent to Prison. They were afterwards brought up for further Examination, and then Dogget own'd that she had the Watch, and that she was to have a Crown Poundage out of it.</p>

               <p>Head. While I was in the Room with her, I look'd at my Watch to see what it was o'Clock, and I told her I must be at the Fountain in Cheapside before 10. She said I might do any Thing with her, but I refused to have any Thing to say to her.</p>

In the forcing he chuck'd him on the Throat, and I saw Shotton strike him two or three Blows on the Breast, and it is my Opinion they were the Death of him.

               <p>Q. Was any Thing said to your Brother before the Prisoner laid hold of him ?</p>
               <p>Herne. I did not hear him asked to play before by any Body: the laying hold was the first that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain while he was playing, that he was any way affected by those Blows?</p>
               <p>Herne. No.</p>

               <p>A Witness. I saw the Prisoner take hold of this Man by the Coat, in order to carry him up to the Wicket to play. Shotton hit him 2 Blows, one over the Prisoner's Arm, and one under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of any Injury afterwards?</p>
               <p>Witness. He said, he believ'd those Rogues had given him his Death. I saw nothing done by the Prisoner but the laying hold of his Collar to make him play.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he play long after this?</p>
               <p>Witness. He got one Notch according to the Rule of the Play.</p>

He complained that his Breast and his Throat were very sore, and said, that the Prisoner in pulling him along chuck'd his Throat so that he could not tell how to swallow any Thing. He lived about 3 Weeks afterwards, and always complained of the Blow.</p>

            . I stood Umpter (Umpire) at the Wicket, and there was a Sort of a Demur about a Man's coming in. I saw the Prisoner bring him along by the Collar, and I saw Shotton strike him a Blow. He seem'd to be unwilling to go in to play, and said he would go in next.</p>
               <p>C. What had the Prisoner and Shotton to do in this?</p>
               <p>Smith. Nothing at all except they laid any Betts. The Deceased did go in and ran one Notch, and was out at the same End as I stood at. He said he was very ill, and wish'd he was at Home, but I did not hear him make any particular Complaint.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Did you hear any Thing but what was civil done or said by me?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, if there had I must have seen it, and I can't say that he used him ill any otherwise than bringing him along to play.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill, Surgeon. On the 18th of Nov. last I was sent for to view the Body of the Deceased on the Coroner's Inquest. I found an external Contusion on the Skin, about 8 Inches Diameter, which extended to the left Hypocondriack. Upon opening the Body I found the Cartilage of the eighth Rib on the left Side broken: in the left Cavity of the Thorax, I found between 15 or 20 Ounces of extravasated Blood, and the back part of the Lungs on that same Side were vastly inflam'd. Then I examin'd the right Cavity of the Thorax, and found 4 or 5 Ounces of Blood, and the Colon and the interior Parts of the Stomach were gangreen'd.</p>
               <p>Council. How do you apprehend that to be done?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill . By the Blows I should imagine, and certainly they were the Cause of his Death, for otherwise he was found.</p>
               <p>C. How long did you see him after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill. He died on the Wednesday, and I opened him on the Monday.</p>
               <p>C. Do you think that any Fever was the Occasion of this Disorder?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill . That has not yet come to my Knowledge: my Opinion is, that it proceeded from these Bruises and Blows.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Is it not common in a malignant Fever to have Part of the Stomach inflamed?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill. I have never seen it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Might not that Rib be broke by a Fall?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill. Yes, to be sure it might.</p>
               <p>C. Was there any Appearance of Blackness upon the Place where the Rib was broke?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill. Yes, about eight Inches Diameter.</p>
               <p>Q. If any Person receives a Blow, will the Cartilage, or the Rib break first?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dudhill. The Cartilage would break sooner than the Rib.</p>

               <p>I think it was on the 23d of September, I heard there was to be a Cricket-Match between the Towns of Brentford , and Staines . I happened to have a Friend come in to dine with me, and therefore I thought we might after Dinner divert ourselves in seeing this Cricket-Match. They played very easy and quiet till the latter Part of the Game, when there were two Men to go in on the Brentford Side, and neither of those Men would go in; so a great Uproar began. The Deceased's Coat was unbutton'd, and I took hold of his Coat very inoffensively, as I thought, and desired him to go in. He d - 'd me, and asked me, what it was to me; upon which, I told him, if he did not play, it should be worse for him, for I would stand by the other Men, and see them righted, if it cost me 20 l. He lifted up his Hand, and I thought he had been going to strike me, and so I left him, and saw him no more.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the Game plaid out?</p>
               <p>Haysler. There were about thirteen Minutes for them to play, and this Man went in and looked as sprightly as could be, and if there had been any Blows or Fighting, I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Dr. Merrick. I attended the Deceased, and found him in very strong Symptoms of a malignant Fever, which is sufficient to kill any Man without Bruises. I viewed his Body in his Life-time, and saw no Blackness upon it. Mr. Dudhill apprehended there was some Mischief about his Ribs, upon which I looked at them, and observed one Cartilage to stand hither than the rest, but I did not venture to press hard enough upon it, to see whether it was broken or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any Complaints to you?</p>
               <p>Dr. Merrick. He was rather too low to make any ; what Questions I asked about his Disorder, were rather answered by the People about him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cooper. On the 29th of October, about three in the Afternoon , coming down Ludgate-Hill, between Mr. Ashley's Door and the Rainbow Coffee-house, I was attacked by the Prisoner and 3 or 4 more. They jostled and pushed me backwards and forwards, and at last pushed my Servant from me. Then they held up my Arms, and that very Man at the Bar ran at me, in Order to take my Watch from me. He got hold of the Chain, and with the first pull he broke one of the Links of it , upon which I spoke to him, but notwithstanding that, he pull'd a second Time , and then got it , and I saw it in his Hand. He was taken presently and carried to the Watch house, and from thence to Bridewell, and before I could see him, he had chang'd his Dress.</p>
               <p>John Hall. On Lord-Mayor's Day, I was walking in Procession with the Haberdasher's Company, and just as we came to Mr. Ashley's Punch-House, I heard an Out-cry of a Pick-pocket. I saw the Prisoner stooping under the Pole of a Coach , and this Watch thrown under the Horses Legs. I took up the Watch and carried it into Mr. Ashley's, where Mr. Cooper describing it , I gave it him, and I believe it has been in his Possession ever since.</p>

            . I was standing over-against Mr. Ashley's to see the Armourer's Company go by, and heard some People cry, Stop Thief! Immediately the Prisoner try'd to push under the Pole of a Hackney Coach; I took hold of his Collar, and he made great Resistance , but a Soldier coming to my Assistance we secured him, and carried him to the Watch house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashley confirm'd Part of Mr. Hall's Evidence.</p>
               <p>Pris. Last Lord-Mayor's Day I happened to be upon Ludgate-Hill, and about 5 Minutes after the Man on Horseback was gone by, there was a Cry of Stop Thief! Presently a Man rushed by me, and that Man (Blay) said he would lay hold of me.</p>

On the 16th of October, I had been out all Day with a Fare, and made it very late at Night before I landed them at Westminster, and being late I got a Coach for them, and they left me. After this, as I was walking along to Hungerford, this Woman met me, and said, How do you do Brother Waterman? I told her I did not know her: why says she, I have seen you often enough at Westminster. She asked me to make her drink; I told her I did not care if I did; and she told me there was an Acquaintance of her's just by, where we could have a Glass of good Wine. I said Wine was too dear for Watermen; but however she carried me as far as the Hay-market, and we went into a Room, and called for a Pint of Wine. She sat down on one Chair and I on another, and when we had drank out that Pint, I was for going, but by her Persuasions I called for another. I being tir'd with sitting up so long, sat down on the Bed, and I suppose she thought I was asleep, for I had not been there 5 Minutes before she made bold to take the Handkerchief off my Neck. I had a Mind to see what she would do with me, and therefore I lay still; but presently she put her Hand in my Pocket to feel for my Money. Then I thought it Time to get up, and said I, you fancy impudent W - e, can't you be content to take my Handkerchief , and not my Money? D - your Eyes, said she, did I take your Handkerchief? that was the next Word: why I saw you, said I; D - you, said she, I took none; that was the next Word. I took 3 s. out of my Pocket, (for I had Money in both) and laid it on the Table, but her Hands were quicker than mine, and she took that too. I took hold of her, and tore her Apron out of the Gathers, and then she said she would swear her Life against me. I would not make any Disturbance in the Room, so I deliver'd her to a Watchman, and he said he knew her to be a Whore and a Thief from her Cradle, that was the next Word. They put her down the dark Hold, and took my Word till next Morning, and then we went to the Justice's, where she pull'd out 3 s one of them was Queen Ann's Shilling, and she d - d me and said, she would be merry with that. As soon as she came out of the Justice's, she shew'd her white Stockings , and said, do you think these white Stockings can walk to the Gatehouse? No, D - you, I will have a Coach; and so because she should not plague us, I gave them a Shilling to get Madam a Coach.</p>
               <p>Pris. If he found me taking his Handkerchief, why did he not take bold of me?</p>
               <p>Bigee. Because I had a Mind to lie a little longer, to see what she would do with me, for I did not know whether she would not take all my Cloaths off .</p>
