               <p>I know the prisoner; he was tried in September, 1785, for stealing a white counterpane, the property of Mr. Hill; am sure he is the same man; I was present when he was ordered to be transported.</p>

               <p>Before my time was expired, I fell into a sickness for two months, and I had a pardon on condition of transporting myself.</p>
               <p>Owen. He had a pardon on condition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100003"/>of transporting himself; he was discharged the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Court. The pardon should have been in Court that we might see the time limited.</p>
               <p>Owen. It was in twenty days.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot take parol evidence of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How came you not to go abroad? - My Lord, sickness prevented me for very near two months; I have people to prove that, but I do not know whether they are come or not.</p>
               <p>(Called but did not answer.)</p>
               <p>Court to Fagan. At whose house did he lodge? - At Mr. Gregg's, No. 15.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not expect to be tried to day.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue sick? - Near two months, and afterwards it was want of money prevented me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the single question for you to determine is, whether this man is the same man that was tried at the time stated in the indictment, which was September, 1785, and received sentence of transportation, and whether he was at large within the kingdom without any lawful cause within that time; now it is proved, that he is the same man that was tried, and received such sentence, and it is proved that he was apprehended at large before the expiration of that term; now the cause that he himself alledges, does not go to an absolute defence, even if his witnesses were here to prove it; therefore if you believe these witnesses, it proves him guilty of the charge.</p>

               <p>Court. This was one o'clock in the morning in a narrow passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to see, and distinguish faces in that passage? - I believe my Lord, as near as I can remember, the moon was at the full, it was as light as day, it was perfectly light.</p>
               <p>Could you see perfectly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long was it they were robbing you? - About two minutes, as nigh as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Which was it that produced the pistol? - The prisoner stood in front with the pistol; he was sometimes on my right hand, and sometimes in front.</p>
               <p>Who was it that said to you, d - n your eyes, hold your tongue, was it the prisoner? - This man did not swear at me, he only told me to hold my tongue; the man that swore at me, his name is Brown, he was tried here last sessions.</p>
               <p>When did you see any of these people again? - Brown was the man that clapped the pistol to my head.</p>
               <p>Who was the third man? - He was taken and admitted an evidence of the crown.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - His name is Couzens.</p>
               <p>Could you pretend to say from just seeing that man for two minutes with a pistol in his hand, and he and others threatening you with destruction at the time, in a narrow alley, by the light of the moon, can you take upon you to swear to that man's face? - I am positive sure to the man's face; I looked him directly in the face; I could distinguish the colour of a blue coat from a green coat; I had my senses so much about me, and it was so perfectly light.</p>
               <p>Was not you frightened? - I was a little frightened.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of this robbery? - I immediately after they robbed me, alarmed the watchman; I went to Bow-street, and asked after the people, and gave a description of the men at the Brown Bear.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner? - I believe it was last Saturday week in the morning.</p>
               <p>Where did you then see him? - At Justice Hyde's.</p>
               <p>I suppose he was taken up upon the information that you and Couzens had given? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Couzens was in custody then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know which of the three it was that clapped a pistol to your head, and that said they would have your money or your life? - That was Brown that was tried last session.</p>
               <p>Then Brown and the person whom you take to be the prisoner, had both pistols? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What dress had the prisoner on? - A brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Had he any surtoot coat on? - No, the third man, that is Couzens, he had a light coloured great coat on.</p>
               <p>When you went to Justice Hyde's, did you see this man among a number of people, or was he pointed out? - He was brought to the bar, and I was asked if I knew him.</p>
               <p>Do you now upon your oath say that he is the man? - Yes, I knew the man again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Last session, the gentleman had one man cast for the sake of the reward, and the man that is the evidence now, he knows very well within his own breast, that I am not the person that was concerned in the robbery, and that gentleman has perjured himself in swearing to me.</p>

               <p>Why did you say so? - I do not know what was the reason for preventing him; I told him he should not go that way, because they said so; I had no reason.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of November last, the night the Princess Amelia was buried, I and two more officers went down to Westminster, to see if we could see any people that we wanted; and just as we got to the turning from New to Old Palace-yard, after the funeral was gone in, we heard the cry of stop thief! I ran and saw the prisoner running very hastily, and the prosecutor almost close to his heels; he ran under a coach, and I ran to meet him, I laid hold of him, and the rest of the officers then came up, and laid hold of him likewise; I am sure he was the man that the prosecutor was in pursuit of; I pursued him under three or four coaches.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever lose sight of him till he was stopped by the officer? - Yes; I lost sight of the prisoner, and kept sight of Allen; I had lost sight of him before the officer pursued him, for five minutes; then they called out, Bill, Bill, that was Allen; then I got sight of him again; I never lost sight of him till he was taken; after I pursued him; I am sure he was the man that robbed me.</p>

            ; and as I say, I saw Marshall was the person that carried the cloak from me; I saw him tear it off myself, and carry it over his arm down the place where they first came from, when they first rushed upon me; the rest ran back the other way, the way that I had come; my little girl cried murder, and a man was coming past, and he ran after them but he could not catch them.</p>
               <p>Then they did not take your money at all? - Nothing farther, only took my cloak.</p>
               <p>How long might this be a passing? - I believe to the best of my knowledge it might be about a minute and a half; it was a very short time.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the prisoners before? - I had seen them at a public house.</p>
               <p>Did they know you? - They knew me well.</p>
               <p>No person passed during the time? - None; I saw five very clear, but I had not an opportunity of seeing the faces of the other three; I saw the faces of these two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Ball's Counsel. I should think from the expression you must be very much frightened, or else you would not have used the expression, you knew them? - I certainly was.</p>
               <p>You was more frightened at the knife? - I was more terrified because I knew them.</p>
               <p>How old is your little girl? - She was fourteen the 6th of last December; she is my apprentice; I have had her two years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Marshall. Ask her where she spent her evening that evening? - I spent my evening at Limehouse, with my child and apprentice girl.</p>
               <p>I suppose he means to ask you whether you have been drinking at all? - I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any of these people afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you do in consequence of this? - I knew Marshall so well that I went the next morning and had him taken up; I was certain to him.</p>
               <p>Was Marshall the only person that you charged then? - Marshall and the other; I did not recollect his name till I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Then it was against Marshall and another that you made your charge? - I said at the office that it was Marshall and a man that I knew, but I could not tell his name.</p>
               <p>How came Ball to be taken up? - I saw him at the same house, at Jones's, where I always used to see them both together in company; he was taken up at a public house; I said, that was the man. I understand that they have some witnesses that will swear false; therefore I beg you will enquire into their characters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are they going to swear about any conversation with you, who is that somebody? - One that has been subpoened, that has been persuaded to swear false, his name is Blagh; I do not see him at present.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with this Mr. Blagh about this thing? - No further than I heard him say at a public house, that Marshall's father should desire him to say that I was at his house twenty minutes after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Blagh? - He was at the door just now; as I was going down Gravel-lane after I had been spending the evening, I went past Mr. Blagh's house, Mrs. Blagh said she had had a great loss, she had lost a bushel of apples; I said, I was sorry for it.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mrs. Millard; I was with her in Farthing-fields, on the 26th of December.</p>
               <p>What happened then, mind you say nothing but what is true and what you remember? - My mistress and me were coming home and five men rushed upon my mistress, one of them said, says he, we wants money, and my mistress said, gentlemen, I know you, only spare my life, and I will give you all I have got; then one of them immediately drew a knife on my mistress, and knocked her down, and he put the knife to her throat, and I ran to some help and to get my mistress up; I screamed and called out murder; the people at the next door came to her assistance; but when they found there was somebody coming they made off; it was a neighbour from where we live that came.</p>
               <p>Of these five men that were there none of them offered to meddle with you, did they? - No, Sir, I looked back ever so many times to see if there was any body coming, but they were all upon my mistress.</p>

               <p>From your reckoning time, and your observation, was it a quarter before eleven? - That was the time upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not later in the evening? - That was the very time.</p>
               <p>Did he go out again in the course of that evening? - He did not as I saw; he must have gone through my apartment; I was up till half after eleven.</p>

               <p>Court. How many people might lodge at your house at that time? - We have three or four lodgings to let; we let the apartment to Ball's mother; she took the apartment; different people lived in the other apartment; one Mr. Gill had one of the apartments.</p>

               <p>What reason have you then for being so particular to this night to swear to a quarter of an hour? - I have very great reason, because I was waiting for my husband to come home; the watchman always calls the half hour.</p>
               <p>But not the quarter? - I was waiting for my husband to come home, for I always go to shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>What night was this that he came home a quarter before eleven? - The 26th.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the 26th? - Because it was the Tuesday night.</p>


               <p>But there was a Tuesday the 19th you know; are you sure it was not that Tuesday that was the 19th? - No, I am sure it was the Tuesday after Christmas day, for this night his mother and I were talking by the fire, and she was waiting for him to come in.</p>

            ; I was up stairs there the same night; it was boxing night; I saw the father and mother and son all together; I went to beg a bit of candle of his wife, I was short of candle, I did not stay long; when I went out, the father shut the door, and bid me a good night; the son was in the room the same time.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to the son? - Yes, I spoke to the son, and they all bid me a good night, and they shut the door, and I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after ten? - That I cannot tell to a minute or two, I believe rather before ten.</p>
               <p>When did you hear of his being taken up? - The next morning.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - My husband is a coal-heaver, and works upon the river; I have three small children; I take care of my children.</p>
               <p>When you heard of his being taken up the next morning, you recollected that he was at home at ten the night before? - Yes, Sir, or rather before ten, about a quarter.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it to the father or mother of this lad, that it could not be him, because he was at home at ten the night before, or did you go to the Justices to tell him? - I went to no Justice at all.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not tell the father and mother? - No, Sir, they knew I was in the room, and saw him there; he sent for me; I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so sure that it was a little before ten? - My children come home about eight; I am some time getting them their supper, and getting them to bed; it was half after nine when my children went to bed.</p>
               <p>Have you any clock? - No, but as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the watchman go? - I heard no watchman, because I live down an alley, what I think is upon my judgment, it was nigh hand ten o'clock as nigh as I can guess; I know nothing at all of the young man, only they have lived in the house about nine or ten weeks; we are no acquaintance; I have a great deal to do, to mind my three children.</p>
               <p>Did you put his father and mother in mind you had been in the room the night before? - I thought nothing about it, I was very sorry.</p>
               <p>How came you to come here to tell this story? - I told the father and mother that I saw the young fellow in the room with them; I told them that two or three days after he was taken up, and I told them several times when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Did you go to tell them this, or did they come to ask you? - I went and told them myself.</p>
               <p>When did you tell them? - I cannot tell rightly, I believe a day or two after, I cannot justly say; I told them in my apartment, the mother came in to light a candle.</p>

               <p>What did you hear it strike? - It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100013"/>between nine and ten; I heard the clock strike nine, and after that he came in; I did not go to bed till past ten; I bolted the door, and he was up stairs in his father's room at that hour, and I heard the clock strike ten, St. George's clock in the highway; I am the very man that bolted the door a few minutes after ten; I was the last up.</p>
               <p>Does this young man pass through your apartment? - No, there is the stairs that take him up, he does not come through my room.</p>
               <p>How did you see him? - My door is withinside the street door; I saw him come in and go up stairs; I was in my own apartment, and I opened the door to see who it was, and I heard him go up to his father's apartment, up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so particular about this 26th of December? - Because it was a boxing day, and I thought I would stay up till all the three families were in; I was not out all day.</p>
               <p>What time did he come in on the Monday evening? - I cannot tell that; I do not know whether he was out all that day; I was particular this evening, because I was up to see him.</p>
               <p>Was not you up on the Monday? - On Monday I did not see him; I left my own door open, when I saw him go up stairs, and I shut the street door, and bolted it to go to bed; that was about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my opinion, after he came in, it was about a quarter after ten; he came in between nine and ten; my room door was open to see if any body was going out again.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to think any body was going out again? - No, I had no reason at all.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else to come in? - No, they were all come in, I staid up till such time I thought they were all settled to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Was it a practice for your lodgers to go out again after that time? - They do sometimes go out.</p>
               <p>Did you ever in your lifetime do that before? - No, but I did it for fear they should go out, and I should have to get up to let them in; I do sometimes keep my door open to see if they go out again; I remember it because it was a boxing night; I know

               <p>All that I know is this, that the night after Christmas night, Mrs. Millard was at my house when I went home, which was about half an hour, or forty minutes after ten; I cannot say to a few minutes, and she stopped there some time, and asked me to have something to drink; she went home, and as soon as she was gone, the watchman went past eleven, that is all I know about it; I keep a fish shop, and green stall; she was at my house when I went home, which was forty minutes after ten.</p>
               <p>You do not know how long she had been there before? - No, I found her there; she stood when I came home against the counter in the shop; I have known her for some years; I was acquainted so far as in business.</p>
               <p>Who was with her in the shop when you went in? - My wife and my two children.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - Not to my knowledge, only people coming in occasionally in the shop to buy what they wanted.</p>
               <p>She had nobody with her? - No person that I know of.</p>
               <p>You did not see an apprentice girl with her? - Oh, I ask pardon, I did see one child, that I forgot.</p>
               <p>What was the conversation that passed between you? - That she would treat me with a drop of something to drink; and my wife says to her, another time will do as well, for my husband wants none, and I do not; she took some money out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100014"/>her pocket, in order to send for something for me to drink; some of the money dropped on the floor; my wife lighted her to pick it up; she went out of the house directly, and I went to bed; this was all that passed.</p>
               <p>This is a very small matter to take up twenty minutes in passing? - That is all I know.</p>
               <p>How long do you think she might be in the shop before she went away? - About ten or fifteen minutes, I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>How long was it after she went that you heard the watchman? - Just as she got out of the door, he went eleven.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to you to be in liquor? - I cannot decide upon that, to be sure any person might drop money through their fingers.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to be in liquor? - Not to my knowledge; I have known her many years, both on the other side of the water and this; what she drinks, I cannot pretend to say; I heard of this robbery, it was two days after my wife had half a a bushel of apples stolen out of the window; it is a place that there is no scarce of robberies there, my Lord.</p>
               <p>But when you heard of this robbery being committed before eleven, you knew it could not be? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon you to swear with positiveness, that the watchman was going past eleven? - If they are erroneous, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Might not the watchman be calling half past ten? - If they do not do their duty; the watchman said past eleven, I was sitting on the bedside when I first heard him.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me you heard the watchman as she was going out of the door? - I was sitting on the bed instead of a chair, before she went out.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner Marshall? - Yes, by sight, I have known him about three months, by going to the house where he used, but no particular acquaintance; I never saw any harm of him in my life.</p>

               <p>Is the door you speak of the street door? - Yes, he came by my door; I did not know the prisoner; but I knew he was not any of Mr. Mitchell's lodgers, and therefore I took notice of him; he went up Perkins's-rents to go up Peter-street; so I thought to myself when he got to the watch box, I would have him stopped, because seeing a man on the other side of the way I was afraid of speaking, and then I saw him coming back with the two patrols; they brought him back, and I said, he had taken them out of that house; he went into the yard with me, and shewed the patrols where he had taken the things, and pushed up the window, and wanted to put the things in at the window again; I went and fetched Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell from her mother's, and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you first of all make him any promise? - Not previous to that confession, but afterwards I promised to shew him lenity if he would confess: the first confession that Boot made was, that there were some whole pieces of Irish stole; he said he had stole a whole piece of Irish, and given it to Jenny; in consequence, I went down into the kitchen, and she acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Upon this first examination, what did he say? - I asked him how long it was since the first cloth was stole, and he acknowledged there had been a whole piece of cloth stole, and that he had given a piece to Jenny; I went down to her, and she said there was a whole piece of cloth, and something else in her room, and if I would go with her, she would shew it to me; I believe she said that John had stole it, and given it to her; I went up stairs with her into the room; in searching the bed, before I observed that one side of the bed was open, and I took out a whole piece of Irish, part of a piece of callico, and part of a piece of swan skin, cut off the piece; she said it was distress that had driven her to it; she had two children, and was not capable of maintaining them.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you made any promise to her, or the other? - After some time; I got Mr. Fletcher from the Rotation office to come to our house, and he examined them separately; I took care they never should get together; and after examining them for some time, we made them a promise of lenity on their confession.</p>
               <p>Court. We must not have any thing mentioned after this confession was made? - It is impossible for me to tell the particular time when that promise was made, it was after Mr. Fletcher had examined them some time; the only promise that was made, he told them if they would confess, it was in my power to shew them mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. If there is a doubt about the time, I shall not receive it? - I am not positive sure as to the time the promise was made.</p>
               <p>What were those pieces of Irish worth that he owned at first he had taken, and given to the prisoner Edwards? - Twenty-five yards cost three shillings and nine-pence a yard, worth upwards of four pounds; he owned that he gave that to

               <p>Down to this time, you had reason to suppose her an honest woman? - I had no reason to suppose either of them otherwise, till I found them so.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that this woman old you she had some family, is that true? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100024"/>I believe she has three children instead of two, all of them young.</p>

               <p>Was the hinges of it sound or not? - I do not know that it was, I believe it was not; she opened it with a key.</p>
               <p>How long had the man lived with you? - Near eleven months.</p>
               <p>Do you know a woman of the name of Charlton? - I have seen her, she lived with a lady in Portland-road; she was not a servant of our's; the prisoner was a porter, he had business in the shop; the woman was a maid of all work; we have a nursery maid beside.</p>

               <p>What sort of a shop was it? - Upon my word I can hardly tell you; it was a shop of every thing, rags, old iron, old shoes, &amp;c. I went back with the constable, and found three pair more, which were nine pair; I found two pair of children's shoes; they were crammed into the window, so that I did not see them before; Davis was there; he went away to get a constable for me for robbing the house as he called it, and I saw no more him, till I saw him the next day before the Justice;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100026"/>I staid there some considerable time, two hours for ought I know; a servant of Davis's took the shoes away by the constable's order; I do not know who she was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the same shoes that you saw in the shop? - Yes, I am confident they are; there is my own handwriting on them, which was before the shoes were made; my hand-writing was in a part of the shoe, which was visible to any body; there is a pair of shoes of the name of Robinson; we always write the name of every gentleman's bespoke shoes, and I know the others by different marks; I am quite confident of it.</p>
               <p>Did Ford say what you and he were come about? - Ford told me where the shoes were; he said nothing about the price of them before Davis.</p>
               <p>What are these shoes worth a pair? - They are different shoes, of different value, I really cannot pretend to say the value of them; those that I marked Robinson, we should have sold for seven shillings as bespoke work.</p>
               <p>What would the others have sold for? - I look upon it my master gave fifty or fifty-three shillings a dozen for them, that is about four shillings and sixpence a pair.</p>
               <p>What did Ford say he sold them for? - Some he said he sold for two shillings a pair, some for half a crown, some for three shillings; he made a variation of the prizes all the way through.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Davis's Counsel. Mr. Lowry keeps a very large retail shop? - Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>All bespoke work in this town is marked very much in the same way? - Very often.</p>

               <p>When it is not bespoke work, I believe it is usual to write the name of the man to whom the work is delivered out? - No, we do not.</p>
               <p>When you went to this man's shop, you pitched upon several articles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were hanging up publicly in the shop? - They were hanging upon nails, and two pair under some rags in the window.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to say they were concealed there? - They were under some covering in the window, whether they were concealed or not, it is unknown to me.</p>

               <p>Was the window a front window, or a back window? - It was a front window.</p>
               <p>Was there writing in the other shoes as well as those of Mr. Robinson's? - No, there are different marks, numbers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Are these town made shoes? - Some are, and some are country.</p>
               <p>Now were any of the marks you found in the shoes disguised or altered at all? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Look now, and tell me if they are altered? - Not that I directly see.</p>
               <p>Then look at them and tell us? - I do not see that they are.</p>
               <p>If they had been walked upon for an hour; or rubbed in the kennel, you would not have known them? - No, I do not know that I should.</p>
               <p>If the name had been struck through, you would not have known them? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know how long it is since these shoes, particularly Mr. Robinson's, were lost? - That is impossible to say.</p>
               <p>Is it within five, six, or seven months? I will answer for it, it is within seven months.</p>
               <p>You took the woman to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Davis was at large? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know how he came there? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Davis acknowledged to buying all the shoes before the Magistrate, when the Magistrate committed him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Tell us all that he said about it? - I do not know any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Why did not he say that he had no idea they were stolen? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did not he say that he gave a fair price for them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100027"/>Did not you keep a public house, and serve the office of a thief-taker? - I kept a public house, I never was a thief-taker, I was a constable; I marked them at the bottom with figures: when Davis said he bought them at a fair price, I told him that the man that sold them to him, brought them on the Sunday afternoon, and they were not finished.</p>
               <p>Did not he say that the man said he would sell them for the leather, and give him the price? you did not lose all these things at a time? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you had known Davis before? - Yes, I knew him when he lived in Eagle-street, years ago; he is a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he gave for these shoes? - He said for some of them he gave four shillings and sixpence a pair, and the man contradicted him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Suppose I was a distressed shoe-maker, I must sell my shoes; it is as much as they are worth, if a man was to make a present of his labour? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say you do not recollect that he said I am distressed for money, I will let you have them for the value of the leather? - I do not remember that they did say so; they sent for me down, and a woman said if five guineas was an object, it should not be wanted; I said I would prosecute.</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker; I work for the prosecutor; on the 18th of December, by Mr. Lowry's desire, I stopped the prisoner Ford in the street; and on searching him, I found two pair of shoes on him, one pair under his waistcoat next his shirt, and the other were in his breeches; they were two pair of children's shoes; I took them from him; I was in Davis's shop, but I went to fetch a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ford. I took eight pair, and some I got half a crown a pair for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. Please to ask him who he sold them to, for he never sold them to me.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner Ford. Who did you sell them to? - I sold them to that man.</p>
               <p>Davis. He never sold them to me except two pair for four shillings and sixpence, and another pair for three shillings and sixpence; my wife had been deceased about sixteen weeks, during the greatest part of that time before her death, I was out of the way of my business, and she conducted it; she died suddenly, and it worked so much on my spirits, that I was out of the way; and other people used to buy and sell, for I could hardly bear the place; I lost a worthy woman, and when I lost her, I lost all: I acknowledge I bought two pair of him; he told me they were his own property; he said he worked for his own customers, and sometimes he made up shoes for the shops; he said he was to have seven shillings for them; I told him I sold second hand, as well as new, so that we must buy them as reasonable as we could, not to under-value them; the first I bought of him was that pair at four shillings and sixpence, and I looked upon them as his own property; I questioned him many times over, and was loth to buy; he desired only the money that the stuff cost, because he was in necessity.</p>

               <p>I was housekeeper to the prisoner Davis; I lived with him three months; since his wife died, I conducted the business in a good measure; I recollect at first of my coming to Mr. Davis, a man came in with a pair of of shoes to sell; Mr. Davis asked him if they were his, and he said they were, he made them; he asked him, are you a craft? he said yes; then he asked him what he asked for them, he told him seven shillings; he said he could not think of giving him so much; he said he was to have seven shillings if they had fitted, as they misfitted, he must sell them for what he could now, as he was very much distressed; Mr. Davis says, well what is the lowest you can think of taking, for I cannot think of giving you that, I have very little call for such things; he said you must give me what you can afford; Mr. Davis asked me for one shilling, and I gave him one shilling and sixpence; then Davis took four shillings and sixpence, and laid it upon the counter; the man took the money, and laid down the shoes; Mr. Davis hung them upon a nail, and said, there, God knows when I shall get my money for them; they were publicly shewn, they were never covered to my knowledge; there was no disguise or concealment; when Mr. Sanders; and the other came, I was up stairs; they took me to the watch-house; my master went to see for a constable, and some time after he came to me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>During three months that you have known him, has he been a fair dealing honest man, or has he been a receiver of stolen goods? - Sir, I have known him three years; my child has been apprentice to him three years; he was more like a father than a master, and his deceased wife was like a mother.</p>
               <p>Court. How came the other shoes into the shop? - I do not know Sir; there was a niece of his was with him for a time; she laid out his money.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I certainly gave this note to Mr. Ball, but as for forging of it, or knowing it to be false, I totally deny; and there is no writing belonging to me but what is on the back; I was appointed <rs id="t17870110-15-deflabel85" type="occupation">surgeon</rs>

               <p>Who is the man that brought you the bill? - He sailed for Jamaica the day after Christmas day.</p>
               <p>Then you have no witnesses here to prove that, have you any body to give you a character? - Mr. Ball frequently repeated that he would not hurt me; there was a Mr. Robinson, an apothecary, present at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is this true? - I said, I would shew him as much lenity as possibly I could.</p>
               <p>Was that before he had confessed he had written the bill? - No, after he confessed.</p>
               <p>Are you positive of that? - I think it was after he confessed.</p>
               <p>Court. The constable ought to have been here who was present.</p>

               <p>Tell us the conversation that passed between Ball and the prisoner in your hearing? - When we came into the room, the prisoner was at dinner; Mr. Ball said, Mr. Moffart, you have served me pretty well, to give me such a note as this, I had like to have been taken into custody upon it myself; the prisoner said to him, aye, aye! I am sorry for that; I think Ball mentioned the name of Mr. Peters, that he had been to him, and he denied knowing any thing of the note, and said, that it was a forged note; well, says the prisoner, if it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100031"/>is so, then I must pay you your money again; says Ball, says he, I would not wish to hurt you, but I cannot lose my money; and be like to come to trouble into the bargain; so that you must not be out of custody till it is decided some way; with that the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner; this was all that passed at that time; then I took the prisoner with me and Ball to St. Ann's watch-house; and in the way as we went along, Ball says to the prisoner, who wrote the indorsement on the back of the note? to let him know who was the man, and whether he could not be found; the prisoner said, it was no matter, he could not blame any body for it, but himself; that he wrote it himself.</p>
               <p>That was in answer to the question who wrote the indorsement? - Yes, as we went along a little further, he said, he had done it through want of money; and that he should have money in a few days to pay it.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was the indorsement that Ball asked him who wrote? - Yes, he asked him that question going along from the prisoner's lodgings.</p>


               <p>The question was not who wrote the note, or who wrote the acceptance; but who wrote the indorsement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner at any time say any more about who wrote the rest of the note? - I understood him by what he said, that he meant it was himself wrote it, but he did not say so downright.</p>
               <p>His answer, whatever it was, was in answer to the question who wrote the indorsement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had the prosecutor promised him any favour in your hearing? - He said, he wanted nothing but his own, and to get rid of it; and he wanted to get no disgrace about it; and that he thought it was a good note when he gave it him.</p>
               <p>Did he make any other promise? - He said, he did not want to hurt him, if he could but get at his own; with that the prisoner gave the prosecutor directions to go to his brother that lived down in Westminster, I forget the street; this conversation was at the watch-house, and the other was going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Are your witnesses here now? - Yes, my Lord, all that I expected to come are here.</p>

             was tried for forging a bill of exchange, thirty days after date, also for forging two indorsements; there was no doubt on the evidence, as to the fact of forging, but Mr. Baldwin objected that the instrument was not a bill of exchange, because there was no stamp upon it, for want of which it would be waste paper, by the late stamp act: it was argued that the stamp act was merely a revenue law, and did not purport in any way to alter the crime of forgery; that the instrument was a false one, and had the semblance of a good bill of exchange; the objection was over-ruled; but as this was a new case, the Court yielded to the request of the prisoner's counsel, and left it to the Judges: on the 1st day of Easter Term, 1783, the objection was over-ruled by all the Judges.</p>
               <p>Court. We are certainly bound by this opinion to over rule the objection taken by the prisoner; but there is a question may arise, whether it can be a forgery upon a note on the face of it void? I shall therefore take the verdict of the Jury; if they are of opinion that he is guilty, subject to the opinion of the Judges, and shall consequently respite judgment.</p>

C. I was not sure whether he said Crandy, or Granby; then by that mark answering, I thought he was an honest man; looking further into the bundle, I saw another tied up in a silk handkerchief; he said there was a jacket and a great coat; I did not examine it then, but he said there is a goose, I saw there was one, I let it lie; we put in the things into his bag, and tied them up, to examine him again in the morning, and discharge him; I asked him how he came by that goose; he said his master passed him on the road about forty miles from London in a diligence, and his master brought this goose, and told him to put it into the bottom of the sack, and put them in the waggon; I asked him if he knew London; he said not much, but he had been there; he said his master's name was one Lester's Esq; in Warwick-lane; he did not know where to find it; he said, his master promised to meet him at a new house, that was building for a public house, and there he would convey him to his own home: our suspicious were most on account of the great cloth; I went out and left him in the watch-house; I returned in about an hour, and the prosecutor had been there on horseback enquiring after a bundle; the next morning I saw the prosecutor; I detained the prisoner and the sack till the morning; I then took him to the Rotation-office, Clerkenwell-green, with the bundle; and the waggoner swore to the things.</p>

            , of Hendon; on the night of the 4th of November, I went to bed a little after eleven; I shut up my shop myself a little after eleven; I fastened the windows, and bolted the two bolts of the door, and put up the bars; my husband asked me if I was sure I had put up the bar; I said, I thought I was perfectly sure; but I went back to see, and all was secure; the next morning I arose a little before seven; I was the first person up, and I found the fastenings of the door quite undone from the inside; they appeared not to be undone but broke; the shutters were as I left them, but the pins being turned round, the keys were at the top instead of the bottom; they might turn the pin round on the outside, but being a spring key, it would not come out; the shutters were in the same state, excepting the holes bored; the pannels of the door are here: in this hole there is room for a man to put in his arm, and by that they could unfasten the bolts, and by the top hole they could lift the bar off.</p>
               <p>So that these two holes commanded all the fastenings and the door? - Yes, Sir, they did.</p>
               <p>What did you lose? - Thirty pieces of printed cotton, more than an hundred and fifty yards together, of the value of thirty pounds; a small quantity of printed linen, some muslin, some coloured silk handkerchiefs, striped dimity, plain cotton, diaper table cloths, some new women's shoes, a piece of silk handkerchiefs, and other things.</p>

               <p>Court. I suppose it was light when you got up in the morning? - Yes, it was; it was seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses examined separate at the desire of the prisoners.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Waddle. What may be the value of all the things that you have lost? - About an hundred pounds, as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>I went with the other officer; and in Franklin's house I found a loaded pistol, and a dark lanthorn, which was in a cupboard under the stairs upon some coals, and some pick-lock keys; here are the pistol, the keys, and the lanthorn, and here is a bullet mould, which I found there.</p>
               <p>Have you compared that bullet mould with the other five balls? - I was present, and saw it compared, and they fit exactly; the pistol was loaded with a ball; I have not got the ball.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether the pistol was loaded with a ball made in that mould? - No, my Lord, I do not.</p>
               <p>Are these pick-lock keys? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter; I live at Hendon; I repaired Mr. Waddle's door after the robbery; I took out these two pannels, and put in another.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at these gimblets, and this saw, and tell us if you observe the mark of such gimblets? - This hole was bored round with a small instrument and not a saw.</p>
               <p>Tell us if you observe the marks of these gimblets? - This gimblet answers the size of the hole; the holes are all bored with one gimblet; they might have been bored with a smaller one first for the sake of preventing the noise; but the large one is introduced afterwards; a gimblet is the last instrument that has been used in boring; these pannels are in the same state they were when I took them out of Mr. Waddle's door.</p>
               <p>Court. One of these gimblets answers to born the pannels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there is nothing particular that you have made any observation on only that one? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Waddle. Look at this muslin handkerchief? - Here is a mark upon this which is No. 15; that is my hand writing, a private mark.</p>
               <p>Then from that you are enabled to swear it was your property? - I am; I lost such a one that night; I have no doubt of its being mine.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Jury, marked with a pencil No. 15.)</p>
               <p>Court. Look at this other muslin handkerchief? - This I have had a great while in my shop; being very much out of the square, and I could not dispose of it; there is no mark that I can swear to so punctually, as I can to the handkerchief being so out of the square, and so many times passing through my fingers, that I have no doubt of it; I lost it that night.</p>
               <p>Look at these linens, and cottons, and tell us if you lost any of these patterns? - I lost of these three patterns, none of this; one was seven yards, what there were in the others I cannot justly say; but I am sure I lost of all these three patterns; and I lost a quantity of corded dimity like this; the mark has been taken off of this; this is a muslin neck handkerchief which has no mark on; but I lost of this pattern and quality; and I lost some such neck handkerchiefs as these; one of these handkerchiefs which was found on Franklin's neck I have very great reason to believe was mine; I have the fellow handkerchief to it in my pocket, the size I dare say will answer one with another; this was one that I had taken for my own use, and it had not been washed. (Compared, corresponding in quality, and pattern and size.) I have no doubt at all but I lost this the evening of the robbery; the other handkerchief found on the prisoner Drudge does not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no mark then on that handkerchief that was found on Franklin? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Shallard. Was the handkerchief made when you found it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jealous. I took Baker on the 28th; his wife said, it was her apartment, and she let it to these young people; Baker was taken in Turnmill-street; I only know it was his house by what she said; she acknowledged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100048"/>him to be her husband; and there were men's clothes in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Mrs. Waddle. Do you know any of those people? - I have seen them before passing about.</p>
               <p>How lately before your house was broke open? - I cannot say; Mrs. Buck's father and mother live at Hendon, about half a mile from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see all the three prisoners in company together at Hendon? - No, I have seen them occasionally in the neighbourhood passing; I do not recollect seeing them in company together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Franklin. Did you ever say that both these handkerchiefs came off one piece? - No, I never did; I said, I thought it was mine; but I should be able to say with certainty when I brought the other piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Which of us did you see at Hendon? - I said, some of you.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever see of them women at Hendon? - I have seen Mrs. Buck at my shop.</p>
               <p>Is she a married woman or no? - I do not know, she calls herself so; I never saw the others at Hendon; Mrs. Buck has been <rs id="t17870110-31-deflabel167" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>I took a room of Mr. Baker at half a crown a week; I had a bed, a couple of chairs, and a table, and a fire place; and these five bullets were laying about the room; the plaisterers were there at the same time; I had been there six weeks.</p>
               <p>Jealous. This iron crow was found in Franklin's room; Baker's wife said, she let out the apartments to these people.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Baker ever claim any property in the man's clothes that were found there? - No, he never was taken back to that house if it was his.</p>

               <p>I was present at Bow-street when Baker was brought; Mr. Addington asked him if that house was his, the first house, and how long he had lived there, and what rent he paid; he said, he took it of Mr. Smith the tobacconist, at the corner of the court, last Michaelmas, and paid eight pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about Franklin's house? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAKER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Beeston and Drudge lodged in my house, and paid me their rent; they always kept good hours; I have worked for Mr. Duncan of Islington, better than a year and a half; I expected him here to clear my character.</p>

               <p>My Lord, they have charged me with things that I know nothing at all about; and they took the things out of my house, belonging to other people; I wish to send for two or three genteel people to speak for me.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Buck. My Lord, I am humbly obliged to you for your advice, but I can bring people to my character.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and bedstead maker at Hatton-wall; the prisoner brought two pieces of mahogany to me on the 12th of December; I thought it had been later in the month; when I was before the Lord Mayor, it was about seven o'clock in the evening; they were three inches square, and seven feet and a half long; the prisoner was the man; he brought a part the night before, which we bought of him; they were smaller a great deal, and his bringing another part made us suspect him; I asked the prisoner how he came by those pillars; at first he said, honestly; I insisted on knowing more particularly; he then said, I hope you will not hurt me; I said, not if you come honestly by them; if not you shall certainly take the consequence; he then said, that a man he worked for, of the name of Chamberlain, in Ratcliffe-highway, No. 34, owed him some money for wages, and had given them to him; I told him I knew the person that lived there, and it could not be there; then he said, it must be 36; I wrote it down, and he said, that was right; he said, he should bring this person the next morning to prove what he said; he never afterwards came to me; I never saw him after till he was taken up; he had worked before at a yard opposite me; I found he worked for Mr. Seddon much about that time; I called at Mr. Seddon's, but the prisoner was not present; the mahogany was marked by Mr. Covington; I saw W. C. upon it before the Lord Mayor; I did not see him mark it.</p>
               <p>At the time this mahogany was sent to Mr. Seddon's had you more pieces of the length of seven feet and a half in your yard? - Yes, a great many pieces of the same length but not of the same width; this was Spanish wood, which is clearer in the grain; there was a figure of 4, a figure of 3, a figure of 2, and a figure of 1; I did not buy them; I do not know of my own knowledge that they were bought; only seeing them stand in the passage; he afterwards described to me where he had them from.</p>

               <p>Is the 4 yours? - No, that is not mine; the 3 and 1/2 is; I swear to the writing, but not to the wood; we never sell the piece with the marks on, nor never send them out to be manufactured, we have manufactured for many years in our own house.</p>

               <p>Court to Seddon. Did this man ever work for you at any time? - He came the pay day, a day or two before I took him up; I am informed he worked for me two or three days in the place of a man that was sick.</p>

I heard somebody say, you must go down into Castle-street; she said she knew nobody there; she said he had been robbing her; I heard a bustle in the passage; she immediately called out, three or four times, Mr. Robinson! I jumped out of bed and opened my door, and went into the passage, and I saw the prisoner and her struggling against the street door, and the street door was shut; I then went and laid hold of the prisoner, and brought him into my place; we searched him, but found nothing; she went down, and came up again, and said she was robbed; she then went back and fetched in the bag; I took the prisoner into my room; I did not see where the bag lay; I live in the parlour; I took him to the round-house; he wished me to go to his wife, to let her know; he said he lived in Tennis-court, Middle-row, Holborn, No. 1.

               <p>My wife goes out to wash, and takes in washing, and she was to go to wash in Castle-street, No. 3, and the child was taken very ill, and not expected to live; she could not go out, and she sent me, and I met a woman that I knew, and she said she did not know such a woman; as we were talking together, a man came out of this door and she says, ask that man; he said yes, she lives in the kitchen backwards; he left the door wide open; I went in as far as the passage, I called at the top of the stairs, and asked if any one was below, nobody answered; I turned back, and this woman was standing at the door; says I, you are wanted, my wife wants you; she fell a searching me, I had nothing in my pocket but a handkerchief; she took it out.</p>

               <p>Did you see it fall from him? - No, I did not; it was down between him and me in a minute.</p>
               <p>Had it been there before? - No, I am positive sure it was not there before: it was dirty, and fell down between his shoes and mine; it is a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say with certainty that that fell from him? - I cannot say any further than as we were both together this lay between us, and I observed something under his jacket when I caught him by the collar; there was nobody else in the alley as I could see.</p>

               <p>About half after five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner Usher standing, and when I returned he stood in the same place; I stood about ten minutes, and he walked backwards and forwards, and looked in, and now and then put his elbow against the window; then there came by some drays, and then he crossed the way to the other, whom I had seen opposite, and I heard him whistle for him; he then stood about three minutes, and then Allen crossed over to the shop, and Usher stood in his place, and Allen likewise walked backwards and forwards two or three times, looking in at the window; then a waggon came past and he knocked in the window, and took out five pair of stockings, and put them under his left arm; I saw him do it; I ran to stop him, and I could not, he ran too fast; I cried out stop thief; and immediately Mr. Hanwell's man came up and took him; then Usher ran after Allen, and I took hold of him also.</p>
               <p>Before this, did you see the prisoners talking together? - Yes, Sir, I did; but I did not know what they talked about; they might be about three or four minutes together; I did not see him drop them.</p>

               <p>In consequence of that request note; did you give that permit? - I did.</p>
               <p>Who did you deliver the permit to? - To the prisoner, who is the officer, who brought the request note.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100066"/>When did you see the prisoner again? - Not that night; I saw him again the next morning; he came between seven and eight the next morning into the office; he then took the permit out of his waistcoat pocket, and said, he had carried that permit to Bolton's last night, but they had altered their minds, and would not send out the goods till the next morning; he then said, I wish you would write another and I will take it down to Bolton's, and give it to Claridge; I then took the note, and told him there was some before, they must stay till their turn; the prisoner said, then give me your foreign book, and I will write it; in the hurry of business any officer makes out permits; he sat down and wrote, but before that, he says, which is the file where the note is? I said, this is the file; because says he, I shall alter the day of the month, from the 1st to the 2d; this is the request note, it stood the 1st when I wrote it, and now there is the number 2 over the No. 1; when he had done that, he sat down and wrote, and cut the permit out of the book, and I saw the permit in his hand; this is the permit book in which it is wrote; he then said he would return the permit which I had granted the day before, and write another; when it is wrote it is cut out of the permit book; he returned my permit and signed it.</p>
               <p>Where is that? - When he signed it, I had nothing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>Look at that book? - Here is the word return in this permit book, which the prisoner wrote himself, upon the checque that I granted at first, the prisoner in his own hand writing has written returned; the prisoner himself kept that permit; it was his business to keep it after he had wrote returned upon it; he said he was going to Bolton's, and he would take the permit with him, and give it to Claridge; he cut out the permit after he had filled it up, and I saw the permit in his hand; I saw him write in my book; this is the permit; this is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Is that agreeable to that checque of the 2d of March? - It is; both the counter part and the permit are of the prisoner's hand writing; I know the prisoner very well, he has been in the office seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the same place? - Three years.</p>
               <p>It is not usual for the stocking officer to assist in granting permits? - Very often in the hurry of business.</p>
               <p>I believe it is often usual for the trader to apply to the stocking officer to get a permit for him? - Very often.</p>
               <p>A trader some times sends his porter or any body to the office, with a request note for a permit? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is a railing that divides you from the person that comes to apply? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He delivers in his request note? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he is seen through the rail, sometimes he sticks it on the rails, and asks how long will it be? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The permit writer is governed by the request note, and then looks at the credit book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I would ask you, if it does not frequently happen, that persons who are unknown to the permit writers, bring these request notes? - They say they come from such a trader and this is the note, and how long will it be before it is done.</p>
               <p>Very often they are porters, or persons that you do not personally know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you or any body may be deceived in that way? - They may.</p>
               <p>Suppose any body should send a porter to the permit office, whom you do not know, but with a request note, you look at the credit book, and you grant the permit, though you do not know the person that brought the request note? - I do.</p>
               <p>On the 1st of March you had granted a permit of this very quantity of liquor from Bolton's? - I had, which Leslie came back and said it had never been out of his possession; there was an entry made of returned, and it could not be made out after that.</p>
               <p>Is not the permit which you have produced upon the proper excise paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100067"/>If the request note was a good one, and had been really Mrs. Bolton's request note, then this permit was perfectly regular, was it not? - It was.</p>
               <p>It was properly filled up, and properly signed, and perfectly regular, the only doubt was about the request note? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe it sometimes happens that a porter or trader, delivers to the stocking officer the request note; and then the stocking officer having communication with the office, he delivers it to the office and gets the permit? - He does sometimes.</p>
               <p>Who keeps the credit book? - It is in the permit book as a guide to the permit writer.</p>
               <p>Have you got the credit book here? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Does your permit differ from the permit in question, in any other respect than the day of the month? - No, it is exactly the same; he said he should only alter the day of the month from the 1st to the 2d.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a former instance of a request note, signed by this Bolton to Hardy, No. 66; see if that is your hand writing? - (Looks at it.) - It is my hand writing; I cannot say who brought this; this is a request note of

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surveyor of the excise; the prisoner was an officer under me.</p>
               <p>Was it his duty to stock Mrs. Bolton? - It was, he was the stocking officer of that division.</p>
               <p>Tell the Court what you know of this transaction? - I went up into the permit office, some time from the 2d of March to the 13th of April, I cannot pretend to say what day, to examine the notes; when I went up, Leslie the prisoner followed me up; I asked for the file where the notes were filed on; it was given to me, and I found a request note, dated the 1st of March originally, and a figure of 2 was made over it; the 1 was not put out; I made a query on it; the prisoner acknowledged that he altered it; I told him it might be attended with bad consequences; I rebuked him; he said he could not think there could be much harm in altering the note; I told him it would be well for him if it did not; then I left the permit office, and went about my usual business; on the 13th of April, I compared Leslie's permits which he had taken up at different houses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you got them here? - No.</p>
               <p>Then we must not hear of them as they are not evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is become of the permits? - They are lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If they were here, I should submit they are no evidence in this case? - In examining these permits, Leslie read in to me 129 gallons to Mrs. Bolton.</p>
               <p>Court. Give us some more account about reading in? - He compared the books; I had the stock book in my hand; and he had the permits; and he read to me 129 gallons into Mrs. Bolton's stock; I do not know whether he particularly mentioned Dunnage's stock then; we were examining every body's stock, and this was in the course of the reading.</p>
               <p>What did you suppose him reading from? - I supposed him reading from a permit; I remarked the quantity; says I, let me look at that permit; says he, it is no matter, it is no permit at all; then he said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100068"/>had lost the permit; I told him if he had lost it, I suspected it was no permit at all; he shewed me the paper; this is the paper; I was going to make a memorandum of it; he said he would save me that trouble, for there was no such permit ever came, and that nobody knew any thing about the matter but himself.</p>
               <p>What was to be the effect of your memorandum? - In order to go and search if such a permit was ever granted from Dunnage or not; from his stock; in consequence of this after he declared that to me; I told him I should go and take Mrs. Bolton's stock; it was read into me as so much stock posted to her credit from Dunnage; he begged I would not go and take Mrs. Bolton's stock; he said if I did go, that it was all over with him, or words to that effect; and he threw down the book on the desk; he requested me to let him go to Claridge to get the increase out of the way, for I should find about 20 gallons increase; Claridge is the cellarman to Mrs. Bolton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I desire the Court will give me leave to ask a question, to see whether any part of this history that we have had applies; when was the whole of this written? Was it produced to you in that state at the time that he produced it to you? - It was.</p>
               <p>What is meant by the words 16th of March? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Does that appear to be the date of the permit upon which the quantity had been removed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Does not that paper import that the removal was on the 16th of March? - I do not know what that was for at all; his books were lost, so that I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He told you there was no such permit? - He did; I told him I never should agree to any such thing; and he run away to Mrs. Bolton's; he was rather in the house before me; he had got down into the cellar; I went down after him, and went into the cellar, and took the stock; he desired me to make it as easy as I could; when I got there, the prisoner was much confused, and so was the cellarman indeed, who said he did not know the consequence of it; I took the stock in a very circumspect manner, and upon balancing the same afterwards at the office, I found fourteen gallons increase of foreign brandy.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him before you left the office, at any time about this transaction with Hardy? - Yes, but I do not know that Hardy's name was particularly mentioned; it was concerning the matter in the books.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing concerning this permit now in question? - I told him on the 13th of April, that I should not only go and take Mrs. Bolton's stock, but I should likewise ask her whether she ever dealt with such a person as Hardy, or whether she ever sent any such quantities; he replied as I had no occasion, for it was all his own doing entirely; for Mrs. Bolton nor Claridge, nor Dunnage, knew nothing about it; and he would clear them of every thing; when we were at the house, I told Claridge what had passed between us, and the cause of my coming; he declared in the prisoner's presence, that he knew nothing at all of it, nor had he sent any such quantities; I told him I thought it was right for me to acquaint Mrs. Bolton of it; I went up stairs, and told her the whole circumstance.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present? - I believe he was, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Explain to us the consequence of conveying this idea of stock from Dunnage to 
Mrs. Bolton?</p>


               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is mere matter of opinion, and I object to it being put in that way.</p>
               <p>Court. To be sure that is only matter of opinion, that the Jury will form as well as he.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you served in the district where the prisoners has been the stocking officer? - Three years or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100069"/>He has been under your immediate controul and direction? - He has.</p>
               <p>How often is it usual for you to examine the state of the permits? - At all opportunities that I thought proper; but once in a month that is the usual way.</p>
               <p>After you have examined them, there is another examination at the excise office? - I apprehend so; I suppose the permits are sent there as a checque upon my examination; I have been three years in that division; I have officiated before; I have been about twenty-seven years in the employ.</p>
               <p>Does it frequently happen that a permit is mislaid? - Often times.</p>
               <p>When that is the case, how is that quantity which would appear to be an illegal increase accounted for? - If these permits that are missing cannot be found, they are reported by the surveyor to the board, lost or mislaid.</p>
               <p>That is a subject of considerable blame in the officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he is bound to give you some account? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>As in the present instance, the prisoner gave you an account from Dunnage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Take this paper? - He read this to me for 129 gallons of brandy, consigned to Mrs. Bolton from Dunnage's stock.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of the word Thompson? - I imagine it to be the permit writer; there is a permit writer of that name; I have known him many years; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Is he in Dunnage's division? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Does it not appear to you, that it meant to convey this information to you, that upon the 16th of March such a permit had been passed? - I cannot give any explanation about it; this is a memorandum of the prisoner's in order to deceive me in reading in; or it is a paper of his own.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand that memorandum to import, that on the 16th of March such a permit had been wrote? - I cannot say what it was for.</p>
               <p>Can you find any number upon it? - Here is 119, which is more likely to be the number of the permit than the 28; to my recollection that 129 gallons was entered before the 2d of March; the book is not here; I did not know Dunnage, I believe he is in the second division.</p>

            . Witness my hand,</p>
               <p>"this 2d day of March, 1786. This permit</p>
               <p>"to be in force one hour, for the</p>
               <p>"goods to be sent out from Mrs. Boulton's</p>
               <p>"stock; and two hours more, for the</p>
               <p>"same to be delivered and received into</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hardy's stock."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If you wish to explain to my Lord and the Jury, how this transaction was, you must do it yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received a paper from a porter, who came and requested a permit for seventy-five gallons of brandy; I carried it to Mr. Norris, who wrote the same; I carried it to that person, who brought it back and said, he wanted another for the next morning; I wrote the other by Mr. Norris's desire, and delivered it to the person who came for it; now, if this note had been a false note, so long after as a month or six weeks, it might have been destroyed, but I believe it to be a true one; it was fairly wrote and posted as the usual course of business was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Norris. Had the prisoner an opportunity to destroy this note if he chose it? - He certainly had; it was upon the file hanging up openly in the office; he had abundant opportunities; he could come at the file if he chose; if the note had been gone, there would have been nothing to have answered to the counter part of the permit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It would have appeared by your counter part that the first of these permits had been granted at the request of the trader? - Yes, the second would have appeared to have been made on the other, and the request note lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Plomer. Does it not often happen that the request notes are lost? - I do not know of any.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called thirteen witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>What sort of a mark was it on the horse hair? - There were three marks of three different people's feet on the horse hair; the print of dirty feet.</p>

               <p>Did you see any thing of them on Friday the 22d of December last? - I was going to work, and I saw the window open, and I looked in, and I saw three people in it; that was between four and five on Friday morning the 22d of December.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was this house? - It is just by Pelican stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you know who lives there? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you heard since? - No, I have not; I saw the parlour window shutters open, about two or three inches; I saw one with a dark lanthorn in his hand, and one of them called him by his name, Notely, hold the lanthorn this way that I may see.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No; I went a few doors off, and I stood, and the three people jumped out of the window; and there was a fourth man walking backwards and forwards on the other side of the way; two of these men were in the house, Notely and Hurst; I cannot tell who the third man was, for I was afraid of calling out; and I did not observe who the fourth man was; they ran down towards the waterside all four of them; I heard a piece of iron fall, and one of them stopped to pick it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What are you? - I am a seaman; I was at Greenland last year, and I had been working in a ship.</p>
               <p>The window shutter was just open enough for you to see a dark lanthorn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This they left open on purpose that you might see them as they were committing a felony? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>You believe they did, do not you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>However they had a lanthorn with them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they see you? - I do not know whether they did or no; I stood five or six doors off.</p>
               <p>You were very much frightened at this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They ran away as fast as they could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They stooped to pick up a thing that fell down, in order to be better observed? - I cannot tell what for; I walked on about my business; I did not know it was any affair of mine.</p>
               <p>How far was the watch box from there? - I cannot tell; I only know the place by going to work; I saw no watchmen after I went up Fox's-lane.</p>
               <p>Then you saw one in Fox's-lane? - Not to my knowledge; I saw none at all.</p>
               <p>Was not there a knocker to the door of this house? - I did not go back to look; I did not know that the house was robbed till some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Then you saw three men with a dark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100073"/>lanthorn in a room, and they jumped out of the window? - I did not know that the house was robbed till some time afterwards, till I heard it was robbed.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Wolfe? - No, I know no such name.</p>
               <p>Who was it bailed you? - Mr. Fletcher.</p>
               <p>What did he bail you for? - That I might come up here at sessions.</p>
               <p>What occasion was there to give bail for you, that you might come here? - Because I should not lose my work.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Fletcher? - A gentleman that lives in the Highway.</p>
               <p>On the highway! what business is he? - He is a gentleman in the office.</p>

               <p>Is not he a runner to the office? - I do not know what he is.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know Mr. Fletcher is one of the runners to that office? - No, Sir, I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Then how came he to bail you? - Because they told him the whole of it.</p>
               <p>When were you with Mr. Orange and Mr. Forrester? - I saw them over the way to day.</p>
               <p>When did you see them before to day? - Yesterday, and the day before yesterday; I had not seen them before this week; I was at work.</p>
               <p>You have seen them several times since this affair happened? - No, Sir, I have not, only since Monday.</p>
               <p>Have you had no conversation with them? - No, never in my life; I never was before a Justice in my life.</p>
               <p>Never about rewards? - Never have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you the man they call stuttering Bill? - I never was called by such a name in my life.</p>
               <p>Was not you before Mr. Smith the Justice, in East Smithfield? - For a wrangle, or a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Was not you before Mr. Smith the Justice on a charge of felony? - No, never in my life; I was there for striking a girl; I never was before any Justice for any harm.</p>
               <p>What girl was it? - A young woman that I live with.</p>
               <p>In short the lady that has the good fortune to be kept by you? - No, Sir, she was married to me at Liverpool; it was some day last week.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, did not Forrester and Orange bail you? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who bailed you upon that charge? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>How came you at large? - I discharged my warrant.</p>
               <p>Was not you bound over to the session? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not Orange and Forrester pass their words for you? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Who might you be at work for that morning? - I was going to look for a day's work.</p>
               <p>The window was open two or three inches? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you took a peep in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I dare say you never saw shutters open two or three inches without looking for some of the loose things; was there a dark lanthorn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the lanthorn darkened, you know what a dark lanthorn is? - I saw light in the lanthorn, Notely had hold of it.</p>
               <p>So you heard them call out, Notely, hold the candle more this way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why they were talking loud, were they? - So loud that I could hear; the other man was right over the way, at about as far as I am now.</p>
               <p>Did not he threaten to give you your gruel? - No, he did not threaten me; he did not speak a word to me.</p>
               <p>He saw you peeping and loitering, and then you went about a door or two distance, and they went away; it was your young woman that gave you that black eye I suppose? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>How soon did you tell any body of this? - I spoke of it the next morning to three or four seamen.</p>
               <p>I suppose you told them, I saw Dick<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100074"/>Notely, and two or three other scamps in the house? - I said, I saw three people in the house.</p>
               <p>Are any of these young men here that you told it to? - No.</p>
               <p>What was their names? - I do not know their names; it was as I was going to Limehouse, going to see for work.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell them that one of them was

               <p>Can you give me any reason why you did not tell that before, when I particularly questioned you; upon your oath did not you know these men before? - I never did know them.</p>
               <p>When were you in company with them afterwards? - I saw one of them in a public house the night afterwards.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - It was Hurst, that young man with the blue clothes; he was telling some people that they did not get above forty pounds in money.</p>
               <p>How came you in company? - I was drinking a pint of beer with two or three seafaring young fellows.</p>
               <p>What is their names? - They are gone to sea; I cannot rightly tell their names, no farther than seeing them on board a man of war; I did not see them join the other two; I saw four people run away together, and they ran down to the water side.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100075"/>What did you do upon that? - I walked away directly.</p>

               <p>You did not go down to the water side at all? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>How near was you to Pelican stairs? - Within four or five doors on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>You saw them run to Pelican stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you go down to look? - I never went to the water side.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure of that? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Nor see what they did when they went down to Pelican stairs? - I did not see any farther than I heard them make a noise in the boat; I did not stop to listen at all; it was a noise as if they were going to push off the boat; I cannot be sure I saw them go off; there were a great many boats rowing about.</p>
               <p>Do you know Pelican stairs? - I never was there in my life.</p>
               <p>How far is it from Fox's-lane? - Not very far.</p>
               <p>How far? - I cannot rightly tell; Fox's-lane comes down to the water side.</p>
               <p>This is the street where the houses open directly down to the water side? - No, Sir, it is six or seven doors where I saw it open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Captain Stephenson. How far is it down to the water side from your house? - There are six houses between our house and Pelican stairs; the passage down to the water side is thirty-five yards; it is very narrow, and makes it look longer; I do not think it is so much neither; it is about the length of the breadth of this Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are not there a great many lighters at those stairs? - Commonly crowded with lighters, all from our back door to the stairs; I wish them stairs were filled up, and so do the neighbours; for there is none plies there but bad people.</p>

               <p>Did you shew the house to any body after that? - Yes, the Justice sent Mr. Forrester with me, and I shewed him the house.</p>

               <p>Then that was the only occasion that brought you before the Magistrate? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>What other occasion? - I was taken up for being disorderly.</p>

               <p>What was you taken up for last? - A beadle took me up; I was going down on board of my ship, and I happened to have a match, a steel, and a tinder-box, and a little tinder to strike a light; but nothing else was found about me; I was taken up about half after four.</p>
               <p>Was it not between three and four? - I do not know whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>You saw a cupboard they were opening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A mahogany cupboard? - I cannot say it was a mahogany cupboard; I knew it was a cupboard.</p>
               <p>Did not you get into the house to see if it was a mahogany cupboard? - I shewed the officer the house; I dare say it was a mahogany cupboard; it was the colour of mahogany.</p>
               <p>Then you saw the colour of it very plainly, which made you think it was mahogany? - It looked like it.</p>
               <p>You saw it very plainly? - Yes, yes.</p>
               <p>What light was there? - Am I witch, to tell what light there was in the house; I saw a light in the house, it was a lanthorn; I cannot tell what light was in the house.</p>
               <p>How came you at large? - Because I served my time out.</p>
               <p>What since last spring? - I came away from Woolwich last March; it will be three years this March; I was two years at Woolwich, on board the hulks; and so was them two men there as well as me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When was you discharged from the hulks? - Last March; I have been at work since.</p>
               <p>I dare say you have not been idle; can you tell me any honest man you have worked for since that time? - The last ship I worked for was the Berwick store-ship, at Deptford; I was determined to take a voyage in it as cook, only for this accident.</p>
               <p>How long was you on board the Berwick? - I was three or four weeks helping to sit her out.</p>
               <p>What ship before? - I was on board the Pearl Frigate. (I must find ears too.) I was in her till she was fitted out about eight weeks; then I left her; I thought to better myself; so I did not sail in her.</p>
               <p>Had you been on board any other before that? - I have not kept an almanack in my head; I first went on board a ship that was laying down at Woolwich, the Dreadnought; I carried her round to Plymouth; she was condemned; I came back in a merchantman.</p>
               <p>So they tried you at Winchester for a burglary? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100077"/>Then you know how that sort of thing is done? - Aye, I believe, I do know.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any body set about to commit a burglary, and take a light, and leave a window open for people to see? - I believe you to be the best judge; you seem to know more about it than I do.</p>
               <p>Furnish me with a little understanding? - I will as well as I can, but I do not understand housebreaking at all.</p>
               <p>Where was you coming from when you saw these men land at Pelican-stairs? - From Rotherhithe; I had business to do in London, to go look for some prize money I had due to me, for the Monarque.</p>
               <p>Where did you earn that? - Up the streights, if you know the place; I dare say it was about six years ago.</p>
               <p>Who was your agent? - Mackintosh.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - I will tell you the name of the place, it was in Crutchedfriers.</p>
               <p>Court. Need we go into the black history of this man's life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The moment the Court say that, we have done.</p>
               <p>Is this Watt's hand writing? - I am no scholar; I cannot read.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Smith? - Yes, he was no bed-fellow of mine; I was in gaol with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say any thing to Smith about Notely? - I never spoke a word to him about Notely; I came from the gaol this morning.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to Smith, that you had Notely under your thumb, and that you would do his business for him? - No Sir, never in my life; I told Smith that Notely hung a man here some time back; that was all that ever I said to him; I never said I would be a witness against him.</p>


               <p>Did not you add, but I have him now? - No Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, if he had fifty necks, you would hang him? - No, I never did, I will swear that positively, nor any thing like it, no further than Notely was evidence against

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was taken up for a different burglary? - Yes, and was committed.</p>
               <p>You have been tried? - I was tried once before, and was innocent; that was for another burglary; Holmes that was tried with me was hanged; I was admitted an evidence about last Wednesday week.</p>
               <p>How long was it after before you discovered this burglary? - I told of this first.</p>
               <p>Did you first reveal this burglary before last Tuesday? - Yes, I did; I said it when I was first taken; I owned it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will not ask him any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not ask you any question that will accuse yourself of course; but the truth of the answer to my questions may perhaps decide a little on your future fate; now I ask you, on your oath, whether Peters was not with you when you committed this robbery? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Was Watts? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see them there at all? - I cannot say I did; I saw somebody there; I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Did Peters speak to you on Pelican-stairs? - I do not know that he did; I do not know Peters or Watts, either of them.</p>
               <p>Richardson never went up from the boat?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100079"/>- Never, he came up to the top of Pelican-stairs, but he never came from the stairs that I knew.</p>
               <p>There were only two of you went into the house, and Hurst stood on the outside? - He was to stay by the shutters, but whether he did, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any talk about the dark lanthorn, when you was in the house? - Notely said let me have it now; when he looked in the desk.</p>
               <p>You did not call on him by his name? - I never called on him by his name in the house; I am sure of that; Hurst never was in the house.</p>
               <p>Did Notely take any notice of any person coming to the window? - Not to my knowledge; I saw nobody looking in at the window.</p>
               <p>What sort of a crow was it that Notely broke open the shutter with? - The crow that Notely had was a foot and a half long, his was a crow properly so called; and it was about six inches smaller than his; we had nothing but the two crows and the dark lanthorn; never a one of us had a chissel, that I am positive of.</p>
               <p>Look at that chissel, did you ever see that before? - No, I never saw it before, nor I am sure we had it not with us.</p>

               <p>Nobody had been taken up before on this robbery? - Notely had been taken up upon bare suspicion of the chissel fitting; that was the day after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>When did Peters give this information? - On the 27th; on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Had Notely been detained on suspicion before that time? - Yes, he was committed for further examination.</p>
               <p>Was any thing ever found besides that chissel? - I believe not; no other circumstance had come out, only the trifling circumstance of hearing that these people were together the day before, near the spot.</p>
               <p>The witness Peters was committed before the justice? - No, he was not, he was taken up by the beadle at night, as a suspicious person; I believe he had been before the Magistrate; I had him in my custody for two days, and since he has been in Clerkenwell; Mr. Staples committed him for want of sureties, as being a material witness in this business, as thinking he would not otherwise appear; I saw them sign these informations; Watts's is in my own hand-writing; I saw the Magistrate sign them; this is Peters's mark, and Mr. Staples's hand-writing; this is Watt's mark, and this is the Magistrate's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Did you give it him, or did he snatch it out of your hand without your consent? - He snatched it without my consent.</p>
               <p>And he kept it I believe? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>How much was the receipt for? - It was for two hundred and fifty pounds for a diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Why he knows me; and I have seen him before in Hartshorn-street, Golden-lane, at an ale-house; I am sure he is the man; I had an hundred hand-bills printed; there was five guineas for taking, and five guineas on conviction.</p>
               <p>Did you describe his person? - Yes, in the papers; he was not taken till lately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now, old gentleman, you will consider this man's life is at stake, and do not treat it ludicrously; I think, first of all, upon some person's picking up a ring, you agreed to take half, and cheat the right owner? - I never mentioned the half at all.</p>
               <p>Did not you consent that it should not be advertised, and you would take half the money to keep it from the right owner? - No, I consented to have it advertised.</p>
               <p>That was the first proposal? - Aye, and the last too.</p>
               <p>Did not you go home to fetch money to purchase your part of the ring, now? - That is upon the account; because he said, I will give you an hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Then you consented to receive the hundred pounds as half the share of this ring, which you knew did not belong to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nor to the man that made the proposal to you? - No.</p>
               <p>You state this to be above a year ago? - Yes, a year and four or five months.</p>
               <p>Then from last August was a twelvemonth, to pretty nearly this time, you never saw that man again, whoever he was, that brought the ring to you? - No, nor never till he was taken.</p>
               <p>That makes sixteen or seventeen months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To read this writing and the receipt it was necessary you should put on your spectacles? - To be sure it was, my eye sight is not so quick to read small print; but I can see pretty well.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, upon your oath, whether you have always been as sure of that man as you are now? - I have been.</p>
               <p>Who was the constable that took him up first? - Ward and Smith took the man together, and brought him to me; I saw him there.</p>
               <p>I ask you, upon your oath, Sir, whether you did not say, that was not the man that had done you the injury? - No, no such a word.</p>
               <p>Will you stick to that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100087"/>When he was taken before the Magistrate did you swear positively to him then? - I did.</p>
               <p>Without hesitation as you have done now? - Yes, I swore to him then as I have done now.</p>
               <p>How many conversations have you had about this man with Smith before you went to the Magistrate? - Why he had my papers to take him whenever he found him.</p>
               <p>Has Smith never told you that it would be a good thing to swear to this man, that something would come of it? - I do not care for that at all; I have been acquainted with Smith a good many years.</p>
               <p>What office does he attend? - Oh, God Almighty knows.</p>

               <p>Sometimes making love is all on one side, you know, and sometimes a little on both sides: attend seriously to the questions I am going to ask you, was not this young man obliged to marry your sister? - Obliged to it! no, Sir, I do not know that he was.</p>
               <p>Did not you and your family press the marriage very much? - We did not.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know of any threats of the young woman to destroy herself if he did not marry her? - The young woman told me once, as I was very much against the marriage, that if I altered his affections to her, it might be the worse with her.</p>
               <p>That is, if you hindered the marriage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she explain what she meant by that? - No, Sir, not clearly.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, that unless this young man consented to marry your sister, she would destroy herself? - I cannot say, but I hinted some little matter of it.</p>
               <p>Why you mentioned it in very broad terms, that you was very glad she was married, for if she had not, she would have destroyed herself, she loved him so much? - No, I did not say she loved him so much.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you was glad you had got your sister married, or she would have destroyed herself? - I said, that she said, perhaps it might be worse with her, and she would have done something to herself that she should not have done.</p>
               <p>Was it not seriously apprehended in the family, that unless the young man consented to marry your sister, it would be the death of her? - I cannot answer to that.</p>
               <p>Have not you told Mr. Lloyd so? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>I hope you did not tell him a lye? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it was so represented to this young man, that the only way to save this young girl's life was to marry her? - No.</p>
               <p>How came these two people together? - She was at Mr. Laidler's in Moorfields, out of place, and he was a workman there.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to be of any of the parties at Bartholomew fair with them? - No, Sir, I was not.</p>
               <p>Do you know from your sister that before the marriage, she was acquainted that he had another wife living? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100093"/>Have you ever heard so? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he pass in your family as a single man? - Yes, I never heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard from your sister, either before or after the prosecution commenced, that she was told at Bartholomew fair before the marriage, that this man had a wife living? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard so? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he pass in your family as a single man? - Yes, I never heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear from your sister neither before or after this prosecution commenced that she was told at Bartholomew fair before the marriage that this man had a wife living? - No, I never heard her say so, nor I never knew it.</p>
               <p>Court. He passed himself as a single man? - He did after he was married, but we discovered it in two days; I never saw him since till I saw him at the bar; we were informed by a letter from the people where they lodged; I do not know the name, it is in White-cross-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Young woman, how long was you acquainted with this young man? - Upwards of five months.</p>
               <p>Where were you married? - At the Holy Trinity.</p>
               <p>Did you know whether he was married or a single man before? - No, Sir, I had no such suspicions; I discovered he was married within three days.</p>
               <p>What became of him? - I do not know; a woman came up stairs, and said, he was her husband; she and him went down stairs; and she came back again; and said, he was her husband; I asked her; if she could prove her marriage, she said, she could swear it; and likewise could bring her certificate in forty-eight hours; that was on the 21st of December; I immediately left him and went to my friends; on the 3d of January he was apprehended at Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Who took him? - I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had no suspicion he was a married man before you was married? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Was you at Bartholomew fair with him? - No; I was there with a young man in Mr. Laidler's house.</p>
               <p>Was there any young woman there? - I have seen Doughty and the other young woman; I had no conversation with them about the prisoner and the marriage.</p>
               <p>They had mentioned your marriage to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe they took some pains to dissuade you from it? - No, Sir, they did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, had nobody told you before you was married, that he was a married man and had a child? - No, I never had the least suspicion; he told me he had no friends in London but a sister.</p>
               <p>Had nobody told you? - No, Sir, I had not the least suspicion.</p>
               <p>That is not an answer, did any body tell you before you was married, that he was a married man, and that you had better have nothing to do with him? - I really cannot recollect any such thing was said.</p>
               <p>Did not Jane Doughty say so? - No, Sir, I never spoke to her but twice.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Apsley mention it? - No, not on that account.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you? - They used to talk to me, and ask me if I was going to be married; I told them, yes.</p>
               <p>Did they make no reply upon that? - No, none at all, not in the least.</p>
               <p>I am sorry to be obliged to ask you these questions, and press you to much about it; be so good to tell me whether the marriage was voluntary on the part of this man, or was not he forced into it? - No, Sir, me force him into it!</p>
               <p>No, I do not say you; I dare say you forced him by your charms as you would any body? - It was his own inclinations; he would have married me months before, but I would not agree to it, for I wished to be asked in church.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100094"/>Was not he told by somebody, by your direction, that unless he married you, some fatal consequence would happen, and that it would be your death? - I never mentioned it to him.</p>
               <p>Nor to any body else with a view to their telling him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you to your brother? - I do not know what I might say to my brother; but it was not with a view to it's being said to him.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday week, seven men came into my house, it is a public house, and staid two hours; they came to drink, and beat the drum; the other six were all stairs; they came in about six in the evening; the maid waited upon them; the prisoner was one of the seven, but he did not go up stairs only sometimes; when they had staid some time; they were taken before Justice Smith; we missed the things before they went out of the house; as soon as ever they had put the things out, they came down stairs; I bid the maid put the little girl to bed, and the child; the maid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100095"/>screamed out directly, and said the money and the things were all gone out of the drawers in the one pair of stairs bed room, next to the room where these people were; they were in the dining room; the door of the bed room was locked, and the maid had the key; I went up stairs on the alarm, and found one of the windows open, which was a casement window; I not been into the room since I got up; the maid had been in several times, and the drawers were broken all to pieces, and every thing that was in them was gone; there was no money gone out of the drawers but the halfpence; the prisoner was in the kitchen when I first heard the alarm; four of the men that were up stairs in the dining room, were then come down stairs, and two of the men were missing; the four men came down to pay their money, and the girl said there were two missing, and they said they would pay for them; they went up stairs with me, and the prisoner, on the alarm, and then they wanted to be off, but I sent them all five, the prisoner and four more, to the watch-house; the other four were examined before Justice Smith, and discharged, and the prisoner was detained for taking the two guineas out of my hand, which was in the room, when he went up stairs with me, and the four others; there was one of the drawers not broke open, which had fifteen guineas in it; they could not get that open; I could not find the key, and one of the men broke the drawer open for me; I believe it was the prisoner that I desired to break open the drawer, and I believe he did so; the fifteen guineas were there safe, and the prisoner took them out of the drawer; they were in a large cup, and he poured the money into my hand; the prisoner came up, and took hold of my hand, and took two guineas out of my hand by force; he could not get any more out, I held it fast; I put the rest into my pocket, and went down and counted it.</p>
               <p>Did you cry out when he forced the money out of your hand? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - I do not know; I knew he had some of the money, and I went down and counted it; I was rather frightened; Mr. Mott and four or five more were in the room, and he said what are you at? I charged the prisoner with it.</p>
               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>There was an alarm while they were there, of the house being robbed; they had been in the house about two hours, or hardly so much; five of the men were below stairs beating a drum; in a little while, came two men and locked in at the door; then this man went up stairs into the dining room, and beat the drum there; then the prisoner, the punch man -</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the punch man? - He is fatter than the rest; then the prisoner came in after the six men; he staid a while below; then he said, I fancy they have muffled the drum, we will go up stairs now.</p>
               <p>Did he appear before that to be one of the company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How, as he came in by himself? - He said he expected to have a bit of supper dressed, for he had five or six people to come; and the people of the house told him they were come, and were up stairs; he said, if it was a piece of pork and greens he did not care; and Mrs. Owens told him she had no orders; he went up stairs twice to the company; the maid went up stairs, and just before that, the other men came down and asked for the reckoning; there were four up stairs, and this man was five; the other two were missing, and while we were talking of paying the reckoning, the maid came down stairs, and said the drawers were broke open, and the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Upon that, did you go up stairs? - Yes, just at the time the alarm was given, the maid said two men were missing, and the others said, G - d d - n them, they are gone a girling, or something of that kind, but we will pay for them; when the alarm was given, they all went up, I went with them; I found the drawers broke,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100096"/>and the room stripped; there was a drawer open, but who opened it, or put the money into Mrs. Owens hands, I cannot say, but I saw the money in her left hand; I saw the prisoner bustle up to Mrs. Owen, as if he was going to salute her; the mean while he put his finger and thumb between her fingers and thumb, and took out something, but what it was I cannot say; I asked her directly what he had taken out of her hand, and she said money; she was in a very great fright, and could not tell what she had lost; I saw Mrs. Owens count her money afterwards; it might be half an hour before we could get her to her senses.</p>
               <p>Was it after they were taken to the watch-house? - It was.</p>
               <p>How much money had she when she counted it? - Eleven guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Did she say how much she should have had? - She said she should have had fifteen guineas, but she would not swear to any more than two guineas.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Owens; the drawers were in her bed room, and I remember where the men beat the drum was facing it, and the bed room was locked; I had the key, the windows of it were all fast; I had been up ten minutes before six; the men were in the tap room; then I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket; when I went up with the child to bed, wanting a quarter to eight, I found the door open, and the lock forced back; the window of one casement was open; the drawers were forced open, and the things were taken out of them; five of the men were in the tap room when I went up stairs, and two were missing.</p>
               <p>Before this happened, had you an opportunity of observing whether the prisoner was in company with the others? - There were two drummers came in first, and two other young men with them; the four came in together; the next, this prisoner came in, then two more after him; when the prisoner came in, he said are there any of our people? I said there are two drummers, and two other young men, and you will have it for staying so long behind them; then he went up stairs; he came down, and ordered me to carry some pipes and tobacco up to these people; after I went up, I found the drawers open; the five went up, and my mistress; I gave the prisoner a screw driver to open the drawer that the money was in, for my mistress desired the drawer to be opened, to see if her money was safe.</p>
               <p>Did you see him open it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards see your mistress have any money in her hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she complain she had lost any of it? - She said to me when she went down stairs, that man has wrenched some money out of my hand; I said, which man? I saw him go up with my mistress, and he said, I am very happy you have lost no money; and I saw him go up to her, and pull her shawl away over her hand, and I gave him a shove, and said, what are you doing? but I did not see him take any money.</p>
               <p>Did your mistress say any thing at that moment? - No, she did not, but when she was going down stairs, she told me he had taken some money.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know of your own knowledge what money was in the drawer? - Fifteen guineas, I told it over the day before.</p>
               <p>Was it all in gold? - There was fourteen guineas in gold, and a guinea's worth of silver; my mistress counted her money before the constable came.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100097"/>Who was present? - That gentleman that stands there, and two more.</p>
               <p>How much money had she then? - Eleven guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>You saw that, did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now when the constable came, what did she charge him with? - With having broke the room open, she forgot to tell the constable that he had taken the money, and I forgot it also in my fright.</p>
               <p>How much money had she lost? - Three guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>How came she to fix the sum of two guineas? - Because she was not willing to put the loss at the most, but at the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know whether that man was searched that night? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Was you to have put this guinea and a half in this drawer? - Yes, but I forgot it.</p>
               <p>When your mistress had counted her money, she thought the guinea and a half was in? - No, I told her I had not put it in; there were sixteen guineas and a half in the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing said about it in the room, either before or after the headborough came? - No, nothing.</p>

                     his Majesty had been graciously pleased to extend his mercy to him on condition of his being transported for life

                  </rs>; when he addressed the Court as follows.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship's humanity to me, and also that of the worthy Sheriffs, from the fatal day of my conviction, has stamped such an indelible impression on my mind, that I should think myself lost to every feeling of gratitude, if I did not return your Lordship and the worthy Sheriffs my most humble thanks; but my Lord, at the same time, I have to assure your Lordship in the most solemn manner, that as I now feel myself forever cut off from the union of a person that was most dear to me, death to me will be preferable to life; I shall therefore insist upon your Lordship to order my sentence to be put into execution: I am truly sensible of the crime I have committed; but it is the most pleasing reflection I have, that although I have been guilty of many irregularities, yet I do not look upon myself as entirely depraved, I trust in the merits of my blessed Saviour, through whose intercession, I hope to become a glorified Saint in Heaven, there to be delivered from the power of evil, and through him to have an entrance into that blessed world, where I shall no more know sin, sorrow, or death; there perhaps I may meet my amiable friends, and rejoice with them to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Young man, I was in hopes the unfortunate situation in which you stand had compleatly corrected the disorder of your mind, and the first part of your address confirmed me in my expectation; but you should well consider, in respect to the other part of your address; for if you have that sense of mind, that duty to God, and that submission to the laws of your country which you have expressed; you must know that you cannot commit a greater crime, than that of voluntarily throwing away that life, which the mercy of your sovereign has thought proper to spare; your execution upon refusing his Majesty's most gracious pardon, will be but self murder; and it is your duty patiently to submit to the consequence of that fact, of which you have been convicted; but in consideration of the state of your mind, his Majesty has extended mercy to you, in a case in which mercy is seldom allowed; for the crime of forgery is so heinous to the public, that it can only be on special circumstances that any mercy can be granted; the best proof you can give of a repentant mind, and of submission to the laws of God and Man, is to submit to his Majesty's pleasure, and to set an example to a part of the world where you may have an opportunity of leading an honest life for the future, which it is too difficult for you to do at home; you should be thankful for what you have already received, and submit to his Majesty's goodness in granting you a pardon; and therefore I expect from that sense of duty, and of religion, and submission to the laws, which you profess to have, that you will consider of it; and I will give you to the first day of the next session so to do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I thank your Lordship; but in the present case, I have an unquestionable right to my own opinion, and as death would be preferable to me, I am determined to persevere in applying for the execution of my sentence.</p>
               <p>Court. You should be aware that if the King's mercy is rejected and abused, when you come to a better temper of mind, which the fear of death will certainly produce, you may have then no opportunity of applying for that mercy which you now refuse.</p>

                        his Majesty had been graciously pleased to extend his mercy to him on condition of his being transported for life
                     </rs>
                  
                     </rs>; when he addressed the Court as follows.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship's humanity to me, and also that of the worthy Sheriffs, from the fatal day of my conviction, has stamped such an indelible impression on my mind, that I should think myself lost to every feeling of gratitude, if I did not return your Lordship and the worthy Sheriffs my most humble thanks; but my Lord, at the same time, I have to assure your Lordship in the most solemn manner, that as I now feel myself forever cut off from the union of a person that was most dear to me, death to me will be preferable to life; I shall therefore insist upon your Lordship to order my sentence to be put into execution: I am truly sensible of the crime I have committed; but it is the most pleasing reflection I have, that although I have been guilty of many irregularities, yet I do not look upon myself as entirely depraved, I trust in the merits of my blessed Saviour, through whose intercession, I hope to become a glorified Saint in Heaven, there to be delivered from the power of evil, and through him to have an entrance into that blessed world, where I shall no more know sin, sorrow, or death; there perhaps I may meet my amiable friends, and rejoice with them to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Recorder. Young man, I was in hopes the unfortunate situation in which you stand had compleatly corrected the disorder of your mind, and the first part of your address confirmed me in my expectation; but you should well consider, in respect to the other part of your address; for if you have that sense of mind, that duty to God, and that submission to the laws of your country which you have expressed; you must know that you cannot commit a greater crime, than that of voluntarily throwing away that life, which the mercy of your sovereign has thought proper to spare; your execution upon refusing his Majesty's most gracious pardon, will be but self murder; and it is your duty patiently to submit to the consequence of that fact, of which you have been convicted; but in consideration of the state of your mind, his Majesty has extended mercy to you, in a case in which mercy is seldom allowed; for the crime of forgery is so heinous to the public, that it can only be on special circumstances that any mercy can be granted; the best proof you can give of a repentant mind, and of submission to the laws of God and Man, is to submit to his Majesty's pleasure, and to set an example to a part of the world where you may have an opportunity of leading an honest life for the future, which it is too difficult for you to do at home; you should be thankful for what you have already received, and submit to his Majesty's goodness in granting you a pardon; and therefore I expect from that sense of duty, and of religion, and submission to the laws, which you profess to have, that you will consider of it; and I will give you to the first day of the next session so to do.</p>
                  <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I thank your Lordship; but in the present case, I have an unquestionable right to my own opinion, and as death would be preferable to me, I am determined to persevere in applying for the execution of my sentence.</p>
                  <p>Court. You should be aware that if the King's mercy is rejected and abused, when you come to a better temper of mind, which the fear of death will certainly produce, you may have then no opportunity of applying for that mercy which you now refuse.</p>
                  <p>Prisoner. I am still determined to persevere in the same opinion.</p>
                  <p>Court. I shall remand you to prison, and give you till the first day of next session to consider of it, and if you then refuse his Majesty's pardon, you may expect immediate execution.</p>
                  <p>Prisoner. Very well my Lord.</p>
