On the 29th and 30th of April he was tipsy, and on the Wednesday I complained of his conduct; he was excessively abusive - I desired an officer to be sent for, and while the officer was sent for he left the house; this was at my house in Bond-street - the plate was taken from my house in Regent's-park; I searched my plate chest at my house in Regent's-park on the following day; I searched minutely, and on the first day I missed a pair of silver candlesticks and some table-spoons - how many I could not ascertain, because in the inventory of the plate there was something put over the number of spoons; I could not see the number - this was on Thursday; I missed dessert spoons and table spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Having searched in your pantry and plate-chest, was it possible for these candlesticks for instance, to have been in the place without your observing them? A. Certainly not. On the Saturday morning on my getting up, Kirby showed me the candlesticks and the rest of the plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. He came to me in May last; I did not desire him to leave the house on Wednesday - he went away when I mentioned sending for the officer - he was drunk: I did not then suspect any robbery.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Savory's service. Wright left the house on Wednesday - I and Mr. Savory searched the pantry and plate-room minutely and attentively; these candlesticks could not have been there. On Saturday morning between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came and rang the bell; I was getting up - I opened the shutters and saw him in the area with a bundle under his arm; I asked him where the candlesticks were, and said there was a great piece of work about them; he said they were wrapped in paper in pantry; I said it was impossible for them to be there, for I and master had searched every place; I opened the door, he came into the kitchen, stood about a minute, and then went into the room adjoining the pantry, where the plate was kept; he stood there a minute or two and then went into the pantry - my fellow-servant came down - the prisoner then came out of the plate-room into the pantry with this pair of candlesticks; he put them down and returned to the room again without saying anything; he returned into the room and brought the tea-pot, wine-strainer and other things, which were not there when we searched; he produced a mug, some spoons, and other things - he then asked my fellow-servant Elizabeth, if that was all right; she said No, there was a table-spoon still missing - he turned round, went out, saying he would go and see if he could find the spoon; he took no bundle out with him - he said he would not see master till he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290004"/>found the spoon; he returned between two and three o'clock in the afternoon and brought the spoon into the kitchen and gave it to me. I am certain this plate was not in the house before he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you still in Mr. Savory's employ? A. Yes - I am his groom; I did not see the prisoner open his bundle - the plate-room is darkish - there is only one closet it it; I am sure I made accurate search; Mr. Savory was not at home when he came in the afternoon, and I did not detain him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When he went away in the morning, did he mention at what hour he would return? A. No, not to my recollection; he said he would go and see if he could find the spoon.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Gofton, a pawnbroker. On the 18th of April the prisoner pawned a pair of silver candlesticks with me for 3l. 10s. 4d.; I believe those produced to be the same; he had before that pawned a table and tea-spoon for 11s.; I know this to be the table-spoon - I asked him if they were his own property - he said they were, and that he wanted some money; he gave me his right name and address; I observed the prisoner's initials on the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think the letters T.F.S. corresponded with A. Wright? A. No. He said they were all his own, and he wanted 3l. 10s. on the candlesticks, just for the present - he redeemed the table-spoons in April, the candlesticks on the 3rd of May: we live in Guildford-street, Oxford-street, about a mile from Bond-street; the candlesticks are worth about 14l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These were separate pledges? A. Yes. He pawned the candlesticks on the day he took the spoon out; silver is worth 5s. an ounce; I include the manufacture in the value of the candlesticks; 10s. 6d. or 14s. an ounce is at times charged for fashionable articles.</p>

On the 17th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in an inner room on the ground floor, and heard a noise at the lobby door; I looked, and saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, closing the street door - he was then going out: I saw him sufficiently to be able to recognize him; I had seen the lobby door latched about five minutes before, and think I must have heard if anybody came in after that, as the room I was in is about twenty feet from the door; I looked in the direction the prisoner was walking, and saw he had a picture under his arm, which had previously hung in the lobby - it was framed; I caught sight of him before he got one third of the way to Fleet-street - he turned the corner into Fleet-street; I lost sight of him for about three minutes: I laid hold of him within ten minutes from the time of his leaving the door; he had then got this picture in his hand - it is a sporting piece, and is Mr. Wray's property. If anybody had opened the door I think I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What door are you speaking of? A. The outer street door is generally open, but the inner one, communicating with the lobby, is invariably closed; if that had been open I must have heard it, as there was no door shut between me and that door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear it opened? was it that that attracted your attention? A. I cannot say; I heard a noise, but whether it was the door being opened I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came up to me, was I walking or running? A. Walking; he did not object to my taking the picture from him; he was confused, and when I took it from him he ran away, and dodged me about the shambles of the market, but he made no violent resistance.</p>

I was on London-bridge at a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner and another little lad with him; the prisoner was hanging to the coach, close behind the prosecutor, and the lad was sitting on the step of the dickey; I saw the prisoner put his hand once or twice to the prosecutor's pocket - he took out a silk handkerchief, folded it up in his hand, and jumped down - I directly seized him; the lad jumped off, and ran into the Borough - he was eight or nine years old, or rather more. The prisoner never got from me - he threw the handkerchief on the ground when I seized him.</p>

             I am the prosecutor's son, and am fourteen years old. I saw the prisoner on the morning of the 5th of May, about twenty yards from the pipe; I had not known him long - I saw him again about half-past four o'clock the same afternoon, rolling the pipe towards Fish-street-hill; I did not then know it was my father's; I asked where he got it from - he said he bought it of a man named Kennett, on Dowgate-hill; Kennett is a wine-cooper. I then went to Kennett - the prisoner was not present; in about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw the pipe at Osmond's, in Little Tower-street, and am certain it is the same I saw the prisoner rolling; I knew it as there were the same number of hoops off it at one end.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it on Dowgate-hill; I was rolling it along - Scarborough's son asked where I bought it, and I told him near Kennett's house.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. How do you know the pipe? Is it branded at all? A. No; when I saw him with it it was very little dirty; it was a very muddy day, and he could not have rolled it far without getting it muddy - if he had brought it from Dowgate-hill it must have been much dirtier; I had noticed the hoops being off at one end when I saw it on the ruins, and in the same state as when he was rolling it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SCARBOROUGH. I am certain it is the pipe which I lost; it had stood on the ruins for a week - I had no other there like it; nobody else puts casks there.</p>

            . The prisoner has been about twelve months in our employ, and had a guinea a week; this cochineal is usually kept on the first floor; we do not sell less than about 1 cwt. On the 8th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Cavanagh, our porter, who resides on the premises, gave me information; I went to the second floor, and found 11 ozs. of cochineal, concealed by the side of an old fender by the fire place; a quantity of brown paper was put over it; it was taken from a bag down stairs, but was too small a quantity to be missed. I determined to watch, and went on 'Change, desiring that no person should be allowed to leave the premises; I returned from 'Change, and found it in the same place; I placed myself in the inner counting-house, which leads to a back stair-case, and about six o'clock, when the men were leaving work, I placed the counting-house door a little ajar, and heard the prisoner creeping up stairs; I opened the door, and saw him - I ran round through the first counting-house, and told Cavanagh to stop whoever came down; I then ran up, and found the cochineal was gone, but a little canvas bag, in which it was concealed, was put aside, and the brown paper strewed about; I came down stairs, and found the prisoner had been stopped; I accused him of having the property on his person - he called God to witness that he had not got it; I felt his pocket, and found he had got it - I put my hand in, and produced it before him - he did not then deny it; it is worth about 8s. I sent one of my clerks for a sheet of paper, to put the cochineal into. An officer was afterwards fetched, and took him in charge. I only took 9 ozs. from him; two more ounces were afterwards found by the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many persons were in your employ? A. Two clerks and four porters; the porters had all been about eighteen months with me, and Cavanagh has been there nearly twenty years - the prisoner has been about twelve months in the concern, and was in my brother's employ about fourteen years: I believe he has a wife and five children; the men work without their coats; I do not myself know where his coat hung - everybody who was on the premises when this took place, is here to night, except the senior clerk - two of the porters had left.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you had given orders that nobody should leave? A. That was in the morning, before I went to 'Change; they were there when I returned from 'Change, and left afterwards, with my permission, at the usual time - the prisoner denied all knowledge of it till I produced the cochineal in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, when you produced it, did he not say it must have been put into his pocket? A. He said nothing of the kind; he told the Lord Mayor his coat had been hanging up; he did not deny it after it was produced: he might have said something in the tone of a guilty man - he was agitated, and I thought he would have fallen.</p>
               <p>Q. When you produced it, do you mean to say he did not deny knowing how it came there? A. He did not.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Kirk. I took some cochineal from the prisoner's pocket, in Mr. Kirk's presence; he did not say how he came by it till after the officer had searched his lodging; I then heard him say the devil had tempted him at the moment; this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290007"/>was after the officer had found 2 ozs. more in his pocket - the cochineal I took from him weighed 9 ozs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master discovered it before you took it from him? A. Yes, he called me for the purpose of taking it from his pocket; I knew nothing of it before he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your master present, and did he hear him say the devil tempted him? A. Yes - it might not have occurred to his recollection to mention it - I went before the Grand Jury, but they said there was no occasion to examine me - I was not called till after Mr. Kirk had seen it in his pocket, and I emptied it out; he did not say he did not know how it came there; I do not exactly know where his coat had hung - he used to hang it in the second floor room; if any man was wickedly disposed he might have put it into his pocket.</p>

            . I have been many years in the prosecutors' service. On the 8th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I found this cochineal between the fender and the edge of the fire-place, in a canvass bag, under some brown paper - I placed it there again, and told Mr. Kirk, who came and looked at it; I live in the house. I was on the watch about six o'clock, when the men left work, and saw the prisoner come into the back warehouse, to brush his clothes; two other men did the same - the two men went with me and shut up the warehouse - I then told them they might go; I did not see the prisoner again till he came down to go out - Mr. Kirk said he wanted him - I told him so, and he said, "What does he want with me? I saw him a few minutes ago;" I said, "Perhaps he wants you to go to the dyers;" Mr. Kirk came down, and said, What is that you have in your basket?" he said, "Nothing at all;" then said Mr. Kirk, "You must have something about your person;" he said he had nothing at all; I told Mr. Kirk he had better search him, if he had any doubt; Mr. Kirk put his hand on his right-hand coat pocket, and asked what was there; I cannot exactly say what answer he gave, but Mr. Kirk pulled out some cochineal, and sent Field for some clean paper to put it on - 9 ozs. were found; I went with him and the constable, and saw 2 ozs. more found in the same pocket - he said the devil tempted him to do it, and it was the first act he had done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that he said so? A. I do not know; I answered what questions were put to me; I do not think I did mention it - I have heard Field state it here, and I also heard the prisoner say it - my master serve dyers with goods. I never myself knew the prisoner to be in Mr. Russel Kirk's employ; his coat hung in the room where the cochineal was found; there were books in the kitchen on purpose for the coats, but he hung his in that place - he was asked what he meant to do with the cochineal, and would not give an answer. I never heard him say he did not know it was in his pocket.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for: 9 ozs. of cochineal were given to me, which they said were found on the prisoner; I searched him afterwards, and found 2 ozs. more in his coat pocket; he did not say it had been placed there by anybody else.</p>

Lincoln the officer was waiting there, and asked him what he had done with the silver spoons - he said he knew nothing about them: I went away on business and Lincoln fetched me. The prisoner then took me down to the dust-hole, and told me the duplicates were there; he had told me a good many lies, and I said he had better tell the truth; he then made a statement, and took me to the dust-hole, where I found the duplicates of the silver spoons; after that he took us to the rag-hole, and in a bag under the rags were two pieces<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290008"/>of linen and a pair of shoes, which were mine; I saw the officer find this memorandum upon him, he told me I should find part of my property at Loyne's in Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square; I went there with Lincoln and found in his shop some blue Artillery cloth - we are contractors for the Artillery corps, and nobody but ourselves have occasion for that cloth; it is made purposely for us - I also found some bone buttons, some hooks and eyes, two pairs of trousers, one pair of which he had made up for himself - I knew the cloth. Lincoln found a duplicate of some scarlet cloth which I believe was ours; a pair of our shears were also found - the goods were all found in the shop - Loynes came in just as we entered; he is a small tailor or piece-broker; Lincoln said he had a search-warrant - he made no reply to that; when we found the things, he said he had bought them of the boy - we had not mentioned any boy; he said the boy's father had been there that morning asking for work: I laid hold of a superfine coat in the shop; he said "That don't belong to you" but when I laid hold of the shears he seemed to nod assent to their being mine; whenever I touched anything that was not mine, he said"That don't belong to you." I had not mentioned my name, or even the boy's name; we only said we had a search-warrant - about thirteen gross of buttons were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had Brennock been with you? A. He came about March last. When I sent for him he cried, and said he hoped I would not prosecute him; I said I would make no promise, but he had better tell the truth, because he was telling a parcel of lies; he cried and said he wanted to see his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not offer to take your oath that you would not prosecute him? A. No; I certainly said nothing about my oath - I said he might see his father, but did not say I would send for his father if he would give up the duplicates, or anything of the sort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know his father? A. Yes; he is a tailor and had worked for me many years; Loynes keeps an open shop - he made no objection to my searching; I found some of the things on the top of a cupboard.</p>

I went to Mr. Dolan's on the 30th of April, and saw Brennock; I asked if he knew anything of the silver spoons; he took Mr. Dolan to the dust-hole and they brought four duplicates; I found a memorandum on him - after Mr. Dolan had said he had better speak the truth I went with him to the rag-hole, he pointed out a bag containing two pieces of linen and a pair of shoes; he said he had taken a great quantity of things and disposed of them to Loynes in Cleveland-street - I went there with a search-warrant, Loynes came in at the same time with us; I told him I had a warrant to search for cloth and other things, and that there was a boy in custody - I did not mention either the boy's name or Mr. Dolan's. Mr. Dolan's evidence is correct; I got on a stool, and found the shears on the top of a cupboard - the boy said he had sold them to him for 4s. - Mr. Dolan said the blue cloth was made expressly to his order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you present when Mr. Dolan was speaking to the boy? A.

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 25th of February I was in the bar; I went up stairs about half-past eight o'clock, to put some silver by; I put the key into the bed-room door, and found it unlocked; I opened the door and saw the drawers turned out, and saw the prisoner standing behind the door, he rushed out and ran down stairs; I raised an alarm; he had pulled two drawers half open, and the two looking-glass drawers quite out and left them on the table; several things were lying on the table which he had taken out of the drawers - out street-door was open at the time; I cannot say how he got up stairs; Mr. Storey, the broker, was the last person in the bed-room; the lock had not been opened by violence, but in the regular way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had received the key from Mr. Storey, I believe? A. Yes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290009"/>

            . I am an auctioneer and appraiser; I had taken an inventory of the value of the effects in the prosecutor's bed-room, on the 25th of February; I left the room about eight or a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening; I believe I locked the door - I am sure of it; I returned the key to Mrs. Burn - I left the house afterwards, and know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Recollect yourself: you at first said, you believed you locked the door; why did you say you believed? A. Because, though I might have locked it, still from circumstances it might be left open; I thought I locked it: when I left the room, the key was in the door; I turned the key and took it out; I believe it was locked: I did not tell the Magistrate I could not swear whether it was open or not; I said I believed I locked it, and I say now, to the best of my belief, I locked it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you a distinct recollection of giving the key to Mrs. Burn? A. I have.</p>

            . I am constable of the parish. The prisoner was delivered to me; I took him to the office, and from there to the watch-house, and when I returned, the things had been put back into the drawer: I asked Mrs. Burn for them, she said she would look them out; she gave them to me on Saturday; when the prisoner was given into my charge, I asked who and what he was, he made no reply; I searched him, and in his coat and waistcoat pockets found twelve skeleton keys; I have tried them to the door, and this one will open it; I also found on him some matches and a phosphorus bottle; I found in his hat a dark lantern, a candle, a pair of gloves, a comb, and handkerchief; I took him to the office; he made a resistance to get from me - that is all I know.</p>
               <p>MRS. BURN. These things are all ours, and were in the drawers, but had been moved out - they are worth about 10s. - more things were moved, but I cannot swear to any but these; nothing was carried quite away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have mixed them with other things? A. No; I put them back into a drawer, but kept them separate; we left the house a few days afterwards and took them with us - I have three children; I have more frocks and articles, but they are made different; I was agitated, but put them all into the drawer, and did not mix them with other things; the servants had access to the room; I had been into the bed-room about half an hour before the broker gave me the key; I have two servants; I am certain nobody had been to the room after me, as I had the key which Mr. Storey had given me; when I went up, I found these things lying on the table.</p>

            . I am constable of Fulham. I, in company with Sanders, apprehended the prisoners together, at the Star public-house, North-end, Fulham, on Tuesday afternoon, the 29th of April, about three or four o'clock, I took two odd stockings which I now produce, off Carter's legs - I asked where he got them; he said he bought them, and had paid for them, and had washed them out himself - that he had had them in his possession three or five weeks, I am not certain which, but am sure it was three weeks at least; he did not say of whom he bought them. When I apprehended Dormer I told him I wanted him about the spoons - he said he knew nothing about them, and I did not question him further.</p>
               <p>CICELY SAYERS. These are my husband's spoons - they have our initials on them, E.C.S.; they are what were missing: I had seen these two stockings at seven o'clock the evening before, and washed them; here are the fellows; I know them by my own work on them -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290010"/>they were marked, but the marks have been cut off those that were stolen; it remains on the fellows - they belong to my son, who is nineteen years old; he does not live at home; I had them to wash for him; they are worth 6d., and the tea-spoons 7s.</p>
               <p>CARTER'S Defence. She is a false-swearing woman; she did not see the stockings for two days after the robbery. I think it is hard she should be allowed to swear to them.</p>
               <p>DORMER'S Defence. On Tuesday morning I was going to look for work, and between the Five Fields and the Bag of Nails public-house, I picked up the spoons, wrapped in paper, and a piece of rag; I asked several people who came by if they were silver; they said they were, and I sold them. I gave Brooks my own name.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROOKS re-examined. I think I had seen Dormer before; I asked his name, and he said Thomas Dormer; I asked his address, and he said, "Mr. Brooks, you know me - I live at No. 5, Perkins'-rents, next door to a customer of your's;" I do not know whether he did live there; I put that address down in a book, in his presence, with the weight of the spoons, which was 1 oz. 1 dwt.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PACE re-examined. Brooks gave me the address which Dormer had given; I went there - it is a house of ill-fame; I could find no such person, nor hear of any such name; I searched every room in the house.</p>

On the night of the 16th of April I was the last person up - I saw the windows communicating with the gardens, at the back of the house, fastened; an iron bar crossed them, and was put into a nook with a spring; there were two windows in the room; all the shutters had similar fastenings; there is a cabinet in that room, with six drawers to it, four of which were locked. I was not alarmed during the night; I saw Offerd, who is Mr. Alexander's gardener, soon after six o'clock in the morning - he is also my gardener. I went down to the room in question, in company with him and my servant; I found every drawer in the cabinet opened and drawers out- the scrutoire was broken open, and everything turned out; the window and the shutters were wide open; the bar was unfastened - it is attached to the shutter at one end, and swings on a pivet; there was a small hole in the shutter, as if it had been bored with an auger; there are bolts on the parlour door, communicating with the passage and the rest of the house - there was a hole made in the door sufficient for a hand to pass through and unbolt it; the door was open, and the bolt drawn; the lock of a cupboard in the hall was forced - I missed a variety of property from that cupboard and other parts of the premises. I am single, and rent the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Tottenham, and was so on the night in question; my box is not a quarter of a mile from Miss Freeman's house. An alarm was given that night, at Mr. Alexander's house: about half-past four o'clock that morning, (after that alarm) I saw both the prisoners up against Scotland-green, which is nearly half a mile from the prosecutrix's house; I was on one side of the road, and they on the other. I went over to them, and said to Jones, "Good morning to you - ayn't you the young man whom I spoke to before this morning;" he said No; I said, "I think you are;" he said, "Ayn't there a little job been done down there to night?" pointing towards the prosecutrix's house; I said Yes - he said, "You never saw me down here before;" he said, "There has been several little jobs done down here lately, and it is time to look out," and he said he would make me remember stopping him on the road; he had stood and talked to me about three minutes, but I had not laid hold of him - he then went away; Rice had gone away, leaving him talking to me; they were both together before: when Jones left he went in the same direction as Rice: he turned out of the road. Soon after this I saw Griffiths, the constable; I followed Jones while he talked to me, and as he was going away he said he would make me remember stopping him on the road; Griffiths and I followed them down into the marsh; we went towards Chingford, to the mills there, and went on to Ponder's-end mills; we did not get sight of them till we got to Ponder's-end; we saw both of them there - Hummerstone was then with us, and he took Jones; Rice left him, and ran away up into Ponder's-end.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was half a mile from the prosecutrix's house that you first met Jones? A. Nearly so; I had heard then that the prosecutrix's house had been robbed; an alarm had been given of the robbery - there were a great many people about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jones alone when you spoke to him? A. They were both together; Rice went on - Jones remained behind talking to me for two or three minutes; I had my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290011"/>watchman's coat on and my rattle and cutl ass - Rice had turned out of the road into Scotland-green, and was out of my sight; there are houses on both sides of the road, there was nothing to prevent my giving an alarm - Jones did not appear anxious to get away; he said if I would follow him, he would tell me where he lived - it is a public place, the houses extend for a quarter of a mile; I saw Jones searched, nothing was found on him that was claimed; he had a little money, no picklock-keys or angers - it rained a little, and was rather a gloomy morning.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean to say that at the time you saw the prosecutor, you had heard of Miss Freemen's robbery? A. No - I had heard of Alexander being robbed, the prisoners did not come over to me - I went over to them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Rice was out of sight before Jones left you? A. Yes because he turned out of the road, I saw him turn out of the road; we found them both together afterwards, I saw them go by Tweed's-mill-field.</p>

            . I am a shepherd. On the 17th of April, about ten minutes before six in the morning - I saw the two prisoners in my master's field - the field belongs to Tyler's farm, and is near Endfield-mill; they were both running when I saw them - I asked what business they had that way, and told them it was no thoroughfare; one of them said something - I cannot exactly say what - they went on, and I tried to meet them; I had my crook in my hand - they went into Mr. George's premises - I followed; they got over his fence, and jumped into a brook of water; I jumped in also, and after I got through the water; I ran up the field, put out my crook, and caught Jones by the leg; I collared him - after I had secured him, I saw Hammet and Griffiths come up: I gave him into their custody; when I took hold of Jones I saw a shift drop from him, and there was a little bit of linen, which I suppose was an old shift - I gave them both to Griffiths, the constable; Rice ran away after I took Jones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RICE. Q. What did you say to us when we were crossing the fields? A. I told you it was no thoroughfare; whether you heard me or not I cannot say - the shift dropped from Jones, whether it was from his pocket or from his clothes, I cannot say; I told him he had dropped something - he said that was not his - I picked it up and put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near was Rice to you when you picked up the shift? A. He was gone away; Jones dropped it - it did not lay in the road Rice had gone - I cannot say that he had gone over just that spot.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a hazy wet morning? A. It might be; I was standing still, when I took it up - I had been running about ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been doing for ten minutes then? A. Sometimes walking and sometimes running; I cannot say how long before I had been running - it might be a minute before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jones walking? A. No - he was getting away as fast as he could; he was nearly exhausted - I could walk nearly as fast as he could run; I had not been walking above a minute - I had not heard of any robbery at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. This was about six o'clock? A. About ten minutes before; it was broad day light; Rice had got quite away when I picked up the shift - I am certain I saw the shift drop from Jones's person.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOHN HAMMET. Q. What time did you first hear of Mr. Alexander's house being broken open? A. It wanted about ten minutes to three o'clock; I met the prisoners about half-past four - they were not above half a mile from the house when the alarm was given- Mr. Franklin and others were about.</p>

            . I live with my father, a barge-master, at Edmonton. On the morning of the 17th of April I joined in pursuit of the prisoners - they went by our place; I followed them all the way to Ponder's-end - they both went through a ditch, and I saw Jones throw a shift or a bundle into the ditch; I went into the ditch, and found a shift and a pair of sleeves - I gave them to Griffiths; the prisoners were then close together, running.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time the shift and sleeves dropped they were both together? A. Yes, as close as they well could be in the ditch; I was about twenty yards from them, and running - they were not touching each other; I found the shift in the ditch through which they both passed; it was a gloomy morning and darkish, but not raining.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How soon after Jones threw the shift down did you see him stopped? A. About two minutes after - I knew him to be the person who had thrown the shift into the ditch.</p>

            . I am a carter, and live at Ponders-end. On the 17th of April, about 6 o'clock in the morning, in consequence of what passed between me and Verdon, I stopped Rice at Ponder's-end - he was running; I pursued him about fifty yards before I took him; I delivered him to Griffiths; I afterwards searched in the direction he had ran, and found a thimble and a seal, which I gave to Griffiths at the office.</p>

            . I am constable of Tottenham. I was coming off duty about twenty minutes before five o'clock, and saw Jones talking to Hammet, the watchman; I afterwards went in pursuit - I never lost sight of Jones; I pursued him about four miles and a half - they got as far as the mills at Ponder's-end; I was not present when they were taken into custody, they were afterwards given into my charge by Harrison and Thirgood; I searched Rice before I took him to the watch-house, and found in his hat a shift and a pair of sleeves - I found a silver crown piece and part of a bracelet in his waistcoat pocket, and a phosphorous-bottle and matches; in his coat pocket I found this chiseel and gimblet, nothing else - I have since applied the chissel to the outside part of the prosecutrix's premises, and to a closet in the drawing-room - it corresponds with the impression made on them; I produce several parcels which I have received from Hummerstone and Verdon; a silver thimble and seal from Thirgood - a shift from Baylie; on our way to the watch-house with the prisoners, I had not held out any threat or promise whatever to them - Jones said, 5l., 10l., or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290012"/>50l. would be no object if I could make it right, and not take him to the watch-house; Rice said nothing - he was by his side at the time; I afterwards went with them to gaol - when they were committed, Jones said, he supposed the might get lagged, but he should not mind, for he had had five years upon the salt-water - I suppose lagged to mean transported; Rice said, he did not mind if he was not topped - I do not know the meaning of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RICE. I should not have used such an expression as that. Witness. I declare positively he did say he should not mind if he was not topped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Jones in a sailor's-dress as he is now? A. No, he had a surtout coat on: I searched him accurately, and found a case-knife on him and 16s. or 18s.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were any sixpences found on Jones? A. Yes, several sixpences, shillings, and half crowns.</p>

               <p>JAMES GRIFFITHS. This match is exactly of the same description, and the same length as the others which were found on Rice.</p>

The house belongs to some orphan children, of whose father I am executor - I have lived there five years; it was let out before I became executor; the rents are paid to Mr. Dawson, the house-agent; the taxes are paid to the agent appointed by the Court of Chancery; I received the rent before the agent was appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased person ever live in the house? - A. Yes, but he did not die there; he died in the country- I lived there long before he died, as a lodger. I must account for the rent for the lodgings to the Court of Chancery; the deceased's name was John George Boehu; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290013"/>have paid no rent since his death. I occupy the first floor- the persons on the ground floor pay rent to us as executors; we are accountable to the receiver for the rent of the whole house; the other executors do not live in the house, nor do the orphans - they are at school; my occupation of the first floor is entirely distinct from the other lodgers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There are nobody but lodgers in the house besides yourself? A. No; we used to carry on business with the people below, for the children; but the partnership has been dissolved by the Court of Chancery; there has been no change whatever in the occupation since the testator's death. The harp was in my own room, on the first floor; I found it on the Sunday following, in the possession of Twigg, at a house in Rose-street, Long-acre - it was worth fifty guineas, and was my property; fifty guineas is a moderate value.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH DAVIS. I was in the service of Mr. Smoat, who lives on the ground floor of the premises occupied by Mr. Delveau, in Conduit-street. On the 8th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, or a few minutes afterwards, the prisoner came to the house - I let him in; he asked me if Mr. Delveau was at home; I told him I did not know - I had frequently seen him at Mr. Delveau's before, and I told him he had better go up stairs and see; he went up; I went down stairs, and saw no more of him - I was at home all the evening, and am certain nobody else called for Mr. Delveau.</p>
               <p>MR. DELVEAU. I never gave the prisoner authority to take the harp to be gilded, or for any purpose; it had been gilded about two months before; no part of the house is occupied by the other executor; neither he nor the children used any part of it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Tothillfields prison on Sunday, the 11th of May, in company with the prisoner's mother; I had some conversation with the prisoner - I had used no inducement or threat to him - on the contrary, I cautioned him; I showed him a printed bill, offering a reward for the recovery of the harp; he said he did not wish any more of those bills to be distributed, nor yet to put the gentleman, or his master, to any expense - his mother said nothing to induce him to confess- I have one of the bills here; he said, "I am the person who took the harp, and I will tell you where you can find it - it is at Rose-street, Long-acre; I asked if he was sure it was there - he said it had been detained there by the landlord, because they could not give a correct account of the number and maker's name, and that it was there still; I directly went to Rose-street, with his mother; Mr. Delveau came there afterwards - I there found the harp now produced; Twigg was there - the prisoner did not mention the number of the house, but described it as well as he could: I went to No. 10, near a gateway, where Twigg resides; I waited till he came home - I showed him the bill; he said he had got the harp, and showed it to me in the parlour of No. 9; Delveau claimed it; he mentioned the number of it before he saw it - it has been in my possession ever since, and is here. The prisoner was detained on the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. DELVEAU. I know the harp to be mine, by the number and maker's name; it is engraved on a brass plate.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH DAVIS re-examined. I had not been in Mr. Delveau's room from the time he went out till he returned, nor had any one else, to my knowledge; the harp was not missed till he came home.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was taken up for this offence, but was not concerned in it; the prisoner came to me on Friday the 25th of April, and he came again on Sunday - he said he had been into Rolls' house the night before, and opened the cellar door, and went down; that he got up into the tap-room, and discovered a cloth before the parlour door window; that he lifted it up, and saw Mr. Rolls sitting in the parlour - he then made the best of his way out; that he took nothing that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you this? A. I had met him in Oxford-street, I was in the habit of using this house - I did not mention this till I was taken up, I drive a horse and cart for Mr. Silvester a bricklayer; I left him on Easter Sunday, and have had no work since. I am now in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2nd of May Mr. Rolls desired me to look for Lorter, I apprehended him at Lisson-grove; I went to see the prisoner in Tothill-fields in company with the prosecutor, and told him that Lorter had told me all about it - and about the handkerchiefs being taken, he said he had taken two handkerchiefs on the 25th; and pawned one in St. Giles' he took them out of the bar, he did not say how he got into the house - he said Lorter knew as much about it as he did, he mentioned nothing about the Saturday night.</p>

Ford;" he wrote this in my presence - I cannot exactly say what money I paid him; it was in cash and bills - the larger part was in cash.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How happens the entry to be in this form? A. It is usual for us to have such a memorandum made by the person receiving the money; I have a perfect recollection of paying it to him on that day.</p>
               <p>MR. BOYD re-examined. (Looking at Mr. Mules' book;) this memorandum is in the prisoner's hand-writing; he has been fourteen years with us - here is the receipt cash book, to which the prisoner and all the clerks have access when they receive money; there is no entry of the cash received from Mr. Mules on the 1st of April; here is an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290015"/>entry in the prisoner's hand-writing, dated the 3d of April(reads) "J. Mules, creditor by bill, due 17th of April, 73l. 15s. 4d.; ditto 5th of May, 20l.; cheque 8l. - total 101l. 15s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other entry in any book in which any cash is entered, on account of Mr. Mules? A. None but this book; the prisoner left our employ on the 11th of April, and up to that time we had no knowledge of Mr. Mules having paid more than 101l. 15s. 4d. - the prisoner was apprehended on the 11th of April, but not on this charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He was in a confidential situation? A. He was our head clerk; our bills are entered before they become due - it was his daty to account for bills the very day he received them, not to keep them till they became cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not, in fact, hold bills till they became due, and having received the cash, then make the entry? A. Decidedly not - he never had authority from us to advance money to our customers - I am certain of that; I never knew of such a thing, and if he had done it I should not have approved of it; if a customer wanted assistance he ought to have asked us to do it; I never knew of his advancing money to one Buck - this is the first time I have heard of it; Buck is a customer of ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that 50l. was not advanced to Buck by the prisoner with your approbation? A. Never to my knowledge - nor did he ever advance money to Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know of it, and approve of it afterwards? A. Never; Davis was a customer; Buck wanted bills renewed once or twice, which the firm did: the prisoner has never advanced money for bills before they became due - I will swear that most positively.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he ever authorized to keep money in his hands after he received it? A. No - no sum whatever, nor a bill of any kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After he received bills, where should they he deposited? A. They should be brought into the partner's counting-house, with the cash-book entry to correspond, the partner signs the book, and they are put by; this memorandum is signed by Mr. French as having received the bills entered.</p>

            . I am a conveyancer - my office is in Tokenhouse-yard - I know the prisoner. When he was in the Compter I carried a message for him to Mr. Mules by his desire: I delivered the exact message he gave me; I told Mules, by desire of the prisoner, that a person wanted to speak to him in the neighbourhood of Newgate-street - I had a coach, and wished him to go with me to see him; he went with me to the Compter, where he saw Ford - I told him on the road that it was the prisoner wished to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. About two years and a half; I had some dealings with him, and ever since that I have been an acquaintance of his; there was an account between us when I saw him in the Compter - there is a transaction between us, which will make the balance against me more than 200l.; I never dealt with the prosecutors - I have taken friends from the country to their house to make purchases.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner applied to you lately for payment of the money you are indebted to him? A. I beg to explain - there were securities in my hands; I had engaged to pay him money, but had not paid it - I promised to pay him money in February and March, but did not do it; I had securities in my hand, out of which I was to pay him money, besides what I owed him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was this transaction entirely independent of the prosecutor's business? A. It has nothing to do with their business.</p>
               <p>MR. MULES. In consequence of a message from the last witness I went to the prisoner at the Compter - he told me that a portion of the money he had received from me he had not given me credit for; he said a female had applied to him for assistance, and he had lent her a sum of money - he did not say what amount; he then took a large quantity of notes from his pocket, and requested me to receive them, and desired me to alter my book; he said he did not know the exact amount he had given me credit for, but the money he had in his hand would be sufficient to balance the account - I said I could not think of receiving any money whatever, and immediately withdrew; what amount he produced I do not know - it looked like notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You understood him to mean he had not given you credit in his employer's books? A. Yes - I made that communication to Messrs. Boyd; they knew nothing about it before I gave the information.</p>

            . I am one of the firm; the letter F. to this entry is my writing; I never received any account from the prisoner, of his having received more from Mr. Mules than is contained in this entry; we have received other money before, but not near this date.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you know of any advance of 50l. made by the prisoner to Buck? - A. No; he never communicated anything of the kind to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "Don't let Buck know that: I know of it?" A. I did not; I do not know of his ever having advanced Buck money - I swear that most positively; if I were in doubt about it I should say so; it is my province to keep the cash book - I balance it whenever it is convenient to me - I have no stated period; nobody balances the book but me - it is quite uncertain when I balance; I had not done it between the 1st and 11th of April - it is not a very easy job; I at times begin it and cannot finish: I had not balanced since the beginning of the year, but I have since the 11th of April; the prisoner was never allowed to hold bills or money; the moment he received them it was his duty to enter them in the cash received book, and then bring them to the partners in their counting-house; I have found fault with him for keeping cash even ten minutes. Buck has dishonoured two or three bills; I believe there was one due on the 4th of March, and another on the 4th of April; he sent some money on account of the bill, stating that he could not provide the balance, and requesting us to draw for it; we ourselves provided what he was short - it was not provided by the prisoner. I have had frequent communications with him respecting Buck's account.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the prisoner advanced him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290016"/>50l., and you told him not to let Buck know that you knew of it? A. I remember nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever tell the prisoner to keep or use the money he received from Mules, to satisfy this bill of Bucks? A. Oh no, certainly not; I did not know he had received it when Buck's bill was due; I could not detect anything wrong by balancing my books, unless I was told it had been paid.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the amount of Buck's bill? - About 280l.; he provided 130l., and, I think, a 16l. bill. I believe it came in a letter, expressing his regret that he could not provide the balance, and requesting it might stand over, or be drawn for; we sent the whole of the money to our banker's, and took up the bill, out of our own funds, placing what he sent to his account; the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with it; he might have been sent to take the bill up; I was quite ignorant of his having received more money from Mules than is entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am sure I can bring to Mr. French's recollection that about fifteen months ago Buck came and told me he could not take up his bill; I said it was almost the first bill of his, and I thought it might injure his credit with the house if they knew it - I advanced him the 50l. myself; I went into the counting-house and told Mr. French, he said, "Well, if you have lent him 50l., keep it to yourself, you can get it from Buck better than us, if he is aware that we lent it, we shall not get if from him."</p>
               <p>MR. FRENCH. I have some slight recollection of 50l. being advanced about fifteen months ago; I considered before, that he was speaking of a recent transaction; it was a matter that did not concern us at all, and made no impression on my mind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not aware when I entered the Court that this charge would have been gone into first, nor did I know this indictment would have been gone on with until Monday; I was taken up on the 11th of April on a charge which I defy them to substantiate, well knowing that one of the partners of the firm paid the money, which they charge me with stealing; they said at the Mansion House that this charge was sufficient for the ends of justice, and they would not enter on that for 105l.; I do not believe they suppose for a moment that I took the 105l. to appropriate to my own use to defraud them of it; I solemnly declare in the presence of my Maker I never thought of defrauding them, nor can they prove it before any Court; let them bring forward any charge and I can defend it; I have been upwards of fourteen years in their employ, their returns are about 300,000l. a year upwards of four millions and a half of money passed through my hands during the fourteen years, and I never defrauded them, nor had I any cause to be dishonest; it is well known the first houses have bondsmen for their clerks, but I had none, my character was sufficient; I had no tie - I admit I received the sum charged on the 29th of March - on the 11th of April I was taken into custody, and had possession of 108l. about thirteen days, and after having served them faithfully for fourteen years, I say it is very dishonourable to prosecute me on this charge; I was not aware I had committed a felony by retaining that money - the first time I was aware of the circumstance it came from Mr. Harmer himself, I told him everything. As to the first charge which I expected to be tried on, I am certain you would have acquitted me; I was told it was the only charge that would be preferred; the prosecutors sent to me saying, if I would plead guilty, that was all they wanted, but they must have a conviction - although in the eye of the law I may be guilty, it was unintentional; I have on one or two occasions lent the prosecutors money for a few days, and they have lent me money; once a customer owed them about 2100l.; about two years ago he was in difficulties, I met him, his father, and uncle, he said, if he could get 500l. or 600l. he thought he could get through his difficulties, I persuaded his father and uncle to lend it to him, and wished to place that money to the account of my employers, and got some persons who threatened to arrest him for 260l., to take my acceptance; before it became due he was a bankrupt, they threatened to arrest me, and my employers advanced me part of the money. I have perhaps in a dozen cases advanced money in this way; we collect our debts every month - a person has paid me 150l., and I have paid my employers on their account 300l. deducting the interest which is allowed for prompt payment, and I thought as I had to pay a Miss Walker 260l. on the 29th of March, I might take the 105l. as she wanted the money, but I considered it merely a debtor and creditor's account, having paid them at times more than I received - I should have repaid the money the next day, or the day after had I not been taken up. This 105l. would not have been discovered, but the moment I was aware of the charge being serious, I sent for Mules and presented him with 126l. to make up the deficiency, telling him, I was not aware of the serious crime. I feel confident you will acquit me of any intention of defrauding them of a farthing; they have kept all my papers, memorandums, and letters which I received from female friends, and they have kept notes of hand and other property to six times this amount; I cannot think they it is, unless they wish to crush me entirely; even my friends have been deterred from coming forward to this Court to speak to my character, from the vindictive manner they have conducted this prosecution. Instead of a prosecution it is a persecution; if I had pleaded guilty Mr. Boyd would have recommended me to mercy, but a conviction they say they must have; I believe if my life was in their hands they must take it, but I have no doubt they have a motive: perhaps they fear my getting into other houses and injuring their connexions; there are other circumstances I could mention, but I will not behave to them as they have to me, I will not even allude to them; there are prosecutions over their heads, and they suppose I might be called as a witness, and if I am convicted my evidence would be done away with. I think that is one motive. I hope you will take into your serious consideration how this prosecution has been got up, how conducted, and that they would not have been in possession of the circumstances, had it not come from me at first, in my over anxiety to do them justice.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Pancras; I know New Inn-yard, Tottenham-court-road, where this stable is. On the night of the 10th of May, I was passing by there, but did not go down the yard; about three o'clock in the morning as I was going by the yard to the watch-house with a charge, I saw a horse come out of the yard with the prisoner Rowe on its back; I proceeded on with my charge - this was about eight minutes before three o'clock. I knew Rowe's person well before - I knew him by the name of Cooper - I have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you tell anybody of it that night? A. I told the master (the prosecutor) of it at four o'clock in the morning, and gave him a description of the prisoner: I did not mention his name- it was on Sunday morning, the 11th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to deliver up your coat at the watch-house that morning, did you mention it to the night officer? A. I did; his name is Burchman - I did not tell him the name of the person I had seen on the horse; I knew him well by sight - I described him as a short stiff man, and described his dress; I swear I gave Burchman that description; I mentioned it to all who were at the watch-house; Burchman was present, but I did not mention any name; I have known Rowe for twelve months by name, but not by the name he is indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any name to Burchman, or to any body till you heard Rowe was in custody? A. No, I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290019"/>- a reward of 10l. was offered, but I never knew that till I had described the prisoner; I did not mention his name till I heard of the reward; I did not hear that 10l. was offered till the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had known Rowe's name for twelve months, what is the reason that you did not mention it to your own night constable? A. I could not recollect the name at all; I described his dress - I did not describe his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you said it was a short thick man? A. Yes, but I never mentioned his name; I described his dress - I did not particularly describe him to Burchman, but he was present; I was not able to recollect his name till after I heard a reward was offered - that did not bring it to my memory.</p>

               <p>Q. What brought the name to your memory? A. I saw the man at Marlborough-street - I saw him that night, but he goes by so many nick names.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Burchman mention the robbery to you? A. I will not be sure which of them mentioned it - whether I mentioned it to him or he to me first; the other watchman was talking about the horse; I said I saw a horse that morning, and said it was a short stiff man, and had a dark dress on; I said that in the presence of several; Burchman was in the chair; I heard of the reward between eleven and twelve o'clock on the Sunday night - I did not see Rowe till the Thursday following; I never mentioned his name, only to my fellow watchman, Halliher; I mentioned the name to him on the Monday; that was after I heard of the reward; I never had a quarrel with the prisoner: I was once at a fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not been continually sneering at you about that fight? A. He never insulted me any more than at the fight; I was chucking a skittle ball; and he gave me a push down at the fight; I have no ill will to him; I was not fighting myself at all.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago was this fight? A. About eighteen months; I have seen him about the streets at nights since that; I never knew him by the name of Rowe, before he was apprehended; I knew him by the name of Cooper - when I saw him in custody he was at Marlborough-street, among other persons; I looked round the yard where they were, and pointed him out; I described him to the constable of the night, between five and six o'clock in the morning, when we were going off duty.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 11th of May, I and Waters were going to the watch-house with a charge, and saw the horse come out of the New Inn yard, with a man on it; I was compelled to stop for it to pass - I did not know the man before, but I knew him afterwards; it was the prisoner Rowe; I am positive he is the man - I took particular notice of his clothes and gaiters, and am certain of him; I pointed him out among fifteen prisoners at Marlborough-street; I went on with my charge to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never knew him before? A. No; it was about 5 minutes before 3 o'clock in the morning; we were taking a drunken man to the watch-house, and had hold of him; he was rather angry - we had to stop till the horse passed by; it came out quite easy; I went to the watch-house with Waters - Burchman was in the chair; I did not hear Waters mention the prisoner's name; he came to me on the Wednesday, and told me I was to go to Marlborough-street; and said the man's name was Cooper; I am sure he said that on Wednesday; I did not hear of a reward till Thursday; Waters did not tell me of the reward on Sunday night -Wednesday night was the first time he mentioned Cooper's name to me; I never heard of the reward till after I came out of the office; I then saw it stuck up in the office; Waters told me there was a reward on Wednesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear you never heard of it till you came out of the office on Thursday? A. I mistook you- he told me of it on Wednesday.</p>

            . I am a carrier, and live in New Inn-yard, Tottenham-court-road. On Saturday night, the 10th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw Rowe facing the prosecutor's stables; he had no business there- he does not live in the yard; I went to the privy, knocked at the privy door - nobody answered, but at last Finch came out of the privy - that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first mention Rowe's name? A. I told Mr. Turtle's son on the Sunday morning. I had a bill filed against me some time ago, and was in prison for an assault; I do not know how many years ago that was; I was once accused of robbing a man of 15s., but was innocent - I was here about a fortnight for the robbery; I was in Clerkenwell prison - I was not there more than three weeks; that was for the assault - it was about two years ago; I was imprisoned here on the charge of robbery in December; I was brought here from the New prison - I was in custody on that charge five or six weeks altogether, as near as I can recollect; I was not tried - I was never in prison on any other charge - I was taken on suspicion about three coats one Saturday night; I cannot tell how long ago - it was after the assault; the watchman stopped me, and I was taken before a Magistrate, but I was not in prison about the coats, nor for anything, except what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you sent to prison for the assault? A. No, I was discharged; when I was stopped with the coats I was sent down for bail; and when I was brought here for a robbery I was discharged, without being indicted; I have known Finch many years - I have had no quarrel with the prisoners, and have no malice against either of them.</p>

            . I live in the same house as Finch, at No. 7, Lower Fitzroy-place, Fitzroy-square. I never spoke to Rowe in my life, nor yet to Finch; I have repeatedly seen Rowe, but am not acquainted with him; Mrs. Woodward is landlady of the house; she is not here - she cannot come. On the night of the 10th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290020"/>of May I saw both the prisoners come into the house at half-past twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess; I was up till near four, and nobody went out of the house, for I fastened the door after them; I am in the habit of sitting up; I am an odd woman, and go out to wash in the day; I sit up to do little jobs for myself; I came in about half-past twelve o'clock that night, and left the door open - these two young men came in; it was impossible for them to go out without my seeing them - they slept in the house; Finch lodged there, in the next room to me; Woodward has been here two days; she is not very well- her husband is a tailor, and he will not let her come.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time of night do they come in? A. Between twelve and one o'clock; it might be a quarter or half-past - it was not later - I was in the back parlour till after three o'clock; Finch lodged in the front room; there is a back door leading into a small yard - there is no admittance the back way. I was not examined at Marlborough-street - I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Justice what you had to say? A. Yes; I did not mention Rowe's name - I said the two men came in; I did not confine my evidence to Finch- Finch is a married man, and has a wife there; Rowe came in and staid all night, and what made me curious was, the landlady said she did not like two men being in one room; Finch could not be out at one o'clock, or Rowe either, for I saw them come in, and I fastened the door.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you examined on oath at the office? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You think it impossible for them to be out at one o'clock? A. Quite so; I have seen Rowe before repeatedly on the stairs, and have heard his name; I was busy ironing a few things for myself, with the back room door open all the time - that is how I am confident- I do not generally keep my door open, but it was a very close night.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is always close in a small room, when you are ironing - do not you always sit with your door open? A. Repeatedly, every day; I am confident neither of them went out.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason you give for the landlady not being here, is that she is ill? A. She is not very well, and their work is wanted, so they cannot come, and they know no more than what I can say, as I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Finch in the habit of bringing Rowe home with him? A. He was at meal times; I never remember his bringing him home at night, but I am seldom at home myself; it struck me as remarkable, and my landlady said, "What, is two men come in?" and she followed them up stairs, to see, and I said, "Why, it is that Mr. George Rowe."</p>
               <p>JURY to THOMAS HALLIHER. Q. You state, that when you were going by the end of the yard with a charge, you were obliged to stop, in consequence of Rowe coming out with a horse; you swear it was him? A. Yes; it was twilight; I had a full view of him, and am certain it was him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you got up you saw the prisoner standing motionless, and the others at a distance behind? A. Yes; he stood in front of me; I never said I was not hurt - I was not sober nor yet intoxicated; I had taken a bottle of wine with a friend - I was stunned with the blow, or I should have known what passed; I did not go to the office till I was summoned, which was on Thursday - I never said. I believe the prisoner did not rob me; I said I believed he was labouring under a state of intoxication; I was waited upon by two women who said they were his mother and sister - they came twice - I did not tell them I did not believe he intended to rob me, or anything like it; I had ordered a new hat; I gave them the hatter's address, and said if they would go and pay for the hat, I would not appear against him, and I did receive a new hat - he is the person who knocked me down; I cannot say he intended to rob me - it was not my wish to prosecute him; I heard nothing about his being held to bail for assaulting me - I got a hat of 23s. value; I did not pay for it - I told these women I had paid for a bottle of wine and received change for half a sovereign; but what it was I could not tell - I did not say I could not tell whether I had put it into my purse or not; I did put it in with other silver - the officer called and told me he would be before the Magistrate on the Monday; I understand he told the Magistrate I was unable to attend, but I was able although<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290021"/>I was greatly abused - I was up at five o'clock that morning, and at the hatters by seven; I told the officer if it was consistent with his duty, to let the prisoner go, after I had seen his mother, as I could not prove he had stolen the articles - I might have lost them before he met me; my handkerchief could not have dropped out of my pocket, my coat was buttoned up - after I was summoned I went to his mother to see if he was a deserving character; as a friend said I had done wrong by shewing so much lenity - I then saw the same two women and another, but did not tell them I was not sober, and could not tell whether I took the change of the half sovereign or not - I said, I did not wish to prosecute, but not that I did not believe he did not intend to rob me; I told the Magistrate I was unable to say he had robbed me, or that he intended, as nothing was found on him; that was my only reason - I will not swear I did not lose my money before; I had not drank to excess - I believe he was intoxicated, but cannot say to what extent.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the memorandum you wrote for the hatter's address? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner and two others beating the prosecutor - that was before he fell; I saw the prisoner knock him down - they all three ran away immediately he fell; I did not see either of them stop, or endeavour to take anything from him; I was crossing the road when they ran - that was before the prosecutor had got up - I am sure of that; I pursued the prisoner, and my partner went after the other two, but did not overtake them; I took the prisoner - he had run round the coach stand - there were about three coaches on the stand; I brought him back to the prosecutor immediately - he had run about fifty yards; we searched for the hat, but could not find it; I did not see either of them take it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you brought the prisoner back was the prosecutor on the ground, or had he got up? A. He was up; I gave the prisoner to a watchman, and went away - the prosecutor appeared intoxicated, and said he had lost his hat; I think the prisoner appeared sober - I am sure he is the man who knocked the prosecutor down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a good deal of beating before you got up, I suppose? A. No, not that I saw; I ran across, and they ran away - I saw all three strike him; he was bleeding at the nose and mouth; I took the prisoner about one hundred yards, and then gave him to another watchman, as I had to go to another desperate row; I am certain the prosecutor had got up before I returned to him with the prisoner - he was not standing motionless by him when he got up; I brought him up to him by the collar in custody - the other men had run away; the prosecutor could not have seen them a little way behind him; I went before the Magistrate the same day, and expected to find the prosecutor there - I did not tell the Magistrate I had seen him, and he was unable to leave his bed; I swear that deliberately - I never said so; the Magistrates sent me to tell him to come on Thursday, but he did not appear then, and I told the Magistrate he did not wish to appear, not liking his name to be in the newspapers; Mr. Taylor had told me so; the Magistrate ordered a summons - he did not tell me he could not swear the prisoner was the man who robbed him; De Caster, the night constable, told the Magistrate on the Monday, that the gentleman was so ill-used he dare say he could not attend; the Magistrate talked of holding the prisoner to bail for an assault.</p>

On the Tuesday after this happened I went with Esther Porter to Mr. Taylor; I saw him at Mr. Barnet's, a surgeon, where he is assistant; he said nothing to me about the half sovereign - he said he had no wish to prosecute the prisoner, and did not believe he intended to rob him; he said if he had his hat made good it would be all very well - he did not mention the loss of his purse or money; he said "I am a hat and handkerchief out of pocket," and if that was restored it would be very well.</p>

            . My husband is a gentleman's coachman. I accompanied Mrs. Moss to Mr. Taylor - he said to the best of his recollection all he had was the change of a half sovereign, which he had given for a bottle of wine, and he was not quite sure whether he had taken up the change or not; and that he rather believed the prisoner's intention was to rescue a cabriolet man from the watchman, than to rob him; and if his hat was made good he should hear nothing more of the matter; he said nothing about losing a purse or money; I was with the prisoner's mother when she paid for the hat - I went on Sunday with his mother to Taylor; he said the hat was not new, but if we made him amends for the crape and hat it would do.</p>

As we were taking him to the watch-house Hales came up to him, and said, "Young man, shall I go and acquaint your friends of your being taken;" he said, "Oh, No - I want nothing of you;" he followed him to the watch-house; the officers afterwards went out and brought him in - I found one of my shirts in his (Hales) hat. I had seen all my things safe the night before, at ten o'clock; the officer found two duplicates in Hales' fob - Higgs did not know he was in custody. The coat is worth 38s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Higgs did not know Hales was in custody? A. He did not; we had taken Higgs into the watch-house, about twenty minutes before we came out for Hales - he did not attempt to escape, but denied the charge; he did not lodge with me - I never saw him before; I had left Higgs in bed when I went out at six o'clock in the morning.</p>

No - I am certain I saw him write it himself, when I paid him the money - he wrote<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290023"/>this memorandum on the bill, with his own hand; when I paid him the money I was close to him.</p>

I have examined the book most carefully, and repeatedly, and it is not entered: I have not carried my examination personally further than the 3d of August; we balance our books daily - there is no such entry in any other book, and he never accounted for the money; that I have ascertained.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you another book called a ledger? A. We have; the prisoner had no business whatever to write in the ledger; I am bound to add, he was at other times, during a press of business, allowed to enter in the ledger, but not at this time, and it was not his duty: he was never allowed to do it except when specially appointed; one side of the ledger is a copy from the cash received book - there are no original entries in it; I find, that in our ready money ledger, Mr. Forsyth is charged with goods, 182l. 2s. 8d., and 48l. 3s. 3d.; those charges are in the hand-writing of the original posting clerk, and there is on the credit side an entry in the prisoner's writing, "3d of August, 210," which purports to be the number of a bill - "77," denoting the folio; the entry is posted from the cash received book, but there is no such entry in that book; the next item is 2l. 17s. 11d. interest, then 228l., importing that that sum had been posted from folio 77 of the cash received book; the 228l. odd, added to 2l. 17s. 11d., balances the sums of 182l. 8s. and 48l. 3s. 3d. - the bill should have been marked 210, and given over to me, but it was never done; the account is closed in the ledger by this entry, and we should never have thought of applying for the money - but the entry is altogether a deception; it is a fictitious entry. The account produced by Mr. Forsyth is in the prisoner's hand-writing; he left our service on the 2d of January, this year; we had not then discovered the transaction; if we had known of Mr. Forsyth having had these goods, we should have applied for the money within a month, he being a ready money customer. The prisoner went from our employ to Mr. Ellis, of Ludgate-street; we afterwards made a discovery, but not of this transaction - I went to Mr. Ellis', with Mr. Ashurst, our solicitor, on the 9th or 10th of March - I saw the prisoner there, and said to him, "There are some entries in the books, made by you, which we cannot understand; I wish you to go with us and explain them" - his answers were confused; I cannot give them, except that he asked to go to get his hat, in great agitation of manner - he said, "Let me go and get my hat;" we said we must go with him - he made a motion to go to the door at which we had entered, but suddenly turned to a French glass door, forced it open violently, ran across some leads into another house belonging to Mr. Ellis; we followed him, crying, "Stop, Watt - Stop thief!" he escaped out of a back door; I did not see him again till he was in custody, about a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the endorsement on this bill of exchange, and tell me whose hand-writing it is? A. It is endorsed by Mr. Forsyth, and this receipt, "August 4, 1827, received the contents,

            . I am a clerk to Messrs. Glyn and Co. This Cardiff Bank bill was brought to our house for payment - I paid it with a 200l. Bank note, No. 9529, dated the 9th of July, 1827; here is the book with the entry, in my own hand-writing.(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Symer, Dundee. - August 6th, 106, Fore-street.</p>
               <p>SIR, - The enclosed also place to my credit with the British Linen Company - is it meant by your letter that no money deposited in your bank can be withdrawn by means of a cheque? I am led to put this question from your request that I send a receipt endorsed, when money is required. I may not withdraw the whole at once, it may be part; if any respectable party were presenting a cheque for payment from me, would it be dishonoured? I regret giving you trouble by such inquiries, but am compelled to do so, from ignorance of the system adopted by your bank. Oblige me by advising of the receipt, as under. Yours, respectfully, WM. WATT.</p>
               <p>N. B. I shall desire a gentleman to call and pay 2s. 5d. postage of the last remittance, which I ommitted to pay.</p>
               <p>200l. No. 9529 - 20l. No. 1735. - Total 220l.</p>
               <p>MR. DILLON. The figures, and all this letter are his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Nothing passed at Ellis' about this transaction? A. No; the ledger is posted by a young man named Wilkins; we can refer to it at any time, and cheque it by the cash book, if we chose. The prisoner very seldom made an entry in the ledger; I cannot find the hand-writing of any other clerk in it, except the one who kept it - we only keep one cash received book, but have several ledgers. Boon and Slater are in our employ; it is not the business of either of them to make entries in the ledger - I am certain Boon never did - it is barely possible that Slater might; the number 210 is merely to distinguish that it was a bill and not cash; the whole sum is entered as 228l., not 232l.; I can explain that - Mr. Forsyth made a separate purchase, which came to 4l. 8s. 6d., and that is the next entry. The prisoner received money, and Slater also. The prisoner was never employed as an entering clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose these entries were made by one person, the clerk who came next would see them? A. Why, the clerk who enters in the book has a great deal to do, and would attend to nothing but what he was about; he certainly ought to have been sharp enough to discover the entry.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290024"/>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it your practice to look into that ledger often? A. No; we look into the cash received book - if we find the money posted in the ledger we conclude all is right.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Can you say positively, from your recollection, that this bill was not paid to you? A. Not from my recollection, but from the course of our business, I say decidedly not - we have no entry of it except this fictitious one in the ledger: if it had been in the cashbook it would have been regular - the person posting the ledger has the cash-book at his side; it is not called over by one, and entered by another.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If that payment had been entered in the book, should you not have discovered it? A. Yes; if it had been entered there and not brought to account I should have discovered it that day, the cash would have been wrong; this entry could not be made by mistake, for he has put the folio from which it purports to be brought, and no such entry is in that folio. I am positive this 200l. bill has never passed through our hands, it has none of our marks on it whatever.</p>

I followed the prisoner, in company with two others, from my own house to Fetter-lane; they went into Sewell's shop - I saw the prisoner and one of the others come out; the prisoner was in the act of putting something into his pocket, which he had some difficulty in doing; I did not see what became of the third person - I sent for Mrs. Sewell; the prisoner and his companion walked up a court, which is a thoroughfare; I stood at the end of the court, and saw the prisoner pull something out, which he gave to his companion; I went up, collared the prisoner, and told him to pull those things out of his pocket; his companion then struck me on the back of my neck; I kept hold of the prisoner, pushed him into a little cheesemonger's shop, and told him to pull out what he had in his pocket; he pulled out his own handkerchief and a new gauze one; Mrs. Sewell claimed it; it was some time before the constable came; he asked me to give him a little liberty; he got on a hamper, and then gave me a severe kick in a certain place, but I held him, and he was secured; he also attempted to stab me with a knife, and tore my trousers and drawers.</p>

(looking at it,) - I have put my name on it; he said he had brought that bill in payment of two drafts which I had upon him - one, which was for 200l., became due that day, the other was for 209l. 19s., and was due on the 26th of December, and was unpaid; I handed the draft of 500l. to my clerk in Fehrmann's presence - he said he would call the following day, in order to have the discount of the bill adjusted, and to receive a cheque for the balance; he did call on the 16th, and received the difference from my clerk - I was present, but did not adjust it with him; my clerk had the charge of the bill - he kept it some time, and then paid it into my bankers; the balance paid to the prisoner was 84l. odd.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, previous to the 15th of January, had you made any communication to the prisoner on the subject of the bill over due, and the one about to become due on the 15th of January? A. Yes; I am not certain whether I sent my clerk, or whether I wrote to him, but I applied to him for payment of the draft; and on the 15th of January he stated that he was obliged to me for waiting for the payment of the bill till that date. I had not heard or seen him since my application; he had made a reply to it; my own hand-writing is on this 500l. bill - I also know it by its general character; I wrote upon it previous to its being paid into my bankers - I do not think I ever saw it after that morning till the evening it became due; when it was returned to me with the words, "acceptance forged" written on it, which was not on it when I parted with it - the acceptance was on it when I received it, or I should not have taken it - the endorsement by the payee to Fehrmann was also on it; I am not aware of any alteration on it since I received it from him, except the words, "acceptance forged" being on it; and an endorsement purporting to be by Messrs. Lubbock - also my own endorsement which I have struck out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You knew at the time you have been speaking of, that the prisoner was in the employ of Messrs. Ward &amp; Co.? A. Yes; they are merchants of Broad-street; I did not know it of my own knowledge, but was informed so - I made no inquiry as to the bill being genuine, before he called on the 16th; he left it with me on the 15th - I cannot tell the time, but it was previous to my leaving business before dinner; if it was not in the morning, I should think it was early in the afternoon - he called about the middle of the day, on the 16th I think; I had plenty of time to make inquiry about the bill, but did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume you speak from the general appearance of the instrument when you say you are not aware of any alteration, except what you have mentioned? A. Yes: I see a number which my clerk added when he entered it; that is, No. 920 - I cannot tell whether these other numbers were on it, or the letter S. in the right hand lower corner.</p>
               <p>Q. I see under the words, "In need with Messrs. Doxat and Co." is, "St. L. &amp; Co.;" are you able to say whether that was on it when you took it? A. No, I did not look at those particulars; I observed, "Doxat and Co." on it - I am not sure whether those words were there or not; I observed the name of Rothschild on the acceptance, and that satisfied me - I should state that the acceptance was not a very legible one; but I have been in the habit of receiving bills on him, and thought the acceptance was similar; I believe the prisoner had told me he was in expectation of an acceptance from the Mauritius, and I think he said, from the Rio de la Plata - he also spoke of a remittance from Germany: I do not know of his having any speculation with Weise and Co. - the two bills I had previously held, were drawn by Weise and Co. on him; I had had other bills drawn by them on him some time ago, and paid by the prisoner - they are hat-manufacturers; I never heard of bills being transmitted from abroad with the endorsement in blank, to be inserted by the correspondent - I do not know whether there is such a firm as Stephen Lurman, Son, and Co., abroad.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Do you know of any such firm as Saint Lurman and Co., or Stephen Lemain and Co.? A. I do not.</p>

            . I am clerk to Sir John Lubbock and Co., bankers, of Mansion-house-street; I presented this bill on the 12th of April to Mr. Clemson, Messrs. Masterman's clearing-clerk, at the clearing-house in Lombard-street; I left it in his possession, and a very few minutes after that, I saw the prisoner at the clearing-house, it was about twelve o'clock; he said, "You have a bill of 500l. accepted at Mastermans, by Mr. Rothschild" - I referred to my book, and said, I had delivered it to Messrs. Masterman's clerk; I saw him go to Masterman's clerk - it is not usual to apply at a clearing-house to take up bills; it is sometimes done, I believe - I never gave up a bill; I have been applied to for them, and refused - the bill was brought to me again in the course of the afternoon; I did not receive it, but the gentleman who brought it to me took it to our house - this was between four and five o'clock; the words, "Acceptance forged" were then written on it - I do not know whether the gentleman who produced it to me, was one of Messrs. Masterman's firm, or a clerk; the same person took it away again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know that person? A. I did not; he is here - the words, "Acceptance forged," are in large characters - whether anything else has been written on it, I do not know; I received it on the 12th of April, with a number of other bills to take to the clearing-house; I received them from no one - they are laid on the desk by one of the partners, and I take them off when I want them; I only know what hands it had been in from the endorsement - I presume it was kept in our safe while in our hands.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. John Masterman and Co.; there are four other partners I believe; On the 12th of April I was at the clearing-house, and received this bill from Messrs. Lubbock's clerk, to enter in my book to their credit, as it purports to be payable at our house; after I had received it, the prisoner applied to me at the clearing-house - he said he wanted to take up a bill of 500l. of Rothschild's acceptance, which I had received from Lubbocks; I told him I could not give it up without authority from our house, and referred him to them, he then went away; he assigned as his reason that he wanted to send it into the country; his application being rather unusual, induced me to look at the bill, and I did not think the signature of Mr. Rothschild authentic; I never gave up bills on such an application. I made a minute of the bill in my book and took it home; I delivered it to Mr. Daniel Mildred, one of our firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say it was rather an unusual application; I gather from that, that you have known such applications made? A. I have; persons, not in the employ of bankers, have access to the clearing-house; there were not so many clerks there at this time as there would have been in the morning; there could be only one from each house at that time, that would be about thirty; I am accustomed to see Mr. Rothschild's acceptance daily; the bill had not been actually cleared when the prisoner applied to me; I had not taken it down in my book - it was returned to Messrs. Lubbock's; we do not consider bills actually cleared till five o'clock; it had been taken down in account.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You do not consider the transaction complete till five o'clock? A. No; after the application was made, I entered the bill in my book, but that was not a final settlement.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. It is usual to take an account of all bills you have on that house? A. Yes, in order to allow them in account, if there are funds to meet them; there is sometimes a difference in Mr. Rothschilds acceptance, some are more legible than others, that is the only difference; I never knew his first names entirely omitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any first names to this? looking at it) A. Here is a mark, purporting to be the initials N. &amp; M. - I will swear that - I have seen acceptances like this - I have been with Messrs. Masterman nearly twelve years, and believe he has kept an account there all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know him sign a different name altogether? A. No; I never saw him write; he signs all his bills and cheques himself; except his wife, she signs a great many for him; I cannot speak to her signing acceptances; I never knew an acceptance signed N. De Rothschild, nor have I ever seen acceptances which could not be read, and yet have turned out to be his; I never knew acceptances of his refused as forgeries, which afterwards proved to be genuine - but I do not pay the bills myself, I only take them down; the acceptance in question bears some resemblance to his.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray do you know whether or not Masterman's have received the 500l. for this bill? A. They have received 500l. I understand; I have heard that it was paid in on the same day, but do not know of my own knowledge - I do not keep the book in which discharges are written against bills.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you in the first instance receive this bill as the acceptance of Mr. Rothschild? A. I took it as a bill, as I do all others; I have nothing to do with the acceptance - I take them down in my book, and they are examined at home; my duty is only to take an account of such bills as are sent to me; I should not have looked at the acceptance except from the application made by the prisoner.</p>

            , and am well acquainted with his hand-writing - (looking at the bill) - I believe this acceptance is not his; I am certain the words above the signature are not his, and I do not know the hand-writing; I know Mrs. Rothschild's writing - it is not her's; she does not accept bills for Mr. Rothschild - I am acquainted with Mr. Rothschild's correspondents at Vienna - he has none of the name of Harriet Barnard; I do not myself write to Vienna - I write to other places; Mr. Kerchner writes to Vienna; Mr. Rothschild has no account with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been in Mr. Rothschild's employ? A. Eight or nine years; he has an immense correspondence in pecuniary matters, and accepts bills for many foreign parties - they circulate very readily both on the continent and in England; I do not know of the prisoner being particularly acquainted with Mr. Rothschild, so as to give him an op<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290028"/>portunity of knowing his mode of hand-writing - I believe he is a German.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you have been with Mr. Rothschild, how many persons have accepted bills for him to your knowledge? A. Mrs. Rothschild in general, and on one occasion, when Mr. Rothschild went to the Continent, he left Mr. B. Cohen and Samuel Cohen, with a power of procuration for him; I think that was the case, but am not certain - they are the only persons I ever knew accept for him: I think he has been to the Continent twice since I have lived with him - he was there last, about three years ago; I believe he once added De to Rothschild - he does now occasionally sign so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not his hand-writing in acceptances almost illegible? A. Not so to me; at times I can decypher the whole, but not always - he writes very indistinctly.</p>
               <p>Q. There is at times a scratch, and then a letter emerges? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know his hand-writing, we suppose, whether it is distinct or not - you can tell whether it is the character of his hand-writing? A. I think I can.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does it not happen that some times one letter is legible, and at another time another; sometimes, for instance, an R, or an o, and no others? A. In general the ths is legible, almost always the oths is legible; I never knew a genuine acceptance of his being returned as forged; I never of my own knowledge knew any acceptance, cheque, or papers, sent from the bankers to inquire whether the signature was his or not, and the answer to be given that it was. I am corresponding clerk - I know nothing of Harriet Barnard.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Should you have had the means of knowing if there had been such a correspondent with the house? A. I think I should.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Rothschild, and have been so about nineteen years; the signature to the acceptance of this bill is not his hand-writing; I do not know whose writing the words "accepted, &amp;c." are - it is not the hand-writing of any clerk in his house, nor is it his writing; I know most of the correspondents of the house - I know no such person as Harriet Barnard, of Vienna, or any where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are not the Vienna corresponding clerk? A. I am not, nor a corresponding clerk at all now: bills are sometimes drawn by persons who do not come within the general class of correspondents, but I think I must have some previous knowledge of the transaction, if a person has been authorized to draw a bill; I must have had some knowledge of them first, for those instances must have arisen from letters of credit - I write the letters of credit from this country; Mr. Rothschild has a brother at Vienna; Mr. Rothschild very seldom signs his name De Rothschild now, if he does ever - he may at times in correspondence.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bill - is that signature N.M. Rothschild? A. Yes, I suppose it is intended for it; I have no doubt it is meant for that - there is something like N or M, I do not know which - it is nothing like De; Mr. Rothschild is not in the habit of accepting with one signature only; this is so indistinct I can hardly tell whether it is N or M; Mrs. Rothschild signs by procuration only.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. And she expresses it to be by procuration, does she? A. Always, my Lord, and she signs cheques by procuration always - she never signs but by procuration.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever known a genuine acceptance of Mr. Rothschild's rejected as a forgery? A. Never; I believe a cheque was once doubted, and sent back to be ascertained whether it was correct; Mr. Rothschild has not many correspondents in Vienna - he differs sometimes in signing his acceptances.</p>
               <p>Q. That circumstance arises from the haste in which he has to transact his affairs? A. I think that is the only cause.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you look at the endorsement on this bill, purporting to be that of Messrs. St. Lurman and Son, in whose hand-writing, to the best of your belief, is that? A. To my belief it is Mr. Fehrmann's hand-writing, the whole of the endorsement except the signature "Pay Mr. J. Fehrmann or order value account, J.F.B.G., Bremen, Jan. 5, 1828;" I cannot say whose hand-writing "St. Lurman and Son" is- I know no hand-writing similar to it; I believe the words"In need with Messrs. Doxat and Co.," on the face of the bill, to be the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is it not customary when a foreign bill comes endorsed in blank, for the person who receives it to write a special direct on to pay it to himself; have you not known it done many times? A. No, I have not; I have seen a good deal of bills - I do not know of such a thing, but should not think it unlikely - I do not know the signature of St. Lurman and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. The writing above it is without disguise, the writing of the prisoner; you have no doubt of recognizing it? A. There is a slight difference from his usual writing; but I believe it to be his - I cannot say what caused the difference; the words, "In need at Doxat and Co." is nothing that binds anybody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you known anything against his honesty at all, or was it merely his embarrassments? A. I cannot give any other answers than I have; as far as my means of judging went, I did not place the highest estimate upon his character.</p>

            . I am a marshal of the City. I took the prisoner into custody on the 12th of April, at the Terrace, Kentish-town, between five and six o'clock in the evening; I saw him come out of a house on the terrace; I searched him, and received from him a 40l. and two 10l. notes; I searched his house, and got a bunch of keys from Mrs. Fehrmann - he was not present; I had previously heard him acknowledge her as his wife - he had gone into the house with me for two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. COPE also deposed to finding some papers in a wardrobe in the prisoner's house, but they were not given in evidence.</p>
               <p>The bill was here read.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, - Embarrassed and overwhelmed by the perilous situation in which I am placed, and being also a foreigner, wholly ignorant of your laws, and but imperfectly acquainted with your language, I feel myself very incompetent to the task of defending myself with proper effect against this most serious charge, - but relying on your justice and liberality to make allowances for my difficulties, I shall narrate to you a short history of the circumstances which have brought me to my present distressing and degrading situation. My parents, who are highly respectable, placed me out at an early age as a mercantile clerk, and about six years ago I came over to this country, with excellent recommendations, and entered into service with Messrs. - and Co., with whom I staid till their failure: I then went into the house of Mr. Elster, and after living with him two years, with unblemished reputation, I engaged myself to the respectable firm of Messrs. Ward's, with whom I lived up to the moment of this charge; and the beginning of last year married an amiable and respectable young lady: until that period my salary was more than sufficient for my support, and as my wife had a small fortune, which was settled on herself and her offspring, we might have lived comfortably; but having the prospect of a family, I was induced to enter into a mercantile speculation, of sending hats to the Mauritius, which Mr. Weise, the hatter, led me to expect would be a prosperous adventure; I gave him my acceptance, at nine months, which I was given to understand would be the time by which the returns would be made; I afterwards made a shipment to Rio Janeiro; unfortunately, the remittances for the goods did not come to hand in sufficient time to enable me to take up my acceptances, and as Mr. Wright held two acceptances which he was pressing me to pay, I became embarrassed and alarmed, lest I should be involved in law proceedings; my credit injured, and the loss of my situation incurred; in this dilemma I consulted a most respectable individual, on whose advice I placed most implicit reliance, as we had been friends from my boyhood; this friend offered to relieve me from my difficulties, saying he had a bill just transmitted to him from abroad, which had been transmitted from Mr. Rothschild, who had accepted it under circumstances which it was unnecessary for him to tell, or for us to know; the bill had three months to run, and I was welcome to the loan of it; provided I pledged my word to take it up, or provide for it, as Mr. Rothschild, (he said) had accepted it on the promise that it should be provided for by the drawer, or on the drawer's account; my friend also engaged me in the most solemn assurance, that if a question arose about the bill, I was to keep his name a profound secret - these promises I gave, and consider myself bound most sacredly and inviolably to adhere to them, whatever may be the consequence; unfortunately, my friend left England shortly after the transaction, and I have been unable to obtain any explanation from him, or a release from my engagement: but from the knowledge I have of his character, I cannot conceive he would have endangered my liberty, or my life, by placing in my hands a fabricated document. I am led to believe, as the bill appears to be drawn by a female, there may be circumstances of a delicate nature about it, which might be wished to be concealed, and this was my impression at the first moment I received it. So anxious was I to perform my promise, I even endeavoured to take up the bill in the morning, wishing to send it out of the country, as the clerk has stated; but not succeeding - I even went and paid 500l. into the banker's, on Messrs. Rothschild's account. After my hours of business were over, I went home in the stage, as was my custom, to enjoy the society of my dear wife and infant; when I was taken into custody by Mr. Cope, the marshal. I may be permitted here to state, that if I had been conscious of any criminality, I had sufficent warning given me to make my escape; for several minutes before I was taken, I was informed the officers were about my house, inquiring for me, but as I had done nothing dishonest, I went home, and surrendered myself to Mr. Cope and the gentleman who accompanied him. I trust, gentleman, from this simple statement of facts, you will see nothing to justify the present charge; I have always been taught to revere the English law, because it not only protects the innocent, but presumes every one to be innocent till the contrary is proved; would not, however, this excellent maxim be reversed, if by any legal perversion, an innocent individual was supposed to be guilty of fraud, when all the facts prove no such intention existed? and may I not, with humble confidence, refer to the facts in my case, and assert there is nothing to prove I uttered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290030"/>this bill with a fraudulent intention? is not the contrary shown in every stage of the proceedings? if fraud had been intended, was it likely I should have put my name to the bill, or passed it to a gentleman to whom I was well known? or if fraud had been contemplated, should I have shown such anxiety to take up the bill? A fraudulent and guilty man, when he had succeeded in his object, flies from justice with the produce of his fraud; but my anxiety was to repay that which I considered a loan; and so far from attempting flight, when I was told the officers were in search of me, I went and resigned myself to them. As a further proof of my innocence, permit me to say, if I had been dishonestly disposed, I might have procured money without the slightest risk of detection; in the present instance detection was certain; but with the thousands passing through my hands, I might have taken to any amount, without discovery. Gentlemen, I beg to assure you I have never been a gamester or profligate; I have never squandered money in heedless expences - but on the contrary, every one who knows me can prove my habits have been correct and proper, and I have always passed my leisure hours either in the company of sedate friends, or generally in the bosom of my family. My embarrassments arose from what might be supposed to be imprudent speculations; even the morning I was taken to the Mansion-house, Mr. Cope handed me a letter, containing a bill of lading from the Mauritius, for part of the property I had before expected. I will not trouble you with further observations, trusting I have already offered sufficient to prove my innocence; if, however, from the peculiarity of the circumstances under which I became possessed of this bill, I am unable to preserve myself from suspicion, I very confidently hope you will not, on suspicion alone, consign a fellow creature to the grave; by the humane practice of the English law, if a doubt exists, the prisoner is saved, on the principle, that it is far better that nine hundred and ninety-nine guilty persons should escape, than an innocent man suffer; this kind benevolent feeling will, I trust, operate in my case, and by your verdict of not guilty, I shall be restored to the dear connexions I have in society, my aged and beloved parents, my amiable and excellent wife, and my darling infant, all of whose future happiness or misery depends on the result of this trial, and who are now, with trembling anxiety, awaiting your decision. - Gentlemen, my life, and the interests of all those dear to me, are in your hands, and to your kind and feeling hearts we all most humbly resign ourselves.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. COPE. Q. Do you remember the prisoner's examination at the Mansion-house? A. Yes; I delivered him a foreign letter on the Monday, it was brought to me from Messrs. Wards; I delivered it to him by the Lord Mayor's order, and I was to see what it contained, which was a bill of lading.</p>

            . I am proprietor of a Kentish-town stage. On the morning of the 12th of April, the prisoner was a passenger to town; and about a quater-past five in the evening I saw Mr. Cope at Kentish-town, he was alone when he first spoke to me, and I afterwards told the prisoner there were three men wanting him - I was returning from Highgate-hill to London; the prisoner was standing at his gate on the terrace as I passed - he walked off the terrace into the road to me, and I told him three persons wanted him; he walked to the back of my coach; whether he beckoned to the parties who wanted him or not, I cannot say - but he stood there till they came up to him; he was about two hundred yards from them when this passed - he stood still till they came up to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Mr. Cope? A. Yes, he was dressed in plain clothes; he said he was going to dine with the prisoner, and asked me the number.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went and told the prisoner some persons were after him? A. No, he came to me; I stopped my coach to deliver a parcel - I did not tell him this in consequence of anything which had been previously said to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Cope come up the moment you had told him? A. No, I had driven about fifty yards before they came up to him; I looked over the back of my coach and saw them - I thought there was a sheriff's writ against him.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield, I went to Mr. White's premises, and examined the field with Westcoat; the sheep had been driven into two corners - I found against the gate a place where a man had been standing with very large nails in his shoes; there were two footsteps on the side of the gate; and on the hedge some wool - there was half a tip on the inside of the heel of the right foot mark; and on the outside a great many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290031"/>nails, and more nails round the toe; and there were a great many nails all round the left foot mark - I traced these footsteps out of the field, about half-way down the road towards the prisoner's house; I got a warrant and searched his house in consequence of suspicion - we found him at dinner; his wife was eating a breast of mutton - and he had part of the breast and neck on his plate - I asked him where he bought the mutton; he said, at Mr. Taylor's, and had given half a crown for it - I took him to Mr. Taylor's, who said, in his presence, that he had not sold him any mutton, and had not seen him; I had received information, and asked the prisoner where the pie was, he gave no answer - I went into the wash-house and found a mutton pie; and in a large iron pot I found a quantity of mutton stewed down - there was part of the neck, breast, loin, and head; I should think sixteen or twenty pounds in weight - it was small Welch mutton, and Mr. White's were small Welch ewes; I searched the privy and found part of a pluck, crammed down with this sheep's-foot - it is the foot of a very small sheep; the pluck appeared very fresh, and two or three spots of blood lay on the privy; it had evidently been recently killed - I took the prisoner to the watch-house, took off his shoes, and compared them with the foot marks at the gate of the field; they fitted - here is the shoe of the right foot; it has half a tip - I applied it to the impression; it corresponded, and the other shoe fitted the other impression; I applied them to two or three impressions over the gate, in the road - they matched; he had a kind of short jacket on, and there was some blood just across the hind part of his shoulder - he had a smock frock on; but that did not come so high.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near to his house did you trace the foot marks? A. Not within a quarter of a mile; as when I got into the main road it was hard - the lane his house is in, is also hard; carts and horses go down there, but they cannot get through - the privy of the next house discharges itself into his; I cannot say whose mutton it was - there is no mark on the sheep's foot; many countrymen wear these kind of shoes; but it is a large foot - this has been a whole tip. but worn off; I have been a shoemaker - it is not common to make labourers shoes with half tips; one of these has no tip.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you alone occupy these apartments? A. Yes; it is a public staircase. I had been out from eleven to three o'clock - I had left Harris, my boy, to attend my apartments.</p>

            . I am in my seventeenth year; I had the care of Mr. Dunston's apartments - I was going down to my dinner a little before two o'clock; I dine in the lower part of the house, with another person belonging to the house; every thing was safe when I went down - I remained below about half an hour; I left the door locked, and put the key on the ledge over the door. When I returned I found the prisoner, (who was a stranger,) on the fourth floor stairs; my master occupies the third and fourth floors; the prisoner asked me for a strange man, who I knew nothing of: I said if he would be so good as to go down stairs, I would ask Mr. Gale, and while I was asking Mr. Gale for the name he gave me, the prisoner ran out of the house; I ran after him - he never got out of my sight, before I stopped him myself; he had a case of instruments and a box, containing the stomach-pump, and a pair of sheets, a pillow-case, and a glass tumbler; I delivered them over to Mr. Gale - I gave him into Mr. Gale's hands, and did not leave him till the constable had taken him; I went into the apartment, and found these things missing, which were safe when I went down to dinner; he said nothing when I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose the street door is open all day? A. Yes; the house is let out in chambers - a great many people pass up and down stairs; I am certain I saw him on the fourth flight of stairs; the key of the door could easily be got down. I went down into the kitchen to dine; I could not see the street door from there; the linen was master's; I found all the property on the prisoner - he came back voluntarily.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not come out till he was in custody? A. No, I was standing at the door - I was called up from the kitchen; a great many people might have been up stairs for what I know - he made no resistance.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going into the room, and looking round I found this picklock-key close to the prisoner, as he sat on the bed; I tried the key to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290032"/>lock of the door - it would not open it; but one of the keys found on the prisoner opened one of the drawers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the regular door key? A. Yes - that was in the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRIS re-examined. One key opens the third and fourth floor doors; I found the key of master's door in the bed-room door, which communicates with the staircase.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNSTON. I know these sheets - they are marked with my name, and were taken from a drawer in the bed-room, and are worth 14s. - also the pillow-case, which is worth 2s.; this case of instruments is mine - it cost me between five and six guineas; some of them are made by my particular direction; I conceive them to be fully worth five guineas; this stomach-pump is worth between 3l. and 4l.; a table-cloth was missing, which is here; this quilt is worth 10s.; the whole property is worth about 10l. I am certain they were all safe when I left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain they were all there? A. I did not see the sheets and pillow-case, but have no doubt they were in the drawers; the instruments cost me more than I have valued them at; I had no doubt about any of my property before the Magistrate; two shirts were produced, which were not mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a foreigner, and not able to make myself properly understood. Mr. Dunston said before the Magistrate, that he could not swear to a particular piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNSTON. I have said there were some shirts there which I could not swear to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. GALE. Q. At what time did you come up stairs? A. Between two and three o'clock; I was waiting at the door for the boy to come back - I took you up stairs myself: I did not come out of the kitchen to lay hold of you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to JOHN BARNETT. Q. Was I in the room when given into your charge? A. On the third staircase; I searched and found a bunch of common keys in your pocket; I found the key and sugar-tongs on the bed; you were sitting on the bed when they were found.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNSTON. These sugar-tongs are mine; they were kept in a closet in the sitting-room, not in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken into the room everything was looked over; this young man found the key and sugar-tongs near the head of the bed, and I stood by the drawers, not near the bed.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRIS. The prisoner opened the room door, and walked about the room before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I positively deny being in one of the rooms before I was taken up; these things were on the stairs of the fourth flight - I went up to inquire for Mr. Crowther, a maker of German lamps - he lived there about six months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. GALE. I went to live there on the 4th of September; a Mr. Carder lived there before the prosecutor - he was a dealer in Birmingham were and lamps.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you lock your desk when you left it? A. I did not; I was not the last person there - the pigeon-holes were inside the desk; I mentioned the loss of my money about an hour after I missed it, but not to my employers; I did not go home to see if I had left it there - I went home in the evening, but not to look for it; I never said so, nor did I look for it at home - I did not mention it to my employers till about half-past two o'clock on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when you was asked at the Mansion-house why you did not tell your master on the Monday, say because you had another place to look for it? A. I did not, nor anything to that effect, there or any where; the prisoner constantly lived in the house; I have been in the prosecutor's employ two years and a half - I have heard from my employers that she once found a 14l. cheque, and restored it: I never heard of her finding a 50l. Bank note, or any other property, and restoring it; I have no doubt of her being a respectable well conducted young woman.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Had you any doubt of leaving the money in the counting-house? A. I had not; the 14l. cheque had been stopped the day before she gave it up; I cannot say whether she knew that.</p>

On a Monday (the 11th of April, I believe) the prisoner came to the shop about the middle of the day, and bought a small gold neck-chain for 25s.; I gave her change for a 5l. note - I am quite satisfied she is the person - I have not the least doubt of her; this is the note she paid me - (looking at it) - I have written on it- I asked her name and address; she said her name was Martin, and she lived at the Bull inn, Bishopsgate; I have written that on the note; my employer wrote the date on it the same day - it is the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the person, whoever it was, buy anything of you before? A. I do not recollect ever seeing her; we cannot remember every person who comes; I was fetched to the prosecutor's counting-house about a fortnight or three weeks after; I had not seen her between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290033"/>the day I took the note and my going there - nearly a month had elapsed.</p>
               <p>Q. When she saw you, did she not immediately say,"You are the person I bought a pair of snaps of?" A. She had seen me before that, in the morning; she said, "You are the person of whom I bought a pair of snaps," and produced one; the officer searched, and found the other; I do not remember selling her a pair of snaps - I had never seen the person who I sold the chain to before, that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say "Your shop is in Whitechapel I do not know the number; but if you will take me out I will show you the shop?" A. I do not recollect it - I will not swear she did not say so; several persons were present; I cannot describe her dress - she came about the middle of the day - twelve, one, or two o'clock; I cannot say precisely which hour - I dine about one; I cannot recollect whether it was after dinner or before - I cannot say what weather it was.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You do not recollect selling her any snaps? A. I never recollect seeing her, except the day the note was passed - when the inquiry was made she said she had never seen the chain, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the snaps ever belonged to your master? A. We cannot say, for almost every shop has the same sort - it is a common gilt snap which every body keeps; I have not seen the gold chain - I cannot say what sort of a dress or bonnet she wore, but I knew her countenance the moment I saw her - whether she wore a hat or a close bonnet I do not know; or whether she had a cap on.</p>

            . I am the employer of the first witness. I stated to the prisoner's father, in her presence that the note was traced to her - that she had paid it away to Mr. Pierson, of Whitechapel for a neck-chain; she said she had a neck-chain in her possession, which was given her by a gentleman, a foreigner; and I think she said recently, but am not certain: the officer went up to search and brought down what they said were all the trinkets she had - I never saw the neck-chain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was the officer there when she said she had a neck chain given to her? A. No; I sent for him immediately - he came in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she and her father remain with you till he came? A. They went up stairs, and when he came I sent for them, and they went up with him; they afterwards all came down to the counting-house, and no neck-chain was produced - we have been nine or ten years at the house; I never heard of her finding a 50l. note on our floor and bringing it to us - it was not to anybody in our house, I am certain; I one day dropped a 14l. cheque in the counting-house - I missed it the very day I drew it, and stopped payment immediately; it was brought to me next day by the prisoner or some of the family - I am not aware that I mentioned to anybody that I had stopped it.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you remain at your counting-house after you lost it? A. Till six or seven o'clock in the morning; when they returned it they said it was found in the ashes, and I recollected standing there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you drop it? A. In the course of the morning I believe; the counting-house was not left any part of the day - I never heard of it being presented.</p>

            . I am a jeweller; Ciriackes was in my employ. I was in the shop when the neck-chain was bought, but have not the least recollection of the prisoner; I was attending to other ladies - Ciriackes gave me the 5l. note; I went up stairs, and got change for it, which was given to the person who bought the chain: I paid the 5l. note to my brother (looking at it) this is it; it has my man's writing on it, and my brother's also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you recollect at what time the note came into your possession? A. I should think between two and three o'clock - I do not think it was later.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said the person who paid the note was as tall as your wife? was it not a taller woman than the prisoner? A. No; I do not think it was; I said I was not positive of the person's height, and that she was as tall as a person in my shop - that person is about her height, not taller - I have not brought my book here; Mr. Butler. the prisoner's solicitor saw it - he asked me to bring it here; I told him I could swear to my entry - I did not think it of any use to bring it here - there is nothing in my notice to produce it; there is an entry in the book of a pair of snaps bought on the 1st of April, and I sold Mr. Butler a pair exactly like them - I cannot say whether those sold on the 1st of April, was to a woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they correspond in appearance with those sold on the 1st of April? A. Mr. Butler brought a pair, and I gave him a pair of the same pattern exactly.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. If you had been called upon to identify that young woman, could you venture to swear to her? A. No; I cannot say that I sold the snaps myself - we sold no others about that time; we sold none between the 1st and 14th of April.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you the person who dealt with her? A. No; I was attending to two ladies - these snaps may he had at any shop; Mr. Butler called to examine my books, and I shewed them to him - my shop is No. 92, near Whitechapel-church.</p>

               <p>MR. ROGERS.

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You gave her the prescription made up on the 14th? A. Yes; it had been left at my house at near twelve o'clock that day - by whom I do not know.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Rogers; I remember the prisoner coming to the shop on the 14th of April; to the best of my belief it was near twelve o'clock; she brought a prescription, which I delivered to Mr. Rogers - she left it with me and went away, and when she called again it was nearly ready for her; I cannot say at what times he called; it required at least half an hour to make it up.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to CHRISTOPHER CIRIACKES. Q. There are other counting-houses in the same house? A. Yes, on the same staircase; the street door is open in the day time.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Has any person access with your permission except this young woman, her father, and mother? A. No.</p>
               <p>- TAYLOR. I am the prisoner's father. On the 14th of April I was at home, also my wife and daughter - I have another daughter who was ill; my brother came about eleven o'clock, and stopped till about a quarter-past one - my wife was washing a few things; I was going to an excise sale, in Old Broad-street, with my brother; my daughter(the prisoner) was sent by her mother to Mr. Roger's, with a prescription, soon after eleven o'clock - it was between eleven and twelve; she told her to make what haste she could, as she wanted her to attend the door, and to the gentlemen - we were without a servant; we only keep one occasionally; it was, I think, not more than twenty or twenty-five minutes when she returned; she then began preparing our dinner; I and my brother dined, and went away about twenty minutes past one o'clock; my family dined with us - we had beef-steaks; when we went out we left her at home - she had not left the house after she returned from the chemist's, and she went there much quicker than I could; I returned from the sale a little before three o'clock- my wife and both daughters were at home; the prisoner was sent out about four for the medicine, and returned with it in as short a time as before, and prepared the tea; my brother drank tea with us, and left between five and six o'clock - near six.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Does this young woman always cook the dinner? A. In general when we have no servant - she is rather fond of a domestic life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not, when called upon to give an account of her time on the afternoon of the 14th, say she had been abroad? A. She did not; I do not recollect her saying a word about being out; she was sent for the medicine; she did not say she was never in Mr. Pierson's shop, to purchase snaps or anything; she said to the young man, "I know you - I bought the snaps of you;" she said, "I cannot tell the number of the house, but you are the young man who sold me the snaps; I know you now your hat is off."</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say she had a neck-chain, which was given to her by a young man? A. No; she said she had a locket; she never said she had a chain - I never heard her say so; she never said it in my presence; the locket can be produced - she produced it at the time with a ribbon on it; I never saw her with a gold chain.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was the locket worn round her neck with the snap which fastened the ribbon? A. It was - she took it off to show the snap; the snap was not mentioned till she mentioned it.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL PRORART. I live at Maidstone, in Hertfordshire. On the 21st of April I was in London; I fell into company with the prisoner and another man about a quarter or half-past two o'clock - they were strangers to me: I first met the other person in Smithfield; he appeared to be a horse-jobber; and in about ten minutes the prisoner came up; we went into a public-house before the prisoner came; they appeared quite strangers; when I saw the other man I was going to Chiswell-street, and asked him to show me the way - he said said he would, and asked who I was going to see; I said, Mr. Smith - he asked me to go into a public-house and take a glass of ale, as he found himself rather thirsty, and in about five minutes the prisoner came in; we were sitting down at a table - the prisoner sat at a distance off, quite in the middle of the room; he got up and shook hands with me, and claimed acquaintance - I said I knew nothing of him - I had never seen him before; the other man was telling me about different people in Gloucestershire, horse-dealers and others, whom I knew, and that made me think him a countryman. The prisoner went and sat down; he pulled out a bag, and said his old aunt had left him 800l., and he meant to spend it - he was sitting quite by himself; only one other person was in the room; he said he had come out of Leicestershire, where he had resided, and was determined to spend it; he pulled some papers out of the bag, which appeared to be notes; we had two pints of ale, and he had two glasses of porter by himself; he did not join our company at that house; I was perfectly sober - the prisoner appeared as if he was half tipsy, but I found afterwards that was sham; before we left the house he said he had been paying a d-d rogue of a lawyer 60l. to put his money right and get it; I came out with the other man, and went on to go to Chiswell-street; the prisoner followed us down stairs - I believe this house was the Punch Bowl public-house; I went on to look for Smith, in Chiswell-street, as I had a letter to deliver to him; the other man walked along the street - the prisoner came and caught hold of my arm; I told him I could walk by myself; he forced his company on me; he only walked a few yards with me; the first man I met said, "Now, can you see yonder butcher's shop?" I said Yes: he said,"You go there and inquire - they will tell you where Smith lives; I want to step back for a necessary purpose;" I had lost the prisoner before that; I went to the butcher, who said Smith had moved; I then returned back to Smithfield, and lit on this countryman, but not Mills - he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290036"/>"Where are you going?" I said to the Bank; he said,"Very well, I am going that way;" I went with him along the street a good way, and through several passages, into a small square, and there we lit on the prisoner at the bar; he came and said, "Here is a drop of very nice ale - come and have a drop with me;" the other man said, "Let us go, it won't hinder us a minute - he seems a good kind young man," and so we went, and there was a quart of porter ordered; we drank some porter, and then there was a cloth put on the table, and some beef-steaks put down - it was not by my order - I knew nothing about it; they had been talking about something to eat; I eat some of the steak; as soon as it came in the prisoner asked me to give him change for a half-sovereign, saying he had no small notes, his notes were all hundreds and hundred and fifties; I gave him change, and when I pulled out the silver my notes were in the same pocket; I pulled them out, and put them into another pocket - he saw I had got notes; I gave him four half-crowns; he then asked me to give him change for half a crown, to give the girl something, as he wished to behave like a gentleman, and he had plenty of money; in giving him change the half-sovereign fell; he pulled it between his fingers - I said, "That won't do to give half a sovereign for a sixpence," and I had that back- he gave the girl sixpence, and before the steaks were taken away, in came three pipes and three glasses of gin and water; I did not order any of them; they asked me to take a pipe - I would not, and said gin and water I did not like; they said I should have brandy; I said I would have neither rum nor brandy; the prisoner said, "Taste it, you never drank any so good;" I tasted it, and found it was all gin, or gin and water, as they say; but sometimes they draw gin and water out of the same cask; I said I had two or three places to go to, and could not stop any longer; then the countryman got up, and said, "If you are determined to go, I shall be very much obliged to you to show me the difference in appearance between the notes you have, and these large notes this man has, for notes of 100l. and 150l. are notes I am not accustomed to, and I am in the habit of taking a great deal of money in horse-dealing; I told him he had better show some of his own, as no doubt he had some; he said he had nothing but country notes, or he would not ask me; I said as he was so good as to show me where Smith lived, I ought to do him a favour if I could, but it was not customary to show notes in a public-house; I produced them, and the prisoner pulled out some notes, and folded them over his finger; one finger was at the top - I could see "Fifty," but could not see what bank it was, as he held his hand over that. The prisoner was on my right hand, and the other man on the left; the prisoner took hold of my notes, whipped them out of my hand, and turned from the table; the other man kept his finger on the notes when they were down on the table; I caught hold of the notes - the prisoner ran off with my notes, leaving the flash notes behind; the other man did not offer to move. I gave the constable the flash notes. I went out directly to see for the prisoner; the other man said, "You go that way and I will go this," and so I lost them both; it was of no use to detain the other man, as he had not got the money. I surrendered next day in discharge of bail, at the King's Bench prison, and before twelve o'clock that day the prisoner came in there to play at rackets - I knew him directly, and laid hold of him; the officer searched him, but neither of my notes were found; I am certain of his person - I could tell him from five hundred; I saw him with four or five hundred in the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you ever seen any one since who is very much like him? A. Not but what I could swear to the prisoner; I never said I had seen another person exceedingly like him, nor did I ever think so; I have seen nobody at all like him - he might be about two hours in my company; he bragged so much about his money and his old aunt, which made me notice him, and he had a little bit of a sore on his lip - it has got better since.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the Sun and Punch Powl public-house, Long-lane, with the prosecutor; it was not there he lost his notes - we were five or six hours looking for the house where he was robbed, but could not find it: I searched about Bartholomew-close and Smithfield - he never took me out of the City to look for it; I was sent for to the lobby of the King's Bench to take the prisoner - I first saw Probart on the 23d of April and received the two flash notes from him; I asked Probart in the prisoner's presence, what he charged him with; he said he had robbed him of a 10l. and a 5l. Bank note - he said he had had no such thing from him; next morning as I was coming to Guildhall with the prisoner, he said he had had the money - I told him not to say anything to me to criminate himself; he said he had nothing to say further than that he thought it hard he should suffer, for four of them shared the money, and he got but 3l. odd for his share.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was anybody present when he told you this? A. Two or three were behind me; whether they heard it I cannot say - there was the prosecutor, a friend of the prisoner's, and the tipstaff; 2the prosecutor was not above three or four yards behind, I suppose, but I did not look behind - all the places the prosecutor took me to, to look for the house were about Bartholourew-hospital; he showed me one or two houses and said they were like it, but when he got in he said they were not the house; I cannot swear he was robbed in the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever take you out of the City boundary? A. No, not by a considerable distance.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRORART re-examined. The notes produced are what the prisoner left behind instead of mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the sign of the house, or the street you were robbed in? A. No - I do not say it was in the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far might it be from the New Postoffice? A. A very short distance.</p>
               <p>The flash notes were here read, one was headed Bank of Fashion, engaging to cut hair in the first style or forfeit 10,000l. the other headed Bank of Elegance, engaging to do the same, or forfeit 50l.</p>

            . I am a constable of the King's Bench, where the prisoner was taken. I was sent for and searched him - I found nothing on him but 6d. and a few halfpence; not being well I sent for Dutton to take him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290037"/>Cross-examined. Q. Did you follow him to Guildhall? A. I did; the prosecutor was in my custody - he was suffered to go before the Magistrate on my word to bring him back; I did not hear the prisoner say he had the money, but he was not in my charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is totally false, as to what Dutton says; I do not think he is a fit man - his evidence should not be taken, for I know his character - he keeps a brothel, and lives on the prostitution of young women. I never stated such a thing to him - the prosecutor has taken me for another person.</p>
               <p>JURY to SAMUEL PROBART. Q. What part of Smithfield did you meet the other man in, after you returned from Chiswell-street? A. Just before I came to the house, we turned into at first - I believe it is the Punch Bowl; we went from there down to the Post-office - he said he was going to the Bank, and would show me the way; we went through several lanes - he said they were the nearest way.</p>

               <p>Q. Take these papers in your hand, and state what are the stamps imposed on paper, first in the hands of the manufacturer, and afterwards in the hands of the stainer? A. The stamps used by the manufacturer are not here; here are the duty stamps, which are made on stained paper - the duty on stained paper is seven farthings on a square yard; about 1s. 0 1/2d. on a piece - there are nearly seven square yards in a piece; here is an impression taken from what we call the first account stamp, which is imposed on the paper - for which we have authority, from seeing the label on the wrapper of the manufacturers, that is imposed without a charge; this bottom impression is the second stamp, and is called the frame-mark - here are several compartments in it, one shews the number of the stamp, 69, and on that is a moveable letter to check the trade; the next is for the purpose of inserting the progressive number of the piece - we take an account in a book of the papers so stamped; the number here corresponds with the number entered in the book - the next compartment shews the length of the paper which here is 12, meaning 12 yards long - another compartment contains the breadth, which is 58-100th of a yard; that multiplied by the length, would be nearly seven square yards, and by that we ascertain the duty to be calculated; the next compartment shews the year - this enables us to know what the duty should be hereafter; the third stamp is called the duty, or charge stamp; that is imposed after the paper has been framed, and denotes that the duty has been paid - that is the stamp respecting which we receive the duty ultimately. On the 16th of February last I went to Martin's premises in Regent's-street, with Mr. Hall, our general surveyor, and Mr. Notweller, a surveyor of Excise - I directly sent somebody to take charge of the premises in Smith's-yard; I saw Mrs. Martin at Regent-street, and enquired for Mr. Martin- I did not find him there; I examined the stock in the work-shop and selected some bits of paper, which I left in Hall's possession I think - but there was paper selected from both places; I afterwards went to Smith's-yard with Mr. Notweller, and selected some there - some pieces there were wet and had just been printed; they could not be moved - Kennedy was with us at both places backward and forward; he remarked that the wet paper would be disturbed if I took them away, and I left them; I told him we considered the pieces to be seized, and it would be at his peril to remove them; that I seized them because the impressions of the duty-stamp and the framestamp were forged - we seized sixty-seven pieces at Regent-street, and ninety-eight at Smith's-yard, exclusive of the wet ones; by the request of Mrs. Martin and Kennedy they were removed as privately as possible from the premises - Kennedy and some boys removed them; we took them to an Excise chamber in Great Pulteney-street; Kennedy, as he was moving some of them, said, it was a rum start-the pieces seized on the 16th are here; these are part of them - here is them stamp on them; I found the wet ones again on the premises - I can swear to them by the pattern; I took them away on Monday, the 18th - the stamps on these papers are forged; I have not the least doubt of it - here is a forged date-stamp, and a forged frame-mark; here are two pieces, and the stamps on both are forged - the stamp on this piece is not so perfect as the other, but still, I can swear it is not my stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the custody of the duty stamp? A. The surveying officers, Clutton and Claggett; their stamp is only used at one paper-stainers besides Martin's - his name is Henderson; it is the duty of Clutton and Claggett to affix those stamps; the surveyor may do it if he thinks proper, but it must be done in the presence of one or both of those persons; here is another piece of the wet paper - the stamps on it are forged in both respects (here the witness examined several other pieces of paper, which he deposed to have forged stamps on them) - all these were seized on the 16th, and taken away on the 18th, being wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at some of those you removed on the 16th? A. Here is some - I have examined them all; they bear the impressions of forged stamps, and appear to have been impressed with the same false stamps as the wet paper - one stamp has been used on them all; the compartment, shewing the date and frame-mark, is rather larger - the letters are rather irregular and larger, and stand at a different distance to those on our stamp; in the space which shews the lengths of the paper there is a very slight difference - they are very nearly alike in size; the difference is in the year - there is no year to be seen; there are two characters which run alike through the pieces, but I cannot tell what it is; when we fetched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290038"/>away the wet paper on the 18th, I think part of it was rolled up, and part hanging up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you, yourself, mark the papers? A. No; I did not put any mark on what I brought away on the 16th - I only know them by the pattern and the forged impressions; I stated to Kennedy on the 16th, in Smith's-yard, that I seized them because they were forged stamps; I did not see Martin at all - I told Mrs. Martin so on my return to Regent-street; the business continued to be carried on by Mr. Martin till they were taken into custody on the 1st of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that in that interval Martin presented a petition to the Board of Excise, to have the matter investigated and the paper restored? A. I do; I cannot say whether he attended to be examined - he was not examined; he called on me two or three times afterwards - it was partly to know what answer there was to his petition; I told him it would meet with every attention from the Board - I believe the matter was referred to me by the Board, but I have so many referred me I am not certain; if the report came into my hands I went into the investigation; I had no occasion to send for him, he came to me - the Commissioners generally refer these petitions to the reporting officers.</p>
               <p>Q. They, having a petition presented against the act of the officer, refer it to the reporting officers themselves? A. Yes. (The petition was here produced by the Counsel for the Crown.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you seen that petition? A. I have - here is my report upon it; it was referred to me, but it is not with reference to the seizure of the 16th, according to my report.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this impression (producing one)? A. I do not know - I have made several - it is a genuine duty-stamp; many of the impressions on the paper are very faint, and it will occur at times that genuine impressions are faint - that sometimes happens from the hurry of the officers, and from the manner the trader hurries the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that stamp is sufficiently distinct for you to say it is genuine or feigned? A. From the character of the impression I believe it to be forged; I can only see part of it - it is sufficiently distinct to enable me to say it is forged; that part which is perfect, is forged, (here the witness pointed out the part he could ascertain to be forged.)</p>
               <p>Q. This you swear you can tell is a forged stamp? A. From my belief it is forged - I swear that; it is not so regular, and the letters are not so upright - our letters are all fixed, and must be even and upright whatever way it is turned; I do not keep the stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this piece of paper (producing one), has the duty been paid on that? A. From the appearance at this end I should suppose it had, but I do not see any impression of the date mark on the other end - this end, as far as I can see it, is a very good impression of the duty stamp, and I should consider it genuine; but if I was in possession of a genuine stamp I could better tell- the number of this stamp is 233, and is not my stamp; it is not Martin's number, and would not be his manufacture.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it is not manufactured by Martin, and stamped by the officer who stamps his papers? A. I believe he has a manufactory at Starch-green - it may have been made there, but that is not in our district; the frame-mark here is certainly imperfect, and the duty stamp is not so perfect as it ought to be, in consequence of it being placed over the account-stamp, but the part I can see of it is genuine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you find any paper resembling that mark on his premises? A. I found paper there bearing good impressions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are those papers made at either of those two places? A. I say from the number of the stamp they are not; they do not belong to Regent-street nor Smith's-yard.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. On the papers you seized are not many of the stamps exceedingly imperfect? A. Yes, and genuine stamps are very imperfect at times; I judge whether they are genuine or not by comparison, and the number of the stamp - it takes four or five days to dry the paper; it depends on the nature of the place they hang in.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you use a comparison at the first seizure? A. Yes; the first seizure was on the 1st of October; the whole paper was found in entered rooms; the officers could go there at any hour in the night, and it is their duty to go there sometimes.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You stated that you informed Mr. Martin and Kennedy that the stamps were forged, and that the prisoners were not apprehended then? A. No; I apprehended them on the 1st of May; I made no seizure then- I made one on the 28th of February; I brought away what I considered forged, and left the genuine stamps - I gave information to the Excise, leaving them to act for the best.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the genuine stamps are not always perfect, not withstanding the stamp is not complete; can you distinguish by that which really exists on the paper, that one stamp is regular, and the other forged? A. Yes; some are not so perfect as other - still there is sufficient difference to enable me to say it is forged.</p>

            . I am an Excise-officer. On the 16th of February I was sent for and went to Martin's, in Regent-street; I found Mr. Bird, Notweller, and Hall there; and I believe there was some of Mr. Martin's men; I cannot say whether Kennedy was there - when I arrived they were examining the paper, some of it was seized - I did not examine the stamps; I have got the genuine stamp here - there are four stamps; the first account - the frame-mark - the charge - and the remmant stamp; the duty-stamp used at Martin's, is No. 99 - there is one paperstainer in that district using that number; his name is James Henderson - I think it was in the afternoon when I went to Regent-street; our usual time of going to stamp there, is from nine to twelve o'clock in the morning generally; the stamps are kept in a box which I keep, but Clagget has the key of the box, and I have the key of the place the box is kept in - I am obliged to send for Clagget before I can get at the duty or first accountstamp.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLAGGET here produced the stamp, No. 99, from a box.</p>
               <p>Witness. This is the duty-stamp, No. 99; I have surveyed at Martin's between five and six years, and have had no other duty-stamp for him besides this.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290039"/>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often in a week do you go to Martin's? A. Every day, Sunday excepted; Martin has been very little in Regent-street, or Smith's-yard for a long time before the 16th of February - it was my duty to notice what paper is there, and see what is in the process of manufacture, but not to take an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have escaped your observation if 140 pieces of forged stamped paper, had been added to his stock? A. His stock was too large for me to perceive the increase; the duty is paid at the Excise-office - the paper produced is very like a paper that many makers may have.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Other paper-stainers have the same pattern; but no other maker has the same number? A. Except Henderson.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you ever lend your stamps to any of the work people to use? A. No; they have been in their possession to use in my presence; but they never went out of my sight - they have worked them on one side while I was at the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see them work with any other stamp than that which you lent them? A. No; that must have made a genuine impression.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Have you not invariably gone to the premises in the morning, during the hours you have mentioned, except at the time in question? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever been between one and four o'clock? A. I might, as I pass the house so much; my regular hours were from nine to twelve - I have no recollection of going out of those hours.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to JOHN CLAGGETT. Q. Are your usual hours for attending to stamp in the morning? A. Yes, from eleven to one is the general time; I have not been after those hours, till after the seizure - the premises are open to us at all hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been frequently sent for to stamp at one hour, and come much later? A. I keep to my time as well as possible - I might have been an hour later at times; I never charged in the afternoon, to my knowledge - I have been sent for to go there and stamp, but not in the afternoon; I do not recollect charging in the afternoon; - I never recollect going three hours after I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not frequently made the impressions at so rapid a rate, that you could not tell yourself whether they were your impressions or not, when they were dry? A. The impressions were always correct, as far as I knew - I could always tell they were genuine impressions: the colouring would alter them at times.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could you always tell without comparison? A. I could always tell whether it was our stamp or not; I never knew an instance to the contrary.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not you know, on your oath, that there have been many? A. To the best of my knowledge there has not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever seen impressions made by you, and you did not know whether they had beed made by the right stamp or not? A. I could tell if they were made from our stamp.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You mean to swear that? A. I can, to the best of my knowledge; I should always know my own stamp; I never saw an impression on paper in his manufactory, that I could not tell whether it was from our stamp or not; I have sometimes examined impressions after they were dry occasionally, just by chance; I could not always distinguish them; sometimes they get obliterated a little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But from the state they were in, could you say whether they were from a genuine stamp or not? A. To the best of my knowledge they were; according to what I had seen, that was our stamp.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On your oath, has it not happened more than once, twice, or thrice, that after you have stamped paper on Martin's premises, when they have become dry, and you inspected them, you could not tell whether they were genuine or not? A. I have seen the stamps and all perfect, to the best of my knowledge; I have never, when I have been on duty, doubted about stamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why have you hesitated so long in answering? A. I was considering about the seizure - I was not at the seizure; I thought you were speaking of the seizure. - When the paper gets dry we cannot see it so perfectly; there might be here and there a piece which I could not distinguish, but I have always found the genuine stamp, whatever I have seen; it might be obliterated, but I could make some of the stamp out to see that it was a genuine impression.</p>

            . I am engraver to the Board of Excise. I have examined impressions of the duty-stamp on several pieces of paper which were seized at Martin's - (looking at one) this is a forged duty-stamp - it is No. 99; here is another - the duty-stamp on that is forged, and on this also; the 99 is not very clear on this, but it is a forged stamp; here is another, which is also forged; I have examined them before, or I should take more time to examine them; the letters are not in the line, and the crown is very cramped; I call it a very bad impression; the letter Y seems tumbling down; I engrave all the Excise stamps with my own hands, and am quite positive I never made the stamp this is impressed from. (Looking at the paper produced by the prisoner's Counsel) this is a genuine stamp - it is No. 233, not 99.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You make the stamps with your own hands, but do not fix them to the paper? A. No; a negligent manner of impressing them would make a varied appearance, of course, but I must know them to be genuine, even if only a small part is impressed - if that part was clear I could not be deceived. I was questioned about this by the Board in October, and I think twice afterwards, before I went to Bow-street; I examined different papers each time; these were the second I examined, to the best of my recollection; I had no hesitation in declaring them forged, either in October or at any time; I went to Bow-street in May; I know nothing of Martin presenting a petition; Bird did not call on me about that.</p>

            . I am a general surveyor of the Excise. I accompanied Bird on the 16th of February to Martin's, in Regent-street; I found a quantity of paper in the front shop, which Bird told me to take charge of; I cannot say how many - I was not at Smith's-yard: one hundred and sixty-five pieces were carried away from the two places, to Great Pulteney-street; Martin's men carried some - I fol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290040"/>lowed them behind; I took it from their to the Excise-office in Broad-street, and locked it up.</p>

            , a paper-hanger. I was apprenticed to Mr. Martin, and have been about two years with him; I have had some quarrel with him. I know the manufactory in Regent-street and Smith's-yard; Kennedy was the foreman; I went to live there about two years ago this Whitsuntide; shortly after I went I saw the paper come in, tied up, with strings round both ends; we only had one shop  then; that was in Smith's yard - I looked at the stamps, and saw there was a difference in them, but I did not then know what was the officer's stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards observe anything going on? - A. The youngest apprentice first called my attention to it- his name is Wilson; he pointed out which was the offcer's (the fourth stamp) when I first went there; the small G. and the date was not to be perceived; a quarrel had taken place between Martin and Kennedy before the 1st of October; master was going to part with Kennedy, and Kennedy came into the shop in Smith's-yard, with thirty pieces of plain paper under his arm, and laid them on the table, and in his other hand he had a handkerchief, with something tied in it; this was about the latter end of September; he was stupidly drunk, and I do not think he knew what he was about; he came up into the upper shop, where I was at work, and began playing with the boys; I went down, and opened the handkerchief, and in it were three stamps; the frame-mark, the duty-mark, and the first account-stamp; I compared the frame-mark with the impressions on the papers, and it was just the same; they must have been made with the stamps in the handkerchief. After the 16th of February (and after the third seizure) Kennedy said it was me who had informed, and if I had not informed, nobody would have known the difference; I denied it then, and said it was not me - he then blamed me for it all, and said it was me that informed all about it; he used a great many oaths, and blackguarded me for it all; I told him I had seen the stamps, and he said it was a d-d lie, I never had seen them; I said there was not one in the place but what knew it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever see them use the stamps? A. No - I never saw them afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. There were three seizures; after the first seizure did you see any impressions of the stamp which you had seen before? A. No - the greater part of that was seized; the forgery was stopped; there was no more forgery carried on till after New-year's day, and then it began again, but it was a different stamp; they had altered it - it was not the officer's stamp; the only difference in the stamp was the date; the date was not to be seen; I could not make the date out; they date the frame-mark by the year; the officer generally stamped about one hundred and twenty pieces a week; there were as many as five sixties in a week which were not stamped by the officers; there are sixty in a bundle; they were stamped, but not by the officer; I had to work on it - it was given to me with that which was properly stamped. The day the third seizure was made was the first time I gave information that I had seen the stamps; I did not see the officers till after the second seizure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When was the first time you quarrelled with your master? A. I quarrelled with him several times; I do not exactly know the first time; my father came into Martin's employ after I became his apprentice; it was above a twelvemonth after; he remained there a good bit, at paper-hanging - I lived with my father; he was working there on and off several times. Martin did not turn him away till after the first seizure - I told nobody in the factory of my having seen the stamps in the handkerchief; I did not say everybody knew of the stamps, but of the forgery; I had talked about that - only one person is here who I told of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps none of them quarrelled with their master? A. They have had petty quarrels - mine was no great quarrel; I respected my master, and Kennedy also; I never said I would do anything that would get Kennedy transported, nor anything like it; I know the servant of the house - I never told her so; I never worked down at Regent-street to talk to her about it; I saw her sometimes - I never talked to the gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. What suggested to you the propriety of telling of this? A. I met the Excise officers, and communicated it to them - I never saw any but the two who came to survey. I met Bird and Hall in Rose-street, and told them.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you select the day of the third seizure to inform of it? A. I had no particular reason; my father had seen Bird, and Bird wished to see us - my father had not seen Bird till he was turned away. I saw the stamps in February, and told my father of it, but nobody else; I told him of it the day I saw the stamps; I never talked to the servant in Regent-street about the stamps - I worked down there three weeks after the first seizure, but never said anything to her about either Martin or Kennedy; my brother quarrelled with Kennedy; I never heard him say he would do what he could to transport him. After Bird made the seizure I shewed some forged paper to Mr. Slowman; I said."They are going on with the old game again;" he said, "Put them under the table, and I will have the officers here in the morning." I took the stamp off the paper and kept it till the morning: I said I thought it was forged, and tore off the end to ascertain the fact; the officer admitted that it was genuine. I told him Bird had told me if I saw any forged to let him know; if it had not been for Slowman the officer would not have known it - it is very easy to discover forged stamps; I am speaking of the frame-stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290041"/>(pointing it out) I never saw any difference in the chargestamp; there is no difference between that charge-mark and the officer's charge mark.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the three stamps you saw in the handkerchief, similar to the one you pointed out as being forged? A. Only the long one (the frame-mark.) I had about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to look at the stamps; the stamp I tore off and fancied was forged proved not to be so - the stamp I tore off was at Starch-green, and a different frame-mark altogether to that in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The frame-mark appears to be much easier to imitate than the duty mark? A. Yes, the duty mark in the handkerchief was exactly like the original, and the first account stamp; any one might see the difference in the frame-mark, if they had the two impressions laid together: my observations have been confined entirely to the frame-mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this sort of stamp like one of them? A. That is the sort of stamp - it is not the same; the difference is, it is clogged up with colour, and this handle is larger; when the impression was made on the paper I could see no difference between the officer's mark and that; I observed no cramping in the crown; the letters were not tumbling down - I never saw any difference in the duty-mark; it was all in the frame-mark; no duty is payable on the frame-mark; no benefit is attached to that, but there is to the duty-mark. My former master's name was Wiltshire - I was apprenticed to him for seven years, and was about eighteen months with him; he had nothing to do for a long while, and we quarrelled; I was an in-door apprentice; he was always telling me I did not earn my victuals; he had to find me in clothes; I could not get any, and wished him to give up my indentures; he would not, but he burnt them; there was a fire at Martin's premises in Regent-street; I did not work there at the time - my brother did; he was not the cause of the fire: my father does not go by the name of lying Duffield, that I know of; I have heard it from several persons in Martin's employ. - When I showed the officer the paper at Starch-green, he showed me the difference, how they altered the frame-mark - he told me I was doing wrong, but not that I ought to be hung; his name is Cole - he said, "Don't you know I could send you to prison for this, and if you do it again I will;" I said, "I have seen the thing carried on so long;" the mark was afterwards pasted on again - it was not destroyed.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You are not an engraver? A. No; what I know of the stamp is from memory; the duty mark is not put on till the frame-mark is.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever tell John Kearns that Kennedy was the cause of your having so many stoppages in your wages? A. I did, and said, perhaps I should have the laugh at him some day - this was before I thought of informing; I also said revenge was sweet, and I would do all in my power to have him transported - I never said to Henry Williams that I would transport Kennedy, nor did I tell James Fanning that or anything like it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. At what time of the day did you see these stamps in the handkerchief? A. In the afternoon, between three and four o'clock I believe; there was only one man at work in the shop besides me - I do not know whether he saw him come in with the handkerchief; he was at work up stairs, and this was down stairs in the lower shop.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many men had Martin on his premises the day you saw the stamp? A. Only me and one man - there are four on the premises at one time, but not at that time.</p>

            . I was apprenticed to Martin, and lived with him not quite a twelvemonth; I have not left - he holds my indeatures now; I worked at the premises in Regent-street - my duty was to join the sheets of paper; Kennedy used to give them to me - the officers used first to account them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever join any sheets that were unfirst accounted? A. Yes - on the Saturday after the seizure was made, I joined a ream at that time; some first accounted paper was joined with it - that was placed mostly at the beginning, the back-end and the head-end; on the Saturday after the second seizure, which was in February, Kennedy brought me down this unfirst accounted paper - the ream was open when he brought it down, and on Monday he brought down another ream; he cut that and laid part of it out, and set the boy to lay the rest out - he told me to join it; I had joined not quite three reams altogether when the officer came and seized them; I think I have seen Kennedy with a stamp in his hand, but I will not be sure - it was about a fortnight before the second seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you that day? A. Mr. Kennedy sent me out about four o'clock in the afternoon to Turner and Co., Bond-street, and when I came back I ran down stairs into the shop - Mr. Martin came to me at the bottom of the stairs; I could see quite plainly into the lower shop- I was within four stairs of the bottom, and could see about half over the shop; I saw Kennedy there - Mr. Martin came to me, and told me to go down to the other shop for a tub; I saw some paper laid on the table waiting for drying - directly I went to the bottom of the stairs Kennedy had something in his hand, and directly Martin came to me, Kennedy held his hand below the table; I was about a quarter of an hour gone for the tub - when I came back I went into the shop again; I saw this paper, which was on the table, charged and ready to roll off - it had got the duty stamp on it; if I recollect right there were two sixties - I had joined part of that paper myself in the morning; I did not notice whether it was first accounted, but when I came back it had the first account-mark, the frame and duty-mark on it - this was about a fortnight before the second seizure; when I went into the shop after the third seizure, Martin said to me, - Duffield, ayn't you ashamed to come to the shop again after joining the sheets in and then going and informing against me?" - I said, "Sir, it was not me that mixed the sheets. it was Mr. Kennedy:" he said, "I will have both you and Kennedy up" - he did not take me before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where was Kennedy standing with something in his hand? A. In Regent-street, on the side of the table in the shop under the show shop; the Excise people go to that shop - there is a gate and stairs to go to it; I am certain neither the charge nor the frame-mark were on the paper when I left; I had been join<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290042"/>ing paper there that day, and Kennedy was working there; but nobody else - now and then a boy might come down from the other shop, but nobody worked there constantly; Kennedy and I were not very good friends - I believe he hit me two or three days before that, but we made it up; we have had several quarrels, but he never hit me before, and I have quarreled with him since I have been working at Starch-green - I cannot exactly say how long ago; we were not continually quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear anything about a fire? A. Yes; some paper caught fire under my table while I was out - that was in Regent-street; it was in the morning - I had a candlestick against the wall; it burnt down to where it was stuck and fell while I was out - there were papershavings there, but no wood-shavings that I am aware of; I had left the candle burning, and was out about a quarter of an hour - there was no one working in the room; Kennedy was gone down to Brewer-street - I believe the wall was not wood, but brick.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you leave the candle there to burn the house down? A. No; it was always put there.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Martin handed in a long written defence, stating, that after the seizure of the papers, conscious of his innocence, he had petitioned the Excise to restore the paper in question, and had been constantly in his business, and communicating with the officers relative to his petition; that nearly three months elapsed before criminal proceedings were adopted; that he was possessed of considerable property, and could have no inducement to resort to such frauds - that the evidence of Duffield was the result of revenge - and the alledged forged impressions must have been impressed in the presence of all the workmen, and when the Excise-officers had access to the premises. - Kennedy put in a written defence declaring his innocence, and contending that the evidence of Duffield was given from a malicious motive.</p>
               <p>The petition presented by Martin to the Board of Excise requesting the return of the papers, as the stamps were put on by the regular officer, was here read.</p>

On the 14th of May I saw him at the manufactory at Starch-green; I work at the next table but one to him - he at first told the men they were carrying on the game as usual, and that there were forged stamps; a person came to me with the framemark of the stamps, and said he was afraid to work - I put on my spectacles, examined it, and found a little variation; I went to Duffield's table, he pointed out one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at any time what he would do? A. That was on the 15th; some of the boys were talking about his turning informer, and he said Kennedy had served him out so, he would say anything to transport Jem Kennedy, for he had often caused him to be docked many a shilling.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW Q. They were observing that he had given information? A. They were calling him an informer, and he said this; he had before that produced paper to us which he said had not the regular stamps, and I saw a difference in them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Those you had seen a difference in, the officer pronounced to be good? A. Yes, that very day; Joe said, "I am wrong for once;" three officers were there, and examined them by the dividers.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. That was the frame-mark? A. Yes; the officer said it was all right, and blamed him very much.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was it not the frame-mark that was pointed out as incorrect? A. Yes - not the charging-stamp; the figures were not placed straight - other papers were produced to me, and the figures were straight; he might suppose it to be wrong, certainly - I do not recollect whether Abraham Duffield was present.</p>

On the 6th of April, about five minutes past ten o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18280529-53-crimeloc285">Turk's Head-court, Green Arbour-court, Golden-lane, St. Luke's, Middlesex</placeName>

I went through a public-house; as I knew the landlord who kept the house, which is a thoroughfare; my sister's door is sixteen or eighteen feet from the door of the public-house; my sister was ill, and I was going to see her - as I passed through the house I asked for the landlord; they told me he was in the tap-room, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that? A. The people in the bar; I did not like the appearance of the people who I saw in the bar - that made me ask for the landlord: as I passed through the house I was stopped by a young man whom I knew from childhood; he recognized me; he shook hands with me, and I passed on to the door, and on putting my hand out to lay hold of the door, the prisoner at the bar took hold of my hat, and took it off - he was at the back of me; I did not notice where he stood as I was going out; he must have stood more to the right of me; he was in the house at the time he took my hat off - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290045"/>was a perfect stranger to me; I had no recollection of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other people with him? A. I think there was another one, but will not speak positive: I turned round and saw him with my hat in his right hand- it was a drab hat; I seized it with my left hand, and endeavoured to recover it; he called others to his assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he call? A. I do not recollect the words he made use of; a confusion immediately took place, and I then struck him once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared to call for some one? A. Yes; I struck him; the landlord's son (I believe it was) said to him, "Give the man his hat and left him go; I know his sister - you will get yourself into trouble;" I was then forcibly dragged or carried through a door into the skittle-ground, by five or six persons; there might be more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of those who forced or dragged you? A. He was one of the party; I do not think he ever left - they forced me on the ground; one held me by the throat, by my handkerchief, which was tied closely round my neck, and they pulled my shoes off; I called for assistance - the landlord came in, and asked what they were about; one of them said, "It is a bl - y lark - we will punish the obstreperous b-g-r." I called to the landlord, knowing his voice perfectly well; I called to him for assistance; he asked who I was, and what my name was: he said he did not know me - I said"I will tell you my brother's name;" he said, "Who is your brother?" I said Early; he said, "Oh, you must get out of it the best way you can;" I said "It is very hard to be punished in a relation's house;" he is a distant relation of my wife; he left, and I do not think he had any hand in it; I was much kicked about the hips - I became very weak, and struggled with them; they beat my lips, as they said with the intention of stopping me from hallooing; I received blows in various parts of my body; there were five or six of them on me; I cannot say the prisoner was one of those in the skittle-ground, as it was dark; I could not recognize any face; they took from me my hat, a blue surfont coat, my shoes, waistcoat, and I had at the time 14s. or more in my lefthand waistcoat pocket, and three penny pieces in my other pocket; my waistcoat was torn off, and they scrambled for my money; I was left with my trousers torn. I laid for some short time before I recovered; I then got up, and got out of the door, and when I got up to go to the door they kicked me into the gutter; I said, "I don't care for that, now I have got out;" I knocked at my sister's door, and told her to let me in; I have omitted to say that while taking off my things I said to them,"Don't ill-use me - take what you like;" I was very much ill-used - I could not put my foot to the ground for two or three days. I saw the prisoner again on the 24th of April; the landlord's son had given information, and he was taken on the 23d, I believe; I am quite sure he is the man who took my hat; I pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He took your hat off - at that time was he not perfectly alone? A. I have not asserted that they were with him then; I cannot say he was alone; I will not swear that he was not; it happened on Easter Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they were all pretty tipsy? A. I cannot speak to that; I was perfectly sober: the landlord and his son were looking at part of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the whole business was a frolic until you hit the prisoner two blows in the face, as hard as you could? A. I acknowledge I did give him two desperate blows in the face - I stood in my own defence. I consider if a man takes my hat off it is with intent to rob me; that was done in the house, not in the skittleground; I was stripped of my coat and things in the skittle-ground: I have not said that the prisoner was in the skittle-ground, or that he was not; I struck him with my right arm - that was the worst of the two, but I had hold of my hat with my left hand; I struck him somewhere about the side of his face, as hard as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he done more to you than just twisted your hat off in a frolic? A. I cannot call it a frolic, for I was not one of their party; I have given my reason for going through the house - I know it was dangerous to go through even any of the passages leading to the house; there are several ways out of the house; if you had a sister who you understood was laying in a dangerous state, you would run all hazards to see her. The landlord is not here - his son is, who saw part of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Magistrate, that you were struck anywhere except in your heel? A. I did; I have the trousers which I had on; I have not produced them, but they are completely destroyed: I cannot tell whether he was in the skittle-ground - there was one whom I held by the collar; I can describe the dress the prisoner had on; I cannot say what he said when he called out, as there was a confusion altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. If he called out, was it not an exclamation at the pain you gave him with the blow? A. No, it was to call his fellow confederates; I believe the whole of them are most desperate characters; they came to his assistance when he called out; I cannot tell what he called out; I was not more than a yard from him. I have known the landlord twenty years - he came into the skittle-ground: when I speak of knowing him twenty years, the landlord had forgot the greater part of my knowing him, for even with regard to the relationship between my wife and him, when he first received the property of his wife's to take this house, he did not know me; he would not know me in the skittle-ground; whether he did know me or not I cannot say; his son knew me - he saw some of the desperate usage.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank anything that night? A. I had been ill all the week before; I had drank part of two pints of porter - that was at the Weavers' Arms public-house, Grub-street; I went there to see the person who keeps the house; I had not been in any other public-house - I had drank one glass of gin and cloves; it is my usual drink - I cannot do without it, for mine is most injurious business; it is necessary to take something - I am positive I drank nothing else - I had not the appearance of a man intoxicated.</p>

            . My father keeps the Queen's Head public-house, Green Arbour-court, Turk's Head-court, Golden-lane. On Easter Sunday night Mr. Holland came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290046"/>by my father's bar; I was going out into Green Arbour-court; he was seized hold of by Donohough, who took off his hat - I was standing at the door; I looked round and said to him, "Give the man his hat;" with that the other thieves came directly - took hold of me, and said,"If you speak a word I will kick your entrails out;" then they took hold of Holland and pulled his coat off - they took him between the yard-door, going towards the skittle-ground; they pulled off his coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on the ground? A. No, not then; they then pulled off his shoes, then shoved him down on the ground between the yard door and passage, and ran away - then they let me go; I got to my father and told him.</p>
               <p>Did you see Holland receive any blows? A. No; when they let me go, he got up and went to his sister's house - he had neither coat, waistcoat, nor shoes on; they took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these young men who you call thieves, in company with the prisoner? A. Yes, he was in company with them, and with them assisting in pulling off his coat and things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was your father present at any part of the transaction? A. No; he was not - I swear that; I heard what the prosecutor has sworn about my father - he was not present at any part of the transaction, and knew nothing of it till I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. If Holland has sworn your father was present at any part of it, it is not true? A. It is not; I did not call out, as they said, if I spoke a word, they would kick my entrails out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, that you desired them to let the young man alone, because you knew him? A. I told them I knew his sister.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate say, "Then I suppose if it had been a stranger you would not have minded?" A. I told the Magistrate if I saw any robbery done I would prevent it if I could; my father has kept the house about three years and a half - I was standing at the door when Holland came in; his hat was taken off in the house - he turned round, and caught hold of the prisoner; he did not give the prisoner any blows - I was behind his back; he did not strike the prisoner - he could not strike him without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is all the rest you have sworn quite as true as that? A. Yes; Holland did not appear to me to be in liquor - he had not drank in my father's house; the young men had been drinking ale - they appeared high up in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they not been larking about all the evening? A. Yes, they had; they had been drinking in my father's house about half an hour before Holland came in - Holland's sister lives in Green Arbour-court; he could go directly out of Golden-lane to the court - that is a broad street; he could go into the court without coming through our house - I should not have been afraid to have gone; he did not appear to have been drinking - Mr. Bennett, the Magistrate of Worship-street, told my father he had no occasion to come here; he did not see anything of the transaction at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not see Holland strike the prisoner; were you not surrounded by these people? A. I was surround directly Holland's hat was taken off - there was no violent blows used at all; neither to the prisoner nor the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen these parties whom you call thieves, at your father's house before? A. I had seen them in the neighbourhood; they had been to the bar to have a drop of liquor - but never to sit down and stop at our house before; I had seen them before that in company, in the neighbourhood, and at my father's bar.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was you in the bar when the prosecutor first came into the house? A. I was at the door going out to Green Arbour-court; I saw him come in - he had not been in the house long; he came through one door, and was going out at another - he did not stop in the house.</p>

            . My husband is a bricklayer; I am Holland's sister; I had been ill, and under the doctor's hands since November last. On the 6th of April my brother knocked at my door, and as he knocked I heard footsteps running past the house; I let him in; he was without coat, waistcoat, or shoes; he appeared very much exhausted; I took him in - he had a scratch on his face, rather on the lip, and on his left ear; I begged of him to go up stairs; after taking him in, I went to Mr. Blower, the landlord; I saw him with a party round the bar, called him aside, and asked if he knew anything about the robbery; he was very saucy, and very much in liquor; the pot-boy was called, and he knew nothing about it; the son was called, and he knew nothing about it; I said they should hear of it in the morning, and in the morning Mr. Blower came to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the blows have come to a scratch on his lip? A. Yes, he had a scratch on his lip, and seemed very much exhausted; the son said that night that he knew nothing about it, but next morning he came and acknowledged it.</p>

On the 10th of May I was going from home - it was about half-past ten o'clock at night when I was going down Grosvenor-place; I met a girl there, and went home with her - she was a woman of the town; that woman is not here; I went home with her to a court in <placeName id="t18280529-54-crimeloc292">Pye-street, Westminster</placeName>

I said I was in no hurry, I would sit there a little; I went to the beside, and began to undo my shoes; she then got up, went out of the room, and said, "I will return in a few minutes; don't you go away:" then in came a man and woman - that was the prisoners Anderson and Young; I did not see the girl again till she was in custody - there was only one bed in the room; Young said, "What are you doing here?" I said I came there with a girl: she said, "You must go out of here; this room belongs to me - you must go and look for the girl:" I said I should not go out of the room - I had paid for the room; I refused to go out; the man and woman went out, and returned; while I was putting on my shoes Young returned into the room, and two men with her, Anderson and the other prisoner - she had both the male prisoner with her; they said, "Now we will see whether you will go out or not;" with that they seized hold of me, Anderson on my right, and Morris on my left - one held each arm, and they began to kick me; after they began kicking me, Anderson put his right hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, where the sovereign was, wrapped up in a bit of paper; while his hand was in my pocket, the woman struck me across the shoulder with a stick which I had brought into the room, and which belonged to an umbrella - the stick broke in two; the other man kicked me, and Anderson had his right hand in my breeches pocket - he turned my pocket inside out; they dragged me out into the court - my knee-cap was put out by their kicks, and my ribs were very much hurt; I called out Watch! and Murder! and received another kick on my left ribs - that was given to me by Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody come to your assistance? A. Not at that time; after that Anderson said, "Let me kill the b-g-r out of the way;" Morris said, "We will serve him out;" I then received another kick in the ribs; they then dragged me out of the court into the street, and left me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the spot where you were in the street? A. It is not a very long court, about the length of this Court; Dempsey, (the watchman) and another man, came up to my assistance; I had then been laying in the street nearly a quarter of an hour - I could not get up in consequence of the injury I had received; they asked me what was the matter; I told them I had been ill-used: they asked me where the house was; I said if they would assist me I would take them to the room where it happened; they carried me there; when we got there the door was locked outside with a padlock; the watchman said he would break it open; I said, "Before you break it open I will give you a description of the room, so that you may know I tell you of the right room:" they broke the door open, and found nobody there; they then carried me to the watch-house, and from there to the Westminster Infirmary - I was bled there, examined, and dressed; all the beds in the Infirmary were occupied - there was no coach, and the men carried me home; my knee-pan was set.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see either of the prisoner? A. This happened on Saturday, and on the next Monday I was fetched to the office, and saw Anderson, Young, and the girl who had taken me there; the girl was discharged; I have found one handkerchief and one shoe - my shoe was left in the room; I did not see it found - it had come off with their pulling me about; I have found one handkerchief which was stolen from me - it was produced at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the girl whom you had met, and Anderson and Young, were you quite certain of their persons? A. I was, and spoke positively to them; I am quite certain I cannot be mistaken in their persons: the Magistrate asked if I should know the other man - Morris was fetched into the office, as he was waiting outside; he was fetched in, and I was certain of him, and spoke positively to him - I am quite certain of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Pray, are you a married man? A. No; I met the girl at half-past ten o'clock - it commenced about eleven; I was not in anybody's employ at the time.</p>


               <p>Q. I do not mean were you going to work at the time, but had you got a master? A. Yes; I get 2s. 4d. a day; nobody here saw me with the sovereign, that I know of; I told the girl I had a sovereign, that I know of; I had taken a pint of beer at the White Horse public-house, Knightsbridge - this happened at Westminster; I went all the way, from home to Westminster - the woman met me in Grosvenor-place; I had drank nothing but the porter all day, except a pint of table-beer; I did not go into any public-house with the girl I met - she asked me to go, but I did not; that girl is here, but not in Court; I drank no gin with her - I did not taste gin that day; I would swear I drank no gin that night if I were on my death-bed; the stick had been taken out of an umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. When these men came into the room, did you strike either of them with your stick, in the first instance? A. I did not; I had never seen Anderson before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the row over altogether? A. About twelve o'clock, or it might be a little after; I had been in the room about twenty minutes before the men came in; they might be in the room knocking and scuffling together a quarter of an hour - I will swear it was five minutes and more; they had their hats on. I received my wages on Saturday morning, from Mr. Howell, the watch-house-keeper of Mary-le-bone; he was my employer - he had given me a sovereign and 9s. 4d.; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of going to places with women who pick you up, when you are quite sober? A. No - I had never seen her before, to my knowledge; I did not tell her I had a sister who kept a house of accommodation, nor anything of the kind. I told her I had a sister who followed that business, the same as she was.</p>
               <p>Q. That kept a b-w-y-house? A. Yes, who had kept one; I have not seen her for a long time, and know nothing about her. I have been a porter at Mr. Vin's oil-shop, at Knightsbridge, for twelve months, and have worked in the Park twelve months; Howell paid me the money because I have been a watchman there this last two months; I was not on duty on this night, but I was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290048"/>watchman; when I want to miss a night I have leave - I had been a watchman about three months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. Q. Did I offer to meddle with you when I came into the room? A. Yes, when they both came in together.</p>
               <p>Q. You said I had another coat on - I have none but this? A. I observed his coat; he had a different loose coat on over the one he has now, a light coloured loose coat, and I could see the same coat he has on now under it, and the same waistcoat; I looked strictly at him when he came in, for I thought I was going to suffer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner YOUNG. Q. Did I not come into the room a second time, and take some in off the mantel-piece, which you had sent for? A. No; I had not sent for any gin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner YOUNG. You sent into us on Sunday morning, by this man (Morris), that if we would give you 1l. you would make it up. Witness. I never saw that man on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. I am that man; he sent me into them. Witness. I sent no such message whatever; I did not know they were taken till the officer came up to my room to see how I was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you send any message by anybody to these people, that if they gave you 1l. you would not go on with the prosecution? A. No; Morris' brother came to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner YOUNG. Q. Can you swear you saw me the second time in the room? A. Yes; I am certain that she hit me with a stick.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor some time after twelve o'clock on Saturday night, in Old Pye-street; he was sitting down on the ground, with his legs stretched out: he was about ten yards from the corner of the court where the robbery happened; I had heard a faint call of Watch! before I saw him - when I came up he was not able to stand; he appeared in great pain, as if he had been hurt - he complained of his loins, and that he thought his thigh was broken; I asked him how it happened - he gave the same account he has now, and said he had lost a sovereign, the handkerchiefs, and one shoe, and if we would assist him to the room he would show us where it was; the witness, I, and another man carried him to the room - he was quite unable to walk; the room was padlocked outside; he said there were raddishes and onions on the table, and a pot of water at the foot of the bed; we broke the door open, and found the raddishes, onions, and water as he had described - his description was accurate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see either of the prisoners? A. I came from the Infirmary, after seeing him bled; in an hour and three quarters or two hours; I called Phillips, and we went into the court, and found the door which we had broken open was bolted inside; I went for a light, leaving Phillips at the door; they opened the door when we knocked, and we found Morris and a woman, who stated that she was his wife - she answered the description of the woman the prosecutor had said took him there, and there was a boy in the room with them; Johnson saw the woman on Monday, and said she was the woman who took him there - they declared their innocence. About half an hour after I took Morris, I found Anderson and Young in the second house from where I found the others; we found Anderson and Young in bed in the parlour, and there was another woman also in the bed; Anderson had all his clothes on but his coat. The prosecutor saw them on Monday morning, before the Magistrate, and identified them directly he got into the lobby; Morris pleaded his innocence so strongly at the watch-house, when we took him there, and not having a white coat on, like a coachman, as Johnson had described him; I was rather doubtful of him - when he dressed himself he put on the same coat as he has now, but the side of his waistcoat was torn down; I never could find a white coat, and on that account the constable did not think right to detain him. When we gave evidence before the Magistrate he was about the office, and was fetched in; the prosecutor said, "That is the man, but he had a white upper coat on;" I was present when Phillips found a handkerchief on the bed where Anderson was laying; the prosecutor identified it, and said it had never been hemmed on one side, and I found it so; we found three or four handkerchiefs - Phillips kept them; Johnson claimed this one - it has not been hemmed on one side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you smell the prosecutor's breath that night? A. I did not exactly smell his breath - I was near enough to him to smell if he had been in liquor; he did not smell of liquor in the least; I never said so - I could not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other watchman, in your presence, say so? A. Never, to my recollection; Phillips never was with the prosecutor; Wakefield helped to carry him - I do not recollect Anderson being searched - I did not search him - I think Phillips did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In your judgement had the prosecutor any appearance of being intoxicated? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MORRIS. I asked the watchman what Hospital the man was at when I was discharged; I at first asked him to have something to drink; he said he did not mind; it was about four o'clock in the morning - we went and had half a pint of gin.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You searched Anderson? A. The constable searched him in the watch-house; I saw him being searched - no sovereign was found on him; I searched the room minutely - but found on sovereign.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at No. 17, Old Pye-street, within one hundred and fifty yards of the court - I was returning home between eleven and twelve o'clock, and heard the cry of Murder! I went to the spot and found Johnson lying at the front door of a house in Pye-street - he appeared to be in pain, as if he was hurt; but not at all affected by liquor - I assisted in taking him to the door of a house where he directed us; the door was padlocked outside - I afterwards carried him to the watch-house; he was not able to walk.</p>
               <p>ANDERSON'S Defence.

               <p>YOUNG'S Defence. I have nothing more to say; I never saw the man after I went out of the room the first time.</p>
               <p>MORRIS' Defence.

               <p>Q. And took another man to the same room? A. Yes; he did not wish me to take him to an accommmodation house, as he said, his sister kept a house - I said, he could not stop; he said, he did not want to stop - I am an unfortunate girl - I left him in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What! leave a perfect stranger in the room? A. Yes; he was tipsy; I told him when I went in, that he could not stop but for a few minutes; he said, he did not want to stop - he gave me 2s.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not stay to see him leave the room? A. Because he would not go out; I asked him to go out - he said, he should not; he was very tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend to what you are saying; though you are in a state of prostitution, do not add perjury to prostitution - three witnesses who saw him, swear positively he was quite sober? A. I do not know whether he was shamming it, but he appeared to me to be tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you say, for you are liable to be committed for perjury; and to be transported if found guilty; now, tell me what you mean to say on this occasion - mind, your words will be taken down, and if you speak false, I shall certainly commit you for perjury? A. I met the prosecutor in Grosvenor-place, about half-past nine o'clock; he at first had a kind of white stick in his hand - he hit me with the stick; I turned to him and said, "What do you mean by hitting me?" he said,"Will you have any gin;" I was talking to a groom at the time - I turned round and asked, what he meant by hitting me; he said nothing; he said, "Will you have any gin?" I said, "I don't mind;" we went to the Feathers public-house, and had a quartern of gin; he drank two glasses, and I drank one, and as we came out, a man was standing with radishes and onions; a watchman was passing - he said, "I say, ask the watchman for a light;" the watchman said, "There is one, you may get it" - well, he got a light, and he bought some radishes and onions; he asked if I would take him home - I said, I could not take him home, but would take him to an accommodation house - he said he could not go to an accommodation house; for his sister kept an accommodation house.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took him to the room you and this man lived in? A. Yes; and he said he would give me 3s. to stop a few minutes - he gave me 2s. 4 1/2d., and when he gave me the 2s. he said he would stop all night. I said, "I told you, you could not stop;" he said, he would - I said, he could not; I left the room a short time - and while I was gone, the door was bolted; I came back and said, "Let me in;" he said, he would let nobody in - I said, "It is me;" he said, "You shall not come in" - I left the room, and did not go again till two o'clock; when I went at two o'clock, the man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290050"/>gone, and my bed was turned upside down, and the bed in the middle of the room - I did not speak to anybody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the three prisoners after you left the room? A. No; I did not tell them the man was there - I do not know how they found it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to stay away two hours? A. I was engaged with a gentleman at another house; a blue handkerchief was claimed on Mary Young's bed; and I saw that handkerchief on Young's bed on the Friday morning - I had only known Young two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that handkerchief; is that the handkerchief you mean to speak to? A. That is the handkerchief I saw Young have on Friday morning - I was not intimate with her; I did not examine the handkerchief - she was tossing it about in this way, and she tore it by hanging it on a nail; I cannot say who mended it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JOHNSON. On my oath I mended that handkerchief myself about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Witness. I only know it by the handkerchief being sewn in the middle; that is all I know it by - it is not exactly in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it? A. No; I merely saw it in her hand - I swear to it only by its being torn in the middle; I do not know whether it was hemmed - but it was torn in the middle.</p>

            . My brother was a porter to Mr. Fenwick; I used to go to fetch his dirty linen; I saw the prisoner there - he has taken things off the counter and put in with the dirty linen, and I took them away: I have seen him take pieces of silk and cotton; I gave them to my mother, who pawned them; the prisoner told me to tell my mother to make as much as she could of them; I never pawned any, nor went with my mother to pawn them; I got them two or three times; the linen was washed and taken to my brother; I took the prisoner the money which my mother gave me - I took 10s., 15s., and 1l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Your brother was porter to the prosecutor? A. Yes, but he is not there now - he was dimissed after the prisoner gave me the articles; he is not here - he is at home, but was not there when we came out; I do not know why he went out; my brother was in the shop, cleaning lamps when the prisoner gave them to me; there was no one else in the shop - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I did not tell the Magistrate that I had pawned them: I did not think I was doing wrong; he told my mother at one time, when I was in the room, that they were all down in the book; he did not tell me he had a number of articles left on his hands, and that he had intended formerly to have gone into business.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BROWN. I am mother of the last witness; she has brought some silks and cottons in my son's linen from the shop - she sometimes said I was to make as much as I could; she said she brought them from Mr. Mussared - I pawned them at different pawnbroker's; I think I twice got 1l., and sometimes 10s., 15s., or 18s.; I sometimes sent the money by the child, and sometimes I took it him myself; I sometimes gave him the duplicates, and sometimes kept them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they not threaten you with a prosecution? A. I was taken and locked up for three days; I was then ill for a fortnight, and was carried to the Westminster workhouse; I had no communication with any one. I should not have liked to have pawned things for my son unless I knew he had come by them honestly; I knew the prisoner was a shopman; they were remnants, but that did not excite my suspicion; I knew he had been going into business for himself, and being a repectable man I thought he might have them of his connections; my son is at home - I did not leave him there when I came out - he did not know he was required to be here, or he would have come; he has been living with me ever since he left the prosecutor, which was about a month after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you get for your trouble? A. Very little, sometimes enough to get me a loaf or a cup of tea: I do not know how I came to go to different pawnbrokers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not engaged in his business? A. Yes; he said I was at liberty to search his box; Brown said nothing particular when she was taken, but at the office she said, "I will exculpate my son - it was from Mussared I received the things."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner was charged with having taken these things did he deny it? Q. No; he said, "I shall decline answering any question here:" meaning before the Magistrate; I do not remember that he said till his trial.</p>

               <p>MR. FENWICK. Brown was my porter; he came in October, and left about a month after the prisoner; I have seen these articles, and have no doubt whatever that they are mine; I have a counterpart of one of them, and have no doubt whatever that they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many of them are there? A. Eight or ten; I have the strongest recollection of three or four of them - I have no doubt of them all, except this piece of stuff, which I do not so well recollect; the prisoner had been in my service five months - he came with a good character from Messrs. Williams and Pearce, silk mercers, two doors from my house; when he left me he went to live with Mr. Clift; I had not discovered the robbery then, but he had staid out two hours, and I dismissed him; I have since heard he was going into partnership; he never told me that he had any goods of his own.</p>

               <p>MR. EVANS. I went to the watch-house concerning some money which he could not account for - when he came into our service he had about 4l. in his possession, and plenty of clothes - he had a larger wardrobe than myself; he came as porter first, and then was made private watchman, thinking him the most honest man we had.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What sort of a watch was it? A. A silver hunting watch, No. 3,896; I gave information at Marlborough-street and Bow-street, and about a month after I lost it I received a letter from Mr. Read; I afterwards saw my watch at Hatton-garden - I said I considered it altogether worth 10l. or 12l., but it was given to me; I do not remember the Magistrate saying he thought that a great deal - the Magistrate said there was a mistake about the maker's name, but I believe it was in the pronunciation - it is Dubois, a French name.</p>

            . I am high-constable of Leeds. I apprehended the prisoner and some others at Leeds, on the 17th of April; I found this watch in his waistband, and another watch in his pocket, with this seal, ring and key attached to it - the number of this watch is 3,896; I asked who it belonged to, he said to his brother, and he had brought it that morning from Ripon to Leeds to be cleaned; the Mayor of Leeds directed it to be advertised, but no one owned it - I then searched the Hue and Cry from London, and found a description of the watch; I then told the prisoner I had found an owner for the property, and he said he would tell me the truth how he got it - that he had it of a Jew at Ripon, and had given his own watch and 26s. for it; I asked him if the key and seal which were to the other watch belonged to this - he said they did; the other watch he said he had had a long time, but did not say how long; I asked him if he had been in London - he said a long time ago, before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. What induced you to apprehend him? A. I found him with some suspicions characters - I took them all; the others were discharged; I was at the office when the prosecutor claimed the watch - he gave the same statement he has to-day; the Magistrate said there was a mistake in the advertisement in the name of Dubois - the prosecutor said it must be the mistake of the person who gave it.</p>
               <p>COURT to PROSECUTOR. Q. Was this seal and key attached to your watch? A. Yes, and this watch is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave my own watch and 26s. for this watch, to a Jew, at the Black Bull public-house, at Ripon.</p>

Yes, my apprentice; this is a part of his indenture - I have the other part; it states that there were 4l. received by me, but this I received from the Drapers' Company; these receipts are for 10l. more, but that was under an agreement between his father and me; his father was to pay the expence of the binding; but he was very poor, and he said he had heard of a charity in the City which would grant me 4l.; I went to the hall, and told the gentleman I had received 10l., but he said I must say nothing about that, or the 4l. would not be allowed - but it made no difference in the stamps. I have received 14l.; I do not remember that the prisoner was told it would be better for him to confess: he was taken on the 20th of May; he said if I would forgive him he would do so no more.</p>

I was employed at the Poulterers' Arms- I was there on the evening in question, and saw the prisoner take the jacket off the back part of the seat - he was intoxicated, and I thought he did not mean to steal it; I told him to take an old sailor's jacket which laid there, but not this one.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother; he came to my house to dine on the day he was taken - he sat down to dinner; the prosecutor came into the room with a constable; he pointed to my brother, and said, "That is the man;" I said, "What is the matter?" he told me, and held out his hand to my brother, and said, "Never mind, William, all I want is satisfaction for my jacket;" the constable sat down, and said, "We will wait till three o'clock;" we sent out for something to drink in the mean time; I said to the constable, "I never knew they allowed a cripple to act as a constable;" this offended him - he got up and collared my brother; I said, "As it is the Sabbath-day, let him go;" he did, and sent for Mr. Cousins, who came; the prisoner went away quietly, and was locked up. I never sent to the prosecutor, but he came to my room, and there, in the presence of three witnesses, said he was sorry for what he had done - he would not have entered the room for the world, and said he would freely give 100l. to get him released; he then went to a public-house, drew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290058"/>up an agreement, valued the jacket at 10s., and said he would take it at 2s. a week; all this was voluntarily from himself: the agreement was signed regularly, and then he asked me to go to the watch-house, which I did; he shook hands, and told my brother if possible he would get him out that night, if not, he would in the morning; he said to the watch-house keeper, "All I want is to get that man discharged - I am satisfied, and if Mr. Cousins comes tell him to let him he discharged;" he said, "I am going to look for him;" he came to me again, and said he came to give us consolation, and said he had done wrong; he came again to my brother's wife, and said he was obligated to come forward against him - that he had been fetched from his work. I have seen the prosecutor once since - he said he believed it was only a frolic - he did not think he meant to steal it. I saw my brother that evening dancing to an organ in the tap-room, and I believe he might have taken it, not knowing whether it was old or new.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I saw the prisoner's mother, and she was so frightened that I said I would have given 100l. rather than have done it: I did value it at first at 10s., but I did agree to take it at 2s.</p>

On the evening of the 3d of May, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for some bonnet-ribbon; a shop-woman showed her some; I then went and undertook to serve her, as I thought she wanted to steal - she came in with two other women, and said to one of them, "Will this ribbon suit?" she said No; the other two then asked the price of some ribbon in the window, and while I was telling them, the prisoner put one ribbon into her basket, which she took from the counter - I believe one of the others had removed it from the box; the prisoner then went down the shop, and asked a female for some prints - she called me to cut it, which I did; she paid 3s. 6d. for it, and put it into her basket - she went to the door, and I saw her put her hand in and take up the ribbon; I had not sold the other women any ribbon; I took the box off the counter, and said I could not serve them, as they had been in the day before and bought nothing; I went after the prisoner and brought her back, and in her basket was found this ribbon and this handkerchief, which I believe is master's - I can swear to the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say she was ever in your shop before? A. Yes, on the Saturday before; I took her about ten yards from the house - I followed her as soon as I could get from some ladies I was serving; I thought she might return the ribbon to the drawer; I had seen her at the shop before - I believe she has been there a dozen times; she remained in the shop about five minutes after she took the ribbon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you at once charge her with it? A. Because I was nearly confident that she had returned it to the box again.</p>

I was nursing my sister Charlotte, who is nine months old, opposite my father's house - she had a necklace round her neck; the prisoner came round her, and then I missed the necklace - I cried out; my father came and ran after him; the necklace has not been found - I did not see him take it; I had seen it on not long before; there was only him and another boy near us; my father could not catch the prisoner, but I am sure he is the boy - I saw his face.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLARK. I am the father of this witness; my daughter told me a boy had stolen Charlotte's beads, and run up Tyson-street - I pursued, but could see no boy; when I came to the mount there were several boys, and the prisoner among them; he ran off, and I pursued. The beads have not been found.</p>

            . I am a cooper. On the morning of the 15th of April, about five o'clock, I saw the three prisoners in the garden ground of Mr. Oakham - I told them they had better be off; I walked on about twenty yards - two of them disappeared, and I saw the third, which was Halls, putting something under the hedge; I looked, and perceived it was a copper - I went to him, and said I should take him; I called to a man who was passing, but he would not come - I jumped over the hedge to take the copper; Halls got away - I did not pursue him because I had some goods of my own, which I was afraid of losing; I took the copper home, and soon after I met the prosecutor's son and told him of it - he said, "If it is my mother's copper there is a little hole stopped up with putty" - which is the case.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he was not running when you took him? A.

A boy came and told me it was gone: I went and missed it - I had seen it the night before; I met Rivers with it on his shoulder about twenty minutes after - I watched him down Turnmill-street with it, and at the corner of Greenhill's-rents he met a man with a cart - he put it into the cart, and they went on with it; I got a constable, and gave them into custody. Payne was by the side of Rivers - I do not think I said anything to them; Rivers had been in my employ two years, and had a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell when this was on your premises? A. I have lost 104 metals since February, but I cannot tell when I lost any particular quantity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SLAUGHTER. Q. Is it your's, or is it not? A. Yes; I know this piece by its being a particular sort, which was made on purpose to cross the roads - they would not let me use any other, because the carts should not be shaken; I had twenty-eight yards of it, and these three yards were found at Christmas's house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there any mark on it? A. No; but we have more like it - it is of a particular shape - no other persons use such as this for a rail-way; I had the mould cast for this at Mr. Fowler's, and he never cast such for anybody else.</p>

I went with Mr. Want to Christmas' premises at Hounslow, where I found 10 1/2 cwt. of this sort of metal; he was not at home - but I saw him afterwards, and asked where he got it; he said he had it of a man with one hand, and he believed his name was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290068"/>Slaughter - nothing was said about it when they were both together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know nothing of Slaughter but what you heard from Christmas? A. No; I took him in the country - Christmas was summoned as a witness at Bow-street - he came, and was committed on Monday last; when I went to his house, Mrs. Christmas shewed me the iron; there was a great deal of broken iron about, and some of these pieces were whole; I believe these pieces are sold as old iron when they are broken: Hounslow is about six miles from the prosecutors premises - Christmas said he had given 3s. a cwt. for it.</p>

            . I am a servant at Hillingdon. I saw Slaughter with some iron like this in his cart, crossing a field about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - he was coming towards the road leading to London; I went and took hold of his donkey; he begged and prayed for us to let him go: we told him we would take the iron back to where he got it - he said he had nine pieces from the wharf, and two from Mr. Rodney's gateway; he gave no account of buying it - we took him into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. WANT. Mr. Rodney is a farmer; I put some iron on his premises for safety.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to JOHN WELCH. Q. Then Slaughter never had time to go to Hounslow with this iron? A. No. There were five pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SLAUGHTER. Two persons came up; one caught hold of the donkey's head, and the other loaded the iron into the cart - they said they knew where it came from.</p>
               <p>JOHN WELCH. Yes; we brought back the cart, and put some iron in, which we found in a ditch; I was thirsty, and went to have a draught of water, and there I saw it; and he having some in his cart, I thought it was all of one parcel.</p>

               <p>JANE TYRRELL. I am a widow; Thomas Tyrrell is my son. On the 7th of April, I came home in the evening, and found my room open, and these things gone; I had seen them safe in the morning when I went out; I do not know who took them - my son lived with me, but did not come home to sleep that night; he came next day - I told him of it; he made no answer - he is as honest a good little boy as ever lived, and I beg and pray you will give him me back; if I part with him, I shall not live long - he did not tell me he had got somebody to pawn these things; I told the Magistrate I heard the officer ask him at Hatton Garden, and he said he got Fury to pawn them.</p>

            , at Seven-dials, on the morning of the 17th of May. About two o'clock that day the prisoner came into a public-house, near Aldgate, where I was, and asked to look at some drab kerseymere - I showed him some, and told him it was 4s. a yard; he said he would not give more than 3s. 6d. - I said I had a piece at Mr. Bailey's, and asked if he would look at it- he said he did not mind; we went to a public-house near the Seven-dials; I went to Mr. Bailey's and fetched the kerseymere - he looked at it, and we agreed for him to have it at 3s. 6d. a yard; he then took a cheque out of his pocket - I looked at it and said I did not like it, and asked him if he would go with me to Mr. Bailey's; he said he would; I took the cheque, and asked him again to go to Mr. Bailey's - he said he had paid it in cash, and that was enough; I asked if I could get it cashed - he said it was too late that night; he drew the cheque in my presence; there were sixty-three yards of the kerseymere, and it came to 11l. 0d. 6d.; on Monday, the 19th, I took the cheque to the bankers, and they said there were no effects - I gave the same cheque to the officer; I left the kerseymere with the prisoner and Mr. Oxley at the public-house - I found the prisoner again on the Monday, in a court near Aldgate, in bed; I had got the direction where he lived from a public-house - this is the cheque.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What time did you first see the prisoner? A. Between two and three o'clock - I was in the public-house when he came in; I knew Oxley before this - Carpenter, a friend of mine, was there; I do not know that he and Oxley were acquainted together; Oxley went to find him to buy the kerseymere - there was a good deal of bargaining between us; it was at my request that the prisoner went to look at the kerseymere - a bill was made and a receipt given for the money; Oxley made the bill at the prisoner's request - I did not say I was no scholar; Oxley had a ready reckoner in his pocket, and made the bill from that - it was about 10 o'clock at night; I do not know the sign of the public-house - I am told the prisoner is very respectably connected; Oxley is in Whitecross-street prison; I had no difficulty in finding Atkinson - he was tipsy; I do not know whether the cheque was filled up by Oxley's desire.</p>

I certainly should not have been induced to purchase this, but through Mr. Oxley, who is their salesman; he stated that they had two cuds of kerseymere, which he thought would answer my purpose; I said I had no cash, but I knew he had a banker's bill for 20l., and asked if they would take that; he said they would not- I said, "Very likely they would take a bill of a month from me;" he said they would not; I said, "Very well, I can't become a customer;" this was before we left the Carthusian Arms public-house; we then went to the Yorkshire Grey public-house, near the Seven-dials, and I remained there while they went and fetched the kerseymere; the cheque was given, and the money would have been ready by twelve o'clock on the Monday, but I was ill; and they came like lions or tigers, and dragged me out of my bed; if I had acted according to my own feelings, I would have knocked the whole three of them down, but I went quietly to Guildhall with them.</p>

            . I keep the New Inn. The prosecutor left some lead with me on the Tuesday afternoon; I saw it safe on the Wednesday - there were 81 lbs. weight of it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking the whole of the afternoon at the New Inn, and became quite intoxicated, and was obliged to lie down upon one of the benches, where I feel asleep; I did not leave the house till I was put out by the landlord at half-past eleven o'clock - I was proceeding along Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-spuare, when a stranger asked me to help him up with a load which he had; he said that he had carried it all the way from St. Pauls, and if I would carry it the remainder of the way he would give me sixpence - as the person to whom he said he was going lived near, and was well-known to me, I consented, and had but just taken it up, when a watchman came up to us, and the stranger immediately ran away; seeing him run I suspected something wrong, and, ran away too, when I was pursued by the watchman, and taken into custody.</p>


               <p>WILLIAM GRUBB. He had been at my house all the afternoon. The lead was in a small yard which parts the kitchen from a room; I knew him before; he was there almost every day; I cannot say whether I turned him out that night or no - If I had turned him out with the lead on his shoulder I must have seen it; I have frequently turned him out at the closing hour at night: the lead was in my custody to take care of; I shut up at half-past eleven o'clock precisely - there might be thirty or forty turned out that night.</p>
               <p>COURT to ROBERT RAWNSLEY. Q. Are you sure it was half-past twelve when you saw him? A. Yes; I was calling the half-hour; it was about two hundred yards from the New Inn.</p>

I was employed to watch a stable by Mr. Charles Reynolds' foreman - there was a mare and a foal there; it required my attention the whole of the night of the 10th of May; I went out that night about a quarter-past twelve o'clock - I know the time, because I heard the clock strike; I saw John Bond at the hen-house door - I was within five yards of him; I had known him for a year and a half before - I could not be mistaken in his person; he had a white hen in his hand- I saw him throw the hen down, with two more, at the door; the door was put too, locked, and the key taken out; I said, "John, is that you?" he went round the yard; I met him again, and said, "John, I see it is you - you have no occasion to run; Mr. Reynolds is coming;" he got out at the gate, and shut it against me; Reynolds came in at another gate, and I met him; I told him what I had seen, and I stopped at the place to watch; I found three fowls at the hen-house door, quite warm, recently killed; Reynolds went with me to the hen-house door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you not seize him? A. Because I knew him, and he ran away - I told the Magistrate that I knew him by his face and dress too.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had you a lantern? A. Yes, and used it; I am certain it was him; I told master who it was directly I met him at the wicket gate.</p>

Avery was employed on the night of the 10th at my stable. where I had a mare and a foal; I was out that night, and returned about a quarter past twelve o'clock, as near as I can tell; I have known the prisoner for years; as I approached my premises, I heard my farm gate slam too - I approached the gate, and heard Avery say, "John, you may run - I know you," and he was approaching towards me with his light; I said, "Who went out at the gate?" he said, "A man;" I said, "Do you know him?" he said"I do;" I do not know that he told me who it was, and I do not know that I asked him; he took me to the hen-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290077"/>house, and I saw three fowls lying dead, they were warm, and the necks bloody. On the Sunday I was out, and I believe on Monday the prisoner was taken - he lives within three hundred yards of me; he got to his own house in two or three minutes, I have no doubt, from my gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did Avery tell you who it was? A. On the Sunday morning, at breakfast time; he called out, "John Bond, don't run," that night, to the best of my judgement - I think he said Bond; I am not certain about it: I did not ask who he meant; I was out on Sunday, and could not go after him. I thought Avery was talking to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was talking to himself? A. I suppose he was - I judge so; the constable who took him is not here; it was rather a dark night.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said before the Magistrate, that Avery said it was a man whom he knew, and told you that it was John Bond.</p>

The prisoner had been a year and two months in my service; I did not miss any particular article - she was under warning to quit on the 12th of May, and on that day I went into her bed-room; I saw a box which she brought when she came into my service - it was unlocked; I opened it, and found a muslin collar; I went down stairs and called her into the dining room - I asked if any of my young men had sold it her, if any one had given it her, or how she came by it; she denied having it; I then said I would search all the boxes- I went up to her box and found the collar; I found six pairs of gloves, and several other articles which I have not mentioned; we then had information that a box had been removed during some alterations - I spoke to her, and she said there had been an old box removed, but there was nothing in it; I found the box at Mr. Gribble's house, with some shawls, prints and other things in it of mine, with my mark on them - the prisoner was then in custody; the value of all the things is 9l. or 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you go into her bed-room in consequence of some suspicion? A. Yes - I had a brother living with me some time before; I have since heard she has miscarried, in consequence of a connexion in my premises - I never went into her bed-room, except once, when she was ill, out of humanity; my brother lived in the house for two or three weeks while she was there; he did not often come to my house, for we had a dispute - it was nothing about her; she said she took the gloves from my dining-room, and the collar from my parlour, not that my brother gave them to her.</p>

In consequence of suspicion I went to Norden's shop, in Longacre, on the 9th of May - I found a great number of books there; he was not at home; I desired that he might be sent to me when he came home, and in about an hour and a half or two hours he came - I told him I had seen a number of books on his shelves which belonged to me; he said he knew the man very well whom he bought them of; that he was a very respectable man, and he could produce him at any time; he said he had seen him within an hour - I had some conversation with him, and pointed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290078"/>out Holmes to him, and asked if that was the person who sold them to him; he said No, he was not - he knew the person he bought them of, that he bought them for a fair price, and had given money for them; I asked, "How many sets of the Miseries of Human Life do you calculate you have had?" - he said he supposed about eighteen copies; I said, "Are you sure you have not had twenty? because in my warehouse they are all tied up in ten, twenty, or thirty" - he said, "I might have had twenty;" I asked what he gave, but he would not tell me - he said he gave a fair price, and bought them of a man whom he undertook to produce; he then went home, and in about two hours a person came and asked for a book, which I thought I could lay my hand on in a moment; I went and could not find it; I then called Holmes, and said,"Jem, where are the Conversations on Chemistry?" he said he had seen them very lately in that place - I said,"I am very sorry to accuse you, but I think you have been robbing me;" I continued to press him on his being so cruel - "Me, Sir, (said he) I have too good a place to rob you;" I spoke to him some time, and told him it would be better to confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the book been found before? A. Yes; he said he had employed another person to go with them; and he stood at Mr. Norden's door, while the other went in and sold them - I saw Norden the same evening in custody; I told him what the boy had stated; he said he had bought twenty copies of the Miseries, and said he would bring the person he had bought them of, but he has not brought him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known Holmes? A. Two years, and placed unbounded confidence in him; I have trusted him with 100l. and found him just and true - I went to Norden again in the evening, and took him in his own shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is Norden's an open shop? A. Yes; the books lie in front for sale; it is common for people to send books round for sale when they are overstocked; I believe every bookseller has done it; we change them for books or money; the Miseries of Human Life was published twenty years ago; my son has no interest in the books - when I first went to Norden's I saw his wife; I told her the books were mine; I went again in the evening; he and the books still remained there - I think he said the man he bought them of kept a shop in Long-acre; books are often bought at sales and distributed through the trade; he did not mention the man's name; I offered a reward for the apprehension of a man in consequence of what Holmes told me; there were marks in the books, but they are rubbed off; the Miseries of Human Life were in quires at my house, but are now in boards; he was offering them at 6s.; I never sold them under 9s. 6d.; they were published at 14s.; here are several which I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are Mr. Wright's son-in-law? A.

            . I live at Harlesdon-green, on the Harrow-road; I work for Mr. Pipe, a farmer. About nine o'clock, on the 13th of April, I was making a hedge- I went to work after breakfast, and saw the two prisoners on the dung-hill; I did not know them before, but they are the men; I went nearly close to them, and saw each of them take a basket on his shoulder, and go away; I had left my tools there, and I thought they had taken them - but they had taken the harness out of a hole there; my master came across the field, and told me to go after them; I did not, but they came back soon after, and with the same two baskets; my master then told me to follow them, and he would come on a horse; I went after them- I lost sight of Smith, basket and all, but I took Johnson, and found in his basket two pairs and a half of hames, a collar, and two pairs of traces; my master asked where he got it; he said the other man gave him half-a-crown to help him; we took him to the Plough public-house at Kensall-green, and there the harness was owned by Mr. Broughton.</p>

I saw the prisoner running and buttoning up his coat - he was stopped, and I saw my partner's saw taken from him, and mine was by his side.</p>

The prisoner gave up the duplicates of these things, and was committed for trial; they owed me 16s. or 17s.</p>

I said, No; he mentioned one or two circumstances, and at last I did believe that I had hung them up; I went home and searched the shop, but they were not there - Mr. Matthews sent me back; I went and met him at the end of Playhouse-yard, and said, "Where are you going?" he said, "I am coming to tell you where the shoes are;" I said, "I will save you the trouble - I will not let you go till I get an officer;" I took him to the shop; he was there about five minutes denying that he had the shoes - Mr. Matthews came round and took them out of his pocket; I believe he did not know what he was about, or he would not have acted so; he was sober.</p>

On the evening of the 28th of April I went to the Flower Pot public-house, in Bishopsgate-street, about ten or half-past ten o'clock, with a friend, and saw the prisoner standing at the bar; I am in the habit of going to that house sometimes - my friend is not here; he is driver of a Hackney stage; I went in to treat him - we had three pints of ale and a glass of Scotch whiskey; I took four sovereigns and a half from a purse in my pocket, and changed the half sovereign to pay - I put the change and the sovereigns into my left-hand trousers pocket again; we were there about three quarters of an hour, but did not sit down; my friend got on his stage, and I went towards home - the prisoner followed me; he stood at my right hand in the house, and saw me take out my money; I was not drunk, but had taken more than usual - we had no conversation; it struck eleven o'clock when I got to the end of <placeName id="t18280529-188-crimeloc1050">Worship-street</placeName>

I said, Yes; he said to the prisoner,"I think, young man, you will be wanted;" the prisoner then ran, the watchman followed, and sprung his rattle; the first watchman in Shoreditch met him, and brought him back in a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not meet him on Fish-street-hill? A. I never saw him there; I had been to Dock-head on business; I was in the Tailors Arms public-house at Shad Thames - I had a pint of half-and-half and a glass of gin and water; I was in no other public-house; I cut my purse open at the Flower Pot because it was in a knot, and I could not open it - I had no other money: I did not fall down before; I was not insensibly drunk - I did not speak to the prisoner, nor he to me: I did not give him my money to keep.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your brother watchman see him throw the money away? A.

On the 10th of May, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from Drury-lane Theatre, and just as I entered the Arcade, Regent-street, I missed my handkerchief, which I had safe when I was going to the Theatre; I remarked to a friend that I had lost it; I was going on, when the officer came, and told me he had seen it taken - he went and took the two prisoners; the handkerchief has not been found - I had not seen the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had not seen the handkerchief for some hours? A. No: it was a yellow silk one, and had my initials on it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in company in Coventry-street; I followed them, and saw them make several attempts at this gentleman's pocket, both there and up Titchhourne-street; and when they got under the Quadrant, I saw Mulford take the handkerchief from the pocket, while Smith was close to him; I went and told the gentleman, who gave me his address: I then went up to the prisoners, who were in company, following another gentleman - I spoke to a gentleman, and said, "I want your assistance;" I then rushed forward, and took them - there were a great many people, as the Theatre was just over; I found one handkerchief on Smith, and another round his leg; he said his leg had a wound in it; I found one handkerchief round Mulford's neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance were you? A. Just across the road, opposite them; I spoke to the gentleman before I seized them - I cannot say how many persons I have prosecuted; Phillips saw it also - I lodge with him- he keeps a china-shop in Great Queen-street; he is not an officer; I cannot say how many cases he has prosecuted- he seldom asks for his expences; I do not recollect whether I prosecuted a man named Banks last Session.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person named Banks was not discharged by proclamation last Session? A. No, not to my recollection- I took no money from a person of that name, nor from his relatives, not to prosecute; I took no money from anybody not to prosecute - I defy you to prove it; I do not recollect the name at any time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you bound over to prosecute any person last Session, who was discharged by proclamation? A. I did not; I will not swear it, but I believe I had but one case last Session which was thrown out - that was a foreigner, and I was not called before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not send Phillips after the gentleman? A. He wishes to decline anything till he comes here.</p>

            . I was coming through Coventry-street with Whittingham - he said "There are two chaps over the way," they followed this gentleman along Tichbourne-street into <placeName id="t18280529-189-crimeloc1055">Regent-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you go out with Whittingham? A. For the purpose of detecting offenders - I go out now and then with him; I crossed the road with him; I did not call Mr. Weld, I did not want to interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been here with Whittingham? A. When he cannot do without me I come - the Magistrate generally sends for me; I never passed as an officer, nor carry a staff; I swear I did not take a staff out that night -Whittingham told me not to go after them, as we could take them both when we had assistance; I believe I had my expences once last Session - I do not think I have been in above two or three cases with Whittingham; I do not think I had my expences in above two or three cases - I have prosecuted many a score of persons without having my expences, but not with Whittingham - I will not swear I have not prosecuted in forty cases - when I get my expences I generally give them to the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not prosecuted a dozen cases in conjunction with Whittingham? A. Yes, I think I can safely swear that - I was here last Session; I was robbed myself, and Whittingham was the officer - I was here once or twice the Session before last; Whittingham was the officer in them - I think I first came here with him six months ago - I only go out for amusement, I do not remember the name of Banks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What property was lost the last time Whittingham was a witness? A. A servant of mine concealed my goods about him, I had my expences for that; I have been here often, I watch thieves - I have not had my expences nine times out of ten.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MULFORD. When Phillips came up he put a staff over our heads and seized me by the throat - I never saw the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to WILLIAM WHITTINGHAM. Q. Upon your oath has not Phillips, when in your company, carried a staff, and acted as a constable? A. When I see him with me I sometimes give him my staff to hold; I have at times given him my staff; he had not one that night.</p>

Barrett struck him on the shoulder and ran away; the watchman came up - I gave charge of Rose: we ran after Barrett - we got the handkerchief from the area afterwards; the gentleman came back, but there were twenty or thirty thieves about - he went away, and did not tell us his name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were there altogether? A. Perhaps one hundred; they tried to trip Whittingham up - the watchman is not here; I had a staff in my hand that night - I do not often have it; the gentleman said, his handkerchief was partly red and partly a flesh colour.</p>

There was a number of thieves surrounded him, and fairly frightened him away; I did not hear all that the gentleman said - I did not hear him say what colour the handkerchief was; I sometimes carry two staffs - I believe I have given Phillips a staff to hold while I have been tying the thieves; he has had it in his hand before - I cannot say whether it was often.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 3rd of May I was fetched to Mr. Dickinson's warehouse - Bamber was offering this silk for sale; I detained him, and from what he said, I went to Pitkin's, who went with us to the dye-house and took the prisoner - I told him I suspected him of stealing some silk; he denied it - I told him he had been seen to take a parcel out of the stable; he said the boy Roe had seen him put it into the stable - Roe said the prisoner had asked him for the key, and taken a bundle out, but he had not seen him put it in; the stable is under the dye-house - there is a loft over it; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the bundle which he took out; he said it was only some shirts he had to wash - that he had taken it to a butcher whose wife washed for him; I then told him the silk had been found - he made no reply; his master said "How could you think of robbing me. when I have taken you from a state of starvation?" he was dreadfully agitated, and said "I am starving now sir."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not very east to swear to silk? A. No; but I believe it to be mine - there is not much of this made in London.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PHILLIPS. I am ostler to Mr. Dickinson. On this Friday Moss was loading a cart of rubbish with me; I saw him go for Roe, and go into the stable - he came out with a bundle; and in the evening I noticed some silk, similar to this in his hat - it is here; I asked what he was going to do with it; he said he was going round to two or three places with it for Mr. Dickinson.</p>

            . I am a silk manufacturer. I employed Gilbert to sell this silk; I received it from the prisoner that day - I did not know whether he was a master or what; he said he had some silk which came from a gentleman in the country, and asked if I knew anybody who could dispose of it - he gave me about 8lbs., I took it to Gilbert.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot swear this is the silk? A. No. I believe it to be the same; it was exactly these colours - I am not in the habit of selling silk for strangers; I had known him about nine days, but never sold anything for him before; he asked if I knew who would buy it - I expected to have about 6d. in the pound commission, which is usual. I have been in custody ever since: I did not ask where he lived - he came to my house, into my kitchen; my wife was not present - I did not expect him to come; I had never been at Mr. Dickinson's dye-house, and was never in custody before: he was to come in the evening for the money; I asked Gilbert to sell it for me.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Graham's employ, and know these handkerchiefs - I sold two off this piece last Saturday week; I took particular notice how I cut it - I had a pair of scissors which would not cut well, and they made a particular mark, and it was missing on the Monday - I can swear this is the same piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the mark? A. It is notched - there is no shop mark on it; I was not asked about it till after the prisoner was gone.</p>

            . On the 18th of April, in the afternoon, I was at Islington, and saw Crossley with four others: I followed them to Clerkenwell-green, and then fetched Hobson - he pointed him out, and said he was certain of him; I brought him to a lamp-post, and told him to look well at him: I had Crossley and another boy; he looked at them both, and said that was not the boy, but Crossley was; I took him to the watch-house. On the 1st of May I saw Aston with three others, in St. John-street-road - there was a crowd looking at Jack in the Green, and I saw Aston untying a handkerchief from a child's neck: I could not take him then, but watched him, and in the afternoon I took Hobson there, and he pointed him out.</p>

               <p>ROBERT SHERIMAN. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half; in consequence of information given by me to the Mint, I was placed under the direction of Limbrick, the officer. On the 8th of May I saw the prisoner and again on the 15th, and told him I should see him in a day or two; I saw him again on the 27th, but before that I met Limbrick, Kirby, Reynolds, Lloyd and Isaacs; I was searched by Limbrick, for the purpose of seeing whether I had anything about me, but I had not - Limbrick then gave me four marked shillings, and half-a-crown and sixpence which were not marked. I went with them to the prisoner's house, in <placeName id="t18280529-211-crimeloc1169">Cobb's-yard, Petticoat-lane</placeName>

I stepped to the door, gave a signal to Reynolds and Isaacs, who came in - the prisoner's sister and his foolish brother were in the house; they made great resistance; when the officers let go of the sister, she made a rush, picked up something which I thought was the bag, and ran to the privy; I had not observed where the prisoner had put the bag - Reynolds rushed after her, and caught her arm as it was down the privy; the twenty counterfeit shillings were found on me; the sister came to me and asked if I had any shofle about me, if I had to put it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who employed you? A. I spoke to Mr. Powell, and he sent for Limbrick; I was never in custody - my wife is in custody at Chelmsford, charged with passing bad money; I sell sweetmeats - I was a gentleman's servant about six years ago; I never did a job of this kind before; Limbrick gave me the marked money at the Crown tavern, on Clerkenwell-green, about twelve o'clock on that day; I went straight to Cobb's yard - I have received nothing for this, nor been promised anything - I expect to be paid for my trouble.</p>

            . I am an inspector of coin. These twenty shillings are all counterfeit; they are in separate papers, being so slightly covered with silver - eighteen are from one die, and two from another; there are some from both dies in the bag - they are all bad half crowns and half sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Are they fit for circulation? A. They are not what is called"rubbed down;" they now represent money just come from the Mint; the persons who pass them generally rub them down - thousands have been passed in this state.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He left you on the 20th? A. Yes; he went out on pleasure I understood - he returned on the Monday, and said his absence was caused by illness; I said I should not take him again, and he went away; I saw him again a few days after at his lodgings, No. 27, London-terrace, Hackney-road; I did not say I was sorry I could not take him again - I have a person named Balding in my employ - he is here; I never knew of my servants selling goods to each other - he proposed to take the stock in November.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever authorize them to sell to each other? A. I authorized Balding to sell the prisoner twenty-four yards of gros de Naples, but nothing else - it has not been paid for; here is the stock-book - this piece is entered as cut, and not to be put with whole pieces.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the stock taken by him or you? A. By him; it was only of the Irish linen; I saw this Irish entered in the book, and might see the piece - it was marked when it came in, which was not twelve months ago; I had no other of that mark; the book is in the prisoner's handwriting - he states it to be on hand in November.</p>

               <p>JAMES HALL. I live at Bexley-place, Greenwich. In February last, in consequence of an advertisement in the newspaper, I wrote a letter (see No. 1) directed to S. S., Albany, and on the 18th of March I received this answer,(see No. 2); my servant brought it to me, and next day I went to No. 20, Dover-street, Piccadilly, I saw the prisoner, who stated that his name was Jelf, and having other business at Greenwich he had called at my house the day before, respecting the letter I had written in answer to an advertisement - that he should have noticed it before, but he had been into the country to fetch his wife: he said he had some trust-money to advance, which would not be required for eight months for the purposes of the trust, and asked what sum I required. I said, "We will say for the present about 1000l." and I proposed to deposit deeds of freeholds as a security. He said there was another gentleman to be consulted, and said "If you have a bill, Mr. Hall, it will be more satisfactory, as there will then be two persons as security." I happened to have in my pocket a bill drawn by myself on Mr. Richard Delves, of Tunbridge-wells, for 1000l., and accepted by him payable at Sir James Esdaile's - it was dated 5th of December, 1827, at twelve months date. I handed it over to him, he said "This will do; will you leave it with me that I may make enquiries respecting the responsibility of yourself and Mr. Delves." I had endorsed the bill when it first came into my possession, but that did not occur to me at the time; it was payable to my order; I handed it to him and left it with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it left with him for any purpose whatever than what you have stated? A. It was left for inquiry only - no advance whatever was made on it - this was on Wednesday; he appointed for me to call on the Friday, to hear the report as to the inquiry. I called on Friday; he then stated that he had not had time to make the inquiries, and appointed for me to call again; he gave me at that time this memorandum. (read.) "5th December, 1827, at twelve months after date 1000l., signed J. Hall. To Mr. R. Delves, Tunbridge Wells. Sir, received the above bill, to do the needful or return, 21st March, 1828." On my arriving at home that day I found this note, which I should have received on the Thursday, (see No. 3.) On the Monday before I had received this note from him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290099"/>(see No. 4.) - On the Monday or Tuesday following I called at his house, as from some information I had become desirous of having the bill - I saw him, and he stated that he had given it to a friend, who would call on me to ascertain if it was my signature, and to make inquiries - that he would call at nine o'clock in the morning or five o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, and requested me to be at home - he did not say who his friend was - I remained at home, nobody called - I called at his house on Wednesday but did not see him - I called on Thursday night, Mrs. Jelf said he was not at home - I said I would wait till he returned - I waited and saw him - he came into the room, but I observed his hat was on the table all the time, which induced me to wait for the purpose of getting the bill back - I stated that Mr. Delves was in town, and would give other bills for it - he said the bill was not in his possession, but he would meet me at Mr. Isaacs, his attorney, next day, and return it. I went to Mr. Isaacs but he did not come - I did not see him again - I received this letter from him,(see No. 5) - I have never received a shilling from him - I do not know what he means by the "small balance" - I published bills describing his person, and offering 50l. reward for him - I have not recovered the bill, or any proceeds for it - I enquired at the Albany and found there was a Mr. Simms there, a ship-broker, but nobody of the prisoner's description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You found the porter of the Albany received letters from the prisoner? A. Yes. Mr. Delves is not here - I did not take the bill in my pocket to get him to discount it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not on the Friday take the bill out of his pocket, and offer to return it to you? A. No, he did not; I demanded it on two occasions - he said, at the second interview, that it would he more convenient if the bill was exchanged for small ones, as they would be more easily negotiated - I wrote a note about bills of 200l. and 300l. in order to get the hill back, as I had seen Mr. Roe, of Marlborough-street, on the subject, and after what I heard I should have had no dealings with him; if he had offered me 1000l. I do not believe I should have taken it and left the bill - I never breakfasted with him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you inquired at the Albany and found letters had been left there, had you ascertained whether the person was known there? A. The porter said he knew nothing about him, but he had asked him to take in letters for him - I never intended to part with my bill - he never produced it to me after I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your purpose was to obtain a certain sum of money? A. Yes; he was to have had the deeds and the bill; the offer I made to get other bills was in order to get it back; Mr. Delves is a good respectable man.</p>

            . I am porter at the Albany. I know Mr. Simms, a ship-broker; the prisoner came to the lodge door, and said, "If a letter comes directed S. S., will you have the goodness to take charge of it;" I did not know him - he did not live in the Albany; I received a few letters, and afterwards told him it was against my order to take in letters, except for gentlemen connected with the building; he said, "Very well, I will direct them to my solicitor, in the Temple." I had four or five letters; several persons called to make inquiries - I told them I knew nothing about him.</p>
               <p>The following are the Letters referred to.</p>
               <p>No. 1. 4th of March, 1828.</p>
               <p>SIR, - Having just been informed by a friend of an advertisement relative to a sum of money to be advanced, I beg leave to mention, that I have occasion for an advance of 2000l. or 3000l.; shall be obliged by a line, appointing an interview, addressed to my residence, Bexley-place, Greenwich.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALL.</p>
               <p>No. 2. 18th of March.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I waited on you in consequence of a letter addressed to my clerk, Mr. Simms, at the Albany; having some business in Greenwich to-day: if you will call on me from eleven to two o'clock to-morrow, I will make a point of being in the way, and conferring with you on the subject of your letter.</p>
               <p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J. JELF.</p>
               <p>No. 20, Dover-street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>No. 3.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jelf's compliments to Mr. Hall, and will thank him to call on Saturday instead of Friday.</p>
               <p>No. 4.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - My friend is making some inquiries at Tunbridge, and on Thursday I shall be able to speak to you definitively; I shall be at Greenwich on Thursday afternoon, and will be at your house about five o'clock. J. JELF.</p>
               <p>No. 5. Dover, 2d of April. 1828.</p>
               <p>SIR, - Business of great importance obliges me to leave for France, for a short time, and I am this moment getting into the steam-packet for Calais; on my return I will call upon you, and give you the small balance which may be due to you upon the bill. J. JELF.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Law left the bill with me to get discounted; he has partaken of my bounty repeatedly - I was obliged to leave home, respecting some persons who had given me bills, and who have since fled; as to the balance I allude to. he was to have had 200l. or 300l. in cash, which was all he seemed to require; this arrange<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290100"/>ment would have been settled, but when I found that in my absence my character had been aspersed, and improper language used to my wife, I certainly refused to relinquish the bill till satisfaction had been made for injuries so serious, and conduct so detestable; if proper satisfaction had been made he would not have found me backward in fulfilling my intentions.</p>

            . I am in Hugh McIntosh's employ. I had to drive the horses from St. James's-park to Richmond, to fetch turf to beautify the gardens; the ostler puts the horse corn out in sacks every morning at the stable-yard at Westminster; I was employed for eight days going to Richmond, till the 14th of May - we had about three bushels of chaff and corn every morning to feed fourteen horses. On the 8th of May Hale and Kent gave a sack of corn to Haynes, at the Old George public-house, Brompton; he gave him all that the ostler had given out for the horses; Haynes was at the stable - I saw him give Hale half-a-crown, and Kent told me he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290103"/>had another; I should think it was worth about 5s.; Mr. McIntosh's name was on the cart - Haynes took the corn into the stable and stowed it; he returned the sack directly, and they went away; when Kent heard that Mr. McIntosh had heard of it, he came to me and said he would give me three sovereigns if I would say nothing about it - I told of it last Saturday week, not before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you mention the three sovereigns at Bow-street? A. Yes - I do not know whether my evidence was read over to me; I believe it was; I did not see what was in the sack - it was given out to us as corn; I abused Kent, because the corn was not given to the horses - I had no money; they offered me beer several times, but I refused it - I had one pint with them; I did not like to make a disturbance about it, as I had only been there a few days - I had no quarrel with them about a jacket, it was with another servant; I did not mention it till after that - we had the nose-bag full for the horses to eat.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any quarrel with them? A. No; the horses had nothing more than was in the corn-bin - Colopy was with me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the sacks filled? A. Yes - 5s. 6d each would be a fair price for them; I knew it was for the horses - I did not like to tell master, but I did three days after; I only see the foreman once a week - I had part of the beer which was bought with the money - I cannot say how much I drank; they were taken up about a week after.</p>

            . I am laundress to Mr. Windle. I locked up his chambers, which are in the Middle Temple, on Friday the 4th of January; he had gone out of town a few days before - I had gone there every day, except Sunday; I went there again on the 5th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I found the outer door only on one lock, and the other door open, the blinds were drawn down, and the lamp was on the floor; it was in a very different state to what I had left it on the 4th - I looked round and was rather frightened, but did not know whether Mr. Windle had been there or not; I locked the chambers and went away - I went again on the next day, which was Sunday, a little after three o'clock, to look more particularly - the first thing I then saw was one of the drawers of the office table was broken open; I looked farther, and found all the drawers were broken open but two, which had not been locked, and the cellaret was broken open; I missed a tea-caddy, a brown silk umbrella, a clothes-bag, and a key, which were left at the chambers; I have since seen the caddy in Mr. Windle's possession, and the clothes-bag at Worship-street - I found a crow-bar and a chisel in the chambers; I gave them to the porter, and a gentleman who I fetched to the chambers- the outer door had not been broken; the key went in as easily as when I left it, but was only locked once - I had locked it twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you positive of that? A. Yes; I remarked, as I did not mean to go again that day that I had locked it safe - I found it singly locked on the Saturday; I double locked it on the Friday - I found the cupboards and drawers open, and the foul linen on the floor; I did not examine minutely that day, being alarmed and thinking Mr. Windle might have been there unknown to me - I made no more inquiry that day; I noticed it more on Sunday, when I went there to see if I could find Mr. Windle; I did not look for the key on Saturday - I locked the door when I came out; I went on Sunday to Mr. Tattersal's in Bloomsbury-square, and told him of it - I never saw the prisoner till he was taken up some months after; I heard he had been taken and was liberated - I have been a laundress four or five years.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. Q. Did you send to Mr. Tattersal on the Saturday? A. Yes, but he was not at his chambers; I went to his house on Sunday, and found him - he is a friend of Mr. Windle's; I attend to three other gentlemen's chambers.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday the 4th of January, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner crossing the road; he crossed Whitecross-street, went up a turning, and knocked at a backdoor; I followed him, as he seemed in a hurry, and passed him two or three yards - I then saw him turn back, and go into Whitecross-street again; I lost sight of him for about a minute and a half. I then saw him come across, and go into the front door of a house with this bag - I followed him in directly, and asked what he had got there; he said his father's clothes - I said that would not satisfy me, he must go with me to the watch-house: I took him there, and then said, "How did you say you got these things?" He said, "I met a gentleman in Holborn, who employed me to carry this bag:" I asked if he knew the gentleman; he said, "No:" I said, "Do you know what is in the bag;" he said No; I said "I must know;" I looked in and found all these articles - I have kept most of them ever since, but not all; I searched him and found these keys on him, and thinking one was not a right key, I said I should detain him - I looked into his hat and found some handkerchiefs; he was taken to Worship-street and examined three times, and then discharged as no owner was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he held to bail? A. No; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290105"/>was at full liberty - he knew he was discharged, because I could not find the owner; he was taken again in three or four months - he was at liberty till then; he knew he was liable to be taken if the owner was found.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. Q. Do you recollect when you found the owner? A. I think about a week after he was discharged - the prosecutor came down to me; I then searched for him many a night and day.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner in a room in George-street, Shoreditch, on the 9th of May, about half-past six o'clock in the morning: I told him it was for Mr. Windle's robbery; he said, "It is of no use - I know I must go with you;" I had seen him the night before, in the skittle-ground of a public-house in Plough-yard, Shoreditch, but he made his escape. I found two skeleton-keys in his room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call these skeleton-keys? A. Yes - they are skeleton-keys for Bramah's locks; I got them from a young woman who was in bed with him. I have been an officer nearly fifteen years.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-surveyor. On the 11th of May, at 2 o'clock in the morning, I saw a light on board the Brigg barge, and saw a can handed down from the deck; I went on board and found Saffery on the deck; I said "What have you there?" He said,"Porter and a general cargo;" I went into the hold and found a spile in the porter cask - I said, "You have been spiling a cask, and I saw a can handed down;" Austin, who was below, said it was necessary to spile casks - I searched for the can, and said it was very odd I could not find it; I went down a second time with Dean, the master, and found the can under a sack, with a quantity of porter in it - I found a gimblet on Austin, and a piece of a different spile; the gimblet was wet, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290107"/>fitted the hole in the cask; Austin said, "We were very dry, and thought no harm of taking a little porter."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does not the beer work at times? A. Yes; they then make a hole in the top of the cask, but this was in the head; their work is hard.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not drunk? A. No - nor was I sober; I could have walked home - I live at East Ham; I cannot say that I ever saw the prisoner - I was not in Fleet-street that day - Yes, I was certainly, but I did not drink till I got to Tower-hill: I went to two public-houses; I drank nothing but gin and beer - I was on Tower-hill about ten o'clock in the morning; I cannot tell what houses I went into, or at what times I drank - I was not at four public-houses; I went and stopped the cheque next morning - I was knocked down by the side of the river.</p>

On the 6th of May I saw this property safe in a box in my room about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner at the bottom of the court at ten - I saw him again in my room at half-past eleven o'clock, getting out of my window; I was going into my room, and he pushed against the door - I waited some time, and saw him go from behind the door and stand in the middle of the room- I cried out, "Lord have mercy upon me;" Stephens came from the water-closet, and the prisoner made his way out at the window; I went in and shut the window, put the fastenings on it, and sent Stephens to tell my husband; I went and fetched Mr. Worrall to go into my room with me; I found my trunk broken open, and the articles stated taken from it; I saw the prisoner in about three hours.</p>

I have known the prisoner about eight months - he lived in an up stairs room of mine about eight months ago; he has borne a good character. On the day he was taken up, he came to my house to ask me if the landlord had a room to let; I said Yes, and he said he would wait for the landlord; he waited from ten minutes past eleven o'clock till near two, and then went away, and I never saw him any more; I do not know what day of the week it was, but it was the beginning of May, about the 5th or 6th - I am quite sure it was the day he was taken up, because his father came the day after, to ask me if he had taken a room in the house - I am quite certain he did not move from the step of my door till two o'clock that day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any more than one pair of spectacles on him? A.

I took King about a week after the robbery, at her own house at Hammersmith; Grimshaw lodged there, but he was not at home - he afterwards came and surrendered himself to me; when I took King, she said Grimshaw gave her the spoons; that he was going to work, and saw them laying in the road.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 20th of May, I fastened up the house and went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock - everything was secure; I got up about half-past six and found the back kitchen window open, a piece cut out of the shutter, and the iron bars which go across, were forced - I know these two dresses - they were wet and were in the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA SCOTT. I am a widow and rent this house. I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; this small silver box is mine and was on the front parlour mantel-piece; I know these dresses and other articles - my house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington; all these things were in the house the day before.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BOND. I lodge at the prosecutrix's house. This is my hat; I left it in the hall, with these gloves in it - it was gone in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the property in the brick field, near the house.</p>
