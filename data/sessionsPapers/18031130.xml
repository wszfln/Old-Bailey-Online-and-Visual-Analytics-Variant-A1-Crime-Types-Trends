             sworn. - I am a Thames Police-officer: On the 24th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty near St. Catharine's-lane, and saw the prisoner, (whom I had often seen before as a <rs id="t18031130-6-deflabel39" type="occupation">waterman</rs>

I then pursued the other, whom I also knew, and he dropped his bag; I picked up the two bags, and took them into a public-house, and coming out again, I saw the prisoner pass the door and looking about; he saw me, and ran away; I pursued him, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Did you see them land? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not heard of the other man? - A. No. (The bags produced.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A young man came to me at the stairs, and asked me if I would assist him to carry a bag of smuggled coffee which he had purchased, and I did; I did not know it was stolen.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - On the 23d of November, I was going along Charlotte-street, between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner stooping and peeping through the palisadoes of No. 17, I went on, and looking round I missed him; I went back past the house, and saw him under the arch-way of the area-door, peeping in, and make a slip back, as if he saw something he was afraid of; he then went in, and came out again, and came up; I went on to Plumsted-street, where I met Lee, an officer, and told him there was a suspicious man; he went back, and saw the prisoner come up the stairs, I laid hold of him, and saw the pelice hanging out of his bosom; the officer then came up, and we took him to Bow-street. (The things produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>(Lee, the officer, confirmed the testimony of the last witness.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember seeing me a minute before? - A. I remember seeing you come out of the area, and thought you were one of the servants at first, till I observed your bulk, and you began to run.</p>
               <p>Q. What did I say? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not say, Lord have mercy on me? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was born in the city of Frankfort, in High Germany, and have been in England above ten years; I have lived in Birmingham, and came to London for a pass to go home to my mother; going along to the Imperial Ambassador's, I met Cummins with those things in his hand, and he asked me if I would buy them; I said I was no such person, being a watch screw maker, and finisher; he held them up before me for half a minute, till Lee came and took me. When I was in the New Prison, a young woman came to see her husband, and said she lived at Cummins's, who had heard him say he had catched a nice green horn; I questioned her about it, and she promised to come in my behalf, and tell what he said; but as her husband is in confinement, and she has three or four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300006"/>children, she is afraid of being turned out, I suppose, as she is not come.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Cummins.) Q. Is any part of that true? - A. Not one part of it; I have no tenant in confinement, or any thing like it.</p>

             sworn. - I know the prisoner, and I know Levy; I saw him when he was taking him from the Compter to Guildhall to be examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you? - A. A publican at Mile-end; as they were going along, Levy said to the prisoner, you may give me what you like, I can do the trick; then we went into a public-house, and had something to drink, I believe a glass of brandy a piece, and I saw some money pass from the prisoner to the constable; I understood he was to give him part then, and part when he got to Guildhall. I have known the prisoner a twelvemonth; he was a pork-butcher in Golden-lane till within these three months; he bears a very honest character.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you? - A. I keep the George, in Pelham-street, Mile-end New Town; I kept the Stationers Arms, in St. John-street, before that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>- WEDBY sworn. - I live at No. 2: I was alarmed on the 14th of November that there were thieves breaking into my garret-window, I went up, and learnt that a man had gone past the garret-window to No. 3; I then went to No. 3, and spoke to Mrs. Kennedy who keeps the house, it is a house of ill fame: I asked her who she had got in the garret; she said her brother was gone up; I went up and saw the last witness; one of the prisoners was sitting on the bed, and the other standing by his side; Kennedy asked them what they had been at; Kennedy went out at the window to No. 3, and called to me to detain those that were in the room: Mrs. Kennedy came up, and seeing the bed rather rumpled she turned down the bed-clothes, and there discovered the lead; I immediately went for two officers, and brought them with me, I gave charge of them; Green did not lodge there, he is a married man; it is a house of ill fame, and he might lodge there as any other man might do; he declared his innocence to the last: and when I first entered the room, he said, if there is any thing amiss, here I am, as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Green. (To Kennedy.) Q. Were you not indicted for keeping a house of ill fame in Wharton's-court, Holborn? - A. It is a falsehood.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not your sister, at this moment, keep a disorderly house for women of the town? - A. I cannot say; she lets her house out to lodgers.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the young man that received the wound? - A. Yes; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoners; Green said he was innocent, and Griffiths said he knew nothing about it; the lead was in the room by the side of the bed. (Produces the lead.)</p>
               <p>Lyons. I compared the lead with Wedby, and it corresponded with the window where it came off.</p>
               <p>Wedby. I saw it compared, and it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Lyons.) Do you receive the rent of this house? - A. Yes; I have a lease of it from Mr. Leverton, I have three houses in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Kennedy.) Did Green oppose your coming into the room? - A. Yes; he said I had no business there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say he lodged there? - A. He took the key up stairs just before, and wished me a good night, saying he was going to bed; he went up about six o'clock, as nigh as I can guess, and said he was going to bed; I had not seen Griffiths before.</p>

               <p>Griffiths's defence, My wife was not at home, and I went to the Red-lion to have a pint of beer; I found the young woman there that rented this room, and I asked her to let me cook a bit of victuals in her room, and she gave me leave; I went there, and pulled off my coat to wash my hands; Green came up, and said he had been upon guard, and was in liquor, and wanted to lie down; I told him I would not incommode him, I would go to the cook's-shop and get something; I was going away when those people came up, I know nothing of the lead; it is a house full of disorderly women,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300014"/>and the door is always open to all comers and goers.</p>

On the Sunday, the prisoner and another man were at Mr. Plumb's, in the tap-room, I had never seen them before, to my knowledge, it was between twelve and one o'clock; one of them said, it is time we should go; he said, we may as well go the back way; there is a back way leads up a passage by the stable, where my quicksets were; I had a suspicion they might take some of them, as I had lost a great many at different times; they went the back way, I went out at the fore door, where I could command the passage; I stopped there, they did not come out of the passage while I stood there; I saw the prisoner come across the lane, with a bundle of quicksets under his arm; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I called to him, and told him he had got my property; I desired him to carry them back, and put them where he had them from, which he did; he then turned to go about his business; I said, no, friend, you are not to go off so; we went down the yard together, and he said, call Mr. Plumb out; I asked Mr. Plumb his name, and he told me; the prisoner said, he took them out to look at, to see if they were as good as his own; I saw nothing more of the other man; they were close together when I saw the prisoner with the quicksets, about six yards from the stable-door; there were twenty-nine bundles in the place; this was only part of a bundle; he could have carried a great deal more, I should suppose half a dozen bundles; each bundle generally contains one thousand; it is worth one shilling a hundred; it was part of two bundles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am in the same line as he is; I went with another man through the stable, both doors were open; I took them out to the other man to shew them to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Before they were gone out of the shop, Goddard came in, and asked for a yard of cloth, which she paid eleven pence for; when they were gone, we missed a piece of print.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the persons? - A. The man and Price went up North-street, and Goddard the other way; I followed Price, and said, my sister wanted to speak to her about the money they left on the print; she returned with me down the street, and the man went on; she then said, she would go back to her son; I said, I would go with her; we turned to the City-road, and as she was near the gutter, I looked down, and observed she kept her hand close down on her pocket-hole; I then drew back, and saw the print in her hand through her pocket-hole. I then charged her with the robbery; she dropped it to the ground; I held her fast with one hand, and picked the print up with the other; and, with assistance, took her back. My sister is not here, having lately been brought to-bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Goddard speak to the man or woman? - A. No, I did not observe her speak to either of them; I observed nothing further between them than Price and the man speak to her in the street, and she came into the shop after them about five minutes.</p>

The Magistrate gave him till the 19th to consider whether he would go into the Army of Reserve; he would not, and then he was committed. I am sure he is the man; he said before the Magistrate that the other young man and he had been drinking at the house of a man, of the name of Baldwin, in Fore-street, that they came together from Fore-street to Drury-lane, and that the other had led him a one side; that was the term he used.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to Shadwell school, I am going of thirteen years old, my father is a cooper, and works at Shoreditch: On the 20th of October, I was going from Shoreditch to Goswell-place, near Islington, about six o'clock in the evening, I had a great bundle with me belonging to Mr.

            ; I saw him pack up shirts, handkerchiefs, aprons, stockings, and waistcoats, into the bundle. As I was going along Shoreditch, I looked into a doctor's shop, and the least of the two prisoners, (Pounceford,) came up to me; he asked me if he should carry my bundle; I told him I was not going much further; as I went up Curtain-road, I met the other prisoner. Pounceford had followed me; they spoke together in the Curtain-road, but I did not hear what they said; I went into a public-house to ask what it was o'clock, and they stopped at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that for the purpose of getting rid of them? - A. Yes; and when I came out, they were waiting at the door; I kept on till I came to <placeName id="t18031130-37-crimeloc225">Vinegar-yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. They knocked you down before they took your bundle? - A. Yes, I had it in both arms close to my breast, because it was a large bundle; I screamed, and Mr. Holloway came out; the prisoners ran away, and Mr. Holloway ran after them; he could not catch them, and then he took me in, and wrote a letter to Mr. Wilson, where Mr. Penn lived. The next day I went with Brown and Elby to look after them, and we met them in Rose-lane, Spital-fields, leading towards Whitechapel; I told Mr. Brown it was them that took the bundle from me; they heard me say so, and they both ran away, and got into the broad place.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure those are the two boys? - A. Yes, I am certain of it, I have no doubt; I saw Pounceford at the doctor's shop, where it was very light, and I could see his face; I have not the least doubt they are the persons; I saw Green at a baker's shop in the Curtain-road, and I saw him at the public-house door; every light place I came to, I looked at their faces.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you look so particularly at their faces? - A. They would keep up with me, and wanted to carry my bundle; when I came out of the public-house, they were waiting for me; I ran away, and they caught me at Vinegar-yard; I am perfectly sure they are the same persons.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Has the property ever been found? - A. No part of it. I belong to the Public-Office, Shadwell: On the 21st of October I heard of the robbery, and sent for the boy, and asked him if he should know the persons again; he said, yes; I took him to the broad place where these kind of people toss up in a morning. In Rose-lane we passed the two prisoners; Elby was before me, and the boy behind; the boy said, here they are, both of them; upon that, they both ran away; we pursued them into the broad place, where there were, I suppose, twenty or thirty of these sort of people, and there we lost sight of the prisoners; I then had a private information of them, and I went to a private lodging in Wentworth-street, on the 25th of November, in company with Elby, and apprehended them both; they were in bed, in two different garrets; the servant went up first, and said, George, open the door, here is a gentleman wants to see you; he would not open the door, and I told him I would break it open; he then jumped out of bed, and unbolted the door; he was going into bed again, and I said, come, come, put on your clothes, I want you; I knew him immediately to be the person who ran away from me on the 21st; then I made the other get up, and open his door; the doors are close together; he said, Mr. Brown, do you want me too? he knew me very well; I told him, yes; we secured them, and brought them before the Magistrate. I knew them both before, and I am sure they are the same persons I had seen in Rose-lane; I took particular notice of the shortest, being very much pock-marked; they acknowledged running away from me in Rose-lane.</p>

I had in my right-hand pocket some money in a leather purse, and in my left-hand pocket a note for 20 l. two two-pound Bank notes, and two one-pound Bank notes; I found my watch and money safe, but the notes gone; I immediately went down Gray's-Inn-lane after them, and found them standing together; the tall woman (Cheese) had in her muff a piece of white paper, which I snatched out of her hand, I looked at it, and found it was the twenty-pound note; I said you have robbed me, and I called out watch immediately; a watchman came up, and I gave charge of those two women, I never recovered the Bank notes; I shewed the watchman the note, and the little one attempted to snatch it out of my hand, but she could not get it from me; they were then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time did you get away from the theatre? - A. I think, half after twelve; I had been with some friends, I left the theatre between eleven and twelve o'clock; I then went with some friends to the Ship, at the corner of the theatre, and had some bread and cheese and some porter; about a quarter after twelve, Mr. Godwin, who belongs to the theatre, went with me to King-street, he lives at Somers-town.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Were you present in Covent-garden Market on Saturday evening? - A. I was, in my own shop, near the last witness; I heard a great noise, thinking it was the basket-women, I did not go nigh; I afterwards heard a scream, and then I advanced, and found the prisoner Quinland -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. I have seen her before; I found her beating Mrs. Warner about the head; I took hold of her by the shoulder, and asked her what she was doing that for; she made me no answer, an answer was returned by another person that she had robbed Mrs. Warner of a piece of meat, and four one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said loud enough for the prisoner to hear? - A. Yes; I said, I knew the weight of the meat, for I had weighed it for her in the course of the afternoon; I turned round and took the meat from the prisoner Dealy, she gave it to me immediately, she did not appear as if she had stolen it; they were then taken up to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Quinland take any thing at all? - A. No; the pocket had been taken before I came up; they were then taken to Bow-street.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you an officer? - A. No, a harness-maker: I was in at the sign of the Green-man, on Saturday evening, adjoining Mrs. Gurney's shop; hearing a disturbance in the market I went out, the prisoners were then at Mrs. Gurney's shop-door; they were taken to Bow-street, and I went with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - A. Not at Mrs. Gurney's house, they were at the Office; when I went out, the prisoner Dealy was shifting her hands under her apron, and upon moving from the position in which she stood, the pocket was laying on the ground, before Mrs. Gurney's shop-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she then to Quinland? - A. They were close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the pocket did not drop from Quinland, but Dealy? - A. Dealy.</p>
               <p>Q. From which hand? - A. I am not positive which hand, her hands were both under her apron; I picked it up and looked into it, and found nothing but a memorandum-book; an officer then came from Bow-street, and they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners searched? - A. Yes: upon one of them the officer found two one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What officer? - A. Mumford.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which of them? - A. Dealy. (Produces the pocket.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Warner.) Look at that pocket? - A. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the tape appear to be broke? - A. Yes, it is broke.</p>
               <p>Q. By the force of pulling it from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the memorandum book? - A. It is mine; it is the same that I had in my pocket when it was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Dealy from you? - A. About a couple of yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came up to you, they came together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Quinland struck you, how near was Dealy to you? - A. A yard, or it might be a couple of yards; they were within a little distance of each other.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Quinland ran away, did Dealy run away too? - A. I was so confused I cannot say.</p>

Mrs. Gurney; I did not see Mrs. Warner then, they told me she had been robbed of a pocket, with a pocket-book, and four one-pound notes in it, with a neck of mutton; I gave Mumford the charge of Dealy, and I took Mrs. Quinland to Bow-street: I searched her, but found nothing upon her except two or three halfpence; then I took Mrs. Dealy to search her, and she told me she had given the notes to Mumford, and that she had them of Mrs. Quinland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what notes? - A. Not that I recollect; I searched her, but found nothing upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know his person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the 10th of November last? - A. Yes, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask if it was quite dark? - A. It was quite dark; I was at work in the shop, and I heard some noise above at the shop-window; I listened to hear what it was about, and I heard some lads say, you shove the glass in, and I will take the things out.</p>
               <p>Q. What glass did you conceive them to be speaking of? - A. The glass of the shop-window; I came up stairs, and saw a piece of glass shoved in, and nobody near the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any breaking of glass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the pane of glass any time before? - A. I saw it at dusk, about five o'clock; it was unbroken then.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very clear about that? - A. Yes; I went down stairs again, and then heard somebody come again; I went up stairs again, and perceived a hand in at a pane of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a man's hand? - A. No, it was a boy's hand; it was that very lad's hand; I immediately went out-side the door, and saw him with his hand still inside the glass; as soon as he took some things out he saw me, and ran away, and as he ran he threw some things into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him do that? - A. Yes; I then caught him, and brought him back to the shop; I went with him again to where he threw the things away, and made him pick them up; he gave them into my hand, and I took him back to the shop; I then went for a constable; he was searched; the glass was cut with a diamond, and some things taken out a week before; it was the same pane of glass; it had been made fast again with putty.</p>
               <p>Q. The putty was removed, and then the glass shoved in? - A. Yes; the constable found upon him a tea-ladle, which we had lost the week before.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things found upon him? - A. Only a tea-ladle.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that was picked up? - A. Six gilt pins; the constable has them.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after she was cleaning it did you miss it? - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make known your loss to the prisoner? - A. Yes, I was charging a boy of the name of May, who came into the house to have a pint of beer, with it; I told him no person had been in but him that I could suspect; he threw himself upon his knees, and declared himself innocent; the prisoner wanted me to send him to jail, but as the boy declared himself innocent, I would not; on Sunday morning, the 7th of August, I went up with the constable into the prisoner's room, and there I saw my candlestick lying on his table; I told the constable that was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Bryant say? - A. Not a word; I gave charge of him, and he was taken before a Magistrate. - (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be your's? - A. Yes, by two dents in the side; I asked him how he came by it at the watch-house, and he denied that it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your's? - A. Yes, perfectly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Who had the public-house before you took it? - A. A man by the name of Condon.</p>
               <p>Q. He had taken it before of the prisoner, had not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Condon was appraised in, and so were you? A. No, I was not appraised in, I bought them without a broker; we lumped them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy more than two candlesticks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath you bought more? - A. I bought two brass candlesticks and two iron ones.</p>
               <p>Q. You inhabit the whole of the house, excepting one room, which he had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been considerable quarrels between you? - A. Not considerable.</p>
               <p>Q. You have gone to law together, have not you? - A. As far as a summons went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the hearing? - A. One summons I got a verdict, and the other was dismissed without prejudice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any other candlesticks in his room? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bleamire committed him for a felony, did not he? - A. He ordered him over to bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For the candlestick? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, it is not true that he was dismissed upon that complaint? - A. Upon my oath it is not true, he was obliged to give bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not bound over for an assault, and was not that the charge that was made? - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively the Justice did not bind you over to prosecute the assault at the next Clerkenwell Sessions? - A. No, he told the prisoner he must find bail.</p>
               <p>Q. For the assault? - A. No, for the felony, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no charge of an assault before the Magistrate? - A. No, because I brought the candlestick before Mr. Bleamire.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said before the Justice put in writing? - A. I don't know, I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not put in writing, and signed by the Justice and yourself? - A. His clerk put it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it? - A. Yes, but I never read it over.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor it was not read over to you? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went before Mr. Bleamire? - A. On the Monday after the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in July or August? - A. In July.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it was in July? - A. Yes, I do; it was on the 7th of August that I found the candlestick, and on the 8th I went before Mr. Bleamire.</p>

               <p>Q. How often did you take him up before Mr. Bleamire? - A. Never but that time.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for by the last witness to apprehend the prisoner; I went up into his room; Mr. Bryant was at the threshold of the door at the bottom of the stairs; he begged of me to let him go up stairs into his own room; I went up with him; we stopped some little time, and Mr. Gibbons came up to see what we were about, and he saw this candlestick, and said it was his property; he gave me charge of him, and I took him to the watch-house, and there I left him; Mr. Gibbons put the candlestick into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the candlestick? - A. To the best of my knowledge he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When you were sent for by Gibbons, the prisoner was at home? - A. He was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you to go up with him? - A. Yes; he made a noise, and wanted to go up to his own room, and he asked me to go up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. The candlestick was upon the table, not secreted at all? - A. It was upon the table.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What were you to take him up for? - A. For making a noise on the Sunday morning; I was sent for to take him for an assault.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man came to me, and wanted to take my public-house; I had heard a bad character of him, I did not like him, and told him not to come after me, and then he got another man to take it, and then he put him in.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the charge? - A. He endeavoured to institute a charge of felony in the first instance for robbing him of a candlestick, but the prisoner clearly made out a claim to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was the claim? - A. He called one or two persons to swear to its being his property.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before the 3d of November? - A. Not that I know of. On the 3d of November she came to my shop between one and two o'clock in the day; when she came in, she asked for a yard and a quarter of edging; when I opened the box, the first piece at the top of the box I shewed her; she said it was for a baby's cap she wanted it, and that was not the right sort; I went on, and shewed her some more; I desired her to lay that by, and she would look over them, and see if there were any she liked better; I shewed her another, and so on, till I looked partly over the whole box; upon putting them back into the box, she laid hold of a broad card of lace, and behind the broad card I saw her drop two cards of lace into her lap as she sat by the side of the counter; when I had seen her do that, I put my lace all up except these two cards of lace; when she had concealed it, she said, I will have a yard and a quarter of that, pointing to that which I at first shewed her; I then put all the lace away into the box except this card; I cut her a yard and a quarter; a man came to the door begging, and she pretended to put her hand to her pocket to give him a halfpenny, and concealed the lace; she got up, she said she had no change, and asked me what the edging would come to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her put it in her pocket? - A. Yes, I saw the edging, and she put it in her pocket; she laid three shillings and sixpence down, and I gave her three-pence in change; she then went to the door, and gave the man a halfpenny, or some halfpence; I made up her parcel, and gave it her, and then she went out of the threshold of the door into the street; I went round the corner as quick as I could to follow her; I told her she had got a couple of cards of my lace, taking hold of her at the same time; I brought her back, and when she came in, I gave a signal for assistance, by knocking my foot upon the shop-floor; my wife and daughter came up; my daughter, who is here, saw her drop them; I did not see them myself; my daughter shewed them me when she picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your daughter pick them up from the same side of the counter that you stood to serve her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you saw her slip two cards of lace into her lap behind the broad card, are you perfectly clear of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you stand on the same side the counter at the time you were serving her that she was? - A. She was on one side of the counter, and I on the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. And the property when it was found, was found on the other side where you had been standing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many things on the counter at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were serving in the shop? - A. Only myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a good deal of lace in the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold any lace of the same quality that you have been describing off the same card? - A. Not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. But before? - A. Yes, it might be a month or two months before.</p>
               <p>Q. You got possession of this lace again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell any more of it afterwards? - A. Not any of the lace that was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are quite sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had this lace? - A. Some months.</p>
               <p>Q. A year perhaps? - A. No, one card I think I have not had above three months, and the other six or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for them? - A. One I gave one shilling and sixpence a yard for; I had one from the maker, and the other was part of a bankrupt's stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many yards there are? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You never sold any of it afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor shewed it for sale to any body? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am daughter to the last witness: On the 3d of November my father knocked against the shop floor; I ran up before my mother; the prisoner was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father had hold of her? - A. No, he stood close by her; I ran behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go at your father's bidding? - A. No, I went of myself; I went behind the counter, and saw two cards of lace lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you found them was where your father usually stood to serve the goods? - A. Yes; I picked them up, and shewed them to my father; the prisoner said, my father had thrown them there; my father said, these were the cards which she had taken; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You found the cards of lace on the side on which your father usually stands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they had fell there or not you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother came up afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mother say, she believed they had fell from the counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300027"/>Court. Q. (To Gander.) Did she go out of the shop? - A. She had got off the threshold; I took hold of her arm, and desired her to come in, which she did; I was then behind her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if she put her hand in her pocket you must have seen her? - A. In my flurry I did not see her; there is a counter on the right and another on the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her throw any thing over the counter, or use any action that looked like throwing any thing over the counter? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. She was in your sight the whole time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think the lace is worth to you? - A. The one that I bought of the bankrupt's stock is worth two pounds five shillings; the other about sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for these nine yards yourself? - A. It is worth five shillings a yard; I cannot say how much I gave for it; I bought it with other different patterns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He said before the Magistrate that he had shewed some of this lace for sale after I was taken up, and the Justice told him he should not have shewn it.</p>
               <p>Gander. I never had such a question put to me; I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. On which side did you see her put the lace into her pocket? - A. On the left side.</p>
               <p>Q. And the lace was found behind the right hand counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a soldier, I was with the last witness; coming down Ludgate-hill, on the 18th of November, we stopped about five minutes at a picture-shop; as he turned to go away, he put his hand to his side, and said, he had lost his pocket-book; a boy came up at the same time, and informed us the prisoner at the bar had taken the book out of his pocket; the boy pointed to him; I was going up to take him by the collar, when he pulled the book out of his pocket, and threw it into the carpenter's shop; we then took him to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never was within thirty or forty yards of the men; there was another man on one side of me, who ran away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a soldier belonging to the West London militia, and have been nearly five years; the prisoner employed me on the 26th of October; I was standing in upper Thames-street looking out for a job; I did not know him before; my comrade and I were standing together; he employed me to take a parcel over Tower-hill; he went away, and I went with him to the corner of the lane, a warehouse just opposite a church, in <placeName id="t18031130-55-crimeloc323">Upper Thames-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go with you? - A. No; I saw a woman in the house; I told her I had brought a parcel for Mr. Bryce; she said, come in; then she said, there is an officer behind, take it away, I will have nothing to do with it, this is not the place it is directed to; I said, it is directed here, and it is impossible for me to get it up again myself, it weighed one hundred and forty-four pounds; she said, take it out, here is an officer coming; an officer then came in, who is dead and buried, but here is one of the party, his name is Smith; they opened the parcel, it contained blacksmiths files and rasps, all new; they took me into custody, and took me before a Magistrate; I went along with the officers to the shop where I had the parcel from, and the prisoner acknowledged he had given me the parcel, and helped me up with it to take over to East Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were taken prisoner upon this occasion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first time, and the last time I hope? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was quite a stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the prosecutor's shop, did you see a Mr. Tyson there, who was the foreman? - A. I saw nobody but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see another man there, not so tall as him? - A. No; there was no other person there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you did not see a person of the name of Tyson in the shop? - A. There was no such person; there was nobody there but him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, at the Thames Police-office, a person of the name of Tyson coming as a witness? - A. Yes; but he was not in the shop at the time I took the load, he was there in the evening, after I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Tyson admitted a witness for the crown? - A. He was taken up by the prisoner's recommendation.</p>
               <p>Q. And charged with having stolen the property, and given it to you? - A. No; no person gave me the property but this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not admitted King's evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here to-day as a witness? - A. He is somewhere about here.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police: I went with the last witness to Upper Thames-street, to Dealy's and Company, at the bottom of Suffolk-lane, just by Allhallow's Church; when I got into the shop I saw the prisoner, the last witness was with me, and he pointed out the prisoner as the man that gave him the note; I then called him on one side, and asked him if he had sent any parcel out by this man; he told me he had; I asked him what it contained; he told me it contained eight dozen rasps and files, four dozen of each; I asked him if he could recollect when that order was executed; he told me it was executed last week, by Mr. Brice; I asked him if the order was made with him or with his master; he told me it was made with his master; I asked him if there was a bill of parcels given at the time the order was made; he told me yes; I told him it was not a customary way to give a bill of parcels when the order was made, it was customary to give it with the goods; I then told him the last witness was in custody upon suspicion of illegal possession of this property, and I should be very glad if he would go down to the office, as he stated it was a fair order; upon which he said, I cannot go now, my master is in Hyde-Park, and I have nobody at home to mind the shop; it happened to be the general review day; I told him he would not be gone above half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, and I persuaded him to leave a message with the maid servant, which he did; he went with me to the Thames Police-office, and in going by Brice's, I said to my brother officer, Glover, who is now no more, go into Brice's, and ask him if he has got a bill of parcels; he went in, but Brice was not at home; I went on with the prisoner, and the last witness and Glover followed me; when we got near Nightingale-lane, the prisoner ran away, I had not taken him into custody, nor told him that I had any suspicion about him; I then pursued and took him; he was very obstinate, and shewed fight to me; I asked him how he came to run away; and his reply was, he thought I was going to put him on board the Tender; he did not know what I was going to do with him; I took him to the office, and the next day he acknowledged his guilt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what he said taken down in writing? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it was taken down? - A. I don't think it was that night.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Tell us what the prisoner said?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300030"/>- A. He said, I have been led into an error, and even mentioned the man's name, Tyson.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all he said? - A. Yes, to my knowledge; the next day he represented the same thing to the firm of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not say, that Tyson was foreman, and that Tyson told him this bundle was to go to Brice's, and that he sent it off accordingly? - A. I don't recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of that, that Tyson was taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>

I carry on their business at No. 151, Thames-street, the corner of Suffolk-lane, near the Church of Allhallows the Great: On Wednesday the 26th of October, I saw the prisoner in the shop, he had nothing to do with us, he belonged to Dealy and Company, which is about twenty yards from our shop; he was carrying out a load.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that house any dealings with your house? - A. Yes, we had occasionally; he had come before, and I had not the most remote suspicion of him. (The property was produced, and identified by the witness.)</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been connected with the house? - A. Thirty-three years; they are all new articles; every file has a private mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner did not belong to your house at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He could have had no access to the property in that house, but through the medium of Tyson? - A. Tyson was the man who had access to it; four of our people were exercising in Hyde-park that day.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar carried out before your face the parcel which was your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that Tyson gave it to the prisoner to carry away? - A. I did not see Tyson deliver them; I saw the man go out with the property.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you know what he was carrying out? - A. I knew he had rasps.</p>

Yes: On Tuesday evening previous to Wednesday the 26th, I went to the Three Cups, Dowgate-hill, where I ordered a friend to wait that I meant to sup with; I met the prisoner coming out of the same public-house; he wanted to talk to me upon this business, and I wanted to go to my friend; he called me a fool for going; he asked me if he could see me in the morning; he said, Mr. Dealy, his master, was going out to see the review, and the other gentlemen were going to exercise. On Wednesday morning I had occasion to go to Little Bush-lane, just beyond his house, and on returning back again he was leaning over the door, and called me a fool; about five minutes afterwards he brought me an order, which is since torn up, or lost, or something of that kind;</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw it afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it his hand-writing? - A. I believe it to be his hand-writing; I had seen him write before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. The order expressed this:</p>
               <p>"Please to deliver the bearer four dozen of fifteen-inch flat files."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether that order was signed by any body? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any rasps? - A. Not in the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed that he should come with an order? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the production of that order, what did you do? - A. I went up into the warehouse, and delivered three dozen, I think, of fifteen-inch flat files, and I think one dozen of fourteen-inch; about five minutes afterwards he came again, took me by the sleeve, and said, follow me up stairs; I went up stairs, and he took four dozen of rasps, which he said Mr. Brice would give him half-a-guinea, or ten shillings a dozen for, and he took them away; as we came down stairs, I saw my master talking in the warehouse; he went past my master, and he made way for him to go out; he took them away to his own master's house; I did not see him till near eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did all this pass? - A. Just before breakfast, about eight o'clock; I saw him come to our door, he asked me if I could let him have any more goods; I told him, while he was teazing me in this sort of way, I could not follow my business, and told him to go away; he said, before he went away, that he had sent a soldier off with those goods, and he was waiting for his coming back; he told me he had sent them to Brice's, I think that was the name, I have been at the house; I did not see the prisoner any more that day, I was taken up the next day morning; I have been in the House of Correction ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You said, just now, you believed the man's name was Brice? - A. I used to call him Price.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been often at Brice's house? - A. Not till the prisoner took me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not carry things frequently there when the prisoner was not there? - A. But once; and that I mentioned to the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with these gentlemen?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300031"/>- A. I have lived twelve months with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever a servant before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade were you before you came to live with these gentlemen? - A. I was in the navy.</p>
               <p>Q. A volunteer, no doubt? - A. I went as captain's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a servant before you went on board a King's ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that? - A. Yes:</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Turner? - A. I was apprenticed with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. A watch case joint finisher; my master had a very bad wife, and she used me very ill; and one thing and another, my master cancelled my indentures, and I went with my master's consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say that the reason you left your master's service, was because he had got a bad wife? - A. It was the reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your master charge you with robbing him? - A. Never, I will take my solemn oath before God and man, he never charged me with robbing him in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear your master never accused you of any thing dishonest about his house? - A. He never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live with him as an apprentice? - A. Two years, and rather better; I bore an excellent character from all the captains in the service.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to persist that the reason you left your master was that he had got a bad wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lived for twelve months with the prosecutors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never gave any information to your masters till you were taken into custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never known of any thing else being stolen from the shop before this? - A. Yes, the prisoner enticed me to let him have these things; he took away some files, and told me he had lost them; that an officer came up, and he threw them down.</p>
               <p>Q. You never told your masters any body wanted to entice you to rob them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This man was to bring you an order, was that agreed upon between you before? - He said he hoped I would be up soon in the morning, as they were going a soldiering, and he would come and take the things out of the warehouse, and go to Mr. Brice's.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to have? - A. He told me he would give me half the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you let him have the things? - A. Yes, he told me he had sent a soldier with them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Crook.) Where was this warehouse situated? - A. I cannot say the name of the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you have not heard since? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the place where you went to the prisoner? - A. No, that is the corner of Bush-lane; I went to the other place to apprehend Tyson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 26th of October, Tyson came to me, and asked if my master was gone to the Review; Tyson desired me to come to the warehouse, and he gave me four dozen of files, and desired me to send them to East-Smithfield; afterwards he gave me four dozen of rasps, and told me to send them to Brice's; I called the soldier, and sent him with them.</p>

When the chaise was taken away, Mrs. Pincott called stop thief; Mr. Pincott followed the man, and most cruelly used him, for which he was summoned before the Alderman. I returned home, and next day I observed a paper stuck up on the front of the defendant's house, with wafers, in a very conspicuous manner. On the 5th of September, I observed a paper stuck up as before, only in larger characters. (A paper shewn him.) This is the paper, and which was taken down by my order; I saw Mrs. Pincott, but not Pincott; his wife principally stood at the door while the paper was up. In consequence of the ill-usage the officer received from Pincott, we attended before the Magistrates. After the 5th of September, I observed a paper pasted within side the chaise-house, and after that it was chalked on a board, and exposed to public view, and attracted a crowd of people round the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a green-grocer? - A. No, I keep a grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The defendant is a coach-maker? - A. He <rs id="t18031130-58-viclabel337" type="occupation">lets out chaises</rs>

                        targets="t18031130-58-victim531 t18031130-58-viclabel337"/>, I don't know that he is a coach-maker, though he writes it up; occasionally chaises come to be repaired.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know the chaise you ordered to be taken away, was a chaise sent to be washed and repaired? - A. I do not know it of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know to whom it belonged? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that chaise washed in the course of the day? - A. I had seen some washed.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a sort of bye-place, is it not - there is no thoroughfare for carriages? - A. There is a thoroughfare for foot-passengers, and a carriage way up to Albion-buildings, but no thoroughfare for carriages.</p>
               <p>Q. The street opposite Mr. Pincott's is rather extensive, is it not? - A. Yes, but a carriage could not pass without going round Mr. Pincott's chaises, sometimes five, six, or seven, of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of a chaise standing there one day, it was drawn away by your order? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not told the defendant you were going to take it away? - A. Not that day, but our vestry clerk had; and I went up myself, with some other trustees, a week or ten days before, with the act of parliament, to request Mr. Pincott would take the chaise away, or abide by the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not do so on the day the chaise was taken? - A. I certainly did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen chaises washed there? - A. Yes, and I have seen them repairing chaises there, painting them, and doing the smith's work there.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GOODCHEAP sworn. - I am apprentice to the defendant and his brother-in-law; I lived in his house on the 5th of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and say whose writing it is? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Pincott write? - A. Yes, I don't believe it is his hand-writing; I cannot tell whose it is; I saw a paper stuck up, but cannot speak to it; this is something like it, but I cannot say, as there were two; I believe this is one; I only read a paper, and did not take any particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put it up? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the defendant at home when it was put up? - A. I don't know; he was at home at his meals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him standing at the door while the paper was there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body reading the paper? - A. Yes, a few.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there were only a few? - A. I was in and out all day; there might be five or six when I saw them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Pincott say any thing about the paper? - A. No, I am his apprentice, and work out; I am only in his presence at meal times.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never heard him speak of that paper? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any body else speak of it in his presence? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask him how it came to be put up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were surprised to see it there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you see it there? - A. I cannot say; I saw it about ten or eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were people looking at it when you went in and out? - A. Yes.</p>

It was contended by the Counsel for the prisoner, that, under these circumstances, he could be indicted only in the county of Surrey, where he received the money, and that nothing had been done in the county of Middlesex to shew an intention to embezzle the money; the prisoner was found guilty, and the question was reserved for the opinion of the Twelve Judges. That opinion has been taken, and they are unanimously of opinion that the prisoner is well convicted.</p>

            , his master, and fraudulently secreting and embezzling, and so stealing it; the indictment stating the money to be the property of the master. After Mr. Justice Chambre had summed up the evidence to the Jury, the prisoner's Counsel suggested an objection that there was no proof of any fact arising in the county of Salop sufficient to give jurisdiction for trial of the offence in that county; the proof (so far as relates to objection) was, that the residence of the master was at Litchfield, in Staffordshire, where the prisoner served him in his trade; that in the morning of Saturday, the 22d of January, they were both at Shrewsbury, and the master having authorised one W. Beaumont to collect some debts for him at that place, returned home the same morning, leaving the prisoner at Shrewsbury to receive the money from Beaumont, and bring it to his master at Litchfield that night; the prisoner engaged so to do, and about noon received the money from Beaumont, and also a letter for his master, which had been left at Beaumont's, and did not relate to the money transaction; the prisoner left Shrewsbury soon after, but did not go on to Litchfield that night, having slept at a public-house on the road, and he did not go to his master till the following evening; he then delivered the letter, and being asked about the money, he said, he had not received any. A few days after, the master, in consequence of information he had received by letter, charged the prisoner with having received the money, and another servant, who had been at Shrewsbury on the Saturday, being present, told him that he had seen him receive money, but the prisoner persisted in denying that he had received any. Some time after, the master, having received further intelligence, bid the prisoner go to Shrewsbury to clear himself. On the Saturday following the prisoner went to Beaumont at his house at Shrewsbury, and desired him to make a search on the left-hand side of the room in which they had been; but no search was made, Beaumont telling him it was of no use to search, as the prisoner had received the money from him. The learned Judge, thinking the objection proper for the consideration of the Judges, made no observations upon it to the Jury, who found the prisoner guilty, and he received sentence. The prisoner's receipt of the money at Shrewsbury, his going thither afterwards to clear himself, and on that occasion desiring a search to be made for the money, as if he had left it there, being the only acts appearing to be done in Shropshire, these questions were made: - first, whether, under this statute, an indictment might not be found and tried in the county where the money or goods were received, although there was no evidence of any other fact locally arising within the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180311300035"/>same county - secondly, whether, if further local proof was necessary, the subsequent conduct of the prisoner at Shrewsbury were not sufficient to obviate the objection as being an act in furtherance of the purpose of secreting or embezzling. In Easter Term following, the Judges having met to consider this case, were of opinion that the trial was properly had at Shrewsbury. Most of them thought, that, as in the case of larceny at common law, so in this, where the statute declared the offence to be of the same kind, the subsequent conduct of the prisoner in not accounting to his master, and denying the receipt of the money, was evidence to shew that the original taking was an intent to secrete and embezzle, and so to steal, within the meaning of the statute, and the more so, as the act of secreting was a negative act; and some considered that the offence was triable in either, as referable to the original taking in the one, and not accounting, but denying the act when called upon in the other. That case I have stated from a very accurate note in Mr. East's book, 24, and if there were any doubts upon that case, the same do not exist in the present. In that case there was very strong evidence to prove he had began to determine to embezzle this money in the county of Salop, and there was likewise a clear execution of that determination in that county, though it was said the not accounting for it arose in the county of Stafford; and when that took place, then the offence might be said to be complete, but not till then. The Judges were of opinion. the prisoner had began to embezzle in the county of Salop, and that he was well tried. In the present case there can exist no doubt whatever. The facts are these: at six o'clock on Saturday evening the prisoner is sent into the county of Surrey, where he receives ten shillings for his master; the receipt was perfectly legal, and there is no evidence whatever, that, till he came to account with his master, he had ever come to a determination to appropriate that money to his own use, so that there is not either expressly or impliedly any proof of his having done any act by which he could have embezzled his master's money before he came to the county of Middlesex; and the nature of the thing embezzled in the present case ought not to be laid out of the case, because the receipt of money is not like the receipt of an identical thing where it may be attended with such circumstances as plainly to shew he had determined to steal it; and then it may be said, if it should clearly appear, as for instance, if he had received a horse, and sold it, it might be said the act was complete in that county, and there could be doubt of it being all done in that county; but with regard to the case of money, it is not necessary the person receiving money should deliver to his employer the identical pieces of money he received, if he should have had any lawful reason for parting with them, provided he does account for the amount; therefore, if there had been any evidence of his paying away money, or spending money, that would have been sufficient; because non constat, they were those identical shillings he so received from the person by whom they were owing; so there is no evidence whatever which could bring him within this act of parliament, his receipt being lawful till he came to be called upon to account for it; when called upon, he denied having received it; therefore, that is the only time at which the Jury could say he had determined to embezzle it to his own use; therefore, without going into this case, which I would do if it were a case of doubt, but in this case there can be no doubt, I will only observe, there is no evidence either actual or presumptive, of his having done any act to embezzle the property; nor could the offence be complete, nor was he guilty within this act, till he denied it to his master; then his offence became complete, and he became well indicted in the county of Middlesex.</p>
