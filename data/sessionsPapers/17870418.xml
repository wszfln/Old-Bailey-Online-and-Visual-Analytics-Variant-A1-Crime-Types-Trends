               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. You was drinking with this man the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you had a conversation about a horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As soon as this conversation began about the horse, he let you into the secret that it was not honestly come by? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You immediately agreed to buy it? - Yes, to be sure I did.</p>
               <p>After he had told you that the horse was not honestly come by, after you received that intimation, you agreed to purchase the horse? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How long have you been accustomed to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180004"/>buy such horses? - I thought it was my duty to get at the knowledge where the man was.</p>
               <p>Then you bound the bargain, and gave him earnest for it? - I thought it was a duty to bring the man to justice, he would not have brought the horse, provided I did not give him the earnest.</p>
               <p>Then you wanted him to commit a felony? - No, I saw the horse at large at

               <p>What are you? - I am a higler.</p>
               <p>How long have carried on that trade at Barnett? - I have been twenty-five years in Finchley and Barnett.</p>
               <p>Have you never been in any scrapes about purchasing things not honestly come by? - Never.</p>
               <p>Nor never tried at Hicks's Hall? - I never was at Hicks's Hall.</p>
               <p>Have you never been tried any where else? - I never was tried any where.</p>
               <p>Have you never said this, that you was very glad now you had got an opportunity of routing this man out of the town? - I never said so to anybody.</p>
               <p>Have you never said so? - No, I never did say so, the man never did me any injury.</p>
               <p>Did you never say so to Gates the constable? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I never did.</p>
               <p>You refused to purchase it at four pounds ten shillings? - I thought to the best of my knowledge it was not worth more than four guineas.</p>
               <p>Why could not you as well agree to give him the whole four pounds ten shillings as four guineas, if you did not mean to make a bargain with him? - A man may make a bargain; he told me it was another man's property, and he thought it was not honestly come by.</p>
               <p>If it was your only motive to bring the man to justice, why not agree for four pounds ten shillings, for you never intended to give him any money? - I had the money to pay for it, provided it was honestly come by; if I had not agreed for the money, he would never have brought the horse.</p>
               <p>Did you intend to buy the horse? - Yes, if it was honestly come by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Did I understand you right in your first examination, that you told people of this before you bound the bargain with the shilling, and before you bid four guineas? - Yes, the night before, the Tuesday night, before I gave any money, and before I saw the horse; it was a brown gelding, the inner leg white behind, a star in his forehead, a brown muzzle, and grey about his eye brows.</p>

               <p>Were there any promises made to him to tell the truth? - No, he said in the Mermaid that he had stolen the horse; he said it was a horse that had been straying on the common a year or two, and he thought it was no use to the gentleman, and he thought he would take him off the common to sell for three or four pounds, to set him up in some thing.</p>

               <p>Where do you live? - Just out of Smithfield; on the 15th, the drover went to fetch them from the field, and returned with fifty-two; it is the close or paddock fronting the Small Pox Hospital; I sent my servants to gain every information, and advertised them the next morning, and by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180009"/>hand-bills, as being lost only, offering two guineas if any information should be given, this produced nothing; I then advertised them as stolen, with a reward of twenty pounds on conviction; this brought forward one Jones, who is not here, and on whose information I took the prisoners, in Spitalfields, the 18th or 19th, I am not positive to the day; I saw them afterwards at the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the skins? - Only by their being the same mark of those I have lost.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. What business are you? - A wholesale carcase butcher.</p>
               <p>Do you always purchase the sheep yourself? - Not always.</p>
               <p>When were these sheep purchased? - On the 12th.</p>
               <p>Who purchased these sheep? - My brother.</p>
               <p>Where were they purchased? - In Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Your brother delivered them over to the drover? - No, I delivered them to the drover; my brother made the bargain, and bought them.</p>
               <p>How is it you divide the profits of your business? - If my brother buys a hundred sheep, we divide them into two parts; my mother has one fifty, and my brother and me has other fifty; there is no other person concerned in partnership besides my mother and brother.</p>

               <p>Had any thing been said to him to induce him to make this confession? - No, there had not; he told us of eight or nine sheep; I told him if he had any hopes, or thoughts that he could get through without making a confession, for God's sake not to make it; but the man seemed to have a great deal of contrition about him, and I believe that was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If I had said so, would not you necessarily have inferred that if you did make the confession, you would have got through? - No, certainly not; we found skins; I traced the skins to be sold at a skin salesman, in Whitechapel-market.</p>

             was at the Black Bull; I knew him nine days before, I was taken on the Thursday morning; this day four weeks, Sarjeant brought me nine sheep, and knocked me up about six, or five minutes after; Smith and Webster called to me, and told me the sheep were come, and desired me to dress myself; I came down, and three were in the yard, the rest were running about the street; I did not know where they were brought from; I can swear to the skins; he told me two days before he had nine sheep to kill; he told me he had bid money for them beforehand; I had no idea that they were stolen sheep.</p>
               <p>What time did you receive them? - About six in the morning.</p>
               <p>Is that a usual time? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon did you kill them? - About half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Is that a proper time? - According as people chuse.</p>
               <p>Should you like now as a butcher to kill them so soon before they were cool? - No, I should not; I was to give two shillings and ten-pence a stone.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is pretty near the mark, within a farthing a pound.</p>
               <p>(Spurgeon deposed to the skins marked with blue chalk and red oker.)</p>
               <p>Where is the mark? - On the rump, the red is on the right cheek; the red chalk mark was on when they came to me; I put on the blue mark when they brought them in, for I did not see any mark upon them.</p>
               <p>If these sheep were to be killed instantly, what was the use of marking them? - We generally do mark them in case of the skins being lost; the others were marked; this is the country mark; there was no particular mark of mine.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the same I saw at the drover's, this is the same mark.</p>
               <p>Court to Spurgeon. Did you see Smith about this shop? - Yes, the day before.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and Smith the day before? - They came and helped to get the place ready to kill them; Smith and Webster were with me before the sheep came.</p>
               <p>Were any of the sheep delivered to Smith? - Seven of them on the Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Were any of these seven delivered to Smith? - None of them.</p>
               <p>Lavender. Smith acknowledged that he assisted in killing the sheep, and that he bought seven, that was before the Magistrate, I heard him; it was not reduced to writing; when he was charged with receiving these sheep, knowing them to be stolen, he said he did not, he bought them fairly, and gave a fair price for them; we went to Smith's lodgings at Westminster, and we found in a necessary part of a skin of one of the five sheep.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Linnell, of Paddington; the next door to Mr. Shepherd's, I was at work for my master in the field nearest to our yard, and nearest to Mr. Shepherd's; as I was going away, I turned round in our own yard, and I saw three men look over the rails; that was about one in the afternoon; then there was one over the rails, one getting over, and one in the ditch; they are the rails that come out of Mr. Turner's, that keeps the King and Queen, into my master's field; they were in my master's field, and the foremost man came stooping along in the ditch towards Mr. Shepherd's garden, and the next did the same, and the third likewise, till they got to the end of Mr. Shepherd's garden, where the linen hung by the hedge; I looked after these people, and I went back into the field where I had been at work, and I peeped through the pales; I hid myself from them; I was within thirty or forty yards of them; first one got over the pales to look over, first one took a peep, then another, then one put his foot, and his knees were at the top of the pales, then he got down, then another got up and peeped, then they were all three down at once; then they beckoned with their hand to a fourth man, who was in Mr. Turner's field; that man came in full view of my face; he was a short little thickset man, in a blue coat; then he wanted to come, and they were all in the ditch together; then I thought I saw one almost on the pales, one of their faces was towards me, I thought he watched me; then I went away; two of them then set off in a hurry, and went into Mr. Turner's field, two staid; I went and told my fellow servant to have his eye to the linen; I was gone about a quarter of an hour, and then I saw a woman, and some other people running; I heard an outcry that all Mr. Shepherd's linen was gone; I set off after them, and the three men were taken; I knew them again, and the very shortest one of them said to me, now do you know any thing of me, master? I said, are not you one of the men that the other beckoned to, to come into the field? and he denied it; and I said that the man in the red coat was the man that came within ten yards of me, and the other man in the brown coat, was the man that had his back towards me, and the other I was not so sure of; I know them by their persons very well, and by their dresses; the man in the brown coat had his back to me, and looked over his right shoulder; the man in the red coat was him that came nearest; the little one is the same one, according to appearance, that they beckoned to come to them; I saw the linen found; I saw the servant maid pick out a shirt out of the hole of a tree belonging to my master's field, and I saw the corner of a blue apron hitched upon a hook, the corner of an outhouse at Mr. Ward's; they found a bundle of linen which had been thrown over; I was before the Justice with them, and these men said they had been at the Spotted Dog, at Westborn-green; one said that he knew but one of them; then another said that they all knew one another, and they happened to meet together.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear positively to all these men? - I can be positive that these are the men I saw first; I have no doubt in the least but they are the same four persons I saw first; I am equally sure of all of them.</p>

               <p>Are you able to speak to the persons of either of them? - I can speak to the one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180014"/>in a dark snuff coloured coat, (the prisoner Wilson) he took the linen off the hedge, and threw it over to the man in a light coloured coat; I cannot say which he was; I do not know either of the others any further than the man in the brown coat; Raynor joined Wilson, and ran away with him after he jumped over the pales, and the man in the light coloured coat ran on the right hand; I am very sure as to the persons of these men; I saw no more than three.</p>

               <p>Was the linen found in the way they run, or the contrary way? - It was partly the way; I did not see them at the place where the linen was found; they passed the place where the linen was found after I lost sight of them; I was before the Justice of peace, and heard these men say they had been at the Spotted Dog, and had been drinking together.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of March, the prosecutrix came to me; I went with the prosecutrix, and in searching about under the table of the prisoner Barrington, there were two old bed gowns, quite rags; I took her into custody, and in the other room, I found the prisoner Clarke, but there was nothing in that room.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These are mine; I found this pocket under Clarke's bed, which is mine; and she said it was hers, and belonged to her child.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Barrington. I lodge by myself; my daughter does not lodge with me; I have no fastenings to the door; it is six-pence a week; and under the straw and hay which I had to lay on, these things were found; I was out in company with this woman, and had part of two pints of beer, and when we came back, she said, she had been robbed, and suspected us.</p>

               <p>Had this prisoner any weapon with him? - No, I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Was this man searched? - Yes, at the turnpike.</p>

               <p>I heard a noise in the road, and I looked over the wall to see what was the matter; I was in the park, and got over the wall and stood in the road, and they took me; I have no friends in town.</p>

               <p>Did you see any body in regimentals on the road, within five or ten minutes? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say you did? - No.</p>

               <p>Court to Fisher. Did you see two men together? - Yes, I did when the horse was standing, then I saw them about three or four yards distance; he rode on the pathway, and I thought he had taken the other; I never saw the other when he went off; I saw him run before me; I only saw them men and nobody going up that side of the road; I was in the middle of the road, and there were some people walking on the other side of the road, but nobody coming towards the turnpike.</p>

             Jones, you have been convicted of an offence so peculiarly aggravated, that if it came within any of the descriptions which the law has made punishable with death, you certainly would have no mercy to expect from your sovereign. The taking away children from their parents, and afterwards stripping and robbing them, is so extremely dangerous to society, so destructive to domestic peace and happiness, so dreadful in its consequences to the unhappy infants, and so terrible in its nature to the unfortunate parents, who by that means very frequently irrecoverably lose their children, in a way much worse than death, that it deserves to be punished in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180026"/>severest manner. If but a single infant can be saved by the terror of your example, and the punishment you are to undergo, (which will not be much better than that of death) the Court will be happy in discharging its duty. Under these circumstances, the sentence of the Court is, that you, and each of you, be</p>

I lost a watch the latter end of August last, in the house I live; I saw it the same night; I lost it about nine; I missed it about five; I slept in the prisoner's room; the next morning when I awoke about five, I missed my watch; the prisoner was there; she was up before me; I asked her whether she had my watch, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes; I was at work that very day.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober when you went to bed? - My master had given me some beer when I was at work. I was not drunk, nor I cannot say I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Was that the first night you slept in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you lodged in that house? - About two years.</p>
               <p>How long had she lodged there? - I cannot say; I suppose she had been there a twelvemonth before I lost my watch. I found my watch the 1st of April; I did not take her up at that time.</p>
               <p>What did you think of its being gone? - When I asked her for my watch, she threatened me so hard, that I dropped it; she threatened to get a warrant against me for taking away her character; I found it at a public house door, where there were some men quarrelling in the street; it laid on the ground.</p>
               <p>Was she there? - She was in the house. There was a man standing by me, and he said, there is a watch on the ground; and we both stooped and picked up the watch, and I knowing the men were quarrelling, I told the man I would keep the watch till we found who dropped it. I put it in my pocket, and told the landlady of it; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180027"/>not know it was my own watch then; I went home, and went to bed, and in the morning, when I awoke, I found the watch to be my own.</p>
               <p>When you went into the public house, to say you had found a watch, did you see the prisoner? - Yes; she was in the house; I did not tell her I had found it; I told the woman of the house.</p>
               <p>Had this woman continued to lodge in the same house, from the time you had lost the watch, till the 1st of April? - Yes, she did. I went away about two months since; I left the house before Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Had you any intimacy after this? - No. The 2d of April, which was Monday, I took up the prisoner; I charged her with it; she said she picked it up in the bed, two or three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the room had you left the watch, when you went to bed? - I did not undress myself at all; I kept on my cloaths, and laid down on the bed. I have got the watch here.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Did you search the bed the morning you missed it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was she undressed? - No.</p>

               <p>I lost the watch when the prosecutor found it. I bought the watch of the prisoner, and gave her 1 l. 18 s. for it; I had it about four months or more; I did not hear him talk about the watch at all; I did not see him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not know that this man dropped the watch till the next day; it was a stranger that was with me.</p>
               <p>Do you know the watch again? - Yes, I think I do.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch; is it the watch you bought of her? - Yes, this is the watch.</p>
               <p>When you bought it of her, did she tell you how she came by it? - She said a young man that had come out of the country had left the duplicate with her; and if he did not return in such a time, she might release the watch, and sell it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The latter end of last October, I picked up a duplicate of a watch, and I shewed it to a great many people in the neighbourhood that I do not know, and they persuaded me to have it raffled for; others persuaded me to sell it out and out; I could not do either, because I did not know the pawn-broker. A person informed me of the pawn-broker; I enquired if it was their duplicate, and they told me it was; I spoke to several people to raffle for the watch; two or three people that work for me, persuaded me to sell the watch out and out, and Rourke said he wanted to buy a watch; he went with me to buy it; my husband has been here all day.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner in the morning of the 15th of March, picking greens in the field, Green Cole, at the bottom of Bow Common; it was about a quarter after eleven; a field belonging to Mr. Mann; I asked him what he was doing there; he said he was picking a few greens; I said, you shall not take them out of the field, and he said he would; have you ploughed the land, or sowed the greens? then I looked round, and saw Mr. Mee at a little distance, and I beckoned him to come and assist me; I said something to him; says he, I will stab you; he had a sack with him, on his left shoulder, and when he saw Mr. Mee coming to me, he threw it down, and said I might take it and be d - d, and he ran away.</p>
               <p>Had you asked him any thing about the sack before? - No.</p>
               <p>What was in the sack? - Five pewter dishes, seven large plates, and three small ones; there were three copper saucepans, a tin one, a stew-pan, a copper pot, and a quantity of kitchen furniture; Mee pursued him; I stood by the things; I took the things to the very first house I met with, that was a public house at Mount Pleasant; I left them with the landlord, his name is Horn, on the same day that I took them; he dropped them from his back.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - On the 16th of March, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - On the Thursday; the next morning, I took them to the rotation office; they opened them before the justice, and they were tied up and sealed; I left them at the office; the prisoner was there; he was examined before the justice; he said he lodged somewhere down at the ruins at Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Was his examination taken down in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What business are you? - I am a bricklayer's labourer.</p>
               <p>Was you at work in that part? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What had you to do in this field? - A gentleman gave me so much a week to look over that field.</p>
               <p>Then you was not at work as a bricklayer's labourer? - Then I was watching the field for a draught of beer.</p>
               <p>And the dispute between you and this man was, whether he should cut three greens or no? - That was all.</p>
               <p>How long was he in the field cutting them, from your first observing him? - About five minutes.</p>
               <p>You was some time disputing too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man absolutely insisted he would cut the greens? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he his knife out cutting them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If he would have given up his purpose in cutting greens, he might have gone off? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell the Magistrate that he came into the field to cut a few roots, and that in this field he found this sack? - I heard him say nothing about the sack.</p>
               <p>Are you sober now? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what this man said before the Justice? - I cannot mind what he said; he said nothing where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Are you a bricklayer's labourer now? - No, I be not.</p>
               <p>Are you out of work now? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this was on the 16th? - Yes, pretty sure of that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was on the Thursday? - Yes, I think it was the Thursday, and I think it was the 16th.</p>

Such irregular and arbitrary proceedings have been too often practised by designing persons, merely for the sake of having a reward.</p>

               <p>Did you know Wilson before? - I never saw him before to my knowledge; when these men had passed me, I said to the watchman, these are the men, it is necessary we should follow them; I said, you follow them that way; I will go round and get some more watchmen; I went round by Saint Thomas's square; I heard the rattles, and ran after them, and just about a quarter of a mile I could see them; I made up to the man with the rattle, and we pursued them, and came up with some men at Kingsland, but I could not say they were the same; there we had information of them; I saw them at the back of Pigwell-field; we heard they were gone to Newington-green; I pursued them till we came to Clerkenwell; when we came into the street, I went into a house and saw Collins; these two men were taken about half after six; I was not present; I saw Wilson after he was taken at the publick-house; I am quite sure he is the same man.</p>

               <p>In January last, I was robbed of upwards of five pounds; there was sixteen half crowns, three half guineas in gold, and the rest in shillings and sixpences; I was brought to bed but two days; the girl that I had came to my bed side, and took my pocket from under my head, and run down stairs, that was the prisoner; I saw her do it; I screamed out; I could not run after her; I did not know her till my husband hired her in Spital-fields, as a weekly servant; she was taken a month after she went away, on the 25th of February; I never recovered any of my money.</p>
               <p>How came you to keep all your money in your pocket? - The man that worked for me was coming in and out, and I was obliged to give change; I was obliged to keep my money in my pocket; it was all the money I had in the world; I saw her take this and I screamed out; I could not follow her; I am sure the money was in my pocket; I had it not a quarter of an hour before; I had it in my hand, and put it in my pocket, and the prisoner saw me with the money in my hand; I set up during the time; I keep two men to hawk my mats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with that woman three months; I never took away her money, nor robbed her of any thing; and I went away of a Friday, and they came to me and said I had robbed them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you lived with Mr. Buckley? - Two years, the 4th of next June.</p>
               <p>Mr. Buckley is in a great way of business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many clerks does he keep? - Only me and his brother, I was never allowed to accept any of his bills, but his brother does, by procuration, sometimes accept bills for him.</p>
               <p>How are you employed in the house? - As clerk keeping his books; and going out with bills for acceptance.</p>
               <p>How many offices have you in this house? only one Compting-house.</p>
               <p>Is not the Compting-house divided into several parts? - There is a partition lately made, Mr. Buckley sits on one side of the desk, and I on the other, the partition does not separate us.</p>
               <p>Does Mr. Buckley do much of the business himself, or does he leave it chiefly to his brother and you? - He does it chiefly himself.</p>
               <p>Who takes the accounts mostly? - I take all the accounts of bills, I keep them myself, go with them for acceptance, and bring them back, they go chiefly through my hands.</p>
               <p>The writing part of the business is done chiefly by yourself and his brother? - Yes, in keeping the books, and entering the bills.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Buckley does not write much in the compting-house? - Not in entering bills, but accepting and addressing bills to his bankers.</p>
               <p>You do not of course often see him write? - Frequently see him write some business that we contract together, I am obliged to see him write his name, for instance, at the Custom-house, when he contracts for wool; Mr.

               <p>Was the bill, at the time it was presented, the same figures and words you see there? - I cannot say as to this number, I do not know it was there, for any thing I know this bill came to me in the same shape it is now, except the indorsement.</p>
               <p>Court. Where has it been ever since? - I paid it away to a gentleman in the city, and it came back to me from that gentleman I paid it to.</p>
               <p>Is that gentleman here? - No, I indorsed it before I paid it, my indorsement is here now.</p>

I went out that evening about half past eight, this was on the Friday. When I came to town on the Saturday morning between eight and nine, I was informed there was a man in custody.</p>

               <p>I was coming along Cheapside, on Friday the 13th of April, about half past eight, or rather more, between that and nine, I stopped by chance to look in at Mr. Eagleton's window; and a man came to me with a bag across his shoulders, and said to me, that teas are much cheaper than they were, he was in the street, I did not take notice of him before; I looked at him very hard; and he said, do you think you should know us again? I looked round towards the door of the shop; and I saw the prisoner standing at the door; and a man a little further on with a knot across his shoulders, then I watched them; and I crossed the way, and went a little way further down towards Bow-church on the other side of the way, then I turned again, and came almost opposite the shop, when I got almost opposite the shop, I saw the prisoner coming out with a parcel of tea, he came to a man about three yards from the door, who had a knot, I suppose him to be the same man I saw before with the knot, he returned into the shop, and came out again with another parcel, when he was coming out, there was a man and a woman selling nuts and oranges, I spoke to the man and told him; by that time they were both turned down Pread street, and were gone, the man that was selling nuts blamed me for not speaking sooner; however, in two or three or four minutes they all three came again, the prisoner walked backwards and forwards several times, at last they all three came across the way, the prisoner I believe bought a half penny worth of nuts, the other bought an orange, the man I spoke to fixed himself up against one of the houses, then they all three went over directly; and they all walked backwards and forwards two or three times; and the prisoner went into the shop again, and brought out another bag, then the man that sold the nuts and me both took hold of him, a mob got round us, we never quitted him, we seized him while he had the bag in his hand, we brought him into the shop, the bag was put into the constable's hands, the bag that was delivered to the constable was the same I took from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Mr. Peatt. They were walking very fast when you saw them first? - They were.</p>

               <p>Did you lose sight of them? - Yes, several times; I took Collins at last in a public-house; they tell me it was Goswell-street; we followed all five till we came to Kingsland, within one hundred yards of the town; there we got information of four; we lost one before we came to Kingsland.</p>

               <p>I am gardener to Mrs. Waller, and our garden comes into Colebrook Row, and I was standing at the garden gate, waiting for my mistress to let me in; it was about six, four men passed me; I looked at them, but said nothing to them; presently comes Frost, and he cried out stop thief; I asked him to go with me; he said, I have run till I can run no longer; so I followed them myself across the fields to the City Gardens; when I got to the City Gardens, they were at the bottom of the passage; then they came to the turnpike, and there I called out stop thief; I pursued them; I had them but very little time out of my sight all the time I was after them, I suppose about a minute and a half; I never lost sight of them from the bottom of Colebrook-row to the end of Brick-lane; one of the men took to Old-street; when they came to the end, I followed them; there were very few people in the street; when I came to the bottom I called out stop thief, and somebody else called stop thief as well as me; I ran up to the top of the lane, and lost sight of them about a minute; then somebody laid hold of Thompson; I stood by him while the man took a pistol out of his pocket, Wilson was stopped by somebody; he was delivered into my hands; I directly searched him, and took this wrench and an iron crow, and a center-bit out of his pocket; there were three men running together at the time, but the men went round the Charter house garden wall; I went up after Thompson; the prisoner was in another coat; when I pursued him he was lower than the rest.</p>
               <p>Was he one of them? - I cannot positively swear to his side face; but he was lower than the rest, and in a different coloured coat.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-case maker; I live in Cross-street, Sutton-street; on the fifteenth of March, about a quarter after six in the morning, I heard the cry of stop thief; I was just gone into my shop, which was in my garden, and two men run by, seemingly very much fatigued; one had on a light coloured great-coat, and the other a blue one; I was afraid to follow them; the first of the two men I saw put his hand into his side pocket, and twice or three times throw some things over the charter-house wall; I did not see what it was; I said on Friday, I rather thought it was something of plate.</p>
               <p>Did you know who that man was? - It was not Wilson; I really believe it was the prisoner, but he had not on that coat, he had on a drab-coloured coat; I picked him out at Justice Blackborow's from a number, I suppose there were fifteen or sixteen; I said, if that was the man he had not on the same coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You never saw the prisoner at the bar before? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I suppose you know very well, that that man stands there for his life? - Yes; he was rather a short man.</p>
               <p>There are many men of the same size. - I never saw him again till I saw him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>You say you was too far distant to see what was thrown over? - I mentioned to my patrol, and said I believed it to be plate; it was the glittering made me believe it was plate; I gave information at the time they were taken to my patrol; I told him to look into the Charter-house Garden; the things were found the next day in the Charter-house Garden; I saw the prisoner at Mr. Blackborow's, I went there to see whether it was him.</p>
               <p>Who took you there to see him? - I had orders from that gentleman that stands there.</p>
               <p>Who shewed the man to you? - The prisoner stood at what I suppose they call the bar; it struck me that I knew him; I hesitated in my mind.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. Then, if I understand you right, you had been at two places after this man at the bar? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How lately before this robbery had you seen this trinket? - Not perhaps since February; I believe in the course of that month I think I must have seen it, for I had a mourning-ring there, that I would have wished to have tried on my finger, and it would not enter at all, having had the gout fixed on the joint of it; I can charge my memory with having seen it in February; there were three mourning-rings, and some other articles that have not been traced; I immediately missed three snuff-boxes, one of them a very remarkable fine tortoise-shell, very large, with a picture; I suppose it cost more than ten guineas, a great many years ago; it might not be worth ten shillings now; there was a varnished snuff-box, which I had bought when I was at Spa; I had hardly used it; it was in this leather case, in one of the pidgeon-holes; the case was left empty; I lost a fish-skin case of instruments, that was lying in my ink-standdish, that was on the library table; a silver small pair of scissars, a knife, and other instruments were in that case; in the upper part of that writing-desk there was usually two keys of padlocks; they used to lay in a bit of paper together; one of them I found in the morning, the other was taken away; on the inside of the writing-desk there was a green varnish tooth pick case, with flowers of different colours, but the ground was green, and the pipe was what they call tortoise-shell, that was gone; I lost three shirts; going into my dressing-room, which is within my library, the window was close barred; I opened that window, and found the lower part of an India cabinet was broke open; in the upper part of that cabinet I kept papers; there might be a surplice, I believe; there was a glass door; nothing appeared but papers; I always kept all my linen in that lower part, and any body that lived in my house might know it; the upper part of the cabinet, that contained papers, was locked; I found these three keys laying on the carpet, immediately before that lock; they had been taken out of the desk; there were taken from that three shirts; there were no more there.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, to be sure; he lived with me six months; he entered into my service, by an almanack which I have here, on the 4th of April, 1786, and was discharged the 30th of September, as appears by my memorandum-book; I saw him once since, when he came and begged hard I would give him a character; I think that was the only time I saw him; I went into the water-closet between seven and eight in the morning; it was locked; there were three or four keys to it; the key that lay in the standish had certainly been made use of, and that part of the house had been entered in the night-time, because in the morning, between seven and eight, I found that sash open; there was no shutter or bar, or any thing; I found the floor of the water-closet all wet, and the cistern that conveyed the water into the bason was emptied; on pulling the string, there was no water came; I was satisfied it had been emptied in the night-time, and they let all the water run in till the bason overflowed.</p>
               <p>Where did you find the key of that closet? - I found it laying in the ink-standish, and the door fastened; I found on one side some sheet lead (that was laid across the cistern, and some wire, to protect it from rusting) was all turned up, somebody's hand or foot must have pressed improperly against that lead, and shoved that lead out of its place; there must have been considerable force to change the form of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think it was a little before seven that you was called up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At that time it was perfectly light, and had been so for some time? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe any thing remarkable on any of your tables? - The corner of the library table, which has a deal drawer, I did observe a greasy round circular mark, and it struck me that it had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180052"/>been occasioned by the standing of a dark lanthorn; I had no candlestick in my house that could make so small a mark; the candlestick I used has a large square bottom, that was plated; the buckles I had in my shoes were plated; they were not taken; the most valuable things were taken, and those of little value left; I had written two penny-post letters, and laid two-pence upon them; the pence were taken, and the letters left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Nothing particular had happened to lead your attention to that table the night before? - No; on that table I left my buckles and candlestick, when I went to bed; there was a greasy mark; I had not observed such a mark before.</p>

               <p>Did you go into any other part of the house beside the Doctor's bed-room that night? - No, Sir, only into the kitchen; I did not go into the water-closet.</p>
               <p>In what condition did you leave the kitchen, as to these fastenings, when you went away? - The kitchen door latched, and the door bolted on the inside, in the passage, and the other door locked; I double locked the street door and the outer door; when I came the next morning, I found the door double locked, and the door next to it shut, as I had left them; when I had opened the passage door, I saw the library door open; I shut the parlour door over night; that I found open; the stair-case door, leading to the kitchen, and the back stairs, that I found open; I went into the kitchen first; I found that door wide open; I am sure I left the kitchen door bolted the night before; then I came up into the library, and I saw the door of the press under the book-case, where the Doctor puts his sugar and tea, with the key in it, and the door open; that I was surprised at; at a distance I saw something white, which I took for a shirt, but it was a parcel of papers; I saw the lid of the writing-desk open four or five inches, and the contents all up in heaps; I came to the fire side, and turned round to look at the library, and a drawer of a card-table was taken out; I believe there was no lock to it; the papers were some thrown out on the table, and some in; then I went and called my maid to light the kitchen fire, and called the Doctor, and went into the water-closet; the Doctor called me, and the window was up, and the floor all wet.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular on the library table? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I have no doubt of them; this is the fish-skin case; I am certain of them by twenty marks; this trinket I have had in my possession, thirty-five years next December; I have had frequent occasions of looking into the little box where it was; it belonged to a lady that died many years ago; I am thoroughly sure, if it is a thing that is capable of being ascertained; mine was cracked exactly in the same manner; and that bit of wire by which it is suspended, is remarkably slight; I lost such a padlock key as this, that night; I have not seen it tried by the padlock in the cellar, but I had two padlock keys, one was left and the other was lost; I lost such a key as that; I cannot swear to it; the keys do not exactly agree; I suppose both the keys open the same padlock; there was a shirt produced to me at Bow-street; it was compared by other people; I wish to say nothing about the shirt, it will be proved.</p>

               <p>It is very old, and very much out of repair, and I suppose will sell for very little indeed? - I am very unequal to say what it is worth; it cost about 25 s. at first, it is very old and out of order.</p>
               <p>This trinket, you can hardly set any value upon it; is this your house? - As residentiary of Saint Paul's, it is my freehold; I occupy it, and that is enough; I lost things to the value of fifty pounds, and the person who took these took a great many more.</p>

               <p>In what colour had it been originally marked? - With blue Coventry thread; that was the manner in which the Doctor's linen was marked in progressive numbers; the number 5 was lost that night, and I believe the others were old shirts; I cannot be positive whether this is a 5 or not; this shirt is a plain shirt, very much like the Doctor's shirts in the collar, the wristbands, and the make of the shirts wholly; it is not my own making; I really think it is one of his shirts; the I is marked with blue Coventry thread, and the mark that remains is the mark of blue.</p>

I am Arch-deacon of Bucks; I live the next door but one to Doctor Douglas, in the Bishop of London's residentiary-house; I visit him frequently; he went from my house that night; he pulled out his watch and said, it was twenty-three minutes past eleven; this egg I took from Mrs. Humphries, about nine or ten at night; as soon as I took it from my pocket, the doctor was sitting at some distance; it was candle light; says he, that is mine, it belonged to my first wife; he said it was cracked, and the thinness of the wire; before it was put into his hands, he was at a greater distance from me than I am from you; calling at the pawnbrokers, he said, he believed he had this and the toothpick case; I desired him to bring it to my house; he did, upon producing it, the Doctor said, that is mine, for on taking hold of it at top you take off all at once; and there was a little bit of ivory lost, and that there was a silver top, but the pencil had been lost for some time; about nine in the morning after the robbery, the Doctor pointed out to me the grease on the table; I went and examined it, and in my judgement, it had entirely the appearance of a dark lanthorn set down there; that was my conclusion.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; one day he came into my shop, and asked me if I would come into the shop; I keep an open shop in Fleet-lane, and deal in shoes and stockings, and other things; it was about three months ago that he came; I was at the door dealing with a man for a pair of stockings; the girl called me; when I came in, he opened a handkerchief, and shewed me the things; I bid him money; he would not take it; he shook his head, and appeared very much affected, and said his wife was dead, and had left these things; then he went away, and came again, and said he could get no more, and I was a fair dealing woman; I gave him thirteen shillings or fourteen shillings for the whole.</p>

               <p>Where had you been? - In Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-Fields; I was going home.</p>
               <p>How came you to lose your way? - Because I am not used to be out at night; I was going home; nobody was with me.</p>
               <p>Had you a bundle of things with you? - No, they were the clothes I had on.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon losing your way? - I was coming down Long Acre, and I lost my way into Crown-street, Hog-lane; I asked the prisoner at the bar; I never saw her before; she told me, if I would go along with her she would shew me; but instead of shewing me the way home, she took me into Parker's-lane, to Mr. Robinson's, an ironmonger's shop; when I got to the door, she asked me to go up stairs, which I refused several times; she asked me to drink with her; I had no objection; with much persuasion I did go up stairs.</p>
               <p>How did she persuade you? - She said, if I would go up stairs with her while she poked down her fire, she would see me home; when she got up stairs, she asked me to treat her; I put my hand in my pocket, and gave her a shilling to get some beer; she was gone about an hour, and returned again, and said it was too late, and she could not get any beer; there was another girl with her at the same time, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180063"/>kept me in talk, and staid with me; she asked me if I would have any gin to drink; I told her I was not fond of spirits, and she went and got some raspberry, and they made me drink a tea-cup full; the prisoner came in again, and took a bottle, and was gone three quarters of an hour, and made me drink a tea-cup full, or else they would throw it over me; I drank it; I was afraid of having my white gown stained; they made as if it was red port, so I drank it up; then they made me go to bed; one of them undressed me, while the o the put her back against the door, and said I should not go out.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you drank the teacup full? - About half an hour; it was getting very late.</p>
               <p>Did this raspberry affect you? - Yes, I suppose it did, or I should not have done such a thing; it was about half an hour after two; I was not so bad but I had my understanding about me; I laid there about ten minutes; I dropt asleep, and I was awaked by the prisoner moving my head, and taking my pockets from under my head; the prisoner and the girl made a sham to undress themselves, when they undressed me; I suppose I fell asleep directly upon getting into bed; it could not be above ten minutes before I was waked; I folded up my gown in my handkerchief, and pinned it in another, on a chair at the bed-side; my petticoats were loose, my pockets were under my head; then I was awaked by their taking my pockets; I looked round, though I pretended to be asleep, and I saw the prisoner and the other woman, with my pockets and the other things; the prisoner had my gown and apron, the other took the other things, and blew out the candle, and poked out the fire; I did not speak to them while they continued in the room, I was afraid, as it was a strange place; as soon as they were gone, I got up to look for my pockets; I found nothing but my hat and shoes, and shift that I had on; I went down in my shift, and a man came up; I called Mr. Robinson.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before? - No, Sir, I did not know his name then; I went down stairs, and knocked at the door; he came up, and desired me to make myself contented, he should find the person out; on Monday night Mr. Freeman took her; I stopped till about half after six in the morning; Mr. Robinson went and got me some things, and Mr. Freeman went to a relation's of mine, and got me some clothes.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was this? - It was on Sunday night, the 4th of March.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner again? - Not till Tuesday morning, before Justice Walker.</p>
               <p>Now, my girl, be positively sure the prisoner is the person. - I am sure of it; I never saw her before; there was a candle in the room till I went to bed; I am positive to the woman; as soon as I saw her, I knew her.</p>
               <p>Have you got the things here? - The pawn-broker has got them.</p>
               <p>Who do you live with? - I live by myself.</p>
               <p>Who do you lodge with? - Mr. Burgess.</p>
               <p>How do you get your livelihood? - I work, and earn nine shillings a week, making ladies hoops and hips.</p>
               <p>Who had you been with that night? - With a young woman that was going down to Bath.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking any thing before? - Nothing but some beer to my supper.</p>

               <p>On Monday morning, the 5th of March, about six, I was called up by Robinson, the landlord of this house; I went up two pair of stairs, in a back room, and I found the prosecutrix in bed, and her clothes all gone, excepting her hat and shoes; I asked her who she was, she was in such a flood of tears, it was a long while before she could tell me; at last she did, and began to describe the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutrix describe her to you? - Yes, she said she should know her from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180064"/>a hundred, she was so particularly marked in the face, and I knew the prisoner living in that house, I went to the prosecutrix's friends, where she directed me, and fetched her sister to her, to bring her some clothes, and take her away; after that, I took a description of the clothes she had lost; as soon as the pawn-brokers opened, I went round, and searched many of them; at one pawn-broker's I found a gown and cloak, and an apron; some of the things are not found yet.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. What passed? - He asked Richard Burchell where he had the hay from; the prisoner was present; Burchell said he bought it of the prisoner at the bar, and the prisoner owned that he did sell it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did he say? - I cannot pretend to say the particular words he made use of.</p>
               <p>What did Burchell say he gave for it? - Three shillings, and the prisoner said he only gave him one shilling for it, and that was a shilling's worth of halfpence; part of the hay is here; it is very good hay.</p>

               <p>The prisoner denied it, and said he had only sold him the sweepings for a shilling, because he expected my Lord's waggon with hay in town? - He might say so.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner give this account of it, that expecting some hay in my Lord's waggon, he had sold the sweepings of the loft, which was the perquisite of the coachman, and received a shilling's worth of halfpence for it? - I cannot recollect that he said so.</p>

               <p>Then you bought it as rubbish? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Perhaps you know whether in the service of noblemen, the sweepings and rubbish are the perquisite of the coachmen? - Not as I know of, I never received any.</p>
               <p>The watchman asked you what you had got in the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you tell him? - Rubbish.</p>
               <p>Not a word of the three trusses? - No.</p>
               <p>So he was uncivil enough to take you into custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And kept you safe in hold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you bought any hay lately before that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you know the price in Smithfield market and St. James's? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did it bear any better price than one shilling a truss? - Yes, some I give two shillings a truss.</p>
               <p>So this you bought for rubbish at one shilling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it tied? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much did you give this man for it? - Three shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you pay him for it? - Yes, one shilling in half-pence, and two shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>How come you to tell the watchman you had not got any in the cart? - I did not know but it was rubbish.</p>
               <p>Why could not you have made it rubbish by untying it, and kicking it about a little? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen. What are you? - A journeyman carpenter.</p>
               <p>This was on Sunday night, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your mother goes to church of a Sunday night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You go to drink crank instead of going to church with your mother? - Not constantly.</p>
               <p>How much had you drank that night? - Part of two or three penny-worth.</p>
               <p>Was you sober upon your oath? - I was, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Who advised you to prosecute this poor boy for an highway robbery? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>You know there is a reward in this case of forty pounds? - I do not know any thing at all of these things, but I have heard of such things; as to my part I had rather be without the reward; I do not want it; it has been very disagreeable to me; I have not contrived to indict him for a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>When they came up to you, you say, you did not suspect their intention to rob you, till the watch was gone? - No.</p>
               <p>So that I take it for granted there was no violence used to you? - No, not in the least, it was gone as quick as lightning; I did not know I was robbed till the watch was out of my pocket; I did not understand what the other man said; I lost sight of him entirely, while I fell down; it was about half after eight; the robbery was about two minutes; my watch was snatched as upright as a dart; I was rather frightened.</p>
               <p>This was a momentary transaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The night was very dark? - It was duskish.</p>
               <p>Taking all these circumstances together, that the night was dark, that you was frightened, and that the transaction was sudden; I take it for granted, you could not swear to the person who took your watch? - When he stepped up to me, I was underneath a lamp.</p>

               <p>(The watch produced without any outside case.)</p>
               <p>Is that the watch that you picked up? - It looks like the same according to the maker's name and number 1265, the name Hayley, to the best of my remembrance; I only looked at it once.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect the number and the maker's name? - Because I was told it afterwards; it appeared to be something towards that number; that is the watch that was delivered to me by the constable.</p>

               <p>That is the way you take care to preserve good order in the night? - They went out of my parish into Russell-court, the girls would not have stopped him, if he had not stopped them; they did not stop long; I should have moved them if they had not gone into Russell-court.</p>

               <p>On the morning of the 16th of February, the deceased Mr. Gill was hired by a gentleman to carry some goods on board a vessel, and he having the boat loaded first, was molested by a rope belonging to the ship the Orphan, and the pilot cut it, it blew a strong gale of wind at that time, after that I begged of Mr. Gill to left the rope over the goods as we were very deep loaded, Gill accordingly got up, and lifted the rope over the goods, the boat was full of parcels; and one parcel was struck overboard by the rope, I called out and said to Mr. Gill, hold water if you please, and let us see what it is; he did so, and they gave us no assistance, I called out, pilot why did not you keep your rope up. I said we could not keep the boat a head to wind, with that he called out, if you do not chuse to have the basket picked up it may lay; and I really believe, the prisoner wetted his hands in picking it up, the prisoner was in the pilot's boat along with the pilot, laying by on their scull, words arose, they said we might pick it up ourselves; we told them we could not; d - n your eyes you b - r, says the prisoner, immediately; Mr. Gill held the scull in this manner, and pointed it at them and said, d - n your eyes, and repeated it again, Mr. Gill struck him upon the right shoulder, the prisoner stooped, and took the pilot's scull up, then it was blow for blow, he took and threw the man this way, it was up the third time against me, says I, for God's sake what have you done, you have fractured the man's scull, the man had a leather hat on at the time, he was a fireman belonging to the London Insurance; and a man that bore a respectable character, the people came with bludgeons, I was forced to fly for my life, the poor man was carried on shore, and is since dead, he fell overboard; and must have been drowned, if a man had not taken him out of the water.</p>

               <p>I saw the poor man soon after he received the blow on the 16th of February, I found him between the blankets, very wet, and extremely languid; and after waiting some little time, he was still more apparently languid; but he groaned, and gave one or two sighs, I then directed such steps as appeared expedient, a little hartshorn and water, they could not get it down, he shoved the things from his mouth, I was present at the trapanning the scull; and I was present with Mr. Crookshank at the opening the head.</p>
               <p>Was he bled immediately upon his being carried to the public house? - No, I did not look upon it justifiable, and Mr. Metford confirmed it, I thought he had received an injury by being in the water, and it was suffocation, his pulse was so extremely low, there was an extravasation in the head.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that his death was occasioned by the blow he received? - I think, to the best of my opinion, that the extravasation gave rise to it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - I do not know, it might be in consequence of his fall into the water.</p>
               <p>Was his scull fractured? - No Sir, there was no fracture. I have no doubt but the extravasation was the cause of his death.</p>

               <p>I was at work on board a Greenland-man; I had received some money; and I came into Rosemary-lane to buy some odd things; I went into a publick house to sit down, and they took me; I have had the handkerchief above these five months, I bought it when I came home from Greenland; it is the same, if I was to die this minute, I never robbed anybody, I never was in a prison in my life.</p>

               <p>Court to Gowing. I suppose you cannot swear to the lead particularly? - No more than by its sitting the place.</p>

             Ridley, a good hearty fellow; says he, we shall call on you to-morrow about this time, and bring him with us; on saying so, I looked on the other side of the chimney-piece where the watch was; the watch was hanging; says he, is there ever a coach-stand in this street; I told him there was; says he, I believe he would like to have the use of your front parlour for one or two mornings in a week; and he asked to see the parlour; I took him out to see the parlour; he approved of it; as we were coming out of the front parlour, I met the prisoner, whom I had left in the back room where the watch was; and they went away and bid me a good morning; I went into the back room again, and there was no watch, the watch was gone; I immediately recollected the watch was there when I went with the other into the front parlour, and left this prisoner in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. How long were you and the other in the front parlour? - About three months afterwards, I met the other prisoner; I took him, and he was tried and convicted here, at the sessions following, for stealing this watch, and being connected with the prisoner; I should have taken this man, but he ran into a house and made his escape out of the garret window; I happened since to meet with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. So this extraordinary fact happened on Good Friday, 1786? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You immediately went out to pursue them? - I did, and could not find them; I went down to Bow-street, and described the man and the watch; I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it, because you talk of believing? - I am not sure Sir, I know I went down to Bow-street that same day.</p>
               <p>Did you not immediately then of course describe the two men? - Yes, I believe I did give a description of two men; I did give a description.</p>
               <p>Was a part of their description, that they were very elegantly dressed? - I do not recollect that; Townsend was very well dressed; this man was not so well dressed.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not a part of your description that these men were elegantly dressed? - I will not say that, I do not recollect that; I thought they had taken up a great deal of time in shewing the lodging, but they had not taken up much time since they looked at the watch.</p>
               <p>In July, you accidentally met with Townsend for the first time? - I did.</p>
               <p>No notice of him in consequence of your information from Bow-street? - No, it was accidentally; I fixed on him at a very great risque of my life.</p>
               <p>I believe you stumbled on this man too, in the street by accident? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to state to my Lord and the Jury, what was the first thing you said to him when you met him? - I was going on Dean-street; I thought he was the man, so I passed him and went to the opposite corner of Compton-street, and there I staid and viewed him, then I was sure; he saw me look at him; he immediately walked off to Green-street.</p>
               <p>My question is this, did not you say to this man, am I right or am I wrong; is not your name Wright? - No, I said to him, and I laid my hand on my shoulder, how do you do Mr. Wright? says he, my name is Cook; says I, it does not signify what your name is, I believe you are an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180077"/>acquaintance of Mr. Townsend's, and you took an opportunity to take away my watch; he immediately said, he knew nothing about it; he went with me before the Magistrate, but very unwillingly; I was certain, though I said I believed.</p>

               <p>Pray, if it is not an impertinent curiosity, may I ask you what way of life you are in? - What way of life! I am employed by the board of navigation in making astronomical and nautical calculations for them.</p>
               <p>I rather think you attach yourself more to the study of the stars than mens faces? - That is no business of your's.</p>
               <p>I dare say if you had a question about the Georgium Sidus, you could resolve us? - I could tell you a great deal more about the Georgium Sidus than you know. Townsend was was found guilty on my charge, 39 s.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Taylor; on Good Friday, 1786, the prisoner at the bar and another man, came to our house to look at a lodging; I opened the door and acquainted Mr. Taylor; then I went down stairs, and in a little time after they came down stairs, the prisoner came into the middle kitchen where I was; there are three kitchens.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the same man? - Yes; I took very particular notice of him; I thought he did not look like a person that wanted a first floor; I am very sure it is him; he was very shabbily dressed, and he said that was a genteel kitchen, and every thing was very pretty and very convenient; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You thought these two people very impertinent in taking up so much of your master's time? - No.</p>
               <p>You thought they did not want a first floor; the other was not shabbily dressed? - Very genteel; this man was not very genteelly dressed.</p>
               <p>Have you never said they were both very genteely dressed? - I never said that.</p>
               <p>What other servant does Mr. Taylor keep? - He has none but myself; he has a wife.</p>
               <p>You are the only servant in the house? - There are other servants besides myself, but not belonging to Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in his service? - Almost three years.</p>
               <p>You came with him from the North? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are the only servant he has? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not see this man again for a twelve-month? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see me come to take a lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you had many people come to look for lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>How many short of five or six hundred? - Not half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Not in three years? - That is not surprising.</p>
               <p>It surprises me? - I am not surprised at all; - I am sure it is the man.</p>
               <p>Was you as sure to Townsend? - Yes, I was; I swore positively to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Is there no other women's hose put down the same day? - There are after that was found out, and after the prisoner was taken up; there are two more entries in his hand writing; he was taken up three or four hours after; there appears to be five or six different entries by the prisoner, the rest was made by a brother of mine who is now in the shop; when I found the deficiency in the account, I went out and informed Mr. Lock and another person, that I supposed he had the money upon him; they came in and I charged him with it, and he immediately pulled out two shillings of the marked money, and threw them on the table, there was another shilling he had in his pocket, and he said that was his own; Mr. Lock took up the two shillings, and said, those were them he sent

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. How much was in the till at the time this happened? - There was half a guinea in gold, three half crowns, and three sixpences, and eighteen-pence in halfpence; I left it so the night before.</p>
               <p>Court. Then what became of the other 4 s? - I had paid them away in change, I took them from the till, they were in the till the same morning they were compared with the other two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My question to you is, when you called in Mr. Lock, and enquired into the state of your till, what money was there in the till? - There was three half crown pieces, half a guinea and five marked shillings, and I believe another shilling and two sixpences, which was taken for a quarter of a yard of baize.</p>

               <p>Did you see what he did with the till afterwards? - No, I came out of the shop immediately, I am quite sure he put them in the till, I took notice, because I understood I was sent to try whether he would take this money or no, therefore I observed what he did.</p>

I think it right in the circumstances of this case to pronounce sentence on this prisoner before he leaves the bar; I am perfectly satisfied with the verdict of the Jury; it appears to me to be founded on very clear and satisfactory evidence, and therefore having no doubt of your guilt, it is my duty, with whatever reluctance I may do it in this particular case, to administer the law with that rigour which the nature of the case deserves. The offence of servants in general, robbing their masters, and more especially those that are entrusted with the property of their masters, is a crime which so entirely cuts up every bond of civil society, that it is the duty of the Courts of Justice, at all times to punish it with severity; the Court therefore think you ought not to remain any longer in this country, and the sentence upon you is, that you be</p>

               <p>Are you positive sure that you saw the basket at the time that you took in the box? - When I undid the rope, I am sure the basket was on the cart, I did not stay in the house above a minute or two at most; there were sheets and table-cloths in the basket, this is the basket; upon missing it I looked up and down Chancery-lane, I could not see a soul, I had not seen the prisoner before, I turned up Carey-street, there I saw the prisoner turn the corner to go down Bell-yard, I took him and brought him back, and asked him where he was going with that basket; he said he was going to carry it; I said then he should carry it back again; in about ten yards a man came up in a green coat, and asked what was the matter, I told him; he bid me not tear his shirt; I told him I would tear his flesh if he wanted to go away; this is the basket.</p>
               <p>Do you know that these things were in the basket? - Yes, because we opened the basket when the thief was taken, I saw it opened, and my mistress and me packed them up over night, they are all marked; it was as full as ever the basket would hold.</p>

               <p>Then supposing the man had gone on with the basket, this man would have met him? - Yes, that man came to my master's, and staid there a good bit, he pretended to assist, but I did not give him any encouragement.</p>

               <p>Did you or not see them drop from her petticoat? - I saw them drop under her petticoat, and took them up immediately.</p>
               <p>Did you see them drop from the lower edge of her petticoat or not? - I saw the end of them below the edge of her petticoat; I saw them drop; I observed they were warm.</p>
               <p>Supposing they had not been warm, should you have been certain they had dropped from under her coats? - I took them standing up under her coats.</p>
               <p>Whether were they in a package or loose? - They were loose.</p>
               <p>Then how could they stand up against her legs? - They were just as they are now, not in a package.</p>
               <p>Who else were in the shop besides you and Hardy? - There was another young man in the shop; he is not here.</p>

(Produced.) He blew out the candle as soon as he could, he was in his shirt sleeves tucked up; and in a flannel waistcoat, all their clothes lay in that cellar where they were at work; and afterwards they put them on, and every one owned their own clothes, I found there a quantity of blanks, and some that were finished.</p>
               <p>What dies did you find there? - Here are a quantity, a dozen or two I believe.</p>
               <p>Was there a compleat apparatus to make the halfpence? - All, but the cuttingout press, which is generally done at a different place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. The man is indicted by the name of Ketch, and the woman by the name of Robinson? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe that they are man and wife? - No, I have no reason to believe they are.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether they pass as such? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Have you any apparatus here that will produce a halfpenny? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a lodger in the next room to the prisoner, and have been four or five months; my husband lives with me, he is a gilder; I saw the man prisoner put whiting into this wooden thing, and then he fastened it in with a knife, as fast as he could, and after that he squeezed it on each side; I saw him take a farthing and put it in, and squeeze it on both sides; afterwards he shook the farthing out.</p>
               <p>Was it wet chalk? - It was dry chalk that I saw; then he melted some lead in a pipe, and he put that in; and when they were done, he field them off, and put them in his hand, and rubbed some blue stuff on them, which gave them the colour of copper; I saw the woman do nothing particular; but I have seen her at times hold a farthing over a candle, and put some tallow to it, that made it look blackish like; I had two farthings and a halfpenny of the money; I had it of my child; I saw the woman prisoner give it my child, who is between nine and ten, to go for a halfpenny worth of snuff.</p>
               <p>Are the prisoners man and wife? - Yes, my waistcoat is full of holes, and I peeped through.</p>
               <p>How came you to have this curiosity? - They were so very noisy, quarrelling and fighting, I was afraid of fire; she was very careless of the fire; I myself have picked the woman out of the fire twice; she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Peter. They used to get drunk together; this is only a piece of spight.</p>

               <p>I went with two other officers to this house in Peter-street, and knocked at the door; it was some time before it was opened; I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner Warlings in the lower room, that goes down two or three steps from the street, with his hand on a table over the cellar, where these stamps were found; Dinmore run past me to the stair-head, and said here they are; I immediately run after, and just saw the glimpse of some persons running into the yard, Taylor was in the space between the yard and the cellar; then I went into the necessary, and brought Harcourt and the woman out; I found these halfpence between the dies that were in the press, and I found five other dies which appeared to be odd ones; we went up stairs afterwards, where Warlings was; we asked him if he knew any thing of the business; he denied it, and said the one pair of stairs was his room; we found these halfpence in the room. (The halfpence produced and deposed to that were found in Taylor's room.) There were thirty shillings worth, which they call a piece.</p>
               <p>Could they work this press below stairs, without shaking the parlour? - I should think not; I suppose the press and fly, and all together, do not weigh much less than two hundred and a half.</p>

               <p>I received information of the robbery, and a description of the person who was suspected, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and apprehended him, and in his room I found these things; the prisoner was there in bed; it was two days after the robbery, in the morning about eight; I had a description of the things; seeing these breeches laying by the side of the bed, I asked him whose they were, and he said mine; I saw a pair of stockings, and asked him if they were his; he said yes, they were what he worked in, and a waistcoat that was there, he likewise said was his; nothing but these things were found upon him; but the evening before, I found a basket standing at the end of the court where he lodged.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to by Millar.)</p>
               <p>Millar. I am sure they are mine.</p>
               <p>What do you know them by from others? - I know them very well, by the mending and appearance of them.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that they are yours? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is your wife here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no evidence of the house being broke open.</p>
               <p>Freeman. The prisoner has informed us himself how he got into the house; he wanted to be an evidence, but there being no other person, the Justice thought it was not proper.</p>
               <p>What led him to confess? - Nothing, that I know of, because the woman was proved to be in the front shop, and he could not go out any other way with the basket, so he told us how he got out.</p>
               <p>What questions were asked him? - None at all; I went and examined the premises, according to his own directions, and I found it according as he said.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when he told you of this? - There was a girl in bed when we took him, and he said he was guilty himself, because we should not hurt the girl.</p>
               <p>Guilty of what? - Of breaking into Mr. Playfair's house, and he said it at the office; nothing had passed before; the room was proved to be the girl's room; she paid rent for it; when he was asked what he had to say in his defence, before Justice Walker, he said he had nothing more to say, but that he was guilty, and hoped the Justice would not hurt the girl; and when we came up, there was a lamppost in Mr. Playfair's passage, that leads to Mr. Playfair's house, and he said he got up that lamp-post, got into the yard, and then went into the entry over the back house, where the man lay, where these things were; he brought them down in the yard, and there was the basket; the lock being old, he forced open the door, and got away; he said after he got over the wall, the yard door was open; it was upon the latch; that is the latch of the door of the yard; that was the back house door; it is all adjoining; it is one wall; it is the yard door that goes into the road; but he had got into the yard; the other door was open.</p>

               <p>Court. Were there any other people running in the same manner, in the same place? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>In the place where the watch was found? - None that I saw; I do not know that the watch was dropped by the prisoner; this was about eight at night; I am sure the prisoner is the same man that passed me, and he confessed it; he carried his hand under his coat, which I described, and he said, the reason was because he was lame; as he passed me, his hand was concealed either in his pocket, or under his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you at a considerable distance? - I was not.</p>
               <p>You have a little mended your recollection since you was before the Justice of peace? - It is not a matter of consequence to me.</p>
               <p>Court. But it is a matter of very great consequence to the prisoner, because his life is at stake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You see I have not provoked you to pertness yet; if it is a long time since, it is not likely you should be more accurate now; you said before the magistrate, that one of them turned up Phoenix-alley, and the other, whom this informant believes to be the prisoner, ran up Hart-street, and passed this informant on the right, with his hand under his pocket; you heard this foreign gentleman examined before the interpreter? - I was not present at the second meeting.</p>
               <p>At first you suspected this might be some fun in two idle fellows? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In point of fact, was not the prisoner's hand covered with one entire flannel bag? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - Now I recollect, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Had not be a very bad hand indeed, three fingers shattered in such a state, as to produce great agony? - Probably it might.</p>
               <p>You are a sail-maker? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not you hear the foreigner say no force was used, but that his watch was taken most dexterously and politely? - I heard him say no force was used, but not that his watch was taken most dexterously and politely.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to swear that he was one of the men that run past you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there many persons who joined in pursuit? - Only one, which I afterwards found to be the patrol; the men were all strangers to me; the man that went up Phoenix-alley was never taken that I know of.</p>
               <p>The foreigner, before the Justice, I believe, gave this account, that he was robbed by one man, who delivered the watch to another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect which hand he said? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Phoenix-alley between the place where the person passed you, and the spot where this prisoner was taken, or beyond the spot? - When the prisoner had passed me, he had got past Phoenix-alley; he was stopped within some few yards of James-street.</p>

               <p>I belong to the government patrols that do duty at the play-house during the plays; at eight at night, going up the passage to Hart-street, all was quiet, and in three minutes I heard the cry of stop thief, towards Bow-street; I saw the prisoner run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180100"/>past me the contrary side of the street; I run after the prisoner; there were two people turning the corner of James-street, and they stopped him; the foreign gentleman came up and called watch, watch; and pointed to the prisoner; I understood by the foreign gentleman's motions, that he was satisfied that the prisoner was one of the men; the foreign gentleman went to the interpreter; I took the prisoner to Bow-street; he wanted me to let him go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You understood it as well as you could, as a man that could not speak English? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You call yourself, I think, a government patrol? - I am paid by government, and I am the patrol.</p>
               <p>Who gave directions for this indictment? - One Townsend was sent with me.</p>
               <p>He is a better lawyer than you; he knows how to make out a highway robbery better than you; it was at night, and you tell us, that at eight at night, Hart-street is particularly cool and quiet? - I tell you the street was quiet, more so than I ever saw it.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there was no performance at the play house that night? - I told you it was the 31st of the month; I should not have been there, if there had not been a performance.</p>
               <p>Do not be angry, keep your temper? - I heard the foreigner examined; I saw the the interpreter; I did not enquire his name, I never saw him before nor since; this <rs id="t17870418-96-viclabel466" type="occupation">Frenchman</rs>

               <p>Did he say they knocked him down before they took his watch? - I heard no such discourse.</p>
               <p>How did he describe it? - He said he was asking his way to his lodgings, and he had it written down on a card, and he met two men, and one said one way, and the other said the other; and the one snatched the watch out of his pocket; he did not say it was taken so dexterously, that he knew nothing about it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was it done with great politeness? - I was not taken up much with his evidence.</p>
               <p>What state was the hand of the prisoner in when you saw him? - I did not take notice, there was a mob about him.</p>
               <p>Was not his hand enclosed in a flannel bag, and three fingers smashed? - That has always been the case; I saw his hand tied up as usual.</p>
               <p>Court. did you ever see this prisoner before? - I have often seen him about the play house, and he is one of those that by name and looks, I was told to take care of; I have only been three weeks on that duty; I have known him all the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, upon your oath, has this man been in custody for any offence of any fort; that is a dangerous question to put to a thief-taker? - Not to my knowledge; I go by my orders.</p>
               <p>- GROVES sworn.</p>
               <p>I was present when this man was examined in Bow-street; I heard the Frenchman examined; I put the question to him, he said his watch was taken from him with great politeness; and the man smiled in his face, and took his watch, avec grande politesse, et tres legerement; that is with great politeness, and dexterously and slightly; he said likewise, that the man who received it from the other, received it avec la main gouche, with his left hand; he at that time told me over and over again, that he could not say that the prisoner was the man; it appeared to be a common pickpocket transaction, no violence in the least.</p>
               <p>You remember they have crammed into this information, that the prisoner was the man, which the foreigner had struck out? - I think it ought to be set right; it was by the mistake of a Dane who could not speak English not French.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I was going towards Smithfield one morning, and I met with Mr. Grainger's son, who goes by the name of Smith; knowing his father for five years back, he gave them me to carry to his father; he gave me three shillings, and when I got there, I was to have a message that he would send him some gold and silver fish, and two pheasants; I carried them, nobody was in the shop, but the woman; she took them and gave me six pence, she said the man was gone to market; I went to the public house and waited, I went to Fleet-market and returned; then there were two gentlemen in the shop, enquiring after ladies' lap-dogs; I had a message to deliver,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180102"/>and the girl saw me in the street, and she came and told me her father wanted to speak to me; I went into the shop, and was immediately laid hold of; I am one hundred and fifty miles from any person that knows me.</p>

               <p>Who was the last up in the family? - Mr. Collier; he was not long after me when I went to bed; all was then safe, the doors and windows were shut and fastened; I went to bed at near twelve; I was alarmed in the morning about six; I got up and came down with Mr. Collier into the shop; the door was open before I came down, but the shutters were broke to pieces, and a pane of glass; the screws of the bolts of the shutters had been forced out, and the glass broke; there were goods missed to a large amount, about the value of one hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>I believe you have no knowledge at all of the persons? - No, Sir, I have had the property ever since, which was given me by one of the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was perfectly light when you got up? - Yes, it had been light some time.</p>

               <p>I went to Mr. Collier's after this robbery, and in September I went with Mr. Collier to a house in Brick-lane; on the 11th of September I went to the house of Aldred, on the information that Mr. Collier had received himself; there we found a large quantity of muslin, dimity, some pieces of Irish, some pieces of printed cotton, and a quantity of handkerchiefs, both linen and cotton, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who was at Aldred's, when you found these things? - Neither he nor she were at home; they came home soon afterwards, there was nobody at home but the daughter; when they came home we took them into custody; nobody was there during the time, but Aldred, his wife, and daughter. We found a small quantity of linen at the room of Mrs. Bell, on the 19th in the morning; Mrs. Bell is not here.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner Taylor at any of these places? - No, I did not; I saw him at a Mr. Goldsmith's; we found a brace of large horse pistols, which were produced here on the former trial, and were delivered into court; Taylor was apprehended on Wednesday the 28th of February, in Golden-lane, at the house of one Mr. Trott.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found on Taylor when he was apprehended? - No kind of property whatever; I know nothing further.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHAKESHAFT sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of September I received information of some goods suspected to be at Mr. Aldred's in Brick-lane; I went there on a search warrant with Mr. Collier; we found some goods there, some pieces of handkerchiefs, and some Irish; they were not at home, when we were searching the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180105"/>house; they came home afterwards and we apprehended them; I found nothing else, but there was some new cloth at the lodging where I was directed, in Ratcliffe-lai, behind St. Luke's church; there was some new cloth made up in an apron; we went there first, and found out the lodgings, and I found a new apron there, and some cloth; and I said to Mr. Armstrong, we will take Athill across the fields to see if he will say any thing; and going along, he shewed me the very house where I had found the cloth, for he said he bought the goods there.</p>
               <p>Whose house was that? - Mrs. Bell lived there, and there were some men's clothes there that hung up; I believe it was Mrs. Bell's lodgings, I cannot positively say; we found her there; there was a coat and breeches hung up, we suspected them to be the prisoner's, but cannot swear they were; the prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him there? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further till the prisoner was taken up? - No, I advertised the prisoner and another through Athill's directions; I was not at the taking of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court to the prisoner. I hope you will take warning, prisoner; your life has escaped in this business, but unless you leave that course of life, which there is great reason to believe you are following, you will not escape the laws of your country long; you may depend upon it your person is too well known; your character is too well known: you may escape punishment for all the offences you have committed; provided you commit none in future; and you may return to the ways of honesty; you have health and strength enough to gain an honest livelihood, if you will do it; you will therefore consider that you have no chance of saving your life for any length of time, if you continue in bad courses.</p>
               <p>Shakeshaft. My Lord, at the time of Athill's examination, I was present when all of it was taken; he informed me that Stephens, Fosset, Taylor and Tucker were all concerned; I then said to him, you mean them that use such a house; yes, says he; Taylor and them that were tried for Mr. Reeves's robbery; them are the men; I have likewise seen him in company with Taylor, at a public house; he was sitting at a window, and abusing the officers, and threatening them.</p>
               <p>Court. You and all the officers of justice perfectly know Mr. Athill now, as well as Mr. Taylor; therefore I recommend it to you to keep an eye on Mr. Athill; if he is caught tripping, you cannot recommend yourself more to the favour of the Court, than in detecting him in every thing he may commit; if you are vigilant and active, you may at least render it impossible for him to go on with his business. Is there any body besides you, who has seen Athill in company with Taylor.</p>

            , are both attornies; the other defendant, Stephen Stephens, keeps a gin-shop, in the Borough; the defendant John Snelling, who is not now before you, but who is also joined in this indictment, became acquainted with Mr. Crossley in the year 1774, and during the whole period of eight years, from that time to the end of the year 1781, Mr. Crossley was employed in all Snelling's business, as his attorney: In 1778, a woman of the name of Ann Brumidgham, the wife of one James Brumidgham, who then lived with Snelling, was arrested in the Palace Court for a small sum of ten pounds, at the suit of one William Wortley; upon that arrest, Mr. Snelling. applied to Mr. Crossley, desiring him to undertake the defence of that action, she being sued as a single woman; Snelling then told Mr. Crossley, that if once it got wind that they could recover against Mrs. Brumidgham as a single woman, she would be sued for several hundred pounds; and therefore it became a very material point to Mr. Snelling to defend her against this suit. A verdict was obtained by the plaintiff in this action; a writ of error was brought by the defendant, and her coverture assigned for error: she was afterwards and pending the writ of error, arrested upon the judgment recovered against her; upon the hearing of the writ of error, the original judgment against Mrs. Brumidgham was set aside: during the time this action was going on, Snelling came frequently to Mr. Crossley's house, begging and desiring him to take care of the cause, and that he (Snelling) would take care of the money to pay him; this woman at that time, cohabiting with Snelling and going by his name. The first bill in Mrs. Brumidgham's business, was delivered personally to Mr. Snelling, upon the 29th of May, 1779; this bill amounted to 42 l. 15 s. 5 d. and credit is given for 16 l. 5 s. 6 d. leaving a balance of 26 l. 9 s. 11 d. But you will observe, gentlemen, that this bill is not only intitled, Mr.

Mrs. Brumidgham did bring Mr. Crossley the money for this note, and it was not sent for payment when due. Snelling informed Mr. Crossley he had got the note in his own hands, and would return it; therefore Mr. Crossley in his next bill gave credit for this note.

            ," and the balance due 100 l. 4 s. 2 d. Mr. Crossley on the 3d October, 1780, made an affidavit, that Snelling was indebted to him in 100 l. for work and labour, business done, fees and disbursements, money paid, laid out and expended; which affidavit so made in the year 1781, has been made use of as the foundation of all the iniquity of this conspiracy. Gentlemen, in Michaelmas term 1781, Mr. Priddle acting as the attorney of Snelling, suffered judgment to go by default in that cause; and on the 12th of January, 1782, a writ of inquiry of damages was executed in the cause of Crossley against Snelling; the execution of which writ was attended by the defendant Snelling, a clerk to Priddle and counsel on behalf of the defendant, to dispute this bill. The Jury in that case found 100 l. 4 s. 2 d. due from Snelling to Crossley. Gentlemen, at this time Snelling would have paid the money, but was prevented by Mr. Priddle, whose ingenuity suggested a method to escape payment; He applied to the Court of King's Bench, and obtained a rule suggesting Mr. Crossley's bill had not been taxed; and by consent it was referred to Mr. Lowten, instead of the proper officer of the Court, to determine what was due. Before the arbitrator, Mr. Crossley stating that he was employed by Mr. Snelling, but having no written order, the arbitrator awarded against him. Gentlemen, after this award, Mr. Crossley delivered a bill to Mrs. Brumidgham, who on this occasion had it taxed before the proper officer, who found a balance of 75 l. 8 s. 7 d. due to Mr. Crossley: But this bill did not include some articles of business done for Snelling contained in the former bill. Gentlemen, Mr. Crossley heard no more of these proceedings from January 1782, until January 1785; in which intermediate time, very unfortunately for him, he was concerned as attorney against Mr. Priddle in divers suits; in one Priddle had sued a Mr. Bullock, in which action Priddle was nonsuited; in another he was employed to sue Priddle on a bail bond, at the suit of Mr. Plumbe, late Sheriff of Middlesex, and a judgment was obtained in that action; and in the beginning of January, 1785, Priddle proposed to settle and give security. On the 3d of January, 1785, a warrant of attorney was executed by Priddle, and one

            , in the penalty of 208 l. at the suit of Mr. Crossley, and witnessed by the defendant Holloway; on which warrant of attorney was a defeazance to pay one half the money in six months, and the other in twelve. Priddle having thus got Mr. Crossley to let him at large, by way of requital, and with a view to get rid of his securities, spirited up his client Snelling to file a bill against Crossley for a malicious arrest in 1785, although the affidavit had been sworn, and arrest made so long ago as October 1781: It never before entered into the mind of man to indict Mr. Crossley, they knew they could not do it; they knew if they did, they must swear falsly; but in 1785, they file a bill for a malicious holding to bail: the cause came on to be tried after Trinlty Term; when it came on, Priddle who never wants ingenuity, put in a number of bills and receipts, supposed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180116"/>to be the handwriting of Mr. Crossley; Mr. Crossley not prepared for this, it imposed on the Jury, and imposed on the Lord Chief Justice; Lord Mansfield expressed great indignation; why, says he, Crossley must know he had no right to arrest Mr. Snelling; and the indignation of the Court was manifest to every man that heard it; but Mr. Crossley knew they were false, he knew they were forged; he suspected the ingenuity of Mr. Priddle, but he did not think he would carry his ingenuity so far, and therefore could not be prepared with an answer. Gentlemen, in a few days after this transaction, Mr. Holloway made his appearance; Mr. Holloway, the friend, the agent, the bosom companion of Priddle, applies to Crossley, under the mask of friendship; I will, says he, if you will come down, I will get you out of this scrape; I know the whole transaction; why these bills and papers were not forged above a week before the trial; they were made within the week: why, says he, you did not know your own hand-writing, they were so well done: Crossley was alarmed at this; Priddle (says Holloway) had got a witness to prove them; one of his clerks, a good witness on the occasion; and if the occasion had required, would have stood forth to have sworn to this handwriting, though we all knew it was made within the week; but, says Holloway, if you will give me ten guineas, and pay the verdict and costs, I will put a stop to this prosecution; I have a great influence over Priddle; give me ten guineas, and pay the money, I will put an end to the whole transaction. That would not do, Holloway came again in a few days; says he, Priddle wants to go to Worcester assizes, and he says, if you will pay the debt and costs of that action of Snelling's, to be estimated at one hundred guineas; pay fifty guineas now, and the rest by and by, there shall be an end to all this business, and the papers shall be put into the hands of Mr. Lowes, a gentleman at the bar; Mr. Crossley thought they would be safe in that gentleman's hands; he thought they could not be in worse hands than they were; and a meeting was had at the Leaping Bar, the other side of Black-friars-bridge, in July, 1785; Stevens and Snelling were to have been at that meeting, but were not; they therefore adjourned the meeting to Stevens's gin shop: when they came there, Stephens and Snelling were together; Stephens said to Mr. Crossley, this matter shall not be settled for a trifle, we must have 200 l. and nothing less; for if you do settle, now is your time, pay the money now; for if it is not, you shall be indicted for a perjury; and then when you are indicted as an attorney, you will not wish to shew your face in a Court of Justice; it will be an imputation in a Court of Justice, and therefore we shall rise in our demand; an indictment once found, they shall not take less than 500 l. Mr. Crossley resisted this application; but not satisfied with this, Holloway came again, he applied several times to have a meeting at the Mitre Tavern to settle all this matter; that they should have 50 l. and that the papers should be placed in Mr. Lowe's hands: Crossley, who had been frightened into this, and who, as they will tell you, is a timid man; for Holloway had bragged, Oh, he is a timid fool, he will be a fine milch-cow, whenever I want ten guineas; Crossley parted with his fifty guineas to Priddle, and the papers were placed in Mr. Lowe's hands: Gentlemen, this brings me to July 1785; Mr. Priddle then thought his friend Mr. Holloway had served him; why, says he, Mr. Crossley, to be sure, Mr. Holloway deserves ten guineas, and a note was given by Crossley for that sum, Gentlemen, in December, 1785, Mr. Crossley happened to be concerned in defending some informations which Holloway was employed to prosecute; the penalties upon those informations, would have amounted to the sum of 200 l. upon which Crossley's client thought it better to give Holloway ten guineas, than run the risque of being sworn against; Holloway received another ten guineas,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180117"/>and he had the hardliness to go on even with those informations; Crossley resisted them on the part of his client, and they were dismissed with contempt and indignation before the magistrate; what, Sir, (said the magistrate) take the money, and then bring the information! get out of the office. Then it was that Holloway and Priddle set to work, to try what they could do either by way of getting more money out of Mr. Crossley, or ruin him in his business, so as to render him incapable of ever attending to resist them again; they then began by giving notice to Mr. Lowes to return those papers which were placed in his hands; Mr. Lowes applied to Crossley upon the occasion; Crossley said he had no objection, but desired they would take exact copies, before they were entrusted in the hands of Priddle. Gentlemen, from 1781, to 1785, no indictment was preferred, not a single step taken by either Priddle, Holloway, Stephens, or Snelling; though Mr. Snelling must know the transaction from the year 1781, when the affidavit was sworn; and his attorney Priddle must know it when he brought his action for the malicious arrest: Holloway likewise knew it, and Stephens the witness, who said he would not take less than 500 l. not one of them ever thought of preferring the indictment till July session, 1786, and this for an affidavit sworn in the year 1781! Gentlemen, on the back of that indictment, the first witness is Mr. Snelling, the second Mr. Stephens; and as the clincher, comes

            ! in case you two do not swear enough, I will come last and pin the basket; now nobody that hears me disputes Priddle's ability to do that, he is too well known; and therefore puts himself last, to cure all defects that may be found in the former witnesses. But that is not all; you do not know half of Priddle yet; Priddle and Holloway consult together, whether he, Holloway, should be on the back of the bill; no, says Holloway; then I cannot be the go between, I shall look like a friend of his; and unfortunately, though Holloway is cunning, yet he was not wise enough to keep his own council; is for the very day he came down here to find the bill of indictment against Crossley, he met Mr. Sambridge; well, says he, I have been at the Old Bailey, and I have been instructing the witnesses against Mr. Crossley; I do not suppose any thing will come of it; he will come down, but I thought it was better for me not to be on the back of the bill: Holloway boasted of this to Mr. Sambridge, after the indictment was found in July session, 1786: that indictment did not come on to be tried till November, 1786; Mr. Priddle never preparing for it, because, as he was boasting to every body, he did not expect it would be tried at at all; but that he heard and knew Crossley was a timid man; therefore he would settle it. Applications the moment the indictment was found, were made by Snelling, by Priddle, and by Holloway, to Mr. Crossley, to make some terms to settle this business; Snelling represented he was led into it by Holloway and Priddle, and that he knew nothing of the matter himself; therefore excused himself among his friends; Holloway declared that he meant nothing by it, and knew nothing on which to prosecute Mr. Crossley, but that he was a very good milch-cow, and was a sure bank to go to for ten guineas; that Mr. Crossley had money, and while he had six-pence, he would have half of it; Priddle asserted every where, that he was at the expence of the whole of it, and it was his doing, boasting that the false papers and the whole contrivance was his, and that he had given forty guineas out of his own pocket to counsel to prosecute Crossley; Stephens said, he did not mind spending any money at all in a business of this kind; and when Priddle applied to him to be bail for a man; no, says he, we have agreed to indict Crossley, and I will not do any thing for you till you have indicted him. Gentlemen, when Mr. Crossley found they had preferred their bill of indictment, he rejected all compromise; no, says he, I have got into bad hands, I now will get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180118"/>out of them, and will take my trial; I will come before a jury of my country, and let them determine on the justice of my case. Gentlemen, in November last Mr. Crossley's trial came on, Mr. Snelling, Mr. Stephens, Mr. Holloway, and Mr. Priddle, the witnesses attending, were ordered out of court; and here if I was to open to you the different declarations that all these prisoners have made at different times, you would be astonished, not only at their wickedness, but at their folly, for they all of them, at different times, declared their knowledge of the business, and that they knew their accusation to be false, but that they instituted it for their own iniquitous purpose. When the trial came on, the first witness examined was Snelling, the moment that he was examined, it appeared that

            , the woman that had been sued, had all along cohabited with him as his wife, that he, in Crossley's presence, and every where, had spoke of her as his wife, upon which an acquittal of Mr. Crossley immediately ensued, on that indictment. Gentlemen, one would suppose, that when these men had gone thus far, there was an end to their proceedings against Mr. Crossley, but the measure of their iniquity was not yet full, for in January Sessions, in this year, and pending this present indictment against them, they preferred another indictment against Mr. Crossley, on an affidavit sworn in the same cause in the year 1781, with no less than twenty-nine assignments of perjury; but they dare not face a Court of Judicature with that indictment; for, on Mr. Crossley entering his cause for trial at the sessions where the indictment was found, immediately before the trial, Priddle, (the prosecutor of the indictment) removed it into the Court of King's Bench. - Gentlemen, the employments of Mr. Crossley by Snelling, will not depend on Crossley's evidence alone, but a number of witnesses will tell you, he himself employed Mr. Crossley in Mrs. Brumidgham's suits; and was to pay the expences of those causes. At a conversation, in the year 1780, at the house of Mr. Alexander, a very respectable man, when Crossley was applying to Snelling to drop the suits in the cause of Mrs. Brumidgham, Snelling said, I would rather spend 500 l. than settle this cause, upon which, Mr. Alexander saying, perhaps Mr. Crossley may be uneasy about his expences; Snelling replied, He knows I have undertaken to pay him, and he has taken my security; what is be afraid of? but he is always plaguing me to settle the cause: Gentlemen, by and by you will hear my friend Mr. Erskine enlarge on the expences of these bills of costs: what, 200 l. spent in desending a suit for 10 l.? but you know a man will sooner spend 50 l. than pay 18 d. wrongfully; and it becomes a matter of spirit; I think I do not owe the man the money; I will not pay it, the amount of the sum is nothing, Snelling might at any time have put a stop to it; but he would not, and expressed his anger against Mr. Crossley, for advising him to make it up; and this not only before Mr. Alexander, but a number of indifferent witnesses; since the indictment there was a conversation at Alexander's house, between Snelling, and one Abbot, when Snelling being asked what he wanted by the indictment against Mr. Crossley, he hit upon a very curious method of telling what his motive was; he wetted his singer with the liquor, and wrote upon the table figures of 200, that is it, says he, why, says Abbot, I know Mr. Crossley, very well, it is a great deal of money; upon which he wetted his singers again, and wrote on the table 150, and says publicly, I will take no less; and Snelling said further, he wanted to get some money; for if the money got into Priddle's hands, he should never get it. Gentleman, this was the language of Snelling; and as to Holloway, whereever he meets Sambridge or any man, he boasts continually from time to time, that he would have money out of this poor man's pocket; it was in the year 1780, after the action against Mrs. Brumidgham was brought, and before the bills delivered, that Snelling said he had undertaken to pay the money, and to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180119"/>security to Crossley. Gentlemen, there are a great many other acts which will convince you, that these men have conspired together to charge Mr. Crossley falsely with that indictment; it is a case in which none of them could be deceived, ignorance is not imputed to any one of them, Snelling must know whether he had undertaken or not to pay the costs to Crossley, he must have known the whole of that transaction; and Priddle must have known that the papers he so produced, were false, to save the client that sum of money, because they were his own manufacture; and there could be no excuse for either Priddle or Holloway, to say, that they believed them to be true, when they knew before they were false; and then they did not pretend to say, that there was any ground for the prosecution, because they knew that Crossley would not come before this Court to be tried for perjury; says Holloway, we shall get an end of him as an Attorney; then Priddle you and I shall share his business between us, we shall get those clients that now go to him: But if they were honest men, would not they have thought seriously thus: what! institute a prosecution in July, 1786, for a perjury committed in 1781! and you, Mr. Priddle received fifty pounds; and you Mr. Holloway ten guineas! why point to him? why apply to him to settle the business? but they were conscious they were wrong; they knew it was both foul and false. Gentlemen, it will be said, by my learned friend, Mr. Erskine, that there was some cause for this prosecution of Mr. Crossley's for perjury, because Lord Mansfield had been angry, and called it perjury; I admit it, but Lord Mansfield was imposed upon, and the jury were imposed upon to give that verdict; for had they known the fact, instead of words of indignation falling from that noble Earl against Mr. Crossley, he would have ordered Priddle to have been committed as he richly deserved: then what becomes of the words of Lord Mansfield; and if they believed Mr. Crossley guilty, then certainly they ought instantly to have prosecuted him for the perjury, they ought not to have lain by till July, 1786, before this prosecution was instituted; and when they had instituted it, do they come fairly before the Court? No, Priddle declares, that even in November, in the same year, he had not prepared himself with his briefs, because he could not suppose, that Crossley would be tried; then he purposes to make money of him or a milch cow. Gentlemen, these facts will, I am sure, induce you to pronounce these three defendants guilty of the several parts of this indictment, when I have called the evidence, you will judge of the iniquity of these men. a fouler conspiracy never came before a court. Gentlemen, the defendants know that, and therefore they came here to meet, and, in hopes to baffle, a prosecution of this kind, by the great abilities of my learned friend; my learned friend will endeavour to baffle our witnesses, he will endeavour to hold my client up in bad colours, perhaps, to you; but admitting for a moment, that Mr. Crossley was the worst man that ever existed, which fact I deny; what right had they to conspire against him? they have no right to conspire against a man, and say he has been guilty of every crime under the sun, supposing he had; but it is no excuse in you, to institute a prosecution of this kind, when you know it is false; you are bad men; you are brought to Justice; and you must answer for your own actions, and not for the actions of others; my learned friend, perhaps, will not trouble you with a witness, resting upon a very able speech; and not wishing, that even I, with my poor abilities, should have an opportunity of making any observation, in reply; he will perhaps address you, in a very able speech, calculated to engage your passions; he will say to you, Can you, gentlemen, suppose, that men of this description; that Mr. Priddle, who is a very able man; that Mr. Holloway, who is a very cunning man, should so far forget themselves? but, Gentlemen, I say, it is a very common observation, that the Devil will forsake his friends<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180120"/>at the last; and, in this case, he certainly has forsaken two of his very best friends. Gentlemen, from their own mouths will I judge them; I will prove the facts I have opened, not from vague witnesses, but from repeated conversations held both with Mr. Priddle, Holloway and Stephens, if that fact is so, what becomes of my learned friend's able speech? you will admire his talents; you will say, pity so much ingenuity should be exerted in behalf of men so undeserving; pity it is, that his great abilities are not employed on the other side, to bring these men to justice; if they had, he would have made us all shudder at their iniquity; and we should have sat down, lamenting, that such men ever existed, and that the Court had it not in their power to inflict a more exemplary punishment on such atrocious offenders, than the law at present enables them; for if men of this description can rob another of his reputation, the next step is neither very remote, nor very difficult, namely, to deprive him of his life; and to a man of character, death would be infinitely preferable to the possible consequences of such an accusation, supported by such a conspiracy; for how can a man exit in society, who has been convicted before a jury of his country, of wilful and corrupt perjury, he ought to be, and I hope ever will be an outcast from society. Gentlemen, if the evidence comes up to but half of what I have opened, you will not let the able harangue of my learned and eloquent friend, Mr. Erskine, outweigh the testimony of so many witnesses. Gentlemen, I trust Mr. Crossley's case in your hands, with you I leave his character, which is dearer to him than his life; and I trust that you will, after a serious investigation of the facts, in justice to him, as well as to the offended laws of your country, give these men over to that punishment, which they so richly deserve.</p>

               <p>At what date was it in point of time that you had the first connection with Mr. Snelling and Mrs. Brumingham? - With Mr. Snelling either the latter end of the year 1773, or the beginning of the year 1774; there seldom a month passed but I did something for Mr. Snelling; from the year 1774 down to 1778, I did business for him and from his recommendation to the amount of 400 l. or 500 l. from 1774 to 1778.</p>
               <p>At what time was it that you was applied to, to undertake any cause for Mr. Brumidgham? - I think it was in Trinity Vacation 1778.</p>
               <p>How was it you was applied to? - Mr. Snelling first applied to me at my office; he told me he was going out of town, and that Mrs. Brumidgham, who was the person who lived with him as his wife, though they were not in fact married, but lived with him as his wife, and she had another husband. -</p>
               <p>Was this his representation to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He himself told you that this woman who lived with him, lived with him as his wife, but she was not in fact married to him, but had another husband alive? - Yes, that was his representation; and he said, she was arrested for the sum of ten pounds, but if they recovered that, she was liable for the sum of three or four hundred pounds more, and therefore though this was a trifling sum, he wished me to conduct it in a particular way; he said, I should put it to his account, he should be my pay-master.</p>
               <p>Had you at this time seen any thing of Mrs. Brumidgham? - I think I had seen her twice, not on this business, but I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180121"/>not known her by any other name than Snelling; Snelling said, I might place it to his account, he should take care to pay whatever might arise.</p>
               <p>Did you in consequence of this conversation, undertake the cause for the woman? - Yes Sir, she applied to me two or three days after, when Mr. Snelling was in the country, and gave me the history of the cause, and said, that she had done some friendships for some people of the name of Rayner.</p>

               <p>You did a great deal of business for this lady, under those instructions? - No doubt of it; and Mr. Snelling was with me every day.</p>
               <p>Did you in the course of the business you was carrying on, see Snelling only, or at all? - There hardly was any matter of consequence in any Court but he was present; he attended more than persons usually do; I consulted him through the whole business.</p>
               <p>To what amount did you do business? - Much larger than 200 l.</p>

               <p>Mr. Crossley. When we were at Westminster on the trial, some money was wanting; that note was given, it was to be paid for me; it was a note given by me, payable to Snelling, for the purpose of raising money when he was out of town; it never was paid; I spoke to Snelling about it, and he often promised to return it.</p>
               <p>Court. Why was credit given for that note to Snelling? - It was never intended to be sent for payment, we were on a very friendly footing, and the note was long due; I gave the bill for the purpose of raising the money; Mrs. Brumidgham took the bill, and brought the money the next morning, and I had the cash for it, and therefore I gave credit for it.</p>
               <p>Was any money settled, or the debt at all liquidated before you delivered another bill? - There were two payments which are at the head of the next bill; which bill was delivered the 31st of May, 1781.</p>

            ." The balance of that is 100 l. 4 s. 2 d there is no credit upon that; the business got into the hands of Mr. Priddle, and he never paid any thing after.</p>
               <p>Then that is the last balance previous to your making the affidavit of the debt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. After all these bills delivered to Mr. Snelling, did you see any thing of him after the delivery, till the time you was driven to have recourse to law? - I frequently saw him after the delivery of the second, and a month or two after the delivery of the last but one; Mr. Priddle and Mr. Snelling came to my house; they said, they came to treat with me about the papers; and Priddle said, if I would give Mr. Snelling a time, which he then mentioned, for payment, and delivered up the papers without the money, it should be paid shortly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I ask you upon your oath? - That was the first time I had a personal interview with Mr. Priddle upon that business; I told Mr. Priddle that I would not part with the papers without the money that was due to me; they were the papers in the cause of Wortley and Brumidgham.</p>
               <p>Did you happen at that time to mention any thing of your determination to proceed at law against them? - Not at that time, for I wished to get the money without if I could.</p>
               <p>Had you at any time pressed Snelling, or threatened him with a legal progress? - I never threatened him with any process till he came into the hands of Priddle; I had no cause of complaint before; I told him I would not part with the papers till I was paid; I think they went away, and said, they would give me an answer; or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>How long intervened before you saw either Priddle or Snelling again? did any thing pass material between you? - No Sir, I cannot say that there did; I do not know that I saw Mr. Snelling after the delivery of the last bill at all.</p>
               <p>Have you heard from Snelling at any time, whether he had or had not in his custody any money of Mrs. Brumidgham's? - Yes Sir, 400 l. frequently, when I advised him to settle the cause, he said, what was that to me, he had more money in his hands of her's than would pay me; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180123"/>my pay-master; I arrested him at the instance of Mrs. Brumidgham.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Snelling at any time before, manifested any thing like dissatisfaction at the urgency of payment? - He said, that other attornies would go through their business before they asked for money; I told him, they might, but I would not in such litigious suits; that might be at the delivery of the last bill but one.</p>
               <p>At any of these times when you had these conversations with Mr. Snelling, did he attempt to shift his ground? - Never, he always acknowledged that he was responsible.</p>
               <p>How long elapsed after these conversations, before you was driven to take out legal process against him? - The first time that any dispute arose, was his wanting me to get possession of a house in Surry.</p>
               <p>After this dispute, what time might elapse before you was driven to have recourse to legal process? - After the delivery of the last bill, and the month expired, I sued out a bailable process.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. From this bailable process it was that the perjury was assigned; after this arrest did you see any thing of him? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long did you hold him in custody, till he was bailed? - A little time; I do not know when he was bailed.</p>
               <p>When was you first apprised of an indictment for perjury against you on this affidavit? - To the best of my remembrance, it was preferred in July sessions, 1786.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Your Lordship sees at once the gap there is!</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, there are five years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now in these five years, had any thing been said to you by these present defendants, and what was said to them? - I had several actions against Mr. Priddle in that intermediate time, upon two of which there were executions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did Priddle stand indebted to you in any sum, and what? - He stood indebted to Mr. Plumbe, the late Sheriff, or to Mr. Saunders, the Sheriff's officer, in 100 l. knew it by Mr. Priddle's admission.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did he ultimately in the event, become indebted to you in a particular sum? - Yes, in that way, he was not indebted to me till I took the secu after that settlement, he frequently applied for time; the sum he admitted he owed me was 104 l.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass, respecting the subject of the indictment, between you and any of the defendants? - After the action for the malicious arrest, there was nothing before that; an action for a malicious arrest was brought against me; I think it was in

               <p>Who was the attorney in that? - Mr. Priddle.</p>
               <p>Who was the plaintiff? - Snelling.</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Priddle acknowledged to you before this time, that he was your debtor to the amount you mentioned? - Yes, Sir, he had given me security before that.</p>
               <p>Were there any terms proffered to you at all by Mr. Priddle, during the pendency of this cause? - No Sir, I forced them on as quick as possible by rules to trial.</p>
               <p>After this trial ended, I believe there was a verdict against you? - There was.</p>
               <p>What were the damages? - Sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>After this was ended, what conversation did you at any time hold with Priddle or Mr. Holloway? - Some few days after the trial, I met Mr. Holloway; he told me, if I would give him ten guineas and pay the verdict and costs, he would get me out of the scrape.</p>
               <p>What scrape did he say? - I told him, I did not understand him; I was much afraid of speaking to him at that time, though I had done some friendships for him; he said, about the papers; I had certainly been overseen at the trial, and had admitted papers that I had never wrote; that I had been taken by surprise. I was sure I never could write such papers; and he said, I was a fool, and did not know my own handwriting; they had not been made seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180124"/>days before the trial, and Mr. Gosnel was to prove them.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Gosnel? - He was then Mr. Priddle's agent, or something of that kind; I told Holloway I believed I was got into bad hands, and I should have no objection to get out of them; that I should not mind ten guineas, and as to the verdict, I did not want to trouble myself about that; I should pay it without any further trouble; he said he would apply to Mr. Priddle, and get it settled in some way or other under his management, and I must give him ten guineas, for himself; there were several meetings between us; at one he pretended Priddle was going to Worcester assizes, and that was the time to strike, and that he could make a very good job of it; if I would give Priddle fifty guineas to enable him to go down there, and set fifty guineas off the warrant of attorney, that should be a discharge of that verdict; the damages and costs were to be estimated at one hundred guineas: we had several meetings. Then he told me that Priddle wanted to fly off, but that he had agreed with Mrs. Priddle that it should be settled; that she had the entire government of Mr. Priddle, and that she was very fond of venison, and that they must have a venison feast at the Horns, in Surry; Holloway and I went there, we had a neck of venison; Mr. and Mrs. Priddle were to have been there by his appointment, but they never came; Holloway came there, and while we were there, he continued to work upon my passions; said, that it must be settled at any rate, even if it was to the amount of two hundred pounds, to prevent Priddle bringing forward an indictment for perjury; I told him I would not pay more than the verdict; Holloway said, I ought to settle it, if it cost two hundred pounds: Priddle would furnish evidence to convict.</p>
               <p>When was the first time Mr. Holloway mentioned any thing about an indictment for perjury? - He said he would settle all then; he intimated to me that there was a danger of an indictment for perjury; that was about the time of the ten guineas, to induce me to it, I believe all in one conversation. He said I ought to settle it, if it cost me two hundred pounds more, for Priddle was determined to furnish evidence to convict.</p>
               <p>Be accurate, if your memory will serve you, as to the terms made use of; do you feel yourself warranted upon the oath you have taken to say, that these were the terms, that Priddle would furnish evidence? - Clearly; I found myself in a very awkward situation; I wanted to come away, upon which he changed sides, and said, if I doubted his integrity, he would make affidavit of the forged papers; he said he would compel Priddle to settle it; when Holloway went away, he said he would apply to Priddle again; he then wrote an appointment to meet me at Mr. Lowes's; there was a previous conversation between Holloway and me about putting the papers into Mr. Lowes's hands; they were the papers, as I understood it, that were produced in Court. A meeting was appointed at the Leaping Bar, on the Surry side of Westminster-bridge, by Holloway, and Mr. Lowes went over there with me; Mr. and Mrs. Priddle, and Mr. Holloway met there. Priddle upon that meeting said, that the verdict should be settled upon the terms of paying fifty guineas down, and there was fifty guineas in the term preceding to be wrote off the warrant of attorney, and I was to postpone the judgment on the warrant of attorney, till final judgment could be obtained on the record; I understood the agreement fully concluded then; but Priddle said he would have his client present, that he might have a discharge. Mr. Snelling did not come, and we went from there, Mr. and Mrs. Priddle, Mr. Lowes, and me; Holloway left us, I think; we went from thence to Stephens's house in the Borough, to look for Snelling, and there we staid for a few minutes; they came in both together; Holloway never came to Stephens's house; but Stephens and Snelling came in after we had been there some time: Priddle withdrew with Snelling; Stephens said, if it was his case, it should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180125"/>not be settled for two hundred pounds; that was while they were absent; I am not sure whether it was before they returned or not; but after they returned, Stephens said in the presence of Priddle and Snelling, it should not be settled for two hundred pounds; and if there was a bill of indictment found, he would be d - d if it was settled under five hundred pounds; I said to Mr. Lowes, it was unfit for me to be there; and Mr. Lowes and me came away together: either a day or two after, or the next day, I received an appointment that Priddle was determined to settle the business; I believe I have a letter from Mr. Holloway; it is in his hand-writing; it is dated the 9th of July, 1785.</p>
               <p>Court. It is of no consequence, he has told us already? - Afterwards there was an appointment, I rather suppose it must be verbal, with Holloway, to meet Priddle and him at the Mitre Tavern in Fleet-street; that was for the 11th of July; we met there on the 11th of July, at the Mitre Tavern, Holloway and Priddle, Mr. Lowes and me; Holloway went to fetch Mr. Lowes; while he was gone, I asked Priddle to let me look at the papers; he then shewed me the original bills of costs, and papers which corresponded with the affidavit that Lord Mansfield had reprobated; I said to Priddle, those are not the papers that were produced in Court; he said, d - n you, you do not know your own handwriting; I did not want but to settle the business, I knew very well that those papers being deposited in safe hands, would be the same thing to me; Mr. Lowes came in, I gave him the fifty guineas, and Priddle delivered him the papers; Mr. Lowes went back, and said Priddle with him; they came back, and said the papers were locked up; I then told Mr. Lowes he must pay Priddle the fifty guineas, and a receipt was given; Priddle then said, you must give Holloway the ten guineas; I was not provided, I gave a note to Priddle, and the note came for payment by Mrs. Priddle; this was the 11th of July, 1785: in the Michaelmas Term following, Priddle was to have entered satisfaction on the judgment on the verdict; there was no writing for it; he asked me in Michaelmas Term to let him have ten guineas, and then he would enter up the judgment and satisfaction; I gave him the ten guineas, and took a receipt in the cause. In Trinity Term, 1786, I heard he had applied to tax costs; I then took out a rule to be present, but he taxed them ex parte, and issued out execution for the whole money.</p>

               <p>Did they levy the whole? - I did not see the execution, but the officers came to my house, my clerks denied me, I cannot tell what was marked; I saw Priddle afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did Priddle admit that he had taken out execution? - He said he had not taken out execution, as I understood; I told him that was false, for that the officers had been at my house, and I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Did he admit that he had done it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation take place in any after-time, relative to the indictment for perjury, and to any method of accommodation? - I do not recollect that, I do not know that I ever saw Stephens after the time he said he would have 500 l. I think Priddle said whether I had paid a part of the execution on Snelling's judgment or not; I should pay it over again, and he would have all his securities up, or he would prefer an indictment for perjury; that was in Trinity Term, 1786; I went away directly; I do not recollect seeing Priddle again.</p>
               <p>Did you see Holloway again? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of Stephens? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>You saw Holloway at your trial? - Certainly; Mr. Priddle, Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Snelling were witnesses on the back of the bill; we had Holloway turned out of Court; he said he was a witness on the trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. If I understand you right, you was acquainted with Snelling from 1773, or 1774? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180126"/>You have had various transactions with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>During all which time, I understand you to say, you never found him defective in his payments; and you had no reason to distrust his credit? - Not till after the delivery of the bill of 1781.</p>
               <p>Then it was Mr. Snelling that first applied to you upon Mrs. Brumidgham's distress? - He first applied to me to employ me on her behalf.</p>
               <p>And that he was to be your paymaster? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This happened before you had seen Mrs. Brumidgham on that business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Consequently you undertook the business on Snelling's credit soleley? - I should have taken up any business on his credit.</p>
               <p>Then I take it for granted, you never received any sums of money from Mrs. Brumidgham on that account? - I have received sums frequently from both.</p>
               <p>Did you give any receipt at that time? - I have no doubt but I did.</p>
               <p>The credits, I observe, are marked on the bill? - I never had any dispute about the credit.</p>
               <p>You brought an action against Mr. Marsh, did you not, for Mr. Snelling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You applied to the Court of King's Bench, in order that you might retain the debt and costs in your hands, because Snelling was indebted to you on account of Mrs. Brumidgham's business? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>On that occasion, Mr. Snelling came forward, and denied, that he had employed you? - I do not know that he did, the rule was discharged, because I had not sworn that Mr. Snelling was not able to pay me, the Court said they never interposed, unless it was an insolvent man.</p>
               <p>Afterwards you brought an action against Mr. Snelling, charging him with all the sees, all the disbursements, and all the business done for Mrs. Brumidgham? - Yes, In that matter I had a judgment by default, and recovered the money before a jury, the master said he had a great many references before him; and it went to Mr. Lowton, with a general reference.</p>
               <p>Did you attend Mr. Lowton on that reference? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you produce before Mr. Lowton the different bills which had been talked of tonight, the five different bills? - No doubt on it, and I believe they were left in Mr. Lowton's hands for some time.</p>
               <p>Take that paper in your hand, and answer me, Sir upon your oath, whether that first bill, at the time it was left in Lowton's custody, was intitled, as it is now, Mr. Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham? - For any thing I know to the contrary, it was as it is now.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively? I have an affidavit in my hand, which was the affidavit you made in order to get the debt and costs in the action of Snelling against Marsh, in which you swore you always gave credit to Mr. Snelling, and not to Mrs. Brumidgham? - I say now, that I never did deliver any bill of any kind without being entitled, Mr.

            , Drs. and I tell you now, Sir, that the second bill you produced, they have a duplicate of it, with a like title, that is in my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Then I understand you to swear, that you never did make out the bill of the 29th of May, 1779, there was but one bill of that date? - It is impossible to say, at the distance of eight or nine years; we were upon terms of the greatest friendship; but, I positively say, Sir, that the bills were all delivered in that fashion.</p>
               <p>You have stated, that the first bill was delivered on the 29th of May, 1779, and that it was in your own hand writing; was that first bill, of the 29th of May, 1779, produced to Mr. Lowton? - It is impossible to recollect at this distance, if not by them, it was by me.</p>
               <p>In that bill of the 29th of May, was not Mrs. Brumidgham alone, made debtor, and not Mr. Snelling? - She certainly was not.</p>
               <p>Then you say, that the very first bill you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180127"/>ever delivered, which was the 29th of May, 1779, which bill was laid before Mr. Lowton, the arbitrator, was titled as it is now? - I mean to say, that the first bill, dated the 29th of May, 1779, was titled as you mentioned certainly.</p>
               <p>Was there any more bills of that date delivered? - Not that I know of, my copy might be laid before the arbitrator.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brumidgham alone was not made debtor? - She could not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever make out a bill in your life that had Mrs. Brumidgham alone debtor? - Not to my remembrance; I wish to be understood to say, I never did to my remembrance, it is impossible for me, at the distance of eight or nine years, to swear to transactions.</p>
               <p>You surprise me, I understood you to say, that the first bill of the 29th of May, 1779, was titled as it is now; did you make Mrs. Brumidgham your debtor, or, did you make Mr. Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham your debtors? - I certainly made Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham jointly.</p>
               <p>Were there produced before the arbitrator any sums of money received of Mrs. Brumidgham? - I do not recollect; there was no dispute before the arbitrator, as to the sums at the foot of the bills.</p>
               <p>But were there not receipts produced to shew? - I should rather suppose, that the credits were taken from the foot of the bills.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive in point of fact, 10 l. - 10 l. - 12 l. and 10 l. from Mrs. Brumidgham? - I may, for ought I know, whatever I received is at the foot of the bills.</p>
               <p>Did you give receipts, as receipts from her, on account of Snelling, or on account of herself? - It is impossible for me, at this distance of time, to recollect what receipts I gave, but I should rather suppose I gave them in his name; I believe there were duplicates of the bills, and there were books, those books are in my custody now</p>
               <p>Are they in court? - After I came down here I had notice.</p>
               <p>Court. That is no notice at all?</p>
               <p>Priddle. It was in the morning; I had his notice only in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you in all your accounts before the arbitrator charge Mr. Snelling as well as Mrs. Brumidgham? - I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Then how came the arbitrator to decide there was nothing due to you? - He found nothing due to me.</p>
               <p>Did he make it in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I object to talking of it?</p>
               <p>There was then an action brought against you by Mr. Snelling for having maliciously held him to bail? - There was.</p>
               <p>That affidavit that I just now put into your hands, was read in Court? - It was.</p>
               <p>In which you swore, that you had made no bill, except in the name of Mr. Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>How came you to say on your original examination, that there was a forged account of your's produced with the name of Mrs. Brumidgham only? - I did not say so; Holloway told me after the trial was over, that there was; I saw them in Court; I saw the names signed to them, and I believe I admitted them; the papers were put in the usual manner.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear it stated that your affidavit was false in that respect? - I do not recollect that any thing was stated about the affidavit.</p>
               <p>Was you not in Court at the time the verdict went against you? - I certainly was.</p>
               <p>Holloway told you after the verdict, some of the papers had not been made above a week before the trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came it you never made any application to the Court for a new trial? - Because I had agreed not to impeach the verdict at all; I found myself in bad hands.</p>
               <p>You knew very well if there was a difference, you had an opportunity of detecting it? - The papers were not in my hands at that time.</p>
               <p>The papers must be different to those that were produced before Mr. Lowton? - They must be different, because I certainly at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180128"/>the arbitration, would have impeached any false papers.</p>
               <p>Did you in Court, when the cause was tried before Lord Mansfield; (I was counsel against you.) when I stated in your hearing, that you declared that all your bills were made jointly; did you deny that I had your bill made only to Mrs. Brumidgham? - I certainly did not see that there were any forgeries at that time; I certainly admitted the papers, suspecting them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state in the publick Court, that in the first bill, Mrs. Brumidgham was alone made debtor? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know the cause was determined upon that point? - I do, but I do not recollect your opening that bill; I was very much surprised when those papers came to be read, because I was sure I never wrote such papers; I might be instructing my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Look at this? - This is my writing; the minute at the bottom is not mine.</p>
               <p>Look at that? - That is my hand; they are all my writing; they are my receipts; I should presume they were written at the time they bear date; I either received that sum from Mr. Snelling, or somebody on his account.</p>
               <p>Were those receipts before Mr. Lowton? - I do not know; I do not recollect any thing being before Mr. Lowton, but the bills of costs, and the credit that was given at the foot, when a cause of Mrs. Brumidgham's upon a plea of coverture, came on to be tried at the King's Bench; the evening before, I wanted some money, this note was delivered over the table after dinner to Mrs. Brumidgham, knowing Snelling to be out of town, and she got the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She told you that the only way was to give a note to Snelling, and she would get cash for it? - No bill could be produced before Mr. Lowton so directed, with my hand-writing fairly obtained.</p>
               <p>With respect to your bills, they could not be with a single title, or Mrs. Brumidgham only debtor, if they were fairly obtained from you? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>With respect to your books, they were of this sort; the bill was copied out and became a perfect duplicate, therefore if the books were produced to Mr. Lowton, they could be only copies of the bills? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holloway. If ever I was thoroughly shocked in my life, I am this night; you say you saw me after this verdict at Guildhall? - Yes, in the Strand; I came to your house some few days after; you had made an appointment; I first saw you a very few days after the verdict, it might be the next morning.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you did not come to me in Scotland yard? - I did not first; I came to you by your own appointment; you said, if I would give you ten guineas, you would get me out of the scrape.</p>
               <p>Did not you come to me after my Lord Mansfield declared in my hearing, that you had committed the most wicked impudent perjury he ever remembered; did not you come to me, knowing I knew Priddle, and feeling your situation? - I never did apply to Mr. Holloway till I met him in the Strand, and had this conversation with him.</p>
               <p>You never did apply to him till he made you that offer? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holloway. Did not you write to me on the 11th of July? - I might for ought I know; I do not know that I did; if you have any letter of mine you may produce it; you told me if I would be directed by you, you would get me out of the scrape, and you would speak to Mr. Priddle.</p>
               <p>You say you was frequently with me afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were those meetings for? - For the purpose of settling upon terms you proposed.</p>
               <p>Settle what? - If you would have my ideas upon the subject, I believe it was to work out of me as much money as you could get.</p>
               <p>You have told the Court that I told you the papers were forged? - You certainly did say some of the papers had not been made a week before the trial, and that I did not know my own hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180129"/>Was it not your own request that I would interceed for you? - After the first proposal, I certainly did wish to get it settled.</p>
               <p>I ask you, if I ever mentioned any sum of money that you were to give by way of setling any indictment? - You mentioned that I must settle it, if I gave him 200 l. at the Horns, and Priddle would furnish evidence to convict, if I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a farmer, I live in Wales.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Stephens and Mr. Priddle? - I have seen them together, I remember seeing them in October, 1785; I saw them at Mr. Stephens's house.</p>
               <p>Who were present at the meeting? - I saw Mr. Stephens and Mr. Priddle, it was on a Sunday; Mr. Priddle asked me to walk with him to the King's Bench, and from there to Stephens's; and we went to Stephens's, and when we got there, Mr. Stephens said, d - n you Priddle, I find you are going to do us all; I did not know what he meant by it; however the conversation past, what do you mean? and Stephens said, those costs of Crossley's should be paid some time ago; I am informed you have got them; he said he had not; says Mr. Priddle to Mr. Stephens, Mr. Stephens, we want you about an elegit of Grant's; says he, I will not give bail for Grant, I will have no concern unless you get the money of Crossley; you have got the money of Crossley, it was agreed upon to indict him, you see we have done him once, and we can do him again; says Priddle, I only want you to step forwards for this poor man that is in gaol, and to get him out; no, says Stephens, I will not, you know I agreed to furnish the money, if you will indict the man, we can get a thousand pounds of him; you know we have done him once, and we can do him again; then Priddle and I came away; says I to Priddle, that Gentleman Stephens is a money-getting man; says 
               <persName id="t17870418-118-person1045">

             can do him; as we were going on, says Priddle, do you know that Crossley has got an execution against me, for a hundred pounds; when I have settled with Crossly for this money, I then shall indict Crossley, and I shall then get two or three hundred pounds out of him, and get the execution, and then they may all go and be deman'd.</p>
               <p>Did any more conversation pass at that time? - No; I think about the 5th of December, in the same year, my son was with Priddle, and he sent him over to see if Stephens would bail Grant, I went with my son to Stephens, we staid there a couple of hours, I suppose, before Stephens came in; when he came in, my son related the matter to him; no, says he, I will not bail Grant, or have any thing to do with him, till the matter is settled with Crossley; says he, I am a Boroughnian, and have a sack full of money; and you may tell him, unless he will do that, I will not stir a foot; my son went out, and I talked to Mr. Stephens about the business of bailing Grant, and he still said the same thing.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Priddle at any time in June, 1786? - Yes, I was with him, I think it was June, or the latter end of May, 1786; Mr. Priddle asked me if I had any money in my pocket; I said I believed I had; he had some of me, I was to have it the next day; says he, I shall have money enough to-morrow, I can give it you again; I went down the next morning, Priddle was at Westminster; says he, will you take a walk with us, we are going over the water; I went with them, Priddle left us, and Snelling and me, and his clerk, went to them, and somebody else, I cannot recollect who; we staid some time, and Mr. Priddle came; then we returned back; Priddle said to me, Mappleback, you have been over to Grant's, and here is a little bit of an affidavit, which you must swear to; when I went to ask Mr. Priddle for the money, says he, d - n me, he has taken out a writ of error; then Holloway came; says he, what do you think Bob? Crossley has taken out a writ of error; oh! says Mr. Holloway, d - n him, we will do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180130"/>him over; we shall get 1000 l. we will indict him.</p>
               <p>Where was this conversation? - At Westminster Hall, just by the gave; says Holloway, you know I was a witnesses to an agreement, and Crossley was to pay the money, and he has been a good milch cow, and I have got ten or twenty out of him, and said, he would get a hundred; Mr. Priddle was Snelling's attorney in Trinity Term, 1786; I think there was some conversation in Place-yard; says I to Pridle, you have brought me into a very pretty mess, here is a non pross for 27 l. and Snelling has got a receipt for the costs; oh! d - n you, says Priddle you are not up to it; I was obliged to give him a receipt for the costs (meaning Snelling) to indict Crossley, for he would not be concerned in the business, unless I give him a receipt for that sum.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you when that prosecution was to be carried on? - He said, they would do it immediately, as soon as Priddle had got the money of Crossley; for some costs of a writ of error; or something of that sort; he said, we shall indict: Crossley; I only gave him a receipt on purpose that we should indict Crossley; in August 1786, I came to London about the 17th or 18th; I saw Priddle; so I applied to him to know who I was to pay some money to; says he, you shall not pay it, do you know we have indicted Crossley; no, says I; says he, the bill is found, and now d - n him, we will do him up; says he, do not you pay the money, Crossley and me will make an end of it; he has got money enough; Snelling said, he would have no concern in the indictment; Snelling said, you know you are to go through this business of the indictment against Crossley; but says he, Priddle, you know my friend Stephens is to find the money, and I have nothing to do with it; Priddle said, I think, I shall receive five hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>Did he mention at any time any money that either he or any body else had paid towards carrying on the prosecution against Crossley? - No, I was a perfect stranger at that time to Crossley, but I met him by accident, and he subpoened me to attend at the sessions; I went to Priddle, and told him I had got a subpoena; O d - n him, says he, we will do them up, I will have three or four hundred of him; says he, when you was here before, I did not think of going on with the business; I had not then made out a brief; but now I have one of three hundred sheets; if he does not come down immediately; I have given fifteen guineas to Counsel, and I will give twenty more.</p>
               <p>That was before Crossley's trial and acquittal? - Oh dear! yes; I told them to settle it; then says Priddle, if you will go and bring me my execution and 300 l. that matter shall all be ended, and I will give a receipt for the money; I then said, it is a sum of money; but however, if Crossley is a man of money, in the hands he is in, he had better give it, than stand the racket, and I will advise him and give him all my trouble; I told Crossley; I then told Priddle, that Mr. Crossley said, he would be d - ned if he gave him a shilling; then says Priddle, I will pursue him immediately, and I will knock him all to pieces; for if he gets quit of this business, I will indict him, and indict him again, till I do him over; I was with Priddle several times; he then said, he would take 200 l. and I went and begged of Mr. Crossley, to give 200 l. says I, I advise you to give 200 l. and make it up; I told Mr. Priddle that he would not give any thing; now says I, you are like to fight it out; it was some time before the trial; I think it was in October sessions; I never saw Mr. Holloway, but at Guildhall; and says he, this will be the ruin of Crossley; says I, I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Priddle's son married your daughter? - Yes; I have no connection with Mr. Crossley; Mr. Morgan, of Bedford-square, is my attorney.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you recollect when it was that you first saw Mr. Crossley to know him? - I cannot tell you, but long ago; in 1781 or 1782; on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him often from 1781 or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180131"/>1782? - Yes, but never to drink, or have conversation with him; I knew him by person.</p>
               <p>You knew him perfectly well in the year 1783? - I knew him when I saw him.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a farmer in Wales? - About seven years; my farm is at Cefnyberrin, in Montgomery; I lived in Yorkshire at that time; I have lived in Wales at times, about six years; my own farm is at Ealey, in Yorkshire; I let it last April, and left it.</p>
               <p>What farm have you now? - I live at Cefnyberren, when I am at home with my daughter.</p>
               <p>How long have you occupied that farm? - I have had it six years in my hands; I let it for three years, and only entered on it last April.</p>
               <p>Is this farm your own? - I look upon it as such, when I have paid for it; I bought it, and when I find the right owner, I am ready and willing to pay for it; I have not paid for it yet; I have had the farm in Yorkshire fifteen or sixteen years; I have occupied my own farm since last April; that has been the place of my last residence.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in town now? - About six or seven days; I have lived at Mr. Crossley's sometime; I lodged there; I feed at his table, but I never had any money of him for my trouble in coming up; I never staid an hour at Mr. Crossley's house, but on this business; in November, I was at Mr. Crossley's house; it was all on this business.</p>
               <p>Then you came to town on this business, and lived for a month in his house? - I always was at his house; I never did any business for him; I never served a writ for him in my life; I have been constantly living in the country; I cannot say what term it was in.</p>
               <p>Have you ever served a writ for Mr. Crossley? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you never, at the suit of Jacques, serve writs for Crossley? - What do you mean, writs to arrest men; I never did; I believe I did serve a copy of a writ; I went with Crossley's man.</p>
               <p>Did not you make an affidavit of the service of that writ, after you had served it? - I believe I might, I did not remember it; I remember nothing about it; I might not make an affidavit.</p>
               <p>Did you or did you not? - I gave the gentleman the writ.</p>
               <p>Did you swear to that service? - Yes, I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did you, yes or no? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say you would do for Priddle? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Have you never said so to any person whatever? - Never in my life, he has said a thousand times that he would send me to gaol; and I said, if you do, I will send you there.</p>
               <p>Do you know one John Hall? - Very well.</p>
               <p>Do you know Robert Jemmet? - But a little.</p>

               <p>Have you not, at this moment, by your own direction, given to your attorney, a suit in the court of Exchequer, against Mr. Priddle? - Several, he wanted to rob me of a large sum of money, or my friends, and I would not let him.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect any conversation between them? - I heard a conversation after dinner; Crossley mentioned to Mr. Snelling that he was engaged for him in defending a cause, and there was an application made by the opposite attorney to settle it, for Wortley; and Snelling seemed angry, and said, he always wanted to settle the causes, upon which he said, he would not do it, he would rather spend 500 l. than settle it; I thought it then was a matter of dispute, whether Mr. Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham were married, or how they lived together; I said, perhaps Mr. Crossley may be uneasy about his expences; and Snelling said to him, no, you are not, are you? I am to be your paymaster; I believe it was in 1780, or 1781; I cannot charge my recollection just now, Mr. Crossley said, you had better settle the cause, in order to save expences, and you will get this money; I think it was an offer of 40 l. Snelling said he would not settle it, he would rather spend from 100 l. to 500 l. At another time, near the Christmas following; Snelling was very frequently there; Crossley asked him about a note of 15 l. or fifteen guineas that he had lent Mrs. Brumidgham, during the absence of Snelling, to get money to pay the expences with, he said, that note is never come for payment; and you may give a receipt for it now, and I will take care of it.</p>
               <p>You are very well acquainted with Crossley? - Yes, I am; I know nothing more of Snelling than seeing him in company several times.</p>
               <p>You do not know then, that Mr. Snelling swore in the Court of King's Bench, that he never had employed Mr. Crossley? No, Sir, there was an appointment between Mr. Abbot and Mr. Snelling at my house; I went to bed, and left them there; they were both drunk, they came to settle something; Snelling would have 150 l. he wetted his fingers with the wine, and figured 200 l. They said it was a great deal of money; I believe Mr. Jacques was there; Snelling said, he wanted to get some money, for if the money got into Priddle's hands, he should never get it; after he figured 200 l. he then figured 150 l. then he said no less.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing Mr. Holloway any time in the year 1768? - I believe it was very early in the January, 1786, there was a business in which Mr. Holloway and me were jointly concerned at that time, and a sum of money had been received by Mr. Holloway, I conceived, on the joint account, on which we were engaged: Mr. Holloway declared, he did not receive it on that account, but that he received it from Crossley, for the purpose of smothering an indictment which was in agitation against Crossley for perjury; that he had received the like sum at the Mitre Tavern, in Fleet-street, when Priddle received 50 l. that Crossley was a frightened driveling fool, and he would make him bleed at any time; that whenever he chose to alarm Crossley, as he did once about some venison; he was very sure he would let him have the same sum. Holloway frequently mentioned him in the course of business, that he should not oppose him in an action we were concerned in, for, that an indictment for perjury should always be held in terrorem, against him; I do mean so upon my oath; I have very frequently seen Crossley; but did not know him, only as being concerned for some Lottery-Office keepers; shortly after this he ridiculed Crossley, said he was a driveling fool, he might have settled it for a hundred, tho' it should cost him many hundreds; tho' damn it he and Priddle had made up their minds; he should not be a witness upon the bill, because he might have the opportunity to act as a mediator, if it was found necessary, as he had been before at the Horns at Kennington; for all they wanted, was to get security for a sum of money. Subsequent to the second indictment, Mr. Holloway and me had several disputes, which are now settled; he then told me he had been at the whole expence of the second indictment for perjury against Crossley, even to bringing up Priddle by Habeas Corpus, for Priddle chose to have him tried at the Old Bailey; since that, Holloway has said, that Priddle and Stephens were nothing to him, they had used him very ill; and damn them, he would give them up, if I would intercede with Crossley not to prosecute him; subsequent to that, Mr. Holloway has, by intreaties first, then, by saying it was necessary we should make an affidavit, not to appear against each other, and he endeavoured to dissuade me; that Mr. Erskine was to appear, and he would blow me out of Court. With respect to Priddle, I believe, in Trinity Term last, there was a motion; I spoke to Priddle; I told him I thought it was a great way off, he said, I do not care a pin for the event of this motion; I will indict him for perjury in Snelling's cause; I will make him give up all my securities, and a round sum into the bargain; I never saw Stephens to my knowledge, all kinds of differences are settled between me and Holloway, nor any animosity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Why you and Mr. Holloway were very good friends? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long ago is it since you went into partnership with Mr. Crossley? - I never was in partnership with Mr. Crossley; all is made up between me and Holloway, and general releases, my mind has given him a general release; I am upon my oath; it was an agreement between Mr. Holloway and me, that the profits should be divided; it is not so with Crossley, his are merely agency fees, he is literally my agent.</p>
               <p>When was this conversation with Priddle? - I believe it was in Trinity Term last.</p>
               <p>What time in the term? - I really do not know; it was a promiscuous meeting; I was standing upon the steps when he was coming down.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him before or since? - Never, I knew Mr. Priddle personally; I did not mention it from friendship to Mr. Crossley.</p>
               <p>Was it sheer justice? - It was sheer good nature; I was sorry to see such a scene as they were engaged in at that time; I had no connection with Crossley; I was very intimate with Holloway.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180134"/>Mr. Holloway. Did not you send to me to come to your house at ten last night? - No, Sir, I did not, I do not recollect I had any business in the world to send for you.</p>
               <p>You did not send your coachman, or some of your servants for me last night? - I do not recollect that I sent for you at all last night?</p>
               <p>Court. A circumstance of that kind could not very easily have escaped your memory? - I meant to have sent for him on Sunday, I knew there was a writ out against one Coppin, at his suit; I wanted to get Mr. Holloway's consent to discharge it; it was either Sunday night, or last night, but whichever it was, it was for that purpose; and no other.</p>
               <p>Have not I very frequently declared to you, that I knew nothing at all of this business, that I was not on the back of the bill? - Yes, you have, since this indictment; but I have as frequently remonstrated with you.</p>
               <p>When you and I made up our differences, did you not then treat about my interfering with Priddle, and the people that you thought were concerned in the prosecution against Crossley?</p>
               <p>Upon my oath, as I stand here, you desired me to mention to Crossley, that you would give up Priddle and Stephens; for damn them, what were they to you; and you have repeatedly said, you was to give Mr. Erskine twenty guineas, and they were to pay Mr. Mingay.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect who were present at that meeting? - Mr. Priddle, Mrs. Priddle, Mr. Holloway, and Mr. Crossley; I was desired to attend that meeting by Priddle, in order to settle some matter between him and Crossley; there was some matter which they had settled, and some papers which had been lodged with me, which I was to keep till they called for them from me; Mr. Priddle was not there when I arrived; he came in soon after, he said then that he did not chuse to do any thing, but in the presence of his client, which I understood to be Snelling; his client, I understood from him, then was in the Borough, at a Mr. Stephens's; and it was then agreed to go from thence to the Borough, where Snelling was said to be, for us all to go there; but Mr. Holloway did not go; Mr. Priddle, his lady, and Crossley, and me, went there; when we arrived at Stephens's, neither Stephens nor Snelling were there; we staid sometime; and then they both came in; upon that, Mr. Priddle retired with Stephens and Snelling to a different room; after a few minutes Mr. Priddle came into the room where we were; and said, Mr. Snelling and Stephens were coming; they did so, and it was said by some of the company, I do not know by whom, whether Snelling was agreeable to what had been proposed; Mr. Snelling appeared rather to be in liquor, he gave some answer, but in such a way that I could not understand him, upon which, Mr. Stephens immediately said, it should not be settled, unless Crossley would pay a sum of money, and if he did not, he should be prosecuted, upon which, Mr. Crossley asked what he meant by a sum of money, the reply of Stephens was, that 100 l. or 200 l. should be paid, or he should be prosecuted; and Stephens said, he would find money for the prosecution; upon that, Mr. Crossley desired to know what was to pay; he paid, and he and I went away together without replying to that answer of Stephens's; Mr. Crossley said, if that was the case, it was not worth his while staying, and called for the reckoning, and paid it, it was sometime after that,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180135"/>I do not know her long, there was a meeting at the Mitre Tavern, in Fleet-street; I was not there; Mr. Priddle or Mr. Holloway came to my chambers, and told me, that Mr. Crossley was at the Mitre Tavern, if I would have the goodness to go there; matters between them would probably be settled; I went there in consequence of that desire, with the person that came for me, there was Mr. Priddle, Mr. Holloway and Mr. Crossley; as soon as I came into the room, after the common compliments, Mr. Priddle and Mr. Crossley retired to a window to look over some papers, then they were put into a sort of loose cover, then it was said to me, that Mr. Crossley would pay 50 l. or guineas; I believe it was guineas, upon these papers being lodged with me; upon which, Mr. Priddle immediately went with me to my own Chambers, and delivered the papers, which they looked at, and which I have never seen; and I opened a drawer in my library table, and put the papers in, and locked the drawer again, then we returned back to the tavern, where Crossley paid Priddle fifty guineas; I believe there was, at the same time, a note given to Mr. Holloway, by Mr. Crossley, as I took it for fifteen pounds; I did not know the consideration of it; I do not recollect any thing more that is material passing at that meeting; I staid but in very short time; these papers continued in my possession for many months; at last Mr. Priddle demanded them of me; I told him I could not deliver them without the consent of Mr. Crossley, if he brought his consent to me, I would, with great pleasure, give them up; some time afterwards Priddle applied to me again, I told him I could not do it unless Mr. Crossley would consent to it; he then said he should be obliged to apply to the Court of King's Bench; I called on Crossley, and told him what passed between Priddle and me; Crossley seemed rather uneasy, and he said, let them be delivered to any other gentleman at the Bar; I communicated that to Priddle; Priddle agreed to that, and named a gentleman at the bar; I think the gentleman's name is School; I did not know the gentleman at the time; before I had delivered them to Mr. School, Mr. Priddle applied to me again, and told me the papers must be delivered to him, upon that, I mentioned it again to Mr. Crossley, upon which, Mr. Crossley immediately said, I do not care what becomes of them; you may deliver them to Priddle if you please.</p>

               <p>Did Crossley desire you, or did you yourself take any particular precaution about them? - I had not till then looked into the papers, and then I gave them to my stationer, and had a copy made of them.</p>
               <p>Did you examine that copy by the original? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make any mark on that copy, to certify its authenticity, and during the whole time you had those papers in your possession, had Mr. Crossley them any one moment out of your possession? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Did he make any alteration in them the whole time? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, permit any body else to make any alteration? - Not a soul living.</p>
               <p>Could any body make any without your observation? - No, no alteration could be made in them while in my possession by any means whatever.</p>
               <p>The copies, were correct copies of the originals as they were delivered to you, had Crossley ever seen them during the whole time they were in your possession? - Never, nor no one person whatever; nor had I ever seen them myself; I delivered the originals after they were copied, into Mr. Priddle's own hands, in Westminster Hall, at the bottom of the steps, going to the King's Bench; I desired Priddle to look them over and see if they were all there; he opened them, looked them over, and said, they were all right.</p>
               <p>Did Priddle at that time know that you had taken copies of them? - I do not believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180136"/>that he did, nor do I know that he knows it at this moment.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to look at these papers, and tell me whether these are your marks upon them, and whether these are the correct copies you took? - These are the copies.</p>
               <p>Have you since this indictment, or since the indictment against Crossley for perjury, had any conversation with Holloway about the business? - Since this indictment, I believe it was upon the very sessions week that this indictment was preferred; and after it was found, I was attending the Sessions at Clerkenwell-green; as I came out of the Sessions, Mr. Holloway was at the door; he spoke to me; he then, said, that Crossley had preferred a bill against him, and it was found; and says he, since that, he has been making proposals, which were rejected by the parties; he said, had Mr. Priddle been advised by him, Mr. Crossley would certainly have been found guilty on the former indictment, for perjury; but says he, he is so fond of bills; we are preparing bills now, and he shall have enough of them; I believe that was the whole conversation; I left Holloway on the steps.</p>
               <p>I believe you was desired by Mr. Crossley to attend on the trial for perjury? - I was, and I was subpoened at the same time, on the part of the former prosecution, and at the same time, I had notice delivered to me, saying, that I had not delivered the receipts back which were delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was that true at all? - It was not true, it was grosly false, and it was desiring me to prepare myself to give reasons why I suffered the bill to be altered, that was a gross calumny, and a falshood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holloway. In the part originally that I took in the business of Crossley, was not it purely out of friendship to Crossley; was not that your idea of the business? - I understood you to be a mutual friend between the parties.</p>
               <p>About the former bill, did not I say, that as to the former bill, it was preferred against Crossley; I knew nothing about that bill; it was about what my Lord Mansfield said about the affidavit that I spoke, and when all the witnesses were ordered out of Court upon the trial of that cause of Crossley's, you was present, whether I did not declare on being ordered out of Court, I knew nothing about this business of Crossley's; I can give no evidence about it? - I do not recollect any thing of that sort passing in Court; I know I was ordered out, at the particular request of Mr. Priddle, who subpoened me upon the prosecution; if that passed, it was after I went out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. I take it for granted, that at this time when these papers were deposited, and this money was to be paid by Mr. Crossley, it was subsequent to the action for the malicious arrest; there was a verdict at that time against him for sixty pounds? - There was.</p>
               <p>And you understood the costs must follow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard him promise to pay the remainder in November? - I heard no such promise.</p>
               <p>Was there any demand made on Crossley, more than the costs in these causes? - Not to my knowledge; I never heard it from Priddle, about a round sum of money, but from Stephens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holloway. Previous to this indictment, have not you heard me declare my with, that the matter should not go on? - You wished that no such prosecution had been had.</p>
               <p>Court. I remember myself, your telling the Court that you was not a witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I recollect it perfectly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. I have been not a little surprised, at a great deal that I have heard in the course of this trial; and although I feel (and if I did not, I must be deprived of all sense and feeling) that there has been a considerable degree of evidence given against those who sent me to defend them; yet I address myself to you, at this late hour of he night not at all disconcerted, because I have the best<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180137"/>opinion of your understandings and disposition to do justice. Indeed, if I could conceive you capable of being led away by the prejudices which must arise from hearing one side till the other is heard, and if I could conceive the consequences of such prejudices would be, that you would not attend to me when I stand up, I should not be able to do that duty I came here with a very strong inclination to do: but Gentlemen, when I come to state to you what I have to lay before you, and what I have been witness to, in the course of my profession in other Courts, in this very transaction; I am persuaded that honest indignation that may arise at first in the breasts of a Jury, and which some of you must have felt, if you have at all conceived, that what these witnesses have sworn is truth, that indignation will turn the other way; and when you have heard my case, then it will be accompanied with a degree of commiseration for the defendants for whom I am counsel. Gentlemen, let us first see what you have to-try, what the question is for your determination; I will not misrepresent that question, I will state it, applying to the learned Judge who is to try this cause, with that integrity, and that intelligence, which so much distinguish him in the administration of justice; and if there be any one observation that I make on the subject of this prosecution, that does not meet with his Lordship's full and complete consent, I give you liberty to lay aside every thing that I shall say, and that you will apply yourselves only to the correction which I shall receive from his Lordship on that account. Gentlemen, the defendants are indicted, for having maliciously, and without any reasonable or probable cause, falsly, wickedly, and maliciously conspired together, to indict Mr. Crossley for the crime of perjury. Mr. Crossley is an attorney of very considerable practice, but that shews you he knew better; this perjury was said to be committed in an affidavit made by him, when he swore in October 1781, that

             was indebted to him in an hundred pounds and upwards; they are charged with having conspired to prosecute Mr. Crossley upon this affidavit, not only maliciously, but without any reasonable or probable cause; or in other words, that they knowing and believing Mr. Crossley was innocent of that perjury, having no reasonable or probable cause to believe he was guilty, but believing his innocence, of their mere malice and wickedness, conspired together to indict him for this diabolical crime. Gentlemen, if they had reason to believe that Mr. Crossley was guilty, his situation in life would render that guilt the more abominable; and if the defendants afterwards believing him to be guilty, and having reasonable or probable cause to suspect that he was guilty, they did proceed against him, hoping that he, Mr. Crossley, knowing his guilt, to save his honour and character, would come to some terms of compromise, however you might be offended with persons for compounding publick justice, and under that colour attempting to extort money; if you think that the defendants, believing Mr. Crossley was guilty, although they ought to have taken a different course, and instead of giving up the prosecution, that they should in an open honest manner, have instantly brought him forwards to a publick trial, but instead of that, they omitted it, they compounded it, and for money they let him off from the punishment, although it is not a proceeding that ought to be justified; if this were proved to the full extent on the prisoners, although it is not a thing that I can at all call for your approbation upon, or desire your sanction to, yet it is quite another species of crime to that charged in this indictment; because these defendants are not indicted for having compounded the crime, or for extorting a sum of money to compound it, but that believing a man to be innocent, they maliciously prosecuted him as a guilty person, though they knew him to be innocent: the question is, whether on the evidence, (not merely on the evidence you have heard, for there is a great deal that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180138"/>will be contradicted) the question that you will have ultimately to try, will be this, whether you have any reason to think, that Priddle, or Holloway, or Stephens, or all of them together, did prefer this bill of indictment against Mr. Crossley, charging him with a perjury, and that they, or either of them, or any of them, such as you can fix by the evidence, had any reason to believe, that he was actually guilty of that offence: if they knew perfectly well that Snelling had given this undertaking, or that Snelling did make that promise to pay, which has been given in proof. - If you should be further of opinion, that all the other defendants knew it, and that therefore Mr. Crossley's affidavit was true, then I admit they are without all manner of defence. But on the other hand, if you should think Mr. Crossley to be perfectly innocent, he can never be tried for that crime again, and it never could be called into question but by his own indictment for a conspiracy; but if men are not content with an acquittal, it is impossible to prevent their being brought again into Court; if he is guilty, and the defendants can prove that guilt in this cause, it cannot be a malicious prosecution; but supposing him to be innocent, if he was not innocent with their knowledge, but that they proceeded upon reasonable and probable causes, then my Lord will tell you this to be the law, that if you should be of opinion that these people had a reasonable belief, that Mr. Crossley had taken a false oath, and that they intended not to proceed against him by indictment, but that in the hopes of extorting a sum of money, though there is no colour for that upon the evidence; but admitting even that the defendants intended to prosecute this Mr. Crossley, or to frighten and terrify him with this prosecution to get money of him, then believing he was guilty, but willing to give up the prosecution of that guilt for a sum of money, which he was well able to pay, it has no manner of connection with the crime you are trying, which is indicting him of an offence which they in their consciences believed him to be innocent of. Now I will lay before you not only some observations on the evidence that has been given, but state to you the evidence I am about to produce: Mr. Snelling most unquestionably had connections with this woman Mrs. Brumidgham, they were intimate, they were very much connected, and for any thing I know, she might sometimes pass under his name; and for ought I know, something of that sort may appear on the trial; Mr. Crossley says to-night, he was applied to originally by Mr. Snelling, that he told him in the most explicit terms, that he was to be pay master, that he knew him in 1774, and in a period of six years, never had any reason to find fault with him, or to doubt his payments, till he became acquainted with Priddle; but there has not been a conversation to night of any payment on the part of Mrs. Brumidgham; none of them have introduced Mrs. Brumidgham, but it is understood and stated by Mr. Crossley himself, that Mrs. Brumidgham, living under Mr. Snelling's protection, he promised to pay him for his labour; and now Mr. Crossley tells you, on his oath, that he was employed by Snelling, and not by Mrs. Brumidgham: after this cause he delivers in a bill on the 29th of May, 1779, and I shall prove by Mrs. Brumidgham, that the bill was not delivered to Mr. Snelling, that it was delivered to her, that it was made out, Mrs. Brumidgham debtor to Mr. Crossley, and not Mr. Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham, debtors. Now can any body believe that he should not know his own debtor, and should in the very first instance make out a bill, not Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham, but Mrs. Brumidgham? he never thought then of charging Mr. Snelling as his pay master, he never thought Mr. Snelling his debtor, all this never occurred to Mr. Crossley at that time; but his bill, which now lays before me, but which has been altered and written on an crazure, this identical bill was delivered first of all with a different title, Mrs. Brumidgham debtor to George<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180139"/>Crossley, and the name of Snelling never made it's appearance upon it; from the proofs I have to lay before you, you will have little doubt on the subject. This was in May 1779. In Trinity Term, 1781, Snelling had employed this very Crossley to bring an action against a Mr. Marsh; and in order to get the debt and costs out of the hands of the defendant's attorney, he made an affidavit in the Court of King's Bench, in 1781, in which he positively swore, that he had delivered that bill to Mr. Snelling, on that occasion, Mr. Priddle was Snelling's attorney, and Snelling came forward, and positively denied that he ever gave any instructions to Mr. Crossley, that he ever employed him, that he ever retained him, or that any one single circumstance, which Crossley has mentioned now, is true; in consequence of that Mr. Crossley's rule was discharged: When Crossley found himself thus foiled, he brought an action (and this is the part I must particularly beg your attention to) he brought an action against Snelling, Snelling could not be examined himself, he was there defendant; then he brought his action (as you have heard from Mr. Crossley himself); that cause was referred, there was a judgment by default, it was afterwards made the subject of a general reference to Mr. Lowton; and Mr. Crossley tells you to-night, that he attended Mr. Lowton, who had a general reference, in order that the account might be taken, and it might be seen whether Snelling was indebted to Mr. Crossley or not; Mr. Crossley has been examined to-night, and he has produced his bills, and he says, that every one of the bills which he delivered, he delivered copies of to Mr. Lowton, (though he boggled at it at first), he said certainly, in every bill Mrs. Brumidgham was made jointly debtor with Snelling, and not alone: Now if Snelling was his employer, if he undertook and promised to pay him, why join Mrs. Brumidgham? On the other hand, if he knew that he had no other demand on Snelling, he had no manner to make out the bill, but to charge Mrs. Brumidgham to be debtor: Mr. Lowton after examining the accounts, after seeing his bills, declared that there was nothing due at all to him: and compelled him to pay the costs of that reference; now upon what grounds did, or could Mr. Lowton determine there was nothing due from Snelling to Mr. Crossley? if Mr. Crossley had produced the receipts I shall produce presently in evidence, Mr. Lowton will tell you he should have made a different award; if it appeared by all his books, by all his conduct, that his dealings had been with Mr. Snelling, and not with Mrs. Brumidgham; but when he saw this man had made Mrs. Brumidgham debtor and not Mr. Snelling, Mr. Lowton had no sort of difficulty in making an award in favour of Snelling against Mr. Crossley, and to make Mr. Crossley pay the costs of that reference; you will observe we are here examining all this as antecedent to this bill of indictment for perjury, which did not arise for several years afterwards; and you will see how, in consequence of this award in favour of Snelling, he brought an action against Mr. Crossley for arresting him, and holding him to bail on that very affidavit, which is the subject of this indictment; for in order to arrest him, he made this very affidavit, which is the subject of the trial to night: that action came on to be tried before my Lord Mansfield, and he told the Jury, (as I am persuaded the Recorder will tell you,) that it requires the very same evidences to obtain a verdict against a defendant in an action, for maliciously holding him to bail, and that the question is not whether by mistake, a less sum is due, but whether the affidavit is made maliciously? I have heard Lord Mansfield say, the very same evidence that is necessary to convict a man of perjury, is necessary to establish that action. Now you will attend to the observation I am about to make; when Snelling brought this action against Crossley, the question was, whether Mr. Crossley's affidavit, upon which he did hold Snelling to bail, was a true or false affidavit, and within the knowledge of Mr. Crossley who made it?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180140"/>and if the Jury and Judge who tried that cause had not been convinced that that was a false affidavit, they consequently would have given a verdict for him; I was Counsel for the plaintiff, and we produced in Court the affidavit which I have just now stated to you, made by Mr. Crossley in Trinity Term, 1781, in which he positively swore, that he had delivered them four bills; for the question was, to whom he had given credit; to whom he had originally given credit was to be determined by the first bill: you are to carry in your minds what was the first bill; that was the same of this date; I produced the affidavit, which was, that he delivered four bills, and each of those bills was intitused Snelling and Brumidgham; he swore that he delivered that bill to Snelling, and that Snelling was made the debtor; Mrs. Brumidgham will tell you, that it was originally made to her; and you will see what is now written, was written on an erazure; the affidavit being read, Snelling produced a bill the 29th of May, 1779; Mrs. Brumidgham, debtor to

            , openly in Court; I will call witnesses who were present; I could prove it myself, it is written upon the back of my brief, in the very words in which it was produced; but it does not require any evidence, if in putting in the bill it appears to be what it was; if the bill was made out in the name of Mrs. Brumidgham, the evidence of the bill would not have corresponded with the affidavit; whereas the verdict was immediately taken, because the bill delivered in 1779, when compared with the affidavit, the instant my Lord Mansfield saw there was that variance, he told the Jury, the question you are to try is, whether Mr. Crossley has wilfully and falsely made the affidavit necessary, that Snelling was indebted to him in the sum of one hundred pounds. You see on the face of his bill it appears, that he did make Mrs. Brumidgham debtor, and therefore the plaintiff is intitled to a verdict. Now, Gentlemen give me leave to call your attention to a circumstance that strikes me to be very material indeed; Mr. Crossley was in Court at that time, he appeared to be in good health that day; he says he is ill now, and takes out his smelling bottle frequently; but he was sitting in Court when I opened the plaintiff's cause, and he said he never delivered any bill to Mrs. Brumidgham, for that I have under his own hand, and I will prove his bill. If he knew that he had given credit to Snelling and not to her; if he was conscious, as he must have been, that no such bill could have been produced; his conduct would have been, let me see this bill, let me look at it; now can any body suppose Mr. Crossley has so little sense, that when he felt himself oppressed, when Lord Mansfield declared it was the most wicked perjury he ever heard; if he knew that no such bill could be produced, that he would not instantly have called for the bill itself? But he did not; and why he did not, no reason can be assigned; but however, to-night I will put in the bill, and you gentlemen will be the Judges of it. Gentlemen, I doubt not but you will give me credit, when I assure you, that I have no connections or acquaintance with the defendants at all; God forbid I should. I come here from a sense of duty; and I assort that having opened the case in the hearing of Mr. Crossley, and having stated that I would produce a bill different intirely to the bill in 1781, made out by him to Mrs. Brumidgham alone. I say, gentlemen, that knowing all this, previous to this indictment; I thought it a duty incumbent upon me, though it was the night before term, I conceived it my duty to come in the behalf of these defendants; I thought it my duty to take care that these men should not intrust their case in the hands of another Counsel, wi, though much more capable of conducting it, had not been a witness to those transactions which my brief states, and which will be proved to you in the clearest manner. Gentlemen, let me repeat what passed before Mr. Lowton; Mr. Lowton had made his award: and he told Mr. Crossley so, Snelling being the plaintiff in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180141"/>against Crossley. Is not it strange; is not it incredible, is not it inconsistent with human belief, that a man who was awake, and an attorney too, and so smart and acute an attorney, and being concerned in many causes as I have very recently seen him concerned in; could sit still when I was to prove him guilty; when I was to state him guilty of perjury; and it was summed up by the Judge that the verdict should be given against him, and he never take any objection; he never says, my Lord this is not my hand-writing; he never told any one man living at the time; he does not even affect surprize, but suffers a verdict for sixty pounds, which must contaminate his character. Gentlemen, is not all this perfectly unaccountable? and now this night, when Mr. Crossley is called upon to account for it; why, he says it is a great distance of time, and he does not recollect, and he is not much given to attend to arguments of Counsel; and really wishes, gentlemen, to prevail on you to believe, that when he was there present in Court, and when his honour, his property, may his very existence, were at stake, that he was so unconcerned as not to listen to what the plaintiff's Counsel was going to produce in Court! Gentlemen, suppose the cause now trying, was against one of you, and the question was, whether you had given credit to A and B; you having sworn that you only gave credit to A, and the Counsel against you was ready to produce your own bill to contradict your affidavit, and make you guilty of perjury; would you be able to suppress your indignation? would not you be apt to break through the common rules of decency, to snatch it out of the hands of that man who held it up to you, to see by what soul practice it had been put into the hands of any Counsel to state? But instead of that, Mr. Crossley, without making an observation, and expressing no desire to look at it, not even after it was laid on the table, to see if it differed from that which he delivered out! - And Mr. Lowten will tell you, if it had been produced before him, he neither would not nor could have made the award he did! Gentlemen, Mr. Crossley gives no reason for all this, only says it is a great length of time, and takes out his smelling bottle - not at all well - might be instructing his Counsel! Now, Gentlemen, do me the favour to observe the purport of the receipts which are at different times, and of course, as he himself seems to admit in his examination were given at the times he received the money; for to be sure, when a man receives money, he gives a receipt; Mr. Crossley says that in general they were received of the persons and on the dates which the receipts themselves purport; now here are the different receipts, the first is,</p>

               <p>"Received this 28th day of July, 1779,</p>
               <p>"of Mr. Snelling, on account ten pounds</p>
               <p>"ten, for Mrs. Brumidgham's business." Gentlemen, it may be said, that a man's paying money on account is the best proof that he is the debtor; but I will prove to you, as men of sense and as men of honour, after you have looked at these receipts (and you never can condemn any set of men, any of your fellow creatures, without taking a very serious view indeed of these papers). Gentlemen, what will you say if I prove to you, that on this very day he received that ten pounds, ten shillings, not from Mr. Snelling, of whom he says it was received, but I will prove to you, from Mrs. Brumidgham, that she paid him the money, and, that this is an absolute fabrication, a forgery; and had no existence before: The next is</p>
               <p>"Received, the 3d of November,</p>
               <p>"1779, of Mrs. Brumidgham,</p>
               <p>"10 l. on account of the cause, Wortley</p>
               <p>"and Brumidgham; and, in part of the</p>
               <p>"bill delivered to her and Mr. Snelling." Now mark the art of this; I do protest, if the observation does not strike you, I shall conceive, that my mind is most singularly constituted; the receipts, by Mrs. Brumidgham's account, stood thus: -</p>
               <p>"Received, this 28th of July, 1779,</p>
               <p>"10 l. 10 s. on account of the law business</p>
               <p>"under my care." He alters that to</p>
               <p>"Received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180142"/>" from Mr. Snelling." When Mrs. Brumidgham paid him the sum of money on the 3d of November, 1779, he gave this receipt,</p>
               <p>"Received, this 3d of November,</p>
               <p>"1779, 10 l. on account of my bill delivered;" Mrs. Brumidgham will swear that is the receipt, nay more, the person who copied this receipt, will come and swear this to be the receipt; when he had the opportunity of altering this receipt, he makes it thus:</p>
               <p>"Received 10 l. 10 s. in</p>
               <p>"part of my bill delivered to her and Mr.</p>
               <p>"Snelling;" and this, to make you believe most undoubtedly, that the credit was given to them jointly: there are five receipts; they are every one of them substituted. Gentlemen, when Mr. Crossley found there was a verdict against him for 60 l. and that Lord Mansfield had made this declaration in Court; and feeling deeply, the situation he was in, he was extremely anxious to have this matter compromised; Mr. Holloway appears, on Mr. Lowe's evidence, to be a friend of all parties; and who wished to stop the very indictment that he is now charged with, Holloway knew nothing of these transactions, the name of Holloway does not appear in this cause, till after Mr. Lowton had made his award; and till after Lord Mansfield had made the declaration in a public and open Court, but Mr. Holloway knew of that sort of declaration; that Mr. Crossley had been guilty of a wilful, wicked, and deliberate perjury: in what? in the affidavit for holding Snelling to bail: Gentlemen, let me put this question to you, remember it may be your own case to be overpowered by false testimony, and remember, that the very same measure you make, it shall be measured to you again; I have the best opinion, both of your understandings and integrity; what evidence, in the name of God, is there before you? attend to this observation; what evidence is there before you, that Mr. Holloway knew, or had any reason to believe, that Lord Mansfield was wrong in the opinion that he declared in Court? What reason had he to believe, that that affidavit was not a forged affidavit? is there a tirtle of evidence of it; they want to make you believe, that the evidence was fabricated, on which the verdict was obtained for the malicious arrest; let me put this question to you, suppose you had been in Court yourselves, any of you, and had found the question was, whether Mr. Crossley had made a false affidavit or no, when he swore, that Snelling was indebted to him in 100 l? If you had heard from Mr. Lowton, that upon inspecting the books of Mr. Crossley, that upon inspecting the bills, that from his own evidence, he was clearly and conscientiously of opinion there was nothing due; should not you have had a reasonable ground to suspect, that Mr. Crossley was guilty of perjury: remember, you are not trying Mr. Holloway, for that he, believing Mr. Crossley to be a guilty person, wanted to compound his guilt; it is one thing to let off a guilty man for a sum of money; and another thing to prosecute an innocent man, knowing him to be innocent; and, gentlemen, in the name of God, what evidence is there before you, that Holloway, at that moment, did not believe him guilty? you never heard his name, but he is accidentally in court; and he finds, that Mr. Crossley is in a scrape; and all that Holloway does, is endeavouring to get a compromise; I say, taking this Mr. Crossley's evidence to be true, you will consider, that these defendants cannot be called as witnesses for one another. Now Gentlemen, with respect to poor Mr. Stephens, who stands there with a very contented countenance, what is he brought here to answer for? What is his motive? What quarrel ever took place between him and Mr. Crossley? What should induce him to ruin Mr. Crossley? What should induce him to believe Mr. Crossley to be innocent? Gentlemen, as soon as those bills were deposited in the hands of Mr. Lowes, certainly somehow or other Mr. Crossley got at them; they were proved in Court in their original state; he alters the bills and all the different receipts; having done that, he knows he is safe against the indictment for perjury; says he, I will prove that all the accounts are quite different to what the Gentlemen suppose; and he refused to pay the rest of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180143"/>the money, and he said he would not pay a farthing of the debt and costs; then he brings a writ of error, and then he hangs it up: he alters the bill, it is the very same bill, he takes away the receipts and substitutes another, and now those receipts, which will be by and bye given to you, appear most evidently to be made all at one time; some are dated in 1780, and some in 1779, and it is very extraordinary, that a man, when he gives a receipt, should put it on the same paper with a former one, the very same papers will join, so that they have been all written on a sheet of paper at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court. That applies to two of them, not to all?</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Yes, my Lord; all these receipts are on the same slip of paper, and they appear evidently to be written at the same time; I will call Mrs. Brumidgham, who will tell you positively that they are not the same, and have all been altered; if this turns out to be the case, surely it must make a great impression upon your minds, and it is not a very extraordinary thing that Mr. Snelling is not here to night, Mr. Crossley has not thought fit to bring him here, he is not standing here to be tried, and yet all the consequences of his guilt (taking him to be guilty) is to be fastened upon others: Suppose for a moment that Mr. Snelling had made this promise to Mr. Crossley, what is every attorney to be indicted for a conspiracy because he is missed by his client? Then what does Holloway do, he is the friend of both parties, and he wants to get a compromise between Mr. Crossley, Priddle and Snelling, who were going on with an indictment for perjury: when this prosecution is afterwards brought forward, Mr. Holloway's name is not mentioned, and, in my poor judgement, there cannot be any one article of evidence that can be twisted into this trial, that Holloway knew that Snelling had actually employed Mr. Crossley; you never see Snelling and Holloway in a situation together, the whole of the evidence is perfectly clear of such a charge; but even if there were, it is not the offence with which Mr. Holloway is charged by this indictment: But Gentlemen, when the cause is called on, and the witnesses are to be called out of Court, what does Holloway do? Why he declares in the open face of the Court, and my Lord had the humanity, as you recollect, Gentlemen, to say, that he remembered Mr. Holloway saying at the trial of Mr. Crossley, that he was subpoened, but did not know what he was to prove: Gentlemen, I may also observe, that Mr. Holloway is placed in a situation that may render it extremely inconvenient to the publick, if he is convicted; who will over venture to prosecute any man, or who will venture to be present when a compromise is going on? Is there any harm in supposing a man guilty, declared so by his country, and by the Judge, and by the arbitrator, whether he is guilty or not God knows; that must be left to his own conscience: has Mr. Crossley brought any one person to night to prove, that he asserted his innocence? Gentlemen, the man that is not brought before you, Snelling, is the only one that can be guilty of this charge, for he must have known it; but non constat Priddle did know it, and then he employs Priddle to bring that action; is Priddle proved to have fabricated that bill? Will any man say, that if Mr. Priddle puts in evidence, which is sufficient in the opinion of one of the greatest Judges, and of a dispassionate Jury to prove Mr. Crossley guilty? If Mr. Lowton's award is put into the scale, had not Mr. Priddle a right to believe, that Mr. Crossley was guilty? Gentlemen, I say, that even if you believe Mr. Crossley, you can have no colour or right to convict any of the defendants; for if you should be of opinion, that Holloway and Stephens knowing that this man was guilty, or believing him to be so, thought it a fit thing to get a sum of money out of him; that does not weigh one feather in the balance of this case; and I submit it to your consideration, whether you ought to consign men over to penalties,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180144"/>and drive them from society; when the question you are to try on your oath is, whether Holloway knew Mr. Crossley was innocent or not? and there is no man who has stated a circumstance, that can lead you to say, that they have any reason to believe Mr. Crossley was innocent: and if not, there is not a colour for treating them, as they have been loaded to night: Holloway appears to have been the friend of all parties, and as a compensation, Mr. Crossley thought fit to pay him, by giving him ten guineas: Mappleback is a man of some note, but as to Mr. Sambridge, he is the enemy of Holloway in his profession; and with respect to his evidence, it is very extraordinary, that Holloway should be so extremely unguarded, and so very foolish, as he represents him to be. Gentlemen, thus the case stands; if you are of opinion this bill was the actual authentic bill delivered into Court, then nobody is guilty of the conspiracy; for there never can be a conspiracy to prosecute a man that is guilty: The first thing to be shewn is, that he is innocent; and the next thing is, to shew that there was reasonable or probable cause to believe him guilty; suppose you should not believe that this bill was as I assert it to be, but that Snelling actually did give that order that Mr. Crossley states, that would be evidence to convict Snelling; but in order to convict any other of the prisoners, it must appear, that they knew that Snelling had given that order, Snelling was so far from telling them, that he made his affidavit in the face of the Court, got a verdict in that action, and there is not any one conversation in which you find Snelling communicating to any one of these defendants, that in fact he had no cause of action: If Snelling is guilty, and it was known to the other prisoners, they are connected most undoubtedly in the iniquity; but because a man is wicked enough to bring a false action, is his attorney to be indicted as a conspirator. There would be an end to the administration of justice, if that was the case.</p>
               <p>With respect to Holloway and Stephens, it does not appear that they ever were connected with the business, till after the trial in the King's Bench, and that trial was reasonable and probable cause for them to believe Mr. Crossley was guilty, even if they were proved to be prosecutors, which they are not. Gentlemen, I am extremely sorry you have been detained here so late at night; you have had a great deal of abuse thrown out against these persons; they cannot give evidence for one another; and there is an observation that will well become you to attend to; whenever you have reason to doubt the evidence of living witnesses, who come to speak under the influence of malice, even if they were of a higher description than Mr. Crossley is, whom I do not mean to impeach, that observation is this, that the safe resort of all Juries, is to have recourse to written evidence, which cannot lie, and which could not be fabricated. If you believe that written evidence, will not you be of opinion most clearly, that there is something foul and something dark in this business; and will not you see most clearly that the conspiracy turns the other way; that Mr. Crossley has conspired with other persons to ruin these men? Gentlemen, I shall trouble you no longer, only to remind you this is a severe prosecution, that the consequences are extremely heavy, and I am sure that you will never subject any of your fellow citizens to such consequences; when you must see that none of these defendants could possibly believe that Mr. Crossley was innocent, and that every thing they have done is perfectly legal, and nothing censurable in their conduct, except their wishing to prevent Mr. Crossley the disgrace of that prosecution.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Did not Mr. Crossley produce his books before you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the books? - I did, and from his books I judged on his case; I wish his books were here.</p>
               <p>Did you examine them fully and correctly? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he deliver any bills? - He did not deliver any; there were bills laid before me on the behalf of Mr. Snelling.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Crossley attend you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Had he an opportunity of seeing those bills that were delivered on the behalf of Mr. Snelling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There were bills delivered to you, purporting to be bills which Mr. Crossley had delivered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were those bills seen by Mr. Crossley? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Did he object to any of them, as spurious, or fabricated, or different from what he had delivered? - He did not; Mr. Crossley was heard, and produced his books, and I examined his books; he never complained of what I had done.</p>
               <p>Put in the award.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to the award; one single fact, that Mr. Lowton made an award, is all I conceive that can be stated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Which way did you make the award? - In favour of Mr. Snelling.</p>
               <p>Was it known to Mr. Snelling that the award was in his favour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To West. Did you examine the record in the cause of Snelling against Crossley? - I did.</p>
               <p>Look at that, and see whether that is a copy of the record? - It is.</p>
               <p>Was you in Court when that action was tried? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Lowton. You was examined in the course of this cause? - I was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mr. Priddle's being in Court? - I do, Priddle was attorney for Snelling; Priddle knew also of the award that I had made.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Snelling in the Court, during that time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine, to Mr. Crossley. Was Holloway in Court? - I believe he was; he told me he was a witness.</p>
               <p>Was Stephens in Court? - He was examined as a witness.</p>
               <p>To West. Did you make any copy of a bill in the possession of Mr. Priddle; is that your hand writing? - This is my hand writing; I copied it from this.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Did you employ Mr. Crossley to defend any action for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it yourself that employed him?</p>
               <p>Court. I think you are not at liberty to give evidence to prove Mr. Crossley's evidence false.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any bill of fees and disbursements from Mr. Crossley? - I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the date of it? - I cannot recollect the date.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the bill when you got it? - I put it by; he delivered the bill to me, and I put in a little drawer, in a bureau or book-case.</p>
               <p>What became of it afterwards? - I should think I did not part with it till I gave it to Mr. Priddle; I paid him several sums of money; he gave as good receipts as any man in the world.</p>
               <p>How many sums did you pay him? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How many receipts had you in all? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What sums did you pay him? - There was 10 l. and 12 l. there were more than two of 10 l. I think.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the receipts? - I put them by.</p>
               <p>Where are they? - I gave them to Priddle.</p>
               <p>Should you know the receipts if you saw them? - I think I should; they were receipts to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180146"/>Can you read? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Read that, is that one of the receipts that was given to you? - That certainly is one.</p>
               <p>Look at that? - That is not it; my receipts were worn very much; Mr. Priddle certainly has my receipts.</p>
               <p>Look at that? - These were mine.</p>
               <p>Were they as clean? - I am not clear, but I rather think that I folded them, if not in the common way as they sold them up, in four, and put them into a little drawer.</p>
               <p>Then they are not your receipts? - No Sir, not all, on my dying pillow, I could have the sacrament administered to me on that.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Crossley ever make any demand on you? - He never did, he always treated me like a gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure you folded them up, and put them in a drawer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you gave them to Mr. Priddle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not carry them about in your pockets? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long have you resumed the name of Brumidgham? - Ever since the year 1763.</p>
               <p>How are the accounts settled between you and Snelling? - They are not settled at all.</p>
               <p>How much is he in your debt now? - In May 1783, Mr. Crossley sued out a writ against Snelling at my suit, the sum is 400 l. and Snelling gave me this bond for 300 l. this man had owed me a great deal of money that was in his hands; Mr. Crossley knew that; Mr. Crossley was intimate with me a considerable time; he knew of my distresses; I am at work now for my daily bread.</p>

               <p>Your situation at present is rather an unhappy one, you are obliged to work for your living? - Yes Sir; at the time I applied to Mr. Crossley to get this money out of the hands of Mr. Snelling, my circumstances were better; I had then about 300 l. by me, which put me into the shop I have now; I had 300 l. by me when I gave Mr. Crossley those directions; Mr. Snelling lived in Bandy-leg-walk; he was down at Warley Common occasionally.</p>
               <p>Who kept the booth there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was not he there the better part of the week? - No, he was a man of business at that time.</p>
               <p>Did not you live with Mr. Snelling and pass for his wife? - Never in my life; Mr. Crossley never knew me but to be Mrs. Brumidgham.</p>
               <p>Did you never go by the name of Snelling? - Never by my consent or by my desire.</p>
               <p>Were you never called Mrs. Snelling? - I certainly have Sir, I never can account for what people call me; it never was my desire; all the business that I transacted in my life, was by the name of Brumidgham.</p>
               <p>How ever disagreeable it was to you, the fact was, that the people called you Mrs. Snelling? - Some persons did; they might probably.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand that the people, (however disagreeable to you) did call you Mrs. Snelling? - I certainly have been called Snelling, there is not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>In the publick way, at least the people use to take the liberty of calling you Mrs. Snelling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This for a considerable time? - I do not know Sir.</p>
               <p>The people used to take the liberty of calling you by this name for several years? - The people that did not know me; but nobody that knew me or any of my private concerns.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Did Mr. Crossley ever call you by the name of Snelling? - No Sir, never; he knew me to be Mrs. Brumidgham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How came you to load your pockets with all these papers and parchments? - I did not know but they might be wanted.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Snelling was ever impudent enough to say that he lived with you as his wife? - I do not know that he ever did say so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180147"/>Upon your oath? - I really cannot say what he might say, he was a man of business at that time.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he gave out to people, that you was his wife, and that he lived with you as such? - I do not think he ever did, or that he ever gave me the appellation of wife in his life.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose house did you live in? - I lived in Mr. Snelling's house; he was bail for me in the action when I was first arrested.</p>
               <p>How many more inmates were there? - Sometimes nobody, sometimes the house was let to other persons.</p>
               <p>How long did you live in this house? - I should suppose for six years; I was always Mrs. Brumidgham, with Mr. Crossley.</p>
               <p>How came it that Mr. Snelling should be possessed of the full half of your property, four hundred pounds? - The bond is but three, however.</p>
               <p>Well then, I will take it for three; how happened it that you should intrust so large a sum of money with Snelling? - I do not know, so it was; I had his note that had been for two or three years standing, and that writ was sued out by Mr. Crossley; he sued out that action for this note.</p>
               <p>Had you any husband alive at that time? - Yes Sir, I had; I knew where he was, and so did Mr. Crossley; he went to his sister, to subpoenea her upon the trial, and when the trial was at Westminster, Mr. Crossley knows that my husband came there, and eat beef-stakes and onions.</p>
               <p>Have you seen Snelling lately? - I believe it may be five or six weeks since I saw him.</p>
               <p>Did he ever tell you that he attended the trial of Mr. Crossley for perjury? - I was turned out of Court and every body else was.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear him say in Court, that you had lived with him as his wife? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he never tell you that he said so, afterwards? - No, Sir, he did not, indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you never ask him how Mr. Crossley became acquitted so easily? - I heard how it was in the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Mr. Crossley always called you by the name of Brumidgham? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Upon your oath, did not you desire Mr. Crossley to call you by the name of Snelling in particular company? - I do not think he ever did; I am sure he could not.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. How's, in Tower-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was an acquaintance of Snelling's as well as your's? - Yes, I never assumed any other name in my life.</p>
               <p>Snelling's business was country business; he never had any in town? - It was Snelling's house, and I was called Snelling in it, and so at the camp.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. Crossley to know any thing of your confinement at Warley-common? - Snelling came to town to him, and he came to me.</p>
               <p>When he wrote to you, he always addressed you by the name of Brumidgham? - He certainly did Sir.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Crossley know you was a woman of property? - Yes Sir, he soon became acquainted with it; he never asked me for money in his life but he had it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holloway to Alexander. When I saw you at Guildhall, when I was subpoened against Mr. Crossley, whether I did not express a little dislike to appear against Mr. Crossley, and whether I did not ask him how he could think I was his enemy? - What I know of what Mr. Holloway observed to me in the Hall was, says he, I came here on this business; but says he, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Alexander. Was you acquainted with Snelling? - I have seen him at Mr. Crossley's; this woman was backwards and forwards there; I knew her by the name of sometimes Snelling, and sometimes Brumidgham.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Master Hall, you have got a fine waistcoat on, we are dressed most of us for the term, which of the Courts do you go to from here? - None at all.</p>
               <p>That trade of bailing (as money is scarce) is pretty well knocked up with you, they tell me? - I never had any trade there.</p>
               <p>Do you know Westminster Hall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you swore yourself worth 2000 l. the Court of Common Pleas would not accept you for ten pounds? - I am not worth so little as two thousand pounds; then nor now, I am worth it; they did not accept of my bail.</p>
               <p>That strange Court of Common Pleas would not take your bail; the Court of Common Peas, insisted on having the money first paid, as it was so small a sum, do you swear that? - That was the answer that my Lord Chief Justice gave me.</p>
               <p>Perhaps his Lordship asked you where you came from, where did you describe yourself to live at that time? - I dare say it is five or six years ago since I attempted to justify for any body.</p>
               <p>By what description did you attempt to justify? - It was to oblige a person.</p>
               <p>By what description, how did you describe yourself? - For what I know I might live in the Kent road.</p>
               <p>But by what description did you attempt to justify bail for that ten pounds? - I cannot attempt to recollect that; I described myself as a salesman.</p>
               <p>Where do you keep your shop? - In the Borough, High-street; I am a butcher; I live there now.</p>
               <p>Where did you describe yourself to live? - It might be at Kilbar; it is so many years ago, I have forgot.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Nayler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has not he a judgement against you for six pounds? - I believe not; I do not suppose he has.</p>
               <p>Has not he had it for six years, and cannot get it, do you mean to swear that is not true? - I will not swear that, I did bail one Dr. Fitz Jo, at the request of a friend.</p>
               <p>Who was the gentleman that you attempted to bail for that ten pounds? - A Gentleman in the country, a person that asked me as a favour; I was to have nothing for my trouble; I was an hired bail.</p>
               <p>Holloway to Mappleback. Did not you meet me on the other side Westminster-bridge, and I then said to you, Mr. Mappleback, to my astonishment, I hear you are to be an evidence against me, and you took me by the hand and said, you knew nothing of it, and could prove nothing against me? - I was riding over Black-fryars-bridge, and Holloway called after me, and Mr. Sambidge was with him; says he, I have sixteen or twenty pounds to pay; oh! says he, what a damned thing it is, we cannot make it up; says he, here is Priddle in the coach; says I, how do you do Priddle; I went to Sambidge's to meet him, but he never came.</p>
               <p>Where was I to meet you? - At Mr. Sambidge's that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mappleback. Do you know Hall? - I know nothing of Hall, but he borrowed three guineas of me and I never got it again.</p>
               <p>Is Hall to be believed upon his out? - He is a man not worth two-pence; I can borrow 100 l. where he cannot borrow a penny.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, we have done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, to favour me at this early hour with attention, to a few observations in reply; I am sure I do not wish to take up more of your time than is absolutely necessary, but it is a duty which I owe to the publick as well as to myself and to make some remarks, not only upon the curious defence set up by my learned friend, but on the evidence given, both on the part of the prosecution and of the defendants; my learned friend set out with saying, that he was shocked and surprised at a great deal which he had heard in the course of this trial, and that he imagined you must have felt as he did, to hear such a charge against persons of the character and situation of his clients, or, as he very singularly and remarkably expressed and described them from those who sent him hither: But Gentlemen, the question will be, whether he has either by his observation, or by his evidence in any manner, impeached the testimony I have adduced, in support of that charge? he talks very much about the probable cause these defendants had for instituting this indictment; whether they had or not a probable cause, is a matter of fact as well as law, which you are the judges of, and upon which you must determine by your verdict; my learned friend stated, that I had not paid any compliments to the prosecutor of this indictment, I own I forbore, however ample the field might be; it was not my wish, and I trust never will be my practice to prejudice the minds of a Jury; I therefore left the case to its own merits, stating only that these defendants had been guilty of a foul conspiracy, to deprive Mr. Crossley of his character, by accusing him of perjury. I have now a right to say, (because it has been found in evidence, because a Jury of his country have decided it) that he was not guilty of the perjury in the indictment hatched by the defendants. And I am further warranted to assert, that so far as my learned friend endeavoured to insinuate imputations of perjury even on the evidence that has been called this day, you will by and by see on which side that evidence attached, and on which side that evidence deserves credit: My learned friend stated to you, that Mr. Crossley had altered the bills delivered to Mr. Priddle, and he pledged himself to you, that he would prove, that the bills delivered by Mr. Crossley to Mr. Snelling and Mrs. Brumidgham, were afterwards altered for the purpose of this prosecution; a little recollection will shew how malicious that accusation is; the bills were delivered to Mrs. Brumidgham, and from her they came to Mr. Priddle; Mr. Priddle delivered them to Mr. Lowes, and he brings them into Court; upon the face of the first bill, you will see that alteration does not exist in fact; of course then that assertion falls to the ground: But says my learned friend, there must be a forgery in this business, so there undoubtedly was, and there is no question on which side that forgery was committed; was it not committed by the defendants, or one of them and his associates, for the purpose of proving Mr. Crossley guilty? Mr. Erskine says, as to the bill, he Mr. Crossley said, he delivered the first to Snelling, and now proceeds Mr. Erskine; I will prove to you Gentlemen, that the first bill was delivered to Mrs. Brumidgham; has he proved that fact? far from it, for Mrs. Brumidgham does not recollect the date of the first bill delivered, again my learned friend says, what influence had Holloway over Priddle? Why says he, Mr. Holloway; was sebpoenad upon that trial? Is that the fact? Is Mr. Holloway that unwilling witness? Is he that man, forced contrary to his inclination to attend? He afterwards said so, it is true; but he told Mr. Sambidge himself, that it was a concerted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180150"/>scheme, it is therefore clearly part of the conspiracy itself, it is a part of the very fraud, that Mr. Holloway's name did not appear on the back of that indictment; my learned friend says, Stephens had no interest; then how came he on the back of the bill? How came his name there together with Mr. Snelling's and Mr. Priddle's? The question is, whether or no it has not been a conspiracy by these four persons, to prosecute Mr. Crossley, for this supposed this trumped up perjury? An observation has been made likewise, that Snelling is not here before you. Why, Gentlemen, a moment's consideration gives that observation quite a new aspect, for by Snelling not being here, we are precluded from giving in evidence before you, several conversations that would have explained the whole of that transaction; my learned friend concludes his speech, by attacking Mappleback, and stating, that Mr. Sambridge having quarrelled with Mr. Holloway, is a foe to him; Mr. Crossley he says also comes here a bitter foe to him; there is no imputation upon Mr. Crossley or Mr. Sambridge's character, yet they are both above the reach of malice, nor within the Pale of censure, but from the misfortune of ever having any communication with the defendants, yet they are to be attacked; my learned friend at the same time throwing such an imputation upon Mr. Lowes, a Barrister of high respect, and unimpeachable character, that if what he says is true, Mr. Lowes must be guilty of perjury; for he has sworn, that these very papers, which he received of Mr. Priddle, he returned to Priddle's hand; nobody altered them, and if they had been altered, he must have known it: Gentlemen, after this, Mr. Erskine proceeds to call his witnesses: The first evidence he produces is Mr. Lowton, and after having attempted by all his ingenuity to bring before you what he knew was not evidence, that is, what Lord Mansfield and Mr. Lowton had said at a different place; and having dwelt much on the indignation that noble peer expressed at the time, he tells you, that it had that effect on the mind of Priddle, as to induce him to believe, that Mr. Crossley had been guilty of perjury; suppose it had, should they on a surmise, prefer an indictment against Mr. Crossley, without any enquiry into the transaction? But is that the case? Had it that effect on their minds? Were they impressed with any idea that he had been guilty of perjury? Did they take up that idea immediately and prefer an indictment? No, they staid to attempt to make an advantage of Mr. Crossley; they had an eye to Mr. Crossley's property; they endeavoured to frighten him; was it from the motive of what they heard in the Court? No, it was for the purpose of getting money, that he was a good milch cow, and from him they would get hundreds: that was their motive, it is proved in evidence by several witnesses, that the defendant said, that if Mr. Crossley would come down handsome, they themselves would not go on with the prosecution; shall they then shelter themselves by what was said in a Court of Justice, when that learned Judge was misled by those very papers which Holloway boasted had only been fabricated seven days? Gentlemen, whatever Mr. Holloway may express now, I wish he had felt a little before he had done it: was Mr. Crossley mistaken in the information he received from Mr. Snelling? What passed in company with Mr. Alexander, a man of reputation, a man of character? Snelling was angry with Crossley, because he wanted to put an end to the whole transaction, but Mr. Crossley did not expect false bills to be produced against him; therefore Mr. Alexander did not attend that trial: Gentlemen, when you consider what is proved in evidence, of Holloway's boasting the day after that trial, and laughing at Crossley, and calling him a fool, because he did not know his own hand writing, but saying to Mr. Sambridge, that he was a good milch cow, that he had had two ten pounds, and would have more of him; you cannot suppose for a moment, that Holloway ever believed Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180151"/>Crossley was guilty of the perjury? So far from it, that he admits that the cause of this prosecution was to have money; on but says Mr. Erskine, you never saw Holloway's name till after that trial; why who was the go-between? Who was at the Leaping Bar? Who went to Mr. Lowes's? and who attended at the Mitre when the money was paid? - Holloway and Priddle. Was there no connection then? But pray was there no connection between them? Why how came all these people at the trial, and when the bill is preferred, Holloway boasts, that he had instructed the witnesses what to say? that Priddle, on consultation with him, previous to the indictment being preferred, thought it was better to leave him out of the bill; and as to Stephens, why they all go together to consult Priddle, and Priddle and Stephens go out together; and when they come in again, says Stephens, by God it shall not be settled under 200 l. and if the Jury find a bill of indictment, then we will have 500 l.? Did he do this for the sake of justice? No. Gentlemen, is there a single witness to prove that at any one time they ever prosessed to believe that Mr. Crossley was guilty? Did Snelling himself believe that affidavit to be false, because that is an argument made use of; for if he had believed it, then he had a probable cause for the prosecution of Mr. Crossley: Could he believe it? it is inconsistent with his conversation throughout the whole transaction; and when they all separately wished to make it up; nay even Snelling himself wanted to make it up; he says he is urged on by Holloway and Priddle; Stephens says, when Priddle wants him to be bail for a man of the name of Grant; no, says he, he shall not; I will do nothing for him, unless you indict Crossley; says he, we shall get a thousand out of him; he has money, and will not have the scandal of a trial: Well but my learned friend says, Mrs.

             is to be a very material witness in this business; she is to prove that those receipts are not the receipis she received from Crossley; and an observation is made that two of the bills are written on the same paper; that is likely enough, and Priddle has ingenuity enough to do that; now it seems to me that the making the two edges meet is not a very difficult thing; supposing two pieces of paper, and these are taken together, laid level, and cut down with a knife, and then notch them a little, and they will match pretty near together; but if by accident they should, is that sufficient for you to impute perjury to Mr. Lowes? - What will you say to Priddle applying to Mr. Lowes to get these papers; and on receiving them from him, looks them over and says they are right; if he meant fair, Priddle should have preferred his indictment first, and given Mr. Lowes notice to produce the bills; no, but he threatens Mr. Lowes to move the Court of King's Bench against him; and at last forces Mr. Lowes to give up the bills; What is Mr. Crossley's conduct, but the conduct of a very innocent man; says he, give them to him; but Mr. Lowes had the precaution to take copies of those bills before they were delivered, knowing the man he had to deal with; therefore it is clear that these bills came back into the possession of Priddle, for him to make any alteration he thought proper in; and with respect to Mr. Crossley knowing Mrs. Brumidgham's name too, that was perfectly clear; that was proved before, because Mr. Crossley is employed on the behalf of Mr. Snelling, and pleads that she is a married woman, and married to a man of the name of Brumidgham, and therefore is not liable to the debt; at last it did come out that many people called her Snelling; and she confirms Mr. Crossley in another part of the story, that he went to Warley Common to bail her. The next evidence is a curious one, Mr Hall, the butcher; and Gentlemen, you know, when a debt is to small as 10 l. few enquiries are made into the ability of the person that becomes bail; but I have a right to say that he was not worth 2000 l. If the Court thought fit to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180152"/>reject him for 10 l. and I think you are of opinion that not much credit is to be paid to such witnesses. The next witness has proved just nothing at all; but the service of a subpoena. Now, Gentlemen, as you have heard the evidence of Mrs. Brumidgham, of Mr. Lowton, of Mr. Hall, I have a right to ask you is there any thing in their testimony that alters the case I opened at first? if there is not, you have my learned friend's opinion, that the charge is so strong against the defendants as to convict them; I need not call a better witness than Mr. Erskine himself; for if you lay Mr. Crossley's evidence intirely out of the case, you then have the evidence of Mappleback; if you believe him, whom my learned friend admits to be a man of undoubted character, that is sufficient to convict them. Damn him, says Holloway, I will do him over, by God, I will indict him; we shall get 1000 l. out of him; you know I was at the making the agreement; he is a good milch cow; I have got 20 l. out of him already: that was before the indictment was found; and after the bill is found, his language is, that bill is found, damn him we will do him up, if he does not come down: are you acquainted, Mr. Mappleback, with Crossley? No, he was a perfect stranger, says Priddle to Mappleback, (who like a good-natured man wishes he could put an end to this business) says Priddle, you shall give 300 l. (and he said he would bo damned it he took less) then they came to 200 l. Holloway less diligent in his part of the scene, urges Crossley, and argues; this indictment will be the ruin of you! And with respect to the testimony of Mr. Mappleback, his son married Priddle's daughter: what connection there may be, I cannot say; but if you believe the evidence, it is sufficient to convict all the three defendants; for do they pretend at any one time that they believed the story of the perjury to be true, and that it was for the sake of justice? no, give me my securities and 300 l. and here is an end of the whole transaction. But Gentlemen, when Mr. Sambridge comes to give his evidence, be opens such a scene against Mr. Holloway, that it makes me shudder to think there is such a person, so vile a miscreant, such a disgrace to human nature, and the honor of mankind as Holloway, to be found in the world; and I have a right to say what you must be convinced of, that Mr. Sambridge comes here to give his testimony as an honest man; and has delivered it with much steadiness, eandour and impartiality. With respect to Stephens; why in the presence of Mr. Lowes, Stephens says, that he would find money to prosecute. Gentlemen, I have hastily run over the heads of the evidence, and I must make this observation to you, that if you believe the testimony on the part of the prosecution, in point of law, all three of the defendants are guilty of the conspiracy: four men conspiring together to indict another, unless they have good and probable cause, which must be proved to you by evidence, and legal evidence; not by suspicion, not by surmise; I say you must find them guilty: the only way you can judge of their mind and intentions is from their conduct at the time of the first trial for the malicious arrest; they are all there, and Mr. Erskine makes it an argument in favour of the prisoners; but it convinces me that they had then some plan in contemplation to attack or ruin Mr. Crossly; which plan, I say, rests in their breasts, and they all meet there for the purpose of carrying it on. What is their conduct afterwards? Why they discover the fraud to Sambridge, who they thought was their friend, and that long before the bill was found. Gentlemen, had these defendants any cause to say that this Mr. Crossley has committed the crime of perjury. A Jury of his country have acquitted him of that charge; they thought the charge foul, and these men knew it to be so, better they came before a Court of Justice. These men have evaded the justice of their country, for a long time; but justice though slow, is sure, and I trust the time is now come when it has overtaken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180153"/>them; when they by their own folly have discovered their iniquity, and that the measure of their iniquities is now full; it is high time that a stop should be but to their niquity, for the measure of it is now running over: God knows who they may apply to next, whether some of you Gentlemen, or even my laarned friend himself, may not be the subject of a foul conspiracy, conducted by men who are so artful, so hackneyed in the ways of wickedness that nothing could resist them; well then might Mr. Crossley be frightened and shudder at the idea of the hands he had got into; and it has been made an argument, to prove Mr. Crossley's guilt; because he was silent when these false papers were produced in a Court of Justice. Now I confess it is the conduct of any honest man, to hold down his head, and say, good God! I am a ruined man; here is a forgery against me; and this forgery so executed, I cannot distinguish it from reality; why Gentlemen, perjury is the next step to forgery, and I do not wonder Mr. Crossley should say, if my property is not worth having, my life they will have next: he suspected forgery from the evidence he heard in Court, but the next day he had full proof of the transaction from the mouth of Holloway himself; and because Mr. Crossley did not instantly bring them to justice, it is now to be made an argument against him, that he had not resolution enough to combat it: it was enough to strike any man dumb; it did strike Mr. Crossley dumb; and Mr. Erskine says, he never moved for a new trial; but what advantage could he have had from a new trial? he had no evidence of the fraud, but that man; with what evidence therefore could he come before the Court; if they got the first verdict by forgery, they would have kept that verdict by perjury; and Mr. Crossley would have found himself in a situation to make an affidavit, that would be contradicted by four men in Court, who had the bills in their power. Gentlemen, you will consider therefore the whole of this case; I am sure you will exercise your judgements, and determine impartially; I have to lament at this late hour, it should fall to me to make a reply in a case of such length; and having been in Court so early as I was, I have done it very imperfectly; but I have observed your great attention to the witnesses who have been examined, and you will have it summed up to you by the learned Judge. I entrust the case of Mr. Crossley, therefore in your hands; and when I say, I entrust his case, I also entrust his honour, his character, and his reputation in your hands: I have a right to demand for him the justice of his country, as my learned friend had on the part of the defendants; if you believe the evidence on the part of the prosecution, Mr. Crossley has a right to your verdict; his character is as dear to him as the defendants can be: all I wish for him is, that you would do to him as you would be done by; if you think he deserves redress; if you think he is an injured man, as I am conviced he is, by a foul conspiracy of these three men now before you, that you will give him that redress by your verdict. Gentlemen, I leave his cause in your hands, being fully satisfied that justice will be done.</p>

               <p>Mr. Holloway. My Lord and Gentletlemen, would you permit me to say a few words, I must confess that after what I have heard to night, it is desirable to me that my existence might end this night; for in my life, I never heard so much before, and I hope I never shall again: I find my Counsel has omitted reading Mr. Crossley's former letter, wherein he calls me his friend, and thanks me for my attention to this perjury business; I now tell it before Mr. Crossley, that the very evening of the trial, after Lord Mansfield had expressed the words, you have heard; Mr. Crossley came to me and said, you have influence over Priddle, I feel my situation, and I fear I never shall get the better of it; we have had several meetings from the time that these papers were deposited in the hands of Mr. Lowes for Crossley's quiet and safe, from that hour till the hour I was subpoened, I never knew that Mr. Crossley was indicted;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180154"/>I never told Mr. Sambridge any of the words that he has made use of; nor did I ever speak with Mappleback till I met him over the bridge, and asked him what he could have to say to me: I wish Mr. Crossley still would do me a little justice; I think Mr. Sambridge would relent of the foul story he has told, not one sylable is true, as God shall judge me.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the three prisoners are indicted for a conspiracy, for falsly, and without probable cause to indict; and in pursuance of that conspiracy indicting and prosecuting

            , one of the conspirators to bail, for the sum of 100 l. and for causing in consequence of that conspiracy, Mr. Crossley to be falsly and without probable cause, indicted for that offence: It is necessary in this case to prove first, that at least two of the persons contained in this indictment, are guilty of the charge; because the indictment, stating it to be the result of conspiracy and combination; the law as well as common sense, says, that the offence cannot be committed by a single person, and therefore, one person alone, cannot be convicted of a conspiracy; but I conceive the law to be, that where more persons than one are indicted for a conspiracy, though some of them are absent and not on their trial at the time; if the Jury are satisfied that any one of the prisoners at the bar, conspired either with their fellow prisoners, or with an absent person, that one may be found guilty. It is necessary to support this charge, not only that the indictment should have been founded upon insufficient ground, which it is proved to be by the acquital of Mr. Crossley; but it is necessary that the Jury should be satisfied, that at the time of confederating together, the defendants had no reasonable or probable cause to believe, that the charge was well founded at the time, though it might appear to be otherwise. If it is done corruptly, the law considers that as maliciously; whatever indictment is prosecuted against a party for any other purpose, than that of publick justice, whether personal malice or resentment, or from the corrupt purpose of making use of the weapons of the law, that is considered as a malicious prosecution: but in this particular instance of an indictment for a conspiracy to prosecute without probable cause; it is not sufficient in point of law, that even the strongest degree of malice should be clearly proved, provided the defendants can shew, that they had a probable cause for doing that which they did, even on a malicious motive; so that though you should be satisfied that the defendants were actuated by malice, or the corrupt view of acquiring money to themselves; yet if they can satisfy your minds, that they had a reasonable ground to believe themselves at the time, that Mr. Crossley was guilty of this offence, though they made a corrupt use of belief; they are not guilty of the crime charged in the present indictment: that I conceive is the state of the law on the question, you will therefore attend to the evidence as applied to that law, and observe whether all the points are made out necessary to prove this charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Stephen's. I hope your Lordship will consider me; I have a mother eighty years old, and a wife and five small children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Holloway. I submit to the Court; I do assure your Lordship, that however I may appear culpable as I here stand; I stand the most dreadful example that ever fell to revenge, and the time is at no great distance when it will so appear; I can say, that this is the first time, that that ever my enemies can say, I was brought to trial or convicted; and, in the courts where I practiced, I never yet, I believe, had a motion made against me; if I had known the evidence that would have been preferred against me, I could have brought such evidence, some of whom would not have been strangers to your Lordship; that would have proved my innocence; I beg leave to observe, that I have laboured under a scene of oppression for some time; I have been convicted now on the evidence of Sambridge and Crossley chiefly; this is only one out of nine indictments preferred against me; bills in chancery, articles of peace; Sambridge indicted me for perjury, when I never took an oath; Mr. Sambridge arrested me for 1000 l. and never proceeded against me from that hour to this, but if I would forego an indictment against him, then he would give me a general release; last night that ever was he sent for me about making up this busisiness, and unfortunately, it did not strike me again, or I could have brought people into court that could have detected him in the falsehood, which he asserted while he stood here. My Lord, under the unhappy circumstances I now am, with an aged father to keep, and a large family; I only intreat, that your Lordship will be as mild as possible in the sentence; for here I stand; and I avow to God and man, I would rather have been capitally convicted, than to lay in prison, or to suffer any ignominious punishment, that I dare not go abroad afterwards; My Lords, circumstanced as I am, I believe it is too late to appeal to Mr. Crossley; but the money that was talked of; (for I will, at this dreadful moment, once more appeal to him the 15 l. he gave me by the note, as stated by Mr. Lowes, was strictly true, but it was fifteen pounds out of thirty, which he took from me in the moment of distress; and this letter would have proved it: with respect to Mr. Sambridge, your Lordship knows the bickerings there has been between us; he took me in execution for 160 l. and he invited me to go to supper; Crossley was there; he took me in execution again, instead of settling the matter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Priddle. For my own part I feel myself no way affected, for I came here with as much confidence and assurance, that we should go off, in a very little while, with great honour; but Mr. Crossley and Mr. Sambidge, whom I do not know I ever saw him before, have got the better of us; I hope your Lordship will take our sentence into consideration.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Holloway. A man in another situation is not deprived of his bread, after he has suffered the sentence of a conviction of this kind; but the only consolation I have, is; if I out-live the punishment I have to undergo, I shall make it appear to your Lordship, how unjust and wicked a prosecution this is; how well it has been managed, the gentlemen who have managed it best know.</p>
