I found the prisoner had been there, drinking bumbo, and had changed a guinea; this was the day before he was taken; and after that, he wanted more gold to be changed. I got a warrant, and took him up, on suspicion: I charged him with the robbery, and he confessed it directly, before Mr. Berry: he was shewed a key that was taken out of his pocket: he said that was the key with which he opened the drawer; he had lived with my mother, who kept the house before me: I have been in the house about nine months; he knew the house all over. He gave to me this silver watch and silver shoe-buckles (producing them); and told me in Justice Berry's house, that my money paid for them, in redeeming them out of pawn, which was 46 s.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did he say he had taken?</p>
               <p>Paine. He said in my hearing he had taken some money, but he could not tell how much.</p>

The prisoner was at my house the day the prosecutor missed his money; he came with two young fellows; they had some brandy and water; he gave two women two penny drams. After that, he wanted change for a guinea; we changed it; he had half a guinea, a quarter, and the rest in silver. After that, he wanted the half guinea to be changed, and also the quarter; he was a little fuddled: I desired him to go to sleep. As he was sitting at the bar, Mr. Paine's apprentice came near the door, and he desired it to be shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Garret. This was at noon time of the day: he got the half guinea changed, he went away: Mr. Paine came to me the next morning, and I told him as he has mentioned; he got a warrant, and took the prisoner up: we took him to Justice Berry; the justice's clerk desired me to see what he had about him: I found this key in his right hand breeches pocket, and found also 2 l. 2 s. 9 d. upon him. I said, I am certain this is Mr. Paine's money. He said, give me the key, and I will pay Mr. Paine, and make it up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how much money he had taken?</p>
               <p>Garret. No, he did not. All the way we went along to prison, he cried, and begged I would deliver him the key, and he would pay Mr. Paine, and make it up with him. I thought I had no right to deliver back such a key as this; (producing a proper pick-lock key).</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say from what place he had taken the money?</p>
               <p>Garret. No, he did not. He owned to me the next day, when I went to see him, that he had no confederates in it; but that he made the key himself, by filing the wards out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Garret. He is a <rs id="t17641017-2-deflabel10" type="occupation">shipwright</rs>

I was talking of my loss at Leaden-hall, and was told there had been a goose sold for 3 s. which was worth upwards of 4 s. I went and looked at it, and found it a goose worth 4 s. 6 d. at Leaden-hall market; it was a town-fed goose, and was foul killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it?</p>
               <p>Laycock. I found it in St. Catharine's: the person said he bought it of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by being foul killed?</p>
               <p>Laycock. It had had its throat cut, and was thrown into a sack; the blood was congealed in it: in the manner it was killed, it appeared to be a stolen goose.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170004"/>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Laycock. I am a goose-seeder. I went and searched the prisoner's house, and found the two ends of goose wings: (produced in court): they exactly fit to the wings. I am sure they were cut off from that goose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the goose in its feathers?</p>
               <p>Laycock. It was out of the feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish with certainty between a country goose, and a town fed goose.</p>
               <p>Laycock. There is as much difference between the one and the other, as between a piece of superfine cloth, and other common cloth; they cannot feed a goose in the country as we can here.</p>

               <p>I had been up the Strand, and returning back, I met a young woman that I keep company with, she is a woman of the town. I came down as far as Butcher row with her, and went in at the Thatch'd-house: I gave her part of a pint of beer: she told me, a young man that she used to live with, was gone to sea, and she had a watch of his in pawn, that I might have, if I would fetch it out: she asked me for the money to fetch it out, and I gave it her. I was for going with her to the pawnbroker, being afraid to trust her with the money, but she would not let me go with her. I gave her a guinea and a half, and 5 s. she gave the guinea and half, and put the rest in her pocket. In a day or two after, I had occasion for money, so I went to pawn it, and the man stopt it. I went in search of her and the young fellow, but could not hear any thing of them. The pawnbroker knows I offered it in my own name, that shows I did not steal it.</p>
               <p>Ashbener. He said his name was Smith, and it was his own; that he had had it some time. I asked him how many months he had had it? he said, he had had it some months. After that, he said, he had it of a young woman, whom he kept company with a few days ago.</p>

There were a parcel of people assembled together to see my Lord Mayor; I had not stood there above five minutes, before I found somebody taking my watch out of my pocket; I put my hand down, and it was very near out; the prisoner was standing with his face towards me. I looked round, left I should accuse him wrongfully, and saw no other person could possibly take it out but him, their backs were towards me: he seeing me put my hand down, turned away from me, and was gone for five or six minutes: then he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170005"/> came again and stood as before, just before me. I had a notion he would attempt it a second time, and was desirous of detecting him. I took notice of all the people, and saw it was impossible, as they stood, for any to take it but the prisoner; he had his hand down just by my fob: I found my watch move again in my pocket, he gave me a shove with his arm: I put my hand down immediately, and said my watch was gone; he had it in his right hand; I catched hold of his left hand; there was a man stood behind him; I was a little fearful he should deliver it to him. I took hold of that man, and immediately my watch fell to the ground, just by the prisoner's foot; the prisoner desired me to say no more about it, but to go into a house, and he would speak to me about it: I gave the constable charge of him immediately, and he was taken to Guildhall; there he was examined.</p>

               <p>Proudfoot. I saw the watch moving just at his toe, and heard it fall; but did not see it drop out of his hand; it was impossible it should fall from any body else.</p>

I went to buy some more, in order to go to work: I went to an ironmonger, in order to buy a bag; there I found some old iron in a scale; there were two pieces of it, that I could swear to be part of the iron I lost. I was there told, they bought it of a woman; and, by enquiring, found it was sent by the prisoner. He was taken up: at one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170006"/> time, he said he had the iron at Kentish-Town; at another time, said, he found it in Golden-lane; that is near my shop: I found, where I deal in old iron, with Napper and Pelham, 12 pounds weight of old iron, some part of that I can swear to, (produced in court, and deposed to) which they had from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Spelman. He did not speak a word: he came in about half an hour after, of his own accord, and the constable secured him. When I spoke to him, he threw the bottle down and broke it; here are some of the pieces: (producing part of a glass bottle.) the constable found two other bottles of wine in the coal-hole after he had made his escape; they are full of red port.

When he could not, he went down on his knees, and said, he had never been guilty of the like before: here is a letter they sent by a girl; I know it to be Warren's hand writing.

               <p>I was going along the key, and went into this house, and to the necessary to ease myself; there was Warren; I staid till he came out; I turned myself round, and there lay a parcel of sugar: just as he came out, Mr. Squires and Mr. James came in upon us, and said, What, have we catched you? we said, in what? in taking sugar, they said. I said, the sugar does not belong to me; I know nothing of it: they sent for a constable, and took us away: I know no more of it, than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Warren's Defence.</p>
               <p>I being in the necessary before him, he waited my coming out: this sugar lay in the same place; we both wondered who it belonged to. I am willing to suffer the law, if they can swear I brought any sugar out of the buildings: he says I threw my share into the vault; it is no such thing.</p>

               <p>Cotton. There were delivered in about thirtyfive thousand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wagg. On the 4th of this instant, one of the porters told me this warehouse was broke open. The two overseers belonging to the company's private trade sent to me, to go down to see how it was: I went, and saw the staples were drawn, and put in again; one was fast, and the other loose in the holes. I examined 400 of the fine walking-canes, which I marked with my own mark, and found about fifteen of them were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your mark?</p>
               <p>Wagg. It is the letter G. on the top joint of the cane; there were eight others taken out of another parcel, not marked. The next day, I went to 'Change, and went to Mr. Forset, that keeps a cane-shop, in Leadenhall-street; I acquainted his journeyman of what was lost, and desired, if any were brought, to stop them. In about an hour after, a young man came to our house, and told me there had been a man there with two canes, in order to sell them; and that he said he had twenty more, and upwards, and had left word, if they would come to the Horshoe and Magpye, a public-house, in Fetter-lane, he would go with them to a house in that neighbourhood, where they were. I went to that public-house, and the prisoner was there, and had the two canes in his hand: I examined the two canes, and found my mark upon one of them. I desired the young man to go with him, and buy the canes at any rate, in order to bring them to the public-house where I was, to pay for them: the young man went, and bought them at half a guinea a cane: I had a constable and a friend of mine ready; the young man brought the canes and prisoner; I looked at the canes; he seemed very uneasy, and said, if I did not like them. he would take them back again I said, neither he nor the canes should go back: there were 24 canes: he said, his sister kept one. where they were lodged: (produced in court.) Here are fifteen of them have my mark upon them. I asked him where he got them? he said, he had some of the lumpers, and some he bought of the Blacks: he told me he was a labourer at Mr. Perry's wharf. Some of these canes are Captain

               <p>Q. Is he bound over?</p>
               <p>Waldron. He is. Upon his information, I charged the constable with the prisoner, for stealing quantities of soles and top leather: we had a search-warrant to search the house of Ross; they live together: they both pleaded ignorance, and said they had no leather but what was their own, which they bought at the Black Prince, in Old Bedlam. We found a parcel of leather secreted in a garret, up three pair of stairs, and locked up in a cupboard; they work below: they are what we call chamber-masters and coblers: they make and mend shoes. (A parcel of leather produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the leather?</p>
               <p>Waldron. We found it a fortnight ago to-day. When I first took them up, they said they knew nothing of me, nor my apprentice neither. I verily believe the whole of this leather to be mine; here is a pair of top-pieces with my own handwriting upon them. When the old man was taxed with it before the alderman, he said, he knew some of it was mine, but not all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account how he knew it to be yours?</p>
               <p>Waldron. No, he did not.

               <p>Waldron. The old man was going on with his confession, but he was stopped by the alderman, who said, it was a thing not desired of a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise Shadwell should have mercy, if he would confess?</p>
               <p>Waldron. No, I did not; nor nobody else, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holder. I was present at Guildhall, when this confession of Shadwell's was taken by Alderman Kite; it was read over to him before he signed it; I saw Sir Robert sign his name, and the prisoner also. The two Ross's were asked some questions; the old man was going to speak, but the alderman thought he could say nothing that would clear him, he said, he did not want him to say any thing to accuse himself. The old man said, he believed some part of the leather was Mr. Waldron's; he owned he had connections with the boy; that he call'd to see him frequently, and the boy said he frequently called to see them. The alderman thought the old man's confession might proceed from ignorance, so gave him warning.</p>

I went to Ross's with a search-warrant, that day fortnight, at almost seven at night; they were both at home: I said I was come to search the house for some leather, the property of the gentleman with me. Andrew told me he had no leather in the house, and knew nothing of any, but what was there below. I took up several pieces, and asked Mr. Waldron if they were his? he said, he could not swear they were: he said he was informed there were some up stairs; they both said there was none above. I asked them if there were any concealed any where? they said they knew of none. Then we went up stairs, in order to search, into the room where William lies; after seeing no appearance of leather, I asked what was in some trunks that were locked up? William said they did not belong to him, but to a lodger, who was gone to Scotland. Mr. Waldron said I must search farther, but it being at that time of night, I refused to break open the house, as the warrant expressed to search in the day-time. I said to

Said I, we must go up stairs: I then asked young Ross, (who was partly undressed, and going to bed) if he could not procure me the key of those trunks? he said, he could not: there was a closet by the bedside; he said, that did not belong to him. Upon that, I wrenched the door open, and found a great quantity of leather, 53 pair of soles, and 76 or 86 fore-pieces. I asked him if he knew any thing of them? he said, nothing at all. I said, you must put your things on, and must go to the Compter; he said, he did not follow the shoe-making business, but rather followed portering, and opening shops for people, and hoped we would not take him away. We put the leather into a sack, and took him to Wood-street-compter; his father was in the Poultry-compter. The next day we had an examination before Mr. Alderman Kite:

               <p>Andrew's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never bought a bit of leather of this boy in my life: I had none of him, only to make soles for him, and mend his shoes; he never gave any to me, neither did I ever give him a farthing. Mr. M'Cloud has done all this out of spite.</p>
               <p>William's Defence.</p>

I first went and knocked at the door; the girl said, where I had been, I might go again: then I went to the Seven Stars and Crown, and told the prisoner, that Nan would not let me in: he went along with me; she let us in: I went to bed, and hung my watch up by the mantle-piece: all the doors and windows were fast at that time; when he went out, I got up, and bolted the door after him; this was at past twelve o'clock. The next morning I missed my watch, and the window was broke. About eleven the next day, the prisoner sent for me at the Black Horse in Lemon-street, and said, Harry, how could Nan be so cruel, as to go to my mother about your watch? if you had staid two or three days, perhaps you might have heard of it.</p>

I said, it is half an hour after: then he went away, and Davis fastened the door after him: after that, when he was in a little dose, I heard a rustle at the window: I saw Chapman come to the bed-side, and snatch the watch, and go out at the window: my candle was out, but I always leave a good fire a-light. In the morning I went to the prisoner's mother, and brought it in with a joke: I asked her what time he came home? she said, about ten o'clock: I said, it was about half an hour after twelve when he went from my house: I said he has taken my Harry's watch: he owned to the taking the watch to me, but I have no witnesses of it.</p>

I took out my watch, and said, about one o'clock; she took up the watch, and went into a back-room: presently came a soldier and hit me two blows: I went down stairs; there the soldier ill-used me. I asked for my watch; the prisoner ran out at the door, and I after her; she escaped from me two or three times; she got into an alley, I closely pursued her; she called out watch; a watchman came and took her to the watch-house; then I desired the watch might be returned to me; she denied very strongly having it: I went with the constable to the door; the same soldier came and opened it; we went in; the watch could not be found; we took the soldier to the watch-house; then she gave the keys to the watchman, and the watchman went and fetched the watch; (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not give me the watch upon some consideration?</p>
               <p>Lemonere. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. I am constable: on the 6th of October, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house: as far as I could understand, the prosecutor had lost his watch; he was in a great flurry; he said he lived in Hedge-Lane; a watchman went there, and brought this woman that now interprets; he said he could find the house out where he was rob'd; I took the beadle and a watchman; he conducted us into Swan Yard; he ran up some steps, and knocked two or three violent raps at the door; a soldier came and opened the door; the prosecutor said, that was the man that beat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170017"/> him down the steps: I asked him where the woman had been? he said, down stairs; I went and examined below, but could find no watch: in the corner of the parlour there stood a stick, which the prosecutor said was his: I brought the soldier to the watch-house; we talked to her for an hour and a half before she would tell where the watch was; she said she knew nothing of it: I told her, as it was the first night I ever watched, I would discharge her if I could, if she would tell where it was; she said, if I would let her go home, she would tell me where it was: she gave the soldier the key, and said it was in the second or third drawer, where it was found. The Justice discharged the soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was very dry and thirsty; I went in at the Globe Tavern to get a gill of wine: as I was tucking my gown up to go home, this gentleman came out after me; he took hold of me, and pull'd me about; I could not get rid of him; I asked him what he wanted with me? he asked me if I would go to cushee? [to bed] I said I did not know what he meant; he insisted on my going to drink with him; I went in at the Star-Inn; he call'd for a pint of porter; I said I could not drink porter; he call'd for some other liquor; I said I never drink any spirituous liquors; then he call'd for some wine for me, and asked if he could have a bed that night? the waiter told him he must pay two shillings for it; he said something else, but I did not understand it. The mistress of the house said, Nancy, I would have you go home: when I got up to go away, he flung down the money for the beer and wine, and followed me; when I got to my own lodging, I said, Sir, you can't stay here all night: he pulled out his watch, and said he had no money: said I, then how could you go to a house and ask for a bed for you and me. if you have no money: he said he would leave his watch for half a guinea till morning; after he had done what he wanted to do, then he wanted his watch, and made a noise for it: my husband hearing him, came and put us both out of the house together: after that he was sociable again.</p>
               <p>Q. to constable. Is the soldier the prisoner's husband?</p>
               <p>Constable. The soldier owned de did live with her, but she was not his wife.</p>

Some of the bottles were marked at the bottom, with the mark of the Jerusalem tavern, where we have all our wine.

            . On the 18th of July, there was an advertisement in the news-paper, setting forth, that a man might get an hundred a year, by advancing 40 l. and the person to apply to the Golden Leg, in Long-acre. I went there: there was Muckle, and the prisoner Wood: it was a good while before they would admit me into the room. I asked them, how they could make it appear, that I should get an hundred a year? they said. they would make it appear, or return me my money again. I said, how is it? they said, as the advertisement expresses it. They wanted a partner in an employment, and by his advancing 40 l. as a premium, it would bring them in an hundred per annum, and near half his time to spare; none but principals need apply. and the money ready. I told them, I could not advance the money myself, but I had a friend would lend me a little money: they said, they would go with me to him; I went, but he was not at home. I went back again in about half an hour after, and met my friend, and told him what I had been about; he said, if you engage with them, they are the biggest villains in London, and you will be ruined. I went and told them I could not raise the money, and so could not be engaged: they shook hands with me, and I went back. Three days after, being the 21st of July, there came Muckle, Wood, and another man, to the end of Warwick-court, where I was: they said to me, do you know this man? no, said I, I never saw him before: said they, we have a note against you for 10 l. and you must pay it, or go to gaol. Said I, I made no agreement with you, and I owe you nothing. They were for taking me away, but I begged of them to let me go into a publick-house, and we went into the Griffin, in Holborn. They shewed me a note; my name was in it: I could not deny the name; said I, you are villains, and laid hold of Muckle; Wood and the other ran away; I secured Muckle, with the assistance of the landlord of the house and another person. They said, they had a writ against me, and were going to drag me to gaol. Here is the note. It is read to this purport:</p>

               <p>Here is another paper which we found upon Muckle. (Producing half a sheet, with a piece of the lower corner on the right hand taken off, about half the breadth, and about four inches deep).</p>
               <p>Edwards. The paper they got me to write my name to, was about the size of this; it was compleat, and I signed no other: they said nothing to me about a promissory note. (The paper inspected. It appeared to be a memorandum of an agreement of a partnership, where Wood and Muckle were to be partners with the person taken in.) They told me the trade was in the brokery way: they drew up a rough draught, as they called it, and I wrote my name at the bottom; if this is the paper, I wrote on that part that is wanting: Wood and Muckle's names were above mine.</p>

               <p>Keyo. I heard them talk of buying and selling of goods, and taking and letting chandler's-shops, and publick-houses. I saw Muckle writing a paper; after he wrote it, he handed it to Mr. Edwards; he put his hand in his waistcoat-pocket, and took out his spectacles and read it: after which, he said it is all well, or all right, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him write any thing?</p>
               <p>Keyo. I saw him write his name at the bottom of the paper.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any other names to it?</p>
               <p>Keyo. I can't say whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the size of the paper.</p>
               <p>Keyo. It was larger than this promissory note, I really think it was the size of half a sheet of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How many papers did you sign your name to?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I signed my name to only one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any notice taken about a forfeiture?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What hand had the prisoner at the bar in this affair?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He and Muckle both told me they were partners.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to write your name?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They wanted me to write my name, that was all they wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this paper pasted to the back of the note?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When Muckle found I would take him in custody, he snatched it to get it. and tore a piece off; so Mr. Alderman Dickenson's clerk pasted that paper behind, to stick it together, as it was before,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I cannot write my name as any body can understand it: I have business enough of my own; I have more business than I can do; I keep a public-house; this man agreed to give us 40 l. I went down stairs, and when I came up again, they had made a little bit of an agreement: after that, it was handed to Mr. Keyo, till the afternoon: after that, the prosecutor would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Keyo. Had you the paper in your possession afterwards?</p>
               <p>Keyo. They handed the agreement to me; I believe the note of hand was with it. Muckle called for it in the evening; I had put it into a corner cupboard; I went and delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this paper whole, or as it appears now?</p>
               <p>Keyo. Muckle tore off some part of it; I cannot say I know a note of hand, because I cannot write.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Muckle told me there was a note of hand at the bottom of it, and the man was to pay 10 l. if he did not come back again, in such a time; he certainly gave that note: I wish I may be hanged in chains if he did not.</p>

I pursued him, and took him, and offered him him half a crown if he would tell me where the watch was; by which means I got part of it again. I found one of the cases at a chandler's-shop, in Spittal-fields; the prisoner had sold it to the woman for 6 d. and he had bruised the other case, in order to get the work out, that a person had stopped, but the remainder of the watch I cannot find.</p>

               <p>Harper. This is my paper, that I carried with the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. When is that dated?</p>

               <p>Q. Who writes the order for plate to be delivered back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Does Mr. French write any?</p>
               <p>Harper. He has wrote none since he has been with my mistress, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this order for the delivery of it your hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Harper. No, it is not; I went twice, in order to bring the plate back; the first time I went, they told me it would be two hours before it would be delivered; that was about four o'clock: I went again about six, then the work was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by work?</p>

               <p>Bowles. Jones did; and Bourk and I waited just by: he was in about ten minutes, and came again, and told us, the work was not finished, and the small work was not paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the note wrote?</p>
               <p>Bowles. I did; we all three of us were in the cart; the work not being ready, we all went back to where the note was wrote; we were to go again at six: when we went again, Jones went in with the note, and we staid in a court just by; he seemed to stay a little longer than ordinary, and we went back again to the place where the note was wrote, and Jones soon came to us with the work in a green bag; the bag that the work was delivered in; there were two quart tankards, with lids to them, and two pint cups; Jones gave them to Bourk, and Bourk held them while Jones went to fetch Welch: Welch came (he knew nothing of the writing the note): he took one of the tankards with the lid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Welch live?</p>
               <p>Bowles. He lives in Black-Boy-Alley; he is about the size of Jones; about 17 or 18 years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the note read?</p>
               <p>Bowles. No, I did not; I heard Bourk say it was to be wrote in Mrs. Bell's name.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170030"/>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with Bourk, when he first mentioned it to Jones?</p>
               <p>Bowles. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was on a dung-hill in Chick-lane; there was I, Bourk, and Bowles all together: first of all, Bourk asked me if I had any money? I said I had none at all; and did not know which way to get any: he said he knew which way to get some, and was sure of getting it; he said his mistress used to send plate to Goldsmiths Hall every day: Bowles and he got a note, and delivered to me, and I went to the hall, and asked for Mrs. Bell's work: I was told it was not ready; it would be ready about six o'clock: I went again about six; I asked the Gentleman for Mrs. Bell's work: it was delivered to me in a green bag; I went and delivered it to them; I did not know what was in the bag. I am an apprentice to a watch-maker.</p>
               <p>Bourk's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing about it; Jones brought me first into it.</p>
               <p>For Jones.</p>

One day, I found a hole, about as big as the palm of my hand, broke into one of the casks: I thought it had been some trifling accident, and ordered the man to mend it. After that, I saw the head broke, and a large quantity of the copper gone. I had information from Mr. Gruggen, that there was some such sort of stuff stopped by him: I was ordered to attend the reexamination of the persons; the copper was produced, and it resembled the same sort of stuff as was in the casks. Powell and Ward were examined before Justice Berry: Powell owned it was he, and another person, that had made his escape, that took it: that he himself was going to break the cask, but not doing it so quick as the other thought necessary, the other took a hatchet, and broke it; and, upon hearing a watchman coming by, they went into the necessary-house: after he was gone by, they went and fetched some more, and Ward carried it to sell.</p>

            . Two men came to my shop, on Little Tower-hill, at the corner of Queen-street: they had got a parcel of metal; and said, a cask of metal broke in shipping, and some of it fell out, and they took it up, and washed it; that it was what they called shot copper: after that, they said, they could not tell what it was. I gave them 4 s. for twelve pounds: this was last Thursday fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What two men were these?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. Those were Powell and Ward; there is not one person in forty that knows what it is. I never saw any before.</p>

               <p>Shepherd. They told me it fell into the water, and they went in and picked it up; and that it was on purpose for making of brass.</p>

            . On Saturday was a week, Ward came to my shop, with a quantity of this copper, and asked me, if I would buy it?</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Gruggen. I am a founder, and live in East-Smithfield. I said, friend, what is it? he said, really, I do not know. I said, I have been many years in the trade, and never saw any thing like it before. I asked him, how he came by it? he said, they were unloading of casks, the head of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170032"/> one burst, and a great deal of it roll'd into the kennel, and he afterwards picked it up, and the owner seemed not to think much at it. I told him, it did not seem dirty: I put it into the scale, and gave him half a crown for it: he said, he would see and find the other man that had picked up some more: I thought it was brass. Magee and he came again, with a larger quantity; there was thirteen pounds of it, within a quarter, for which I gave them 8 s. 8 d. he said, they washed and dried it. I would have stopped them then, but I had nobody with me. On the Thursday following, a woman came, and said, she had got a small quantity of that metal that I had bought of a man a few days before. I told her, it was not worth my while to buy such a quantity, I wanted it altogether. On the Friday, Ward came and acquainted me they had brought some: I said where are you? he said, over the way: I said, I am settling a little account with a couple of gentlemen, and I'll be with you soon. I sent one of my servants to fetch a constable, but not getting one, I went over myself, and stopped them; there were all the three prisoners, Ward, Powell, and Magee; they had then near an hundred weight. I took them before Justice Berry, and they were committed. In taking them to gaol, Magee made his escape: Powell confess'd before the justice, how he took it, and that he was along with Magee, but not with Ward. He said, Magee told him he lay slugging in bed, when there was money to be got; and, after they had shewed him what money was to be got, he went with him. He said, only Magee and himself were concerned in taking it; Ward brought part of it to sell, though he was not in the robbery.</p>
