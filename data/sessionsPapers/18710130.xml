I don't thieve! I am a prostitute, but you know I don't thieve "—I said "I know you do thieve, and you have been convicted for it times"—I took her to the station, absent for the divisional surgeon to examine O'Hara—there was a slight cut in his face, it was covered with blood, but nothing very serious—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found in his trowsers pocket—he was fined 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. next day for being drunk—his right hand coat pocket was torn down.</p>

Mr. Chamberlain, I know nothing of it; I saw the man lying down, but I don't know anything of it"—she was taken to the station—at the station the women said they had not been in the "Euston Tavern" that night, and had not had anything to drink with O'Hara.</p>

Milton was about to insert my name; there was some difficulty about spelling the name, and I wrote it for him—I then gave him a cheque for the amount—he produced pen and ink—I produced a blank cheque, which I always kept in my pocket—I was about to cross the cheque, when Milton requested me not to do so, as he wished to get the money immediately—in consequence of that request I did not cross the cheque—it was payable to bearer by my bankers, Cox &amp; Co., of Craig's Court—I should say I was there altogether about twenty minutes—I requested that the horses might be sent home by 3 o'clock that afternoon, to my house, 10, Stanhope Gardens—the horses came a little before 3 o'clock—I had given directions to my coachman to take them to some stables that I had engaged, in the Brompton Road, as my own stables were not ready—I went to the stables in the Brompton Road, that afternoon, for the purpose of trying the horses—they were put into a break; my coachman went out in the break with me, and some man stood behind, one of the persons from the livery stable—I drove the horses myself—I had considerable difficulty to begin with, in getting them to start at all; my coachman tried first, and failed, and then I tried; after getting them to start they started off at a good round canter, for a little distance; I then drove them round by the South Kensington Station, about half-a-mile, and before I had gone that distance one of them <hi rend="italic">roared</hi> very much; I then just drove round to my house, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile altogether—they were entirely unfit for my purpose, or rather one horse was unfit, being an evident <hi rend="italic">roarer</hi>, and that spoilt the pair—being dissatisfied with them I sent them back to the stables, and next morning I went to South Street—I did not see either of the prisoners there—I left a note for the coachman, Wilson or Davis, requesting him to come and take the horses away, and on the next evening, about 8 o'clock, Wilson came, with another man—he was shown into my study—he said that Mr. Scott would be very sorry that the horses did not suit me, and that he would take them away—I requested that a receipt might be given for the horses, which I wrote out, and requested him to sign—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was unable to write, and I wrote his name, and he put his mark—he gave me the name of Thomas Davis.

               <p>away from the stables—I went to 20, Aberdeen Place, on the Saturday afternoon before this interview with Wilson; failing to find the coachman at the mews, I drove straight there, being anxious to settle the question at once—I inquired for Mr. Scott, but was not able to see him—in consequence of that I wrote a letter on that same Saturday evening, and received this in answer. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Liverpool, October 20th, 1870.

However, if this arrangement should greatly incon<lb/>venience you, please to inform me per return, and I will adopt some other plan. Yours, A. Scott.") I have never received a penny of the money—I gave the cheque to the prisoner, believing his statement that he was a gentleman, and the son of the late well-known banker, Mr. Scott—it was upon that representation that I parted with the cheque—finding I could not get the money, I was advised, in the beginning of January, to go to South Street again—I went disguised, with whiskers and moustache—I saw both the prisoners there—I am certain they are the same men that I had seen there on 14th October—a statement was made by the prisoner's Counsel before the Magistrate; other than that, I have no doubt whatever that they are the men.</p>

I am gardener to Mr. Thorley, at Finchley—Milton was coachman there from June to December—I keep the keys of the two gates—I remember on 14th October Mr. Thorley left in his carriage, about 12 o'clock—Milton drove him, and he was home about 7 o'clock, or a little after—I know it was the 14th, because I marked it down—I lost two pigs that day—it was on a Friday—Milton was <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> my fellow-servant about the pigs, and saying he would get the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi> on the morrow, Saturday—the pigs were lost about 4 o'clock on the Friday; at least that was when we found it out—my under-man had orders to shut them up at a certain time, and he came to me about 4 o'clock, saying he could not find them—we told Milton about it, as he was cleaning his horses or harness—Mr. Thorley drove up nearly every day in October, except Sunday, and Milton drove him—it was generally about the same hour, within ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he generally returned about 7 o'clock; sometimes about 6 o'clock—he did not go by rail during that month—since that time he has gone; since it has been frosty, and the coachman has left; but he did not go by rail before October; if he did it was very rarely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am certain it was on Friday, 14th October, the pigs were lost—I marked it in chalk on the shed that very day, about 4 o'clock—Alexander is the name of my under-man—I was examined before the Magistrate—Milton did not ask me to give evidence; he told me he was locked up, and said "I shall have you up"—I did not tell him then about the pigs; I did the second time I saw him—I can't recollect when that was—I don't think it was before he was committed—I can't recollect—I traced it back by bills that I had received, and then it directly came into my mind that I had made a chalk mark on a certain day—that came into my mind directly I heard of the case—I can't swear whether I talked with Milton about this matter of the pigs helping the case—I am the head gardener—I keep the keys of the carriage entrance, and am obliged to answer the bell when anyone comes—I say that Mr. Thorley went up in his carriage every day in October, or nearly every day—I could not swear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101300015"/>
               <p>that there were some days on which he did not use the carriage—Alexander is not here to<lb/>day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is a fact that we did lose the two pigs on the 14th, and we recovered them the next morning—I was told that Milton was charged with an offence committed on the 14th, and after I heard that, I found that was the day we had lost the pigs—I am quite positive that on that day he drove Mr. Thorley into town—he never wore whiskers or even slight hairs—he never had the least appearance of hairs during the time I knew him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman to Mr. Thorley, at the mills, in town—I knew Milton as coachman—I am not positive whether Mr. Thorley drove into town every day during October, in his carriage; but he did most days, and Milton drove him—I am not able to say anything positive about the 14th—he was in the habit of driving Mr. Thorley in during the middle of the month; he used to arrive about 12.30, generally, and then it would be his duty to clean the horses and the carriage, and then he would go and get a bit of dinner, saying, if he was wanted would I send for him—he never knew the time Mr. Thorley would want him, and he was always obliged to be in the way—he would come back again from dinner about 2 o'clock—I never knew him to be absent during the day for three-quarters of an hour or an hour, because he was uncertain of the time Mr. Thorley would leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was usually away for about three-quarters of an hour, at his dinner, not longer—he always cleaned the carriage before he went to dinner—I am watchman there, and am in the yard, and the carriage is in the yard—he used to go to a cook-shop to get his dinner, and leave word where he was gone, if he was wanted—I don't recollect any day in October when Mr. Thorley did not come in his carriage; there might be one day in a month, perhaps, when he did not—he usually came from about 12.20 to 12.30.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mrs. Wells—the stables are at 21, King's Mews, South Street, Park Lane—Milton's father lives opposite our stables—I know the prisoner—I have not seen him since the early part of last year, April or March, or somewhere about that time—I know French—I remember his clipping some horses in October; I can't recollect exactly the day—he was there for about three weeks or two months—I don't know Mr. Curling, not to call him to mind—I remember a gentleman coming there to look at some horses, in October—my mistress came home from the country on 28th September, and this was about the middle of October—French brought in a pair of scissors, which I had lent him to clip some horses, and he began clipping my horse's legs; and during the time he was doing that he was called out to run some horses up and down—I did not go out of my stable—there was another man there; it was not Milton, I believe it was his brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was not the only time I had seen horses trotted up and down by any of the Miltons—I saw it once or twice that week—I could not fix the dates; but my wife was confined on 4th October, and my mistress went away on the 8th; that was Saturday, and this was the latter end of the next week—I remember when French Charley was clipping my horse's legs he was called away—I can't swear to the gentle<lb/>man that bought the horses—I know Wilson—I did not see him in South Street in October—I saw him there at the beginning of November—on my oath I never saw him in the mews before November—I never saw him about there, nor in the stables in Brick Street—that is about five</p>

I am a merchant, and live at Claremont Terrace, Lordship Lane, Stoke Newington—I know the prisoner; he calls himself a general dealer—on 20th June last he purchased 135 bundles of straw boards of me, the price was 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me his acceptance for the amount; it came back dishonoured—I met the prisoner once or twice after that, in the street, and asked him to pay me—he said he would do so—after that his sister paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account; I think that was in October, about three weeks after the bill was dishonoured—on 26th October, the prisoner came to my office, and asked me to grant him some more time—my clerk was present—I asked what time he required to pay the balance, 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said twelve days, but if I would not pay the acceptance away, he would probably be in a position to take it up before that time—I had a bill-stamp in the office, or I got one, and my clerk wrote out this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable in twelve days, and the prisoner accepted it—it would fall due on the 10th November—it has never been paid—on 12th November I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "November 11th. Sir,—I have been expecting your bill to be presented, and only now have received the enclosed. I shall take the bill up this evening, and save you further trouble.") It never was taken up, and I gave instructions to my solicitor—I did not tell the prisoner I would renew the bill on its becoming due, nor did he tell me he could not meet it—I did not say it would be all right, and that by his obliging me, and accepting the bill, it would be doing me a personal favour; it was not upon that under<lb/>standing alone that I consented to accept the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was the first transaction I ever had with the prisoner—I sold him the goods on 30th June—I have not got the first bill here, it is at my office—I sued on the second bill, and then he made the affidavit—I got judgment against him—I left the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I had to withdraw the levy, there being a bill of sale, and pay 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the costs of the interpleaded—I took out the summons when I found that perjury was committed—I think it was taken out on 15th</p>

               <p>January—the affidavit was sworn on 29th November—I wrote a letter to the prisoner in January stating I should take proceedings if he did not pay the money—I did not tell him verbally that I would indict him for perjury if he did not pay—I asked him to pay me when I met him in the street; I think that was in December—he said the matter rested entirely in the hands of his solicitors—I said nothing to him then about perjury—I met him again in Cannon Street, about a month ago, and asked him to settle it, and he again told me it did not lay in his power; it was in the hands of his solicitors—I did not say anything about perjury then—it was he who proposed the second bill—I did not particularly care whether I had it or not; I thought it would be a better security—I paid it away—I did not tell him that was what I wanted it for—I did not agree that I would not pay it away—I did not give up the old bill, because I thought that was a collateral security—when he re<lb/>accepted this bill I told him I would not return the other; that I would keep it as a collateral security, and return it to him when the other bill was paid; that was at my office at the time he accepted the bill—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my clerk's writing; it was no doubt written by my instructions. (<hi rend="italic">This was a Utter to the prisoner stating that it was his intention to prosecute him for perjury, and not to spars him the slightest mercy in dealing with him according to law.</hi>) If my clerk wrote that, it was evidently by my instructions—I do not dictate to him what to say, merely to write such and such a letter—Mr. Murray is my attorney, and has been so all through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prosecutor—I recollect the defendant calling at the office on 26th October—he asked Mr. Eckhaus if he would take a bill for twelve days for the amount of the account, and Mr. Eckhaus consented to do so—I wrote it out, and saw the prisoner accept it—he said he was expecting to receive money every day, and he should very likely pay the bill before it was due—he did not say he could not meet it when it was due, nor did Mr. Eckhaus say he would see it was all right—if he gave him the bill it would be doing him a great personal favour—the prosecu<lb/>tor did not consent to accept the bill on the understanding that he would renew it when it became due.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Leigh Street, Burton Crescent, and am a surveyor and builder—the prisoner was a general servant in my house—she came a fortnight before Christmas—on Sunday night, the 15th January, about 8.30, or from that to 9, I was called by my daughter, and I went directly to the bedroom over an office which I had, and found the bedding on fire, and the room full of smoke, so much so, that I could scarcely get into the room—I began beating the flames out with my hand and smothered them over with the blankets, and in that way got it out, with the assistance of water—after that I got a light, and I closely inspected the place to make out the cause, if possible, and I saw that it had been evidently set on fire between the palliasse and above the rail of the bedstead, under the counterpane—there was a counterpane over the bed—I saw the flames extending each way, evidently starting from the top of the rail—the bed was made, and there was an extra quantity of things on—there was a sealskin mantle and a waterproof also there, amongst the bedding, and the prisoner afterwards said she had put it on—that was the fifth fire I had had in the house—one occurred on 5th January—they extended over ten days, from the 5th to the 15th—seeing that they must have been set on fire, I went to the police-constable to come to inspect it—I asked the prisoner if she had been up into the room and done anything in the way of fire there—she said, in my hearing, that Miss Sherritt was last in the room</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101300029"/>
               <p>—after the police-constable had been in and inspected it and made inquiries, she confessed that she did it—we were sitting in the dining room—I said "You had better confess and tell me whether you really hare done it or not, and we should be inclined to forgive you and look over it"—she was in a very excited condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was a good servant while she was with me, as far as abilities were concerned—she was well conducted—I understand her age is 15, on 24th of this month—I had no fault to find with her—she seemed to be willing—I keep the house myself—there are six of my own family in the house, and a young lady and three gentlemen occasionally, lodgers—I kept one servant, a charwoman, and a boy to do all the rough work—I thought the fire was accidental at first, because it did not occur to me that it had been anything else; I really did not investigate or think of it—I thought it was a spark or something.</p>

On 15th January, between 10 and 11 at night I went to the prosecutor's house—I went to the first floor front bedroom with Mr. Nash—I found the room full of smoke, and the bed and bedding completely destroyed—I also saw a sealskin mantle there, burnt—I then went down in the kitchen and saw the prisoner—Mr. Nash, junior, was with me—Mr. Nash might have been there, but he did not stay any length of time—I saw her before she saw Mr. Nash—I am sure of that—I told her I was a police-officer, and I was going to put some questions to her, and she must be Very careful how she answered them—I said "Do you know there has been a fire in the house to night"—she said "Yes, I do"—I said "This looks very suspicious, this is the fifth fire that has occurred here within ten days"—she said "I know nothing about it, I have not been up stairs to night"—I said "I have been informed that you have been up stairs, I was told so by young Miss Nash "—I then sent for Miss Nash and repeated the same again, and Miss Nash said "Ellen, how can you tell such falsehoods I"—she became very much excited and began to cry—she then said "Sir, I will tell you something"—no promise had been made to her at that time, in my presence, and no threat—she said "You said just now, sir, there has been five fires, I only lighted four; I went up stairs, and took some matches and put them to the gas and then threw them under the bed clothes, and placed over the bed clothes a sealskin mantle; I don't know what made me do it; I have a good master and mistress, and they have been very kind to me "—I told her I should take her to the station—she said "Oh dear! tell my mother"—I told her that should be done—before taking her to the station I took her into the dining-room, where Mr. Nash and the family were—she went and sat by Mrs. Nash's side, and made a confession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear Mr. Nash say he would forgive her, and tell her to tell the truth—after the prisoner had told me about it, I went with her into the dining-room, where the family were—she said she wanted to speak to her master, and she did not wish me to be present, and I went outside the door—I am quite sure that was after I had seen her in the kitchen—I put the questions to the girl, which I have told you—Mr. Nash might have been there, but I don't remember—I think he was there a short time—he did not tell the girl in the kitchen that she had better speak the truth—he did not say a word to her in the kitchen—Mr. Nash's son was not present when she made the statement—he had left the kitchen then,</p>

I said "You might be civil;" and he struck me on the head with the broom. I have the mark now. I snatched hold of the broom, and got it from him, and struck him on the head.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 105). On Monday night, 2nd January, about 11.10, I was in Thomas Street, Bethnal Green, and heard men shouting and women shrieking in Chilton Street—I went there and found about twenty men and women quarrelling; the men wanted to fight—I advised them to go away and take another time for fighting—the prisoners were all there—I knew Bryan, Beer, and Davey by sight—I advised them to go away, but they would not, and Bryan came behind me, put his hand round my neck, and threw me on my back—I got up and took hold of him, he struggled and we both, fell—while I was on the ground the other prisoners kicked me violently about the head and under the arm—my mouth was hurt, and I lost a tooth—I got up, still holding Bryan, and was making my way to the station, when Browning stood in front of me, and said "Let him go, let him go," and he struck me on the head with something very heavy, which felled me to the ground—they all commenced kicking me, and some one called out "Don't kill him "—with that they ceased, and I got up and seized Bryan again; the word "<hi rend="italic">rouse</hi>" was given; they all surrounded me and I was <hi rend="italic">punched</hi>—Browning struck me several times on the head with something like a bludgeon; it was large and black, something like this (<hi rend="italic">a truncheon tipped with an iron band</hi>)—this is much heavier than one of ours—I drew my truncheon and made a strike, but my arm was caught behind, and my truncheon was taken away from me—some one I do not know asked me for my rattle—I handed it out, and there were several hands to take it—it was sprung, and the prisoners went away—a constable came, or I should have fallen from loss of blood from my head—my nose and mouth were bleeding—my wounds were dressed at the station—Brown<lb/>ing had a bandage round his head—Davey, the smallest prisoner, climbed up by the side of me and tried to reach my face—on Wednesday morning the four prisoners were brought to my bed, and I knew them at once—they were not placed with others at that time—Beer kicked me, when I was on the ground, first.</p>

My beat is round about Chilton Street—that is rather a roughish neighbourhood—I had not seen other <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> that day—there were about twenty people there, and four or five women—the "White Horse "is the nearest public-house, and that is a long way off—when I went up, Browning and another man were attacking one another, but I did not see any blows—I will undertake to say that there were not 150 people in the street—a man was being led away by two other men and a woman; a man got in front of me, and he was the first person I spoke to—they were a few yards from the rest of the mob—when I was thrown down, my helmet came off—this was between two gas lamps—I had never seen Browning before, to my knowledge—it was not the first time I have been thrown down—I was just as sensible when I got to the station as I am now, and I described the men—several other men in the crowd hit me, and I described others besides these four.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 51, Chilton Street, Bethnal Green—on 2nd January, about 11 o'clock at night, I was in Chilton Street, and saw about twenty men quarrelling, and using very bad language—Young told them to go away, and not kick up a bother there—they did not go, but the prisoner in the drab jacket (<hi rend="italic">Bryan</hi>) struck Young, and they fell together in the road—Young got up, took him by the collar, and asked him what he had done that for—they fell again, and the other men kicked Young while he was on the ground—Browning was one of them; he had a white bandage on his head—I cannot identify the other two—I said "Oh, you vagabonds, to serve a man in that manner!"—I went for a policeman, and when I was half way down Hare Street I heard Bryan behind me—he went into a doorway, peeped round a corner, and then walked out again, and went into the "Hare" public-house—I remained at the opposite corner, what we call the "Crown" corner, looking for a policeman, and while there I saw Browning go into the public-house, with several others—soon after<lb/>wards I saw Young going to the station, in a dreadful state, another con<lb/>stable was helping him, and a young man.</p>

I live at 90, Hare Street—on 2nd January I heard women screaming—I went up Chilton Street, and saw a policeman, with fourteen or fifteen men, and two women—the policeman was persuading them to go away, because they wanted to fight; but they would not—he got two of them down Thomas Street, and two more of them wanted to fight—he said "As soon as I stop two of you fighting, two more want to begin," and one in a light jacket struck the policeman, and knocked him down—I do not know who he was—the policeman took him by the collar, and he struggled, and fell, and all the others went round him and kicked him—he got up again, still holding the one with the light jacket; they struggled, and fell again, and they all kicked him as they had before—I cannot tell who they were, it was too dark to discern their features; but one had a bandage on his head—they all ran away but the one who the policeman had got—the one with the baudago said "Who has he got now? I will go back and see"—he came back, and the one who was underneath the policeman said <hi rend="italic">"Cop,"</hi> and he got away, and ran off, and the one with the bandage hit the policeman upwards of a dozen times on his head with some weapon, I could not see what, and the policeman said "I have had enough"—he had nothing on his head, and he reeled on to the opposite side of the way and said "What, no help?"—I said "Where is your rattle?"—he pulled it out, and tried to ring it; but could not—a little girl, about fourteen, said "Give it to me, master," and she tried to ring it, as well as she could—he said, a second time, "What, no assistance?" and as he said that another policeman came to his assistance, and then Davey came up to me in his shirtsleeves—he lives next door to me—he said "Emma, what is the matter?"—I said fourteen or fifteen <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> have nearly killed this policeman "—he said "Don't you say nothing, or perhaps you will get a crack from some of them"—I said "If I see any of them I shall lock them up "—the policeman was then taken to the station, and Davey followed, and stood outside the station with me till 12.15, in his shirtsleeves, and no cap on.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also paid that into my banker's—I received both these cheques back dishonoured—I received the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque back on the 19th, and the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on the 25th—it was issued on the 19th; I got it on the 20th, and got it back on the 25th—I should not have allowed my potatoes to go if I had known the cheques would hare been dishonoured, or if I had known the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque would hare been dishonoured—in consequence of the dishonour of those cheques, I came up to London to see the defendant—and saw him on the 26th, at his house, at 256, Caledonian Road—my brother was there with him before I got to see him—I went in and bid him "Good morning," and I said "Well, George, how is it you sent me those two cheques, they are dis<lb/>honoured?"—he said "I am very sorry, but it will be all right in a short time "—I said "You must have known your position previous to sending for those goods "—he said "I did, I have known it for two years "—I then asked him if he had any money that I could have—he said "No "—I said "I started off from home in a hurry, and I am short of money, can you let me have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he says "No, I am going to call my creditors together in a few days, and I think there will be 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for you"—I said "Then you have been obtaining these goods from us on purpose to pay other creditors with; well I shall see further into this before I leave London; I shall consult a solicitor to see what can be done in the matter; I am not going to sit down to be robbed with impunity "—he says "You had better let it alone a few days, I had a loss of some goods that I bought of you and your brother some two years ago of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Well, I don't know anything about that, this is the first time I have known about it"—I also said that he might have got 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by them, for anything I knew—I left him at that time—a few days afterwards a notice went down to my place—on 17th June, after receiving a telegram, I saw the defendant at the station, at Blackpool—my brother was there, and a gentle<lb/>man of the name of Eschwedge—he says "It is a bad job;" and I says "It is"—he says "I am come down to try and get you to take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound down, and I will give you bills; I will sign them, and you can date them as you think proper, after I have got over my difficulties"—I said the bills were no use to us unless they were backed by some one else—he said "I will go back to London, but I don't know that I can have it done; I will see my father-in-law"—I believe I put that to him, asking him if he thought his father-in-law would not do it—he said he did not</p>

               <p>know, but he would go back and see, and be would either write or telegraph the result, but he would rather we would accept the bills, and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., than go and ask his father-in-law—he pressed me very hard, and said how honest he would be if we would only accept the bills—I refused to take the bills and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, too—I saw him again on the same day, and walked to the station with him—he wanted me to write up to his father-in-law to see if we could bring any influence to bear upon him to back the bills, but I was to do it in such a way that his father-in-law would not detect that he had anything to do with it—I promised to write, and I did write, some time after—this is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "From John Read, potato merchant, 30, Bonny Street, Blackpool, to Mr. Isaac Peart, potato merchant, London, July 15, 1870.

Before we make application to have him prosecuted, we just wish to say that we are willing to take 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, providing our coats are paid, rather than prosecute him. You know our case is a very clear one; we have our remedy. If this is complied with at once, you can write per return of post. We write this letter without prejudice to the case. Waiting your reply, we are, yours truly, John and Jonathan Read. P.S.—We should have written Bell himself, but knowing the bankruptcy authorities receive the letters, we thought it might be as well to write to you."

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. I have done business with Bell for three years, in the potato line—I have not sold him thousands or hundreds of thousands of tons of potatoes during that three years—hundreds perhaps, not thousands—I think I have had about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his money, in all transactions—I am not in partnership with my brother Jonathan—he is here to-day—my transactions have been entirely irrespective of the transac<lb/>tions my brother has had with him—I am not doing a very large business at Blackpool as a potato merchant; not to the extent of thousands a year—it all depends on the trade—if we have a good season, then we have a large trade—there is a great fluctuation in the trade at different seasons of the year, in the spring, perhaps, of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I believe there was one cheque which was paid to me by Bell that was dishonoured, before this—that was not paid that I know of, but it never came back to me—it was honoured afterwards—I can't tell which it is—it was paid, and that was enough for me—it did not happen, in reference to a cheque for a larger amount than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that that was dishonoured, and that I took a bill of exchange, or a promis<lb/>sory note, for it—I have never held his cheque back at his request for a time, and afterwards presented it—there were two cheques that were dis<lb/>honoured, and afterwards paid; but I only knew of one till I was at the Clerkenwell Court, and then I found out there were two, when it was shown to me—it did not happen to roe that a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented and not paid at maturity, and subsequently was paid—there is no doubt that I have been paid this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, dated December 1867—it bears on the face of it "Refer to drawer," but it had never been named to me—my bankers never told me of it—I paid it in the ordinary course, and they never returned it to me; I never heard a word of it—it has been paid—I suppose it was paid after it had been dishonoured; I don't know anything more about it—this cheque of April, 1870, for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has "Refer to drawer" is the only one I know about—I know of only one and this is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101300046"/>
               <p>it, for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after December, 1867, I supplied Mr. Bell with potatoes from time to time and was paid—I did not know that my brother took a bill of exchange or a promissory note for a cheque of Bell's which had been dishonoured, till we were in the Court—I know it now—I don't know how much it was—his transactions and mine are quite separate—we always expect the money for the sales of potatoes within a week, or something like it—perhaps I may have sold him potatoes and not been paid the balance for a week afterwards—about the middle of May, after the dishonour of one of these cheques, or both, I received a note from Mr. Bell, countermanding the delivery of any further quantity of potatoes—he had got my lot then; he ought to have sent to me sooner—there was not a quantity of potatoes which would have been forwarded to London, if I had not received that note—I did not send him more than he had ordered—he telegraphed for 20 tons 19 cwt.—he afterwards wrote for a few trucks more, when he sent me the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and I sent him 17 tons more—I believe the letter, ordering a few trucks more, was written on the 13th—I charged him 115<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I sought 120<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him, and then he offered me 115<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had not been seeking a market at Blackpool for those very potatoes in vain: that I swear—I had not offered them to any one in London, only to Mr. Bell—I know Mr. Dowse since this affair happened—he is a potato dealer in London, I believe—I never wrote a letter to Mr. Dowse—I had not been offering potatoes to him before I sent these potatoes to Mr. Bell—I had not been in correspondence with him, or in personal communication with him; I had no communication with him whatever—I have not received any communication from him up to this date—the first interview I had with Mr. Bell, after the dishonour of these cheques, was on 26th May, at his house in London—my brother was present; not all the time—he said if I would allow the matter to stand over, he hoped shortly to be able to arrange things—my temper was good enough on that occasion—he said something to this effect "You ought not to be so hard upon me, I suffered a considerable loss by potatoes which you sent to me a couple of years ago, and you need not make such a fuss about your being possibly a loser by me now "—I was not out of temper with him, I merely said I should consult a solicitor, he having obtained these goods so recently, and so barefacedly to telegraph for these goods and get them, and then to call himself together—I said "I shall consult a solicitor before I leave London," and then it was he said to me and my brother "You need not be so put about, I suffered a loss by you some two years ago, in reference to potatoes that you sent to me "—I had previously asked him if he could let me have some money—he did not say "If I am obliged to fail, I cannot give you any money in preference to my other creditors "—he never named no preference whatever—he said "I cannot give you any money "—he did not, at that interview or any other one, say "If I were to give you any money, and were obliged to become bankrupt, it would be doing injustice to the rest of my creditors "—the interview at Blackpool was on 17th June—my brother was present a part of the time—I had had some talk with Mr. Murray, my solicitor, before I left London, in May—I did not tell him to tell Mr. Bell that if he could not find money to pay me, I would see whether I could not prosecute him—I did instruct Mr. Murray, on 17th June—at the interview at Blackpool, I did not tell Mr. Bell that if he would pay me or get for me 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs, and something in the pound on my debt, that there should be an end of the matter—I said nothing of the kind to him—I was not trying to get 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs at that time—I never thought</p>

               <p>of such a thing as 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. costs, and part of what he was indebted to me, on 17th June—I was not extremely anxious at that time to settle the matter by getting 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the defendant—I had a lot of talk with Mr. Bell—I don't know that I have ever been in a bad humour with him all the time, though, there might be now and again a sharp word—he did not dine with me on that day—I believe he had tea at my house, bat I would not swear it—I don't know that he dined at my brother's—I was not there—we had a game at bowls on that day; several games—I was not going to behave badly to him when he came to see me—I don't think I am behaving badly to him now—the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had never been named on that day—I had a lot of talk with him—I was anxious to settle, of course, but it was not named on that date—it was in November last that 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the fixed sum for costs—it was on 17th June that the conversation took place with reference to the father-in-law—I never saw him in my life till I was at the Bankruptcy Court—I said we would have the bills, if his father-in-law would back them—I had heard that his father-in-law was a man of means in the same trade—I did not know it, only from hearing it—I told him if his father-in-law put his name on them I should be satisfied—on 15th July, this letter was written to the father-in-law, at Bell's request—I did not show that letter to Bell before I sent it—I did not see Bell between 17th June and 15th July—I have not had any conversation with the father-in-law, Mr. Peart, yet—my communication to him was by letter, that was all—an application had not been made in the mean time to the Court of Bankruptcy, to sanction a prosecution—I was present when my counsel made the application to the Judge at the Bankruptcy Court for permission to prosecute Mr. Bell for obtaining money from me by fraud—he dismissed it—I did not hear him say that there was no pretence for asking him to give authority for the in<lb/>tervention of the criminal law in this case, or that it was a monstrous applica<lb/>tion—I would not undertake to say what it was the Judge actually did say—the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was fixed for costs after the application for permission to prosecute—I don't know the amount of costs before, when we had the conversation at Blackpool, on 17th June—we had never had the bill—I never said to the defendant, on 17th June, that I must have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to satisfy my lawyer, and some of my own debt besides—I did not name a sum at all; 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was fixed in November—there was no other sum fixed at any time—I did not suggest that 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would do—it was their side said that—Mr. Webster offered 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe, to our solicitor, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—per<lb/>haps 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was wanted, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, at some time or other—we never consented to take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I did not tell him, when he was down at Blackpool, to try and put the screw on the old gentleman, meaning his wife's father, and try and get the money out of him—I asked him if he thought his father-in-law would do it—I did not say to him "If you can't do anything with the old man, see what the wife can do"—I never heard it named before—he said he did not know anybody who would back the bills, and I said to him "Don't you think your father-in-law, Mr. Peart, would do it? '—he did not tell me that he was surprised to find that his bankers had stopped his over-draft?—after he had got all the potatoes, he wrote me a letter to say that his bankers had slopped his over-draft; but he did not say that he was surprised that they had done so—I did not know that he had been in the habit of over drawing his bank account, I first knew it when he wrote that letter—I sent the cheque back to the bank, after it had been returned to me—I did not, on an occasion previously to that, send a dis<lb/>honoured</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir.—Enclosed is cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; our trade is very slow this week, and prices is not so good, so don't send any more at present.")

                  </hi>. I am a potato merchant, of South Beach, Blackpool—I am brother of the last witness; but we are not in partnership—I have known the defendant about three years, and had transactions with him—I had no transaction with him from 5th June, 1869, to May, 1870—in November there was a small balance due to me of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which has never been paid—on 7th May, 1870, I received this letter from the defendant, dated May 6th.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated the price at</hi> 120<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per ton</hi>). On 9th May I received this telegram, ordering 20 tons—on 10th May I sent the defendant 18 tons and some hundredweight of potatoes, value over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 12th May I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the cheque to be sent, and inquired if more goods were wanted</hi>.)

An application was made by Counsel against the bankrupt for permission under the Statute, to institute a prosecution against the bankrupt—the Registrar said "I think it is very desirable that we should have an opportunity of so far sifting the matter as to enable us to hear both sides of the case, and not to decide simply upon one side first of all. I will grant the application for an adjournment till November, and I think you had better renew the other application (that is for the permission to prosecute) to me at Basinghall Street some time next week, and in the mean time I shall have an opportunity of seeing the shorthand writer's notes"—It was then adjourned till 11th November—I was not present at the meeting on 12th August before the Registrar, when he gave his determination—I was out of town on that occasion—I have it on my notes that Mr. Reed acted as Counsel against the bankrupt.</p>

I am the manager of the London and County Bank, Caledonian Road branch—we do a great deal of business with the Islington potato market and other markets—the defendant had an account at our bank for some years—it was still open in May last—the last day of payment was on 23rd May—I gave him notice in April about his account, it was this "To Mr. George Bell. Sir,—Your cheques' to so-and-so, and so-and-so,' having been presented and returned unpaid, I have again to request that you will not draw cheques unless you are prepared to meet the same on presen<lb/>tation"—the date of that is 18th April 1870—I must have requested him, before that, not to draw—I returned several cheques in April and May—I should say twenty or thirty—apparently, cheques were returned as</p>

               <p>early as 1867, referred to drawer—I have not the book to prove that—the "return" book that I have' brought commences with 1869—the defendant was allowed to overdraw for some long period—on 18th April he was 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdrawn—I had one or two conversations with him about the overdrawing—I had frequently requested him to cover his account—I did that whenever his account was overdrawn—by covering his account, I mean not to overdraw—when the cheques were returned by me in April and May the account was overdrawn, and beyond my wish to increase it—on 11th April the account was overdrawn 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th April, 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 11th, 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 11th May, 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 19th May, 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—cheques were returned on 6th May—one, for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next return was on 7th May, one for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then nothing up to 11th—on the 7th May there was a payment of 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can't say whether that was before or after the cheque for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was dishonoured—it is entered "By cash "—that constitutes cheques, and gold, and silver—"bill" in the pass-book is entered as cash at the time, and debited against him afterwards, if it is not paid—there were subsequent payments in May of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from 7th May to the 23rd, the payments amounted to 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was drawing against that—from April to 23rd May the account appears to have been slightly increased—on 23rd May the balance against him was 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was about the same as it was on the 9th—I told him that it was against the rules of the bank for accounts to be overdrawn, therefore, I must request he would cover it, at the same time the over draft might stand at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I should expect it paid quickly—he was to pay in money to meet cheques, it being against the rules of the bank to have overdrawn accounts at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. It is not an uncommon practice to overdraw, but it is against the rule; that rule, like every other, has its exceptions—those exceptions are made by the manager at his discretion—it is the fact that, just previous to May, 1870, we had allowed another customer to overdraw to the extent of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Bell had had a banking account at our branch five or six years, to my knowledge—he banked there when I took the post of manager—he was carrying on business as a potato salesman—I had a high opinion of him, as a man of honour and a man of business—we balance our accounts every quarter—during that period he passed through the bank, in payments and debits, an average of 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the pass-book</hi>) in June, 1867, here is 5600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each side—bills that are discounted for persons are entered in the book as bills; if paid in with the ordinary cash, they are called cash—in the last quarter in 1870, I see, "Cash, 4296<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that is actual cash, including cheques, of course—during years he has paid in many thousands a year, either in cash or in securities, which have been realized and converted into cash—the balance against him is 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during the whole period that I have been manager, he has, at different times, been permitted to overdraw his account, and been charged interest for it—at times that overdraft amounted to several hundred pounds, which was afterwards honourably replaced by him; at one time to the extent of between 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which at first was referred to drawer, was afterwards passed, and his account was in credit—on 7th May he was 405<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdrawn, and on 25th his account was in credit—between 13th and 23rd May he paid in somewhere about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in round numbers—on 11th April he was 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. overdrawn—when he was stopped his account had improved—</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Lisle Street, and am a mason—I have known Machler three years—on 10th September I saw him at a coffee-shop in Little Newport Street—he offered me some tickets in a German lottery, and I took two, and paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said it was a lottery that would be drawn on 30th December, and that he disposed of the tickets on commission. (<hi rend="italic">Ticket read:</hi> "For the wounded German soldiers and relatives of the dead, the holder of this ticket to receive the prize that may fall on it; price 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The committee was here set out</hi>); the drawing includes about 500 splendid old paintings, about 100 clocks, and other works of art. The drawing will take place in public, in the presence of the whole committee, on 30th December. The smallest prize is worth more than the value of the ticket.") I asked him about the com<lb/>mittee, if he knew the names signed on the tickets, and the said "Yes, they are merchants in the City"—the next day he asked me If would like</p>

               <p>to take some more—that was at the same cafe, in Newport Street—I took four more, and paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards saw him again, and asked him for some more tickets, as several friends of mine wished to take tickets on behalf of the benefit—I took sixteen tickets, altogether—I paid him for them, and this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him several times before the last payment, on 10th September—nearly every day at the same cafe—I said nothing to him with reference to the matter, till the month of December, when I asked him to show me the prospectus of the drawing—he said "You shall have a prospectus, but the committee intend to have the patronage of the royal family in Germany, and after that I will give you a prospectus "—I told him I should like to make inquiry about it, and speak to one of the gentlemen whose name was on the tickets; I said it was very suspicious to me that a short time before the drawing they should draw a prospectus; and if they had not the prospectus a long time before, how could they alter the tickets—I made some inquiries about some of the names, and I then told him I had been to the German newspaper office, and I had heard there the gentleman had left the place; and that I had been to see Mr. Felsenthall, but I could not find him at all; and I said I was not satisfied with the inquiries—I told him I had left a letter at Mr. Felsenthall's office, and I expected an answer—he said "Well, it will be all right," and the next day I saw Lewtner—when I told Machler I was not satisfied he said "You will have your money back; and if the committee will not give you back the money, I will"—that was about the 26th or 27th December—I told him I had been inquiring about these gentlemen, and I was not satisfied, because the day for the drawing would be in a few days, and I would be obliged to go to the Police Court to make a charge against the committee—he told me I could do what I liked—he said "I am not con<lb/>cerned, I only have the tickets, and sell them on commission; and if you are not satisfied, I will repay you, if the committee will not"—I did not know Lewtner when I first bought the tickets—I saw him the day after I had been to Mr. Felsenthall's office, in the beginning of December, at the cafe in Little Newport Street—he said to me "Are you Mr. Eberwein?" and I said "Yes "—he said he had come from Mr. Felsenthall, to make arrange<lb/>ments with me about the tickets I had—I told him I should like to have my money back—he said "Well, you can have your money back if you like; but the drawing will be in February; the committee intend to change the tickets, and have a portrait of Bismarck on one side, and the Crown Prince of Prussia on the other "—I refused to have the tickets, and he asked me to meet him on 22nd December, and he would bring me half the amount of the tickets—I did not see him then, he did not come, and he wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "To Edward Eberwein. 23rd December, 1870. I returned this morning about 11 o'clock, and found my little boy not very well.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant P</hi>). On 10th January, about 3 a.m., I received information, and found six pigs and seven ducks, dead, on the prisoner's father's premises—some of the ducks had their heads pulled right off, and others had them stretched out from the windpipe—the pigs appeared to have been hit on the head—there was a little blood on them—I con<lb/>cealed myself in a shed, about four yards from where they were lying, and remained there from 3.30 till 5.45, when the prisoner came in through the large shed, which is a railway arch, under the North Kent Line, with doors at each end—he walked through 'the premises, and round the shed, where we were secreted—he moved a temporary board, which stood in front of the little shed, stooped down, and felt in with his hands, then got up, went into the big shed, lit a candle, came out with it, and stood for a second; he then commenced moving the pigs from his left side, passing them over to his right—on picking up the second, he said to himself "Oh, you are nice little chaps, too!"—he bad a lantern in his hand, and as he was picking up the third pig, I stepped out, and said "Halloa, Tyler, what are you doing?—he said "Nothing!"—I said "Well, there were some dead pigs and ducks, for I saw you remove them"—he said "Well, I get up early in the morning, for we have had several things removed from here"—I said "We will see about these ducks and pigs "—he said "I do not know anything of them"—I said "Why, I saw you remove them "—he said Well, three men brought them here last night"—I said "What time?—he said "Be<lb/>tween 12 and 1 o'clock "—I said "Who were the men?"—he said "I don't know, they were entire strangers to me"—I took him to the station; we arrived there about 6.30, and about 9 o'clock when I was searching him, he said "Well, I bought them List night"—he afterwards said "If I had not been drinking I should not have gone with them "—he was taken before the Magistrate, and remanded—on 10th January I took his coat off, examined the pockets, and found some feathers in one—both the pockets were clotted with congealed blood—the feathers correspond with those of this duck's neck and head (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was found lying on the premises—the prosecutor's premises are 300 or 400 yards from the Tunbridge Railway; to get there people would go as far as the junction between Lewisham and New Cross, and then down the North Kent line, to the shed, which is right underneath the North Kent Line—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is correct.</p>

               <p>16 lbs. each—I have seen the prisoner at pigeon-matches—I do not know whether his father keeps ducks, fowls, or pigeons; I saw one lire duck fly over from the Ravensbourne—I was there three hours, but it was dark, and I did not see a duck-pond—this was not on my beat, it is not the section I belong to—there was snow on the ground—I followed the footsteps behind the constable, and the way I traced them it was about a mile and a half from Mr. Sheppard's house to Mr. Tylers's—there were six sets of footsteps, three going each way; they went up to Heather Green Bridge, just through the bridge, which is three-quarters of a mile from where the prisoner lives—I traced the three sets of footsteps to within twenty yards of Tyler's house, and then one set went up to the shed on Mr. Tyler's premises—I did not trace them back, but they went both ways—I did not see a shoe compared with the foot-marks—the snow was just deep enough to cover the ground, so that you could trace the steps, which left a deep impression—one foot-print appeared as if the toe-cap was off; I noticed that for the whole mile and a half, where we could get a direct print of it—that was between 3 and 4 a.m.—it was moonlight, and I had the assist<lb/>ance of my lamp—the snow was not all melted away before we went to the Police Court next morning—we went there at 10.20, and did not leave till 2 p.m.—I did not notice whether the snow had melted then—here is where the toe-cap is off the boot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also saw the impression of these four nails—it is not an uncommon kind of boot for a labourer to wear—it was taken from the prisoner's feet—I took two men, named Hazlewood and Calverly, in custody—that was not after comparing their boots with the snow, it was some days afterwards—one set of footsteps was, I believe, smaller than this boot, and another set about the same size.</p>

               <p>about 1 o'clock, I went with constables Austin and Goodwin to Goff's house, in Trafalgar Road, East Greenwich—he keeps a second-hand shop for the sale of unredeemed pledges—I told him I had come for some sail-cloth that he had bought of Terdre, who was then in custody—he said yes, he had bought some—I accompanied him down stairs, and he gave me this sail-cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked if he had another—he said "No"—I told him I should take him into custody, and charge him with the unlawful posses<lb/>sion of this one—I then searched his place, and found this other sail-cloth behind the counter; he told me there was another, and produced it himself—I told him he had other property in his possession, some boots, and a gun, and he said he had not—I then took him to the station, returned, and searched the kitchen, and found these two pairs of water-boots, and a pair of trowsers, and after a time the gun was brought down from a room where Mrs. Goff was confined—it was given to me by a woman who was nursing her—these two saws were given to me by Goff—I took the gun to the station, and showed it to Goff', and he said yes, it was being paid off of—he gave me the key of his strong-room, which the constables used afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, stationed at the Tower—on 23rd January I was going along High Street, Borough, between 12 and 1 o'clock at night—I was sober—I met the prisoner as I was going along—he drew something out of his pocket, like a ham bone, and struck me over the eye with it, said "Take that"—it knocked me nearly senseless—I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, a half-crown and two sixpences—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> his hand in my pocket, and took them out—he ran away—a constable came up—I ran with him after the prisoner, and I saw him taken in charge and taken to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not drunk—I left the Tower about 8.30, and this was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I don't know how many public-houses I had been into.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was quite sober—my left eye is still bruised.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 259). I saw the prisoner running, and apprehended him—he hit me in the chest, and tried to throw me—we both fell to the ground—the prosecutor came up, and said "That is the man who knocked me down, and robbed me of a half-crown land two sixpences"—I took the prisoner to the station, and found a half-crown in his sleeve—the prosecutor had had a glass or two, but he was sober.</p>
