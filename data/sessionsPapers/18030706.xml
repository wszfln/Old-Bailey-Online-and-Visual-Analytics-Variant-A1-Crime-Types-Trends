             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Jennett: On Thursday the 31st of May, about six o'clock, the prisoner came up to me at the door, and asked for a bit of blue ointment spread upon some lint; he said, Mr. Jennett don't know me, I am a medical man; I reached the pot down, and he spread the plaister; he then asked to go into the parlour to dress an ulcer; I shewed him into the parlour; I did not go into the parlour; I called over a little boy; he then came out, and looked among the bottles; he wanted to make some pills of tincture of bark and calomel; he asked if I had any made, and I said, no; he said, I will call again about nine o'clock, and if Mr. Jennett is not at home, we will knock up a few pills between us, and then you will have something in your own pocket. About nine o'clock he came again, as I was going to shut up shop; he said, he was come for some pills, and he wanted a small blister spread; he cut a piece of leather, and I was going to spread it with my thumb; he told me, if I would go round the corner into Church-street, and heat the patler, he would give me a shilling; I went, and when I came back, I saw him go out with my master's great coat on; I ran across the way, and caught hold of him, and said, you have got a coat that does not belong to you; he gave me the coat, and wanted to go away; he said, you have got the coat, what do you want more? I said, he must come back with me; he got away from me, and I caught him again; he then said, he would give me half a guinea if I would let him go; I got assistance, and he was secured.(John Alcock, a constable, produced the great coat, which was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

               <p>CHARLES WHALEY, the younger, sworn. -On Saturday the 18th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, there were four trusses of hay found in the sheep barn, where we used formerly to keep sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. At <placeName id="t18030706-5-crimeloc29">Potter's-Bar</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18030706-5-crimeloc29" type="placeName" value="Potter's-Bar"/>

                        targets="t18030706-5-off27 t18030706-5-crimeloc29"/>. The witness and I sat to watch between nine and ten in the evening; we sat up all night, and nobody came; we sat up again on Sunday night, and nobody came that night; we sat up on Monday night, and on Tuesday morning, about four o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came and took the four trusses away; about two hours after that he came into another barn adjoining that where we sat up, what we call the draught barn, with a ladder he got up into the lost window.</p>



               <p>Q. Were you in a situation to watch both barns? - A. Yes; he went in at the lost window, which goes into the wheat barn, where we sat; he put his hand over the window to open the window; he saw me, and then he went away, and took the ladder with him. The prisoner was my father's servant, and he had been binding hay that day; the colour and quality was exactly like our's; we could not miss it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Are you in partnership with your father? - A. No, he has no partner.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with your father? - A.Four years next Michaelmas; he was carman and hay-binder.</p>

               <p>Q. How near to you was the person who was carrying this hay? - A.Not more than thirty yards.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it moon-light? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. It was a cloudy night? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS LORD sworn. - I work for Mr. Whaley; I sat up to watch in the wheat barn with young Mr. Whaley on Saturday night, and Monday and Tuesday the same. About two o'clock on Tuesday morning the prisoner came and took four trusses of hay from under the stubble in the sheep barn, and carried it away; I don't know what he did with it; I have known him these three years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.This was a cloudy night? - A. Yes, but it is never very dark at this time of the year.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that at thirty yards distance, at that time of night, you could see the man's face? - A. Yes, I am sure it was him.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not follow the man? - A.No, we staid to see if he would take any thing else.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never said you could not see distinctly who it was? - A. Yes, I told the prisoner so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Warwick so? - A. Yes, I did; I said so, because the prisoner should not be resolute; I did not like to handcuff him, as I knew the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Warwick is a respectable farmer? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060005"/>Q.Why did you tell Mr. Warwick so? - A. Because I had told the prisoner so; I had no particular reason.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Warwick that Mr. Whaley could not see him too? - A. I do not know, I might.</p>

               <p>Q.Perhaps what you told Mr. Warwick was the truth? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you tell us the truth now? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>SARAH - sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Wharley: On Saturday morning the 18th of June, I found four trusses of hay covered over with dubble, which is a very unusual thing, in the sheep house, close to the rick-yard.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>- WARWICK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a farmer; I have known the prisoner ten years; he was in my service two years; he has always borne the character of an honest and industrious man. <rs id="t18030706-5-verdict30" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>- BURTON sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; I took in this sheet from the prisoner on the 23d of June, between ten and twelve o'clock; I am sure it was the prisoner. - (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. This is the sheet I lost; it is marked G B, and a number; it was hanging in the yard to dry.</p>

I am as innocent as the child unborn; a decent man that I met asked me to pawn it for him; he said, his wife was ill, and he was ashamed to pawn it, and he would give me a shilling for my trouble; I pawned it for three shillings; I gave him the money, and he gave me a shilling. <rs id="t18030706-6-verdict35" type="verdictDescription">

The prisoner lodged in the house before I went to it; I lodged with her three weeks.</p>

               <p>- DARE sworn. - I am a pewterer, at No. 10, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square: On Saturday the 11th of June, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I knew of a situation; I told her, I did not at that time; but if she would call as she was passing by, if I should hear, I would tell her; she had a small bundle in her hand, and begged the favour of me to let her leave it till she came back, she was going a little further; I told her she might; she did not call that day, she called the following day, which was Sunday the 12th of June; I asked her why she did not call for her bundle; I went to give it her, and she said, being sunday, she would not take it till the next day. About eight o'clock in the evening Betts came for the bundle, and told me she was in custody; I cannot swear to the bundle, the handkerchief in which it is, is like it; the same bundle that I received from the prisoner, I delivered to the officer.</p>

               <p>HENRY BETTS sworn. - I belong to Marybone watch-house: On Sunday the 12th of June, the prisoner was in custody on suspicion of stealing a watch; she sent a little boy to the last witness's house; I thought it my duty to follow the boy; the boy first went into the shop, and I followed him; the boy asked for a bundle that Mrs. Preston had left; I told the last witness she was in custody, and he let me have the bundle; I found the watch in the bundle. - (Produces the gown.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my gown.</p>



               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the gown of her.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Green.) Did you ever sell her this gown? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she ever offer to buy it? - A. No; after I had missed my gown, the prisoner said, she had lost a five-pound note, a ten-pound note, and a petticoat; another person lost a watch, and they said it must be me, and I was taken up; I was examined at Marlborough-street, and acquitted; before the gown was found the mistress of the house lost the watch, and I had seen her with a watch.</p>

               <p>Betts. The watch was delivered back before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Green. I saw her go out with a bundle the day I lost my gown, but I had no suspicion of her; she came back the same evening, and slept there.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WHITE sworn. - I am a mason, at No. 29, Windmill-street, Finsbury-square: On Thursday the 16th of June, I was looking out of my parlour window, and saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Poynder's yard, in Hill-street, with two boards on his shoulder, which appeared to me to be scassolding-boards; I saw him go to the corner of Paul-street, and put them off his shoulder; I thought he went into a house, but I could not see whether he did or not; Mr. Reeve's is the corner of Paul-street; in a few minutes he returned, and setched one more board; he took the saw a direction; then I saw him and another labourer go to the King's Arms public-house.</p>

               <p>- REEVE sworn. - I am a carpenter, at No. 5, Paul-street; the prisoner came to me between eight and nine in the morning of the 16th of June, and asked me if I bought old boards; I told him, yes; he brought me one; he asked me half a crown, and I gave him two shillings; then he brought me four more, I gave him nine shillings for them; and then two more, and I gave him five shillings and sixpence; then two more at five shillings and sixpence; and then three more at eight shillings and sixpence; I shewed them to Mr. Poynder, and he claimed them.(One of the boards produced and identified by Mr. Poynder.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you desire Harris to take them to Smithfield for you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN DAVIS sworn. - Q. You are a drover? - A. I am: On Monday morning I was at the Angel door, between two and three o'clock; I saw the two prisoners there, I knew them before, they came from the Red Lion door; the little one said, b-r your eyes, make haste, and turn them out, for somebody is coming; they turned out the lambs; I don't know how many there were, they turned them all out; then the little one turned them towards the corner of the City Road; then the big one drove them down the City Road; I immediately went to

            , the fieldkeeper, and called him up.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the lambs before? - A. No, I had not; I went with Smith as far as the river, and then I desired the watchman to go with him, and I saw Smith and the watchman bring them both back again in about a quarter of an hour; the lambs were left behind.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you see the lambs? - A.No, it was between light and dark, that I could not see them; they were brown lambs.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CRISP sworn. - Q.You are a watchman at the pens at Islington? - A. Yes, at Pentonville; I was going round my beat between the hours of two and three, and saw the two prisoners sitting at the Red Lion door, opposite the pens; I sat down by them upon the bench for five minutes; while I was sitting there, Williams said to Harris,(upon seeing a drover getting some sheep out of the pens) go and see that they do not mix with the others; then the drover went away with them; I went away directly; the little one said, be quick, let us go and turn them out; and then they went and turned the lambs out, and drove them down the Goswell-street Road.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you observe them particularly? - A. Not when they were driving them down; I did not apprehend but what they had a right.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the way to Smithfield? - A. Not the direct road; the direct road would be down St. John-street; Smith and I pursued them, and overtook them just by Goswell-street turnpike; Williams was in the road, and Harris was down in the field driving the sheep, I look upon it to avoid the gate; I laid hold of Harris, and told him he must go along with me; he did not make me any answer; Smith asked what they were going to do with them, and he said, they had no money, and were going to take them to the Green-yard; we took them to the watch-house, and then I went back, and fetched twenty-nine lambs and one ewe.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you since shewn them to Crace and to Tew? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH SMITH sworn. - Q. You are fieldkeeper we understand? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing said to you by Davis, did you follow the two prisoners? - A. Yes; I took hold of Williams, and asked him what he was doing with the sheep, and he said, they were going to take them to the Green-yard, because they had no money.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you present when they were examined before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know whether what Williams said was taken down in writing? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. EDMUNDS sworn. - Q.Were you present at the examination before the Magistrates? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Was what the prisoner said taken in writing? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Smith.) Do you remember what Williams said before the Magistrate? - A. He said he was going to take them to Mr. Baslington, at Smithfield; he said a countryman ordered him to take them there.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Tew.) Did you tell these boys to take them to Smithfield? - A. No; as for the little one, I never saw him at all; I told the other to take care of them while I went to Smithfield with my note.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Crisp.) What did the little one say about turning them out? - A. He told the other to make haste in turning them out, or they should be too late, or something of that fort.</p>

               <p>Harris's defence. This young man and I were sitting at the Red Lion door; one John Smith was taking some sheep out of the pens, and he called to somebody to help him, and I went and helped him; he went away towards Smithfield; I called out, shall I bring them after you, and he said, yes, and I took them down the Goswell-street Road, because they should not mix with the others.</p>

               <p>Williams's defence. This young man told me the countryman desired him to take them down to Smithfield, and I helped him.</p>

I had been to Mr. Henley's for three pair of stockings, and saw her with two men behaving rather rudely in the street. I stood on one side because I would not interrupt them, and she would not let me pass one way or the other, they took up the whole pavement, and I stood in a nook for them to pass; the prisoner caught hold of me by the shoulder, and by the cheek and hair; she fetched blood of me in several places; I had no bonnet on; then the men that were with her snatched at my parcel, containing three pair of stockings.</p>

               <p>Q.What did she say to you? - A. We never spoke to each other; she got my head down between her knees, and then it was that the men snatched the parcel from me.</p>

               <p>Q.Did the men say any thing? - A. No; I called out for help, and Mr. Paulin came to my assistance; the prisoner was taken into custody, and the men made their escape; I picked up one pair of stockings under the prisoner's feet, after the constable had taken her, Mr. Paulin picked up another pair of stockings.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to be carrying stockings at that time of night? - A.My mistress sent me to Mr. Henley's for a pair of stockings, and he sent three pair for her to take her choice; they were for my master.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you get them? - A. I got them at Worship-street on Wednesday; I am sure they are the same.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Moore.) Can you tell which of these two pair of stockings you took up under the prisoner's feet? - A. Yes, these are them (pointing them out.)</p>

               <p>Q. Was that one of the pairs you received from Mr. Henley? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it not Mr. Paulin that took the bundle from you? - A.No, the men took it; they burst the paper, and I got hold of but one pair.</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury, I have the honour to attend you by the instructions of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, to state to you the case against the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this cause had been appointed for trial at a former Session; it was then postponed, and it will become my duty presently to offer to you the reason which induced the Governor and Company of the Bank, in the discharge of their duty, to postpone the trial of the cause at that time; it would be out of order to do it now, because it would interrupt more important narrative; and when I have stated it, I apprehend the conduct of those who requested that postponement, will not only be satisfactory, but will meet with the approbation of their Lordships.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen. the case before you is of the last importance; it is of importance inasmuch as it affects the life of the prisoner; for the offence with which he is charged has for the security of this most important Corporation, and for the interests of us all, been made, by a statute of the last reign, a capital offence: It is a capital offence for any officer or servant in the Bank of England to embezzle or secrete any of the securities with which he is intrusted, and of which the Governor and Company of the Bank of England are, in many instances, trustees for the public. It will become my duty, and I think it will not occupy any great portion of your time, to state to you the manner in which the business of the Bank is carried on, as it respects this particular department.</p>

            , the Chief Cashier; and it is not unfit I should say thus early, that down to the period which brings him to this bar as a criminal, he had conducted himself very faithfully, and with very meritorious services. Some unfortunate speculations in the public Funds, in which he probably sustained some losses, appear to have drawn him aside from that fidelity, and in an unhappy moment to subtract from those securities under his immediate care immense portions of that property for which he is today to answer before you. In the year 1799, having thus passed through the gradations of office, Mr. Aslett was appointed a Cashier in the Bank You know it is part of the business of the Bank, and a very large part, to purchase Government securities of various sorts, particular Exchequer-bills, which are issued in vast amounts, and which that Company purchase to supply the exigencies of the State. The manner in which these purchases are made is this: When a quantity of Exchequer-bills are in the money-market, the purchase is left entirely to the management of the Cashier, and for a considerable time past, in consequence of the great age and growing infirmities of Mr. Newland, the principal Cashier, this business was under the entire controul of the prisoner at the bar. All the purchases made immediately from the Government, are made through the respectable house of Messrs. Goldsmid; those purchased in the money-market are made by Mr. Templeman, the broker to the Bank; a bill of parcels is made out; I will suppose Messrs. Goldsmid to make out an enumeration of the various Exchequer-bills, describing them by their numbers, so that every person sees immediately what the one has bought, and what the other has sold. This bill of parcels has been delivered, in all the instances to which I shall have to call your attention to-day, to Mr. Aslett; in all the instances it was his duty to compare the bundle of Exchequer-bills with the enumeration of them in the bill of parcels, and by his own order, with his own hand, to direct the payment from the Cashiers of the Bank for the bills so purchased. They are then entered by the prisoner in what is called the bought-book; a corresponding entry to the bill of parcels is made in the bought-book. The Exchequer-bills themselves are deposited in a strong chest kept in the Cashier's office, and from time to time, as they increase to a bulk, to be placed under the more immediate eye of the Directors themselves; they are selected by the prisoner for that purpose, and carried into the parlour, where the Directors transact the business of the Bank. The manner in which this is done, I shall proceed to describe: You will suppose a bundle of Exchequer-bills, containing one thousand each, amounting to 100, or 200,000l. in value, or perhaps it may be better to put it amounting to 227,000l. The course that is taken is to count off a certain number of those, and then another clerk counts off the remainder, in order to ascertain the number carried into the parlour by the prisoner; they are carried into the parlour, accompained by the book I have in my hand, in which it was his duty to enter the parcels he carried in. I shall state the entry presently. In the parlour they are received by the Directors in waiting; they are by them counted and examined, each by itself, to see if it corresponds with the entry in this, which I shall, for distinction sake, call the parlour-book, distinguishing it from the bought book. When this entry is made and compared with the bundles, two of the Directors sign the entry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060016"/>as a voucher to the Cashier, that so much had been brought, and safely delivered from him into the immediate care of the Directors; and then the Exchequerbills thus brought into the parlour, are deposited by the Directors in a closet with three keys, and, generally speaking, it can only be opened in the presence of three Directors; but in certain exigencies it may by two; but no person, under any possible circumstances, can draw but in the presence of two Directors any thing from that strong closet which is there deposited. We will suppose then, that a parcel of Exchequer-bills are now safely deposited in the strong closet in the parlour, the Bank of England purchase these securities, and hold them till the time of redemption, they are never, by any possibility, again in the hands of the public; they are never, by any possibility, again in the money-market; they can, by no possibility, be there, but by the connivance of some two of the Directors of the Bank, in fraud of their duty, by opening the closet, and taking them out; for they are never sold, never re-issued, but remain there with an interest growing upon them, till the interests of the public make it a fit season for paying them, and then they are carried to the Treasury. It was the duty of Mr. Aslett to make this transfer of Exchequer-bills from the Cashier's office to the parlour, and on the 26th of February, the day to which your attention will be drawn upon this indictment, he did carry into that room a certain quantity of Exchequer-bills in one parcel, amounting to 100,000l. another bundle, amounting to 200,000l. and another, amounting to 400,000l. making in the whole of the transfer from the Cashier's office to the strong closet in the parlour upon that day 700,000l. He made the entry corresponding with this in the parlour-book, and it was regularly signed by two of the respectable Directors, Mr. Pugett and Mr. Smith. According to the entry, as it now appears in the book, Mr. Aslett ought to have carried into the parlour another bundle of Exchequer-bills, amounting to 200,000l. My charge against him is, that after he had made up four separate bundles, he withdrew the first, and converted it to his own use, or, in the language of the law and of the indictment, that he embezzled and secreted it. This I shall prove to the utmost demonstration unanswered. You will find, that the well-placed confidence which the Governor and Company of the Bank of England had in a servant of twenty-five years standing, (for if we may not have confidence in such servants, in whom can we place any?) enabled this gentleman, for a considerable time, to conceal the fraud and peculation which he had been guilty of. It was not until the 9th of April that any suspicion arose that any thing amiss had taken place; it was next to impossible it should be discovered, because there could have been no occasion to resort to this closet till the time of payment. No payment had been made in the intermediate time, and therefore it was next to impossible it should be discovered; but on the 9th of April, in consequence of a transaction which the prisoner had had with a gentleman of the name of Bish, a broker, an application was made at the Bank of this nature. Mr. Bish, a man much versed in business, was acquainted with the circumstance I have mentioned, that is, that Exchequer-bills once bought by the Bank never can again fairly come into circulation. It did so happen, fortunately for the purposes of justice, that upon an application to him on the 16th of day of March, he applied to Mr. Bish to make him a purchase in the 3 per Cent. Consols, for the opening of the succeeding day, to the amount of 50,000l. Mr. Bish refused to engage so deeply; he made several excuses, saying the fluctuation might be extremely great, and there might be a great loss. Mr. Aslett told him, if he deposited securities with him, he could have no objection, and enquired what the probable fluctuation might be. Mr. Bish informing him it might be 6 per Cent. the prisoner proposed depositing securities to make him safe; in consequence of which, he did deposit with him three Exchequer-bills, which, as I expressed myself before, fortunately for justice Mr. Bish knew had been previously sold to the Bank. This circumstance, you may suppose, considerably alarmed that gentleman, because he knew there must have been some foul and unfair practice, and therefore, as became him, he presented himself to the Bank, to disclose this circumstance to the Governor and Directors of the Bank. An enquiry was made, and the conduct of the prisoner on that occasion is extremely material; at this time it was impossible from any thing, but the information of Mr. Bish, that any suspicion should light on Mr. Aslett. Mr. Newland was resorted to, and a meeting of Directors had, at which attended a respectable Magistrate, likewise a Director of the Bank, Mr. Alderman Watson; and the qucstions that he put to Mr. Newland were these, in the presence of the prisoner: - "Is it possible that any Exchequer-bill, bought for the Bank, can get into circulation;" he said,"Certainly not, the thing is absolutely impossible (he might have referred to Mr. Watson's own knowledge upon the subject); you know, Sir, they are always deposited in the strong chest in the parlour." The question was answered, that the thing was impossible; upon that the question was repeated to Mr. Aflett himself, and his answer agreed with that of Mr. Newland, that the thing was absolutely impossible.</p>



               <p>Gentlemen, as it was not given to Mr. Bish as a payment, but to remain a dormant security in his hands to wait the opening of the Consols, his attention was not called to this circumstance till the day of the opening, when he discovered they had been sold, which led to the communication and the conversation I have stated. Mr. Aflett, upon being asked the question whether any bought bill could by any possibility get into the hands of any person without the walls of the Bank, answered, as Mr. Newland had done, that the thing was impossible; it became necessary now, to make him acquainted that the Bank were in possession of the fact, - that some bills thus truly described, as not passing by any possibility but by fraud and embezzlement, had found their way into the money-market, and that three of them had passed to the hands of Mr. Bish, the prisoner was asked if he had not had some concern in that transaction; his answer was, that he had indeed directed Mr. Bish to make a purchase of stock, - that he had indeed made a deposit of Exchequer-bills with Mr. Bish, but he had done this for a friend; he was asked the name of that friend, and he wished to be excused from disclosing it; upon being pressed, he mentioned Mr. Hosier, a gen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060017"/>tleman who is a partner in a respectable banking-house at the other end of the town; he had said, these could not be the Bank Exchequer-bills; he turned over two of the bought books, and certified to Mr. Watson, that they were not Bank property, because every bill bought by the Bank must be found in some bought book: but the fact was too apparent, for, upon turning to a book which lay immediately under those two which Mr. Aslett had looked at, the Directors immediately found the enumeration of the three bills which had passed to Mr. Bish, which he had thus stated could not be taken out of the Bank but by fraud, and which he had represented could not be the property of the Bank, because they were not in the bought books, it became impossible then but that this gentleman should be immediately secured; that measure therefore was taken. Now, I take the liberty here of pausing for a moment, and asking you, under the direction you will receive from the wisdom and learning that presides over this important trial, whether, if we were in the case of one security alone, deposited in the hands of any private man under the care of his confidential servant, and that deposited in a manner in which but by fraud it could not come into the hands of the public, and it is found to have come into the hands of the public, and by the intervention, and for the benefit of the considential servant, suppose I had to present such a case concerning some one security for money, would you not say it called loudly for explanation; and I am now speaking in a case in which there are two hundred of those securities, for the charge is an embezzlement of 200,000l. I will account not for the three alone deposited with Mr. Bish, but I will account for the whole of them: I will prove every one of them to have been converted by the unfortunate person at the bar to his own benefit, and if I do this, it will be impossible for charity itself to entertain a doubt about his guilt.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, the manner in which I shall account for them will be this: in the same manner in which he deposited Exchequer-bills with Mr. Bish, he deposited other Exchequer-bills with Mr. Ellet, Mr. Chambers, a banker, Mr.

            , Mr. Oughton, and without satiguing you with names, with a number of other persons he had made deposits of Exchequer-bills, which will be found to correspond precifely with those drawn from the Bank. Three of them were traced into the possession of Mr. Bish, one is stated in this indictment, another in this indictment is pledged with a person of the name of Oughton, and of the rest I will give you this account: After Mr. Aslett had been taken into custody, his desk in the Cashier's office was examined, and in that desk was an envelope which had contained 200,000l. and there were found in it, under his own lock any key, bills to the amount of 16000l. which ought to have been in the strong closet in the Bank, and which, with those issued to Mr. Bish and others, will account for the whole 200,000l. and, with the exception of these, all the Exchequer-bills that were in the custody of the Bank on the 26th of February; all that are not paid by Government, are found in their proper places. My case against him, therefore, is this - that he is entrusted with these for the especial purpose of making them up into bundles, and carrying them into the parlour - that, in doing so, he withdraws a portion of them; I evidence that, by shewing his depositing them for his own benefit; I prove the bought book the correspondence of those in the closet; with the bought book I shall shew you that these are withdrawn, and all the rest are there. Is it possible then to hesitate, in coming to that conclusion which affects the case of the prisoner, that in an unlucky moment he forgot his duty and embezzled this property.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I took the liberty of stating in the outset, that this case stood for trial at the former Session, and as it has occasioned much anxious speculation upon what ground it was not proceeded in, I will state what that ground was. I have however most distinctly to complain, and I hope their Lordships will not only forgive me in making that complaint, but perhaps they will join their high authority in the reprobation of that of which I now complain - I mean the gross and scandalous misrepresentations that have been made in various publications of the supposed causes of the trial being put off, and I hope to live to see the day in which the justice of the country will exert itself in the case of some poor unprotected man in rags, to punish those who dare, between the commitment of a person and his being arraigned before the trying Jury, to publish that by which he may run the risk of being prejudiced by exaggerated statements of his supposed guilt, by insinuations calculated to no possible good, but fraught with the utmost danger. Publications of this sort I have had the misfortune to see, respecting the gentleman at the bar; but I persuade myself confidently, that if any such have found their way into the hands of those to whom I am now addressing myself, you will discharge them from your minds altogether. It is our happy privilege, in the country in which we have the good fortune to live, to have the justice of the country administered by unprejudiced and impartial Juries, and I do hope that, if this practice of exciting prejudice in the public mind is not discontinued, the authors of it will meet with that condign punishment which they deserve.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I will now state what was the real cause of the postponement of this trial, and as it is of the last importance that those whom I here unworthily represent, should not misconduct themselves in respect of the high duty they have to perform on behalf of the public, I know their Lordships will forgive the small portion of time that I shall consume in that statement.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, you observe the particular securities, respecting which you are at present called upon to enquire, are described as Exchequer-bills, which you know are issued in consequence of loans made for the public service, and that they are issued under the regulation of particular Acts of Parliament. By the Loan Act of 1799, a clause was introduced from the increase of the business in the office, in consequence of the vast demands which the public services required, by which a provision was made, that Exchequer-bills shall be signed by the auditor of the Exchequer, or some person duly authorized by him, with the approbation of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, in writing, under their hands, or under the hands of any three or more of them. It occurred to us to know upon the investigation, which it became the duty of the Bank to make, in order to lay the regular evidence before the trying Jury, - it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060018"/>occuried to us to know, that upon the Loan of 1799, a gentleman of the name of Jennings was duly authorised to sign Exchequer-bills, but it happened, by some accident, which it is not for me to explain, that in the subsequent loans, though the same clause was inserted, requiring the authority of the person to sign for the Auditor of the Exchequer to be in the way I have stated, yet he continued to sign, acting under the old authority; - now it is clear, the public having derived the benefit of these loans, they have not suffered by this want of form, but as we were then at a period, when Parliament were not sitting, at a very important period, in the history of the country, we were aware that if it was to be stated, that all the Exchequer-bills which had been issued to the amount of many millions of money, had been issued with such an informality as to render them invalid, it might create such an alarm in the country as to affect the money market very considerably. The Counsel for the prisoner felt with me, and agreed with the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, that the trial should be postponed, and they took their share of the inconvenience till the period should arrive, when they might explain their conduct, they therefore took their share of the obliguy which might attach to it. The fact was no sooner known than the remedy was applied, a Bill was brought in reciting the former act, and reciting that the public had had the benefit of these Exchequer-bills, and therefore no fraud had been practised, thus the inconvenience is now removed. I hope the Court will excuse me for having taken up so much of its time, but I thought it necessary, in order to satisfy the public that there has been no improvident waste of time in the postponement that has taken place. The law that is now in force upon that subject, states that all Exchequer-bills issued previous to the passing of the present Act, signed by Mr. Jennings, should in all civil purposes be as valid from the first issuing of them as if they had been signed by the Auditor of the Exchequer.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I am not to conceal from you, that this fact of the invalidity of these Exchequer-bills does create a considerable difficulty in carring on this prosecution - it is not perhaps the proper season for me to say much more upon that subject - it is impossible, that at any time that question can be in better hands to be decided than it is by the Judges upon the present occasion; all the learning, and all the intelligence necessary to such a decision certainly presents itself in Court at present. If the Court, upon considering the current of cases upon the subject, should be of opinion that these are not Exchequer-bills, so as to punish the person entrusted with them, as embezzling them; if their Lordships should consider it a clear case against the validity of the prosecution, I shall be satisfied with that notification; if on the other hand they should think it a question of such magnitude to be considered by all the Judges of England, or whatever course they may think fit to take, we shall he perfectly satisfied. Your province, as you know, is merely to decide upon the important question of fact; if we prove the facts as I have stated them, you will discharge your duty with the firmness of men, and find him guilty; if you have any possible doubt, if the excellent character I have already attributed to him, and which I have no doubt may be manifested to you by the most respectable members of society, if all this can induce you to entertain a rational doubt, you will give him all the benefit of that doubt, and with greater pleasure pronounce that he is not guilty.</p>

             called.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, in order to save the time of the Court without entering at all this moment into the evidence, I wish, as Counsel for the prisoner, to address a few words to your Lordship's consideration. - My Lord, the indictment charges in every Count of it, either a larceny, or an embezzling of Exchequer Bills, which brings the question to this narrow point, whether under the circumstances which have been so honourably stated by my Learned Friend these are Exchequer Bills - Your Lordships have the Act of Parliament before you, and I believe also the late Act passed in consequence of this discovery being made of the informality in these Exchequer Bills. - Your Lordships see, in order to constitute these Exchequer-bills, the Act of Parliament, which alone can create these securities, must be observed, and there is no power given to the Lords of the Treasury to issue these bills, except in the form prescribed by the Act; they are either Exchequer Bills in the form prescribed by the Act, or they are nothing. The words are these, Provided always, that every such Exchequer-bill shall and may be signed by the auditor of the receipt of his Majesty's Exchequer, or in his name, by a person duly authorised by him, with the approbation of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in writing, under their hand, or by any three or more of them." Now it is admitted, that although Mr. Jennings had, in 1799, this special authority conferred upon him in strict conformity with this Act of Parliament, yet his authority did not extend beyond that which was given to him upon that occasion, namely, to legalize and create according to that Act of Parliament Exchequer-bills. By some oversight, without imputing blame to any body, that authority has not been renewed, these pieces of paper, therefore, are not Exchequer-bills, they are not Government Securities, they are nothing that your Lordship can recognize as a species of property. In this case, your Lordship observes, if I were to add any thing, I should be literally creating a difficulty where none exists; if we, on the part of the prisoner were to be entering into any analogies, into any legal considerations so as to assist your Lordship's judgement in deciding upon so plain a case as this, we should not be treating your Lordship with that respect we owe your Lordship, nor should we be serving the unfortunate gentleman with whose interests we are charged. My Lord, some cases are so extremely clear, that they will only be darkened by illustration; if there are securities which the Goverment have a right to create, it is for the Government to say under what forms it shall be created; the Government might direct that it should require no signature at all; they might direct that it should be signed by the Auditor of the Exchequer only; they might direct particular forms, they might create any form, or they might chuse to create no form, but unquestionably, if forms are prescribed, and those forms are not observed, the security is not created. Besides, I hold in my hand the legislative exposition of this; Parliament itself has declared it, and for us to labour from the bar what has been done by the Parliament of the kingdom, would be extremely pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060019"/>posterous. Parliament have declared them to be invalid, and if they had done otherwise, they would have fallen into the error they meant to correct; and considering the legal assistance which the Bank always have; and above all, the assistance which Parliament have, that it was the result of antecedent consideration, by those learned persons whose advice is always at hand upon such important occasions, namely, the assistance of the Attorney-General, himself a Member of the House of Commons, and other Crown-officers; I cannot suppose Parliament would have played and trifled with the securities of this country, especially in this momentous period, in which I think no one man can possibly differ from another. Parliament have thought fit to declare, after reciting the former Act, in the words stated by Mr. Garrow, that "Mr. Jennings was duly authorized by the said Auditor to sign the same with the approbation of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in writing under their hands, or of any three or more of them. And whereas

And whereas several subsequent Acts, for raising money by Loans or Exchequer-bills, have provided, that the Exchequer-bills to be issued under such Acts respectively, might be signed by such person as might be so authorised and approved as aforesaid, under and by virtue of each and every such Act respectively. And whereas the authority of the said Robert Jennings has been omitted to be renewed under each of the last-mentioned Acts, but notwithstanding such omission, the said

             has continued to sign such Exchequer-bills, as if the authority given to him by virtue of the said first mentioned Act of Parliament, had extended to all Exchequer bills, subsequently to be issued, and had not been confined to such Exchequer-bills as were issued under the said first mentioned Act of Parliament; and whereas the public have had the benefit of the money raised by virtue of such Exchequer-bills, respecting the validity of which doubts may arise; be it therefore enacted, that all such Exchequer-bills as have been issued by virtue of any Act or Acts of Parliament passed previous to the passing of the present Act, and which have been signed by the said Robert Jennings, in the name of the Auditor of the Receipt of his Majesty's Exchequer as aforesaid, shall be, and be deemed to be, and to have been for all civil purposes, contracts, and engagements, as valid, and in as full force to all intents and purposes from the first issuing of the same, as if the same had been issued by the said Auditor." Then there is that humane proviso, which does so much honour to the framers of the Law, and is so consistent with the true principles of the British Constitution, not to alter this just regulation, so as to affect the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, or any other person."Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to prejudice, or affect in any manner whatsoever, any prosecution now depending, or which may be hereafter commenced for, or relating to any Act done previous to the passing of this Act, touching, or concerning, or relating to the said Exchequer-bills, or any or them, so as aforesaid, signed by the said Robert Jennings of his Majesty's Exchequer." This Bill could not possibly have been brought into the House, it could not possibly have passed, but from the consideration of Parliament, that these papers, which would otherwise have been Exchequerbills, are void and invalid, not being issued according to the provisions of the Act. I really should feel, that I was not only wasting your Lordships' time, but that I was not paying that respect and reverence which it is always my duty to observe towards your Lordships, if I were to argue this point any farther. One word more, however, I must add, I cordially concur with my honourable and learned Friend in the concluding part of his address, adding this also, that after the painful attention I have been obliged to give to the whole of this case, I see nothing that human precaution, foresight, or diligence, on the part of those excellent servants of the public who compose the Bank of England, that could possibly have altered or affected any one circumstance that can this day come before the Court for their consideration. It would be unworthy in me to insinuate whether any guilt belongs to this prisoner, because the time is not yet come, but this I must say, that the Bank, from the beginning to the end, has conducted itself with that ability, that diligence, and that attention to the great duties that belong to it, and the great interests of the public connected with those duties, as to render such attacks as have been alluded to, more infamous, because they are false and unfounded.(Mr. Serjeant Best, on the same side, called their Lordships' attention to the words of the Act, which he read.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it becomes my duty to answer the argument of my learned friend; I admit, that for the purpose of proving the embezzlement, I must shew that this is an Exchequer-bill, and if it is not an Exchequer-bill for this purpose, to make it the subject of a charge upon an indictment, it is nothing. It appears to me the answer to my Learned Friend's argument is this, not that this is for all purposes a good Exchequer-bill, because to a certain extent my Learned Friend has a right to pray in aid a part of the late Act of Parliament, but otherwise they have taken care to leave this case precisely as it was before the passing of that Act."Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to prejudice, or affect in any manner whatsoever, any prosecution now depending, or which may be hereafter commenced for, or relating to any Act done previous to the passing of this Act" But with respect to that legislative exposition, even if we were in a civil action, your Lordships observe the expression in the Act, "whereas the public have had the benefit of the money raised by virtue of such Exchequer-bills, respecting the validity of which doubts may arise," and then it enacts that they shall have the same effect as if they were duly signed by the said Robert Jennings. My Lords, I am not attempting to say, that this is not a case of difficulty, but I am to submit to your Lordships such reasons as occur to me in answer to the objection. I say that, as against the Exchequer which issued that Bill, it was always a good Exchequer-bill, as against those who issue it; it should be taken to be an Exchequer-bill, with respect to the Bank of England, who buy it from the Exchequer, it must be taken to be an Exchequer-bill, but more abundantly as against the man who is entrusted with it as an Exchequer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060020"/>bill, and who, as an Exchequer-bill, embezzles it, it must be taken to be an Exchequer-bill.</p>

               <p>My Lords, the current of cases upon Bills of Exchange, and the stamp laws say this, that unless a Bill of Exchange shall bear upon it a stamp according to its denomination and value, it shall not be received as evidence in a Court of Law or Equity, and shall not be good or available. A case occurs to me of a man who signed his name to a paper, importing to be a Bill of Exchange; he was indicted for forging the Bill of Exchange of A. B. and it was proved clearly not to be the hand-writing of 
               <persName id="t18030706-34-person199">A. B. </persName>
            but the hand-writing of the prisoner. An objection was taken that it was not a Bill of Exchange. Why was it not a Bill of Exchange? It had a drawer, it had a payee, it had an acceptor, it had a sum, it had a date at which it was demandable, but it had not a stamp; and the law has said, that such a paper not having a stamp according to its denomination and value, shall not be received in evidence in any Court of Law or Equity, and shall not be good or available. Notwithstanding that, it has been decided by the wisdom of all the Judges, that for criminal purposes, that is, for the purpose of punishing the man who issues it as a Bill of Exchange, who obtains money upon it as a Bill of Exchange, that it shall not be open to him to call in aid a mere Revenue statute, to protect himself against the consequences of his own fraud, he having obtained money's worth upon it as a Bill of Exchange, and having no credit of his own, it shall not be permitted to him to say, it is not a Bill of Exchange. That is the case of

            . My Lords, it does not occur to me to add any thing more. I am free to confess it is not a case without difficulty; but I submit to your Lordships this ought as well to be considered an Exchequer Bill, as the instrument in that case was held to be a Bill of Exchange.</p>



               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, my Learned Friend had admitted, that in order to obtain your Lordship's judgment against the objection we have taken the liberty to make, he must convince your Lordships that this is an Exchequer-bill, for it is so stated to be in every Count in this indictment; and my Learned Friend sets out with that which undoubtedly he was bound to set out with as the foundation of his argument, that as the Bank Act makes it a capital felony for any person to embezzle the securities of the Bank, of England, that person being a servant of the Bank, and being entrusted with them, my Learned Friend must shew, that the prisoner at the bar has embezzled an Exchequer-bill, the property of the Bank of England. My Learned Friend, after being bound to state that he must convince your Lordships of that, goes on to say, it need not be to all intents and purposes an Exchequer-bill. My Lord, if I were to address myself to my Learned Friend in any other place than this, I need not, I think, labour very much to shew that it is not an Exchequer-bill; and if it is an Exchequer-bill, it is to all intents and purposes an Exchequer-bill. In order to see that an Exchequer-bill is to all intents and purposes an Exchequer-bill, one has only to see what is the nature of it; it is the same as any other security to any private person, and it entitles the party, if it is not paid at the period when it becomes due, to tender it as a set-off against the taxes which Government have a right to demand against him; it is to be taken in payment as a security of Government, which Government must receive in payment of the taxes, which they have a right to call upon the public for; it is therefore a security entitling the person who possesses it to a specific demand against Government, provided always that it is an Exchequer-bill. Supposing this Act of Parliament had not been made, and this paper had been offered for taxes due to Government; supposing it had been refused, and an action brought, and the question was, whether Government were bound to receive that as an Exchequer-bill? Undoubtedly it would be unworthy the character of such a Government as that of this country to have refused it; but surely if it had been referred to the Judges, they would have said Government are not bound to consider this as an Exchequerbill, because it is not an Exchequer-bill, unless it is signed by the Auditor of the Exchequer, or some person duly authorised by him, with the approbation of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in writing under their hands, or of any three or more of them. These were the checks Parliament thought fit to interpose for the safety of the public; they had no authority from the Government to issue them in their own name without these checks and counter-checks. The Auditor of the Exchequer had no right to issue these bills of his own authority; he must do it by the authority of the Lords of the Treasury, and he had no right to appoint his Deputy, but with the approbation of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in writing under their hands, or any three or more of them; but your Lordships observe, unless he is so authorised as this Act requires him to be authorised, it is the same as if it had been signed by my Learned Friend or myself. Mr. Jennings, who formerly signed Exchequer-bills, signed them under an authority that was valid; but it extended no further than the Act which gave him that authority; he was functus officis; his signature has no more validity than if it had the signature of the officer of this Court.</p>

               <p>Lord Chief Barm. Exactly the same as if it had not been signed at all.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Just so, my Lord. I ought to take notice of the single case that was cired by my Learned Friend, and that is the case of Colin Reculist. That was a charge against the prisoner, Reculist, for forging a promissory note, and when Mr. Justice Grose came to deliver the opinions of the Twelve Judges, he said this:"The crime as charged against the prisoner by the words of the indictment, is clearly and satisfactorily proved. The proposition arising from the objection is, that the paper-writing stated in the indictment is not a promissory note, because it is not upon a stamp, and therefore cannot be given in evidence; but the question whether it is or is not a promissory note, depends upon the tenor of the instrument, and not upon the circumstance of its being stamped or not. Would it be possible to say if a man was charged upon the Revenue laws with issuing a promissory not unstamped, that that note shall not be offered in evidence, when the very charge is for having issued it without a stamp. Upon the whole I submit to your Lorships that the objection is good.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060021"/>Lord Chief Baron. In considering questions of this kind, the magnitude of the offence can have no influence upon our decision; whether it is to the amount of a million of pounds, or half a crown, the law must be the same. To be sure, at such a time as this, if the offence did exist, we cannot but regret that it cannot be investigated, and investigated to conviction; but let us consider this, that we are making a small sacrifice to the regular and orderly administration of justice, as it has been handed down to us by our ancestors. We may thank God we have but few instances, in which it becomes necessary to make the sacrifice; and though amidst a great variety of cases now and then the guilty may escape by the defective forms of law, yet we have reason to believe it is the only price we pay, and it is but a small one for the stability of our criminal code.</p>

               <p>As to the argument that this bill was taken by the Bank as a genuine Exchequer bill, that bill will not bear upon the fact, whether it is an Exchequer-bill or not. In the case of the forgery, the party was charged with having uttered a forged instrument, purporting to be a true one; but here it is positively charged in the indictment that this is a genuine instrument; I am therefore of opinion the objection is good.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. In this case I form my opinion upon the very words of the indictment. In all the Counts this instrument is called an Exchequer-bill, and the question turns upon, whether it is an Exchequer-bill or not; and as I construe this Act, it is impossible for me to say it is an Exchequer-bill.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. It is certain, that in all indictments you must prove the property as it is charged; as for instance in cases of larceny, you must prove the goods as they are charged in the indictment. Here the charge is, that the prisoner embezzled an Exchequerbill, and a bill commonly called an Exchequer-bill; it must be proved, therefore, to be an Exchequer-bill. In the case stated by Mr. Garrow, the essence of the charge was not that he made a Bill of Exchange, but that he made a false instrument, purporting to be a Bill of Exchange; but here the essence of the charge is, that this is a good and true Exchequer-bill; but I am of opinion my Lord Grenville's name ought to have been put to it to make it valid.</p>

               <p>Lord Chief Baron. Gentlemen of the Jury, you will acquit the prisoner.</p>

Yes, on the 11th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, she came in to match two bits of lace that she had in her hand: I told her I had not any of the same; I was in the shop alone; I carried some lace to some ladies in a carriage before she came in; I came back into the shop, leaving the lace in the carriage; I then went back again to the carriage, leaving the prisoner in the shop; I had told her I had no lace of that sort; I saw her go to the box where I had taken the lace from; I saw her hand in the box; it was on the opposite side of the shop from where I had left her; she took a piece of lace out with her right-hand; I went into the shop, and asked her, what she was going to do with that piece of lace; she said, she had not got any; I told her, I had seen her take a piece; I pulled down her apron, and there I found the piece of lace. - (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A.Six pounds and upwards prime cost; as I had got my property I let her go, but some people about the door took her to Bow-street, and I was sent for; I did not with to prosecute her.</p>

             sworn. - Q. At what time on the 27th of May did any thing happen to you? - A. At eleven o'clock at night, I was going to Hertford; I was short of money; I wanted to follow the waggon for company.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you come from? - A. Turnhamgreen; a man knocked me down.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was that? - A.About a mile from <placeName id="t18030706-37-crimeloc207">Hammersmith</placeName>

               <p>Q.Where was the man? - A. Up against the pales by a bush.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you before he knocked you down? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.What did he knock you down with? - A. His fist, and then he wanted to be concerned with me; he said, he would lie with me, and I cried, murder! he said, he would pull my tongue out if I cried out any more; he beat me with his fist as long as he could; you never saw such a head as I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he strike you with his fist? - A. Every where; my head was as big as a peck, and he stamped upon my stomack; then he wanted to force my body; he put his hand up my petticoats, and used me terribly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he take any thing from you? - A. Yes, a basket with some trifles that I had; he did not leave me a halfpenny worth to sell; he ran away with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did he go away - did any body come up to you? - A. No creature; I crawled upon my hands and knees till I met the watchman, Gibbs, and he guided me to an alehouse; the man was just gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see your basket again? - A. Yes, at the Justice's the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. It was not light enough to see the man's face? A. Not to take full observation; I saw that he was of a dark complexion.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there in this basket? - A. Books and ballads, cotton-laces, and a few sewingneedles; I had but a penny in the world; there was a pair of spectacles, some needles for making cabbage-nets, and a night-cap.</p>

               <p>RICHARD GIBBS sworn. - Q.What are you? - A. I am night constable and watchman of the parish of Hammersmith.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time seeing that old woman? - A. Yes, five weeks ago last Saturday, about one o'clock in the morning, at the bottom of Hammersmith; she was crawling along on her hands and knees on the foot-path; I took her to the Chaise and Horses, a night-house, where the carts and waggons stop when they go to market; she was in a very bloody condition, and her head swelled as big as a peck; the blood ran out of her mouth; her eyes were very much swelled; she was quite frightful for any one to see; both her hands were bloody all over.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether that was blood that had dropped from her mouth, or from an injury done to her hands? - A.I did not; her face was cut very much.</p>

               <p>MATTHEW WELLS sworn. - Q.Were you at the Chaise and Horses at Hammersmith when Gibbs came in with the old woman? - A. Yes, last Saturday five weeks; I live there as ostler.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - A.About a quarter before three o'clock, I think, in the morning, and in consequence of what they told me, I came to London in pursuit of the man; I rode with Mr. Rutter, a butcher, to Oxendon-street; then I went back into Piccadilly, and met a man with a basket three doors on the other side of Air-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. He said over night that his name was 
               <persName id="t18030706-37-person208">

            .</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him over night? - A. Yes, he had had two half pints of beer at our house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, that is the man; when I met him, I said, good morning to you, and he said the same to me. It rained very hard, and I asked him if he was not wet; he said, he was only a little wet at his back; I said, he had not come far; he said, he had come from Brentford; I asked him to go and have half a pint of purl; I said, I thought it would not hurt him; he said, he thought it would do him good; and when we had got about one hundred and twenty yards, I took him by the collar, and told him he was my prisoner; the watchman was in his watch-box, and we took him to Vine-street watch-house; I took the basket from him, and delivered it to the constable of the night; it contained some books and ballads, some laces, and other things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He asked me what I had to sell in the basket, and I said it did not belong to me, it belonged to another man.</p>

               <p>Wells. I asked him what he had got to sell, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060023"/>he said he had not got any thing to sell; he did not say any thing more till he got to the watch-house, and then he said another man gave it him.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What time did you see him at the Chaise and Horses? - A. Not till between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before the other witness and the old woman came in? - A.About an hour and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body with him at that time? - A. Nobody.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he the basket with him at that time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. At the Chaise and Horses? - A. Yes; the basket stood upon the table before him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same man? - A. I am very sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was he at the Chaise and Horses? - A.Half an hour; I dare say.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - A. No, I never spoke to him while he was in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take notice of him? - A. Because I saw the basket standing upon the table, and I saw him there.</p>

               <p>Q. What induced you to remark him more than any body else? - A. I always do, when any strangers come in at night; I was in and out, and saw him several times.</p>

               <p>Q. How long a time might you be in the room when the prisoner was there? - A. I suppose I might be in five or six minutes at a time, three or four different times.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think you cannot be mistaken about the man? - A. I am sure I am not.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he say a man had given it to him before he got to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>CHARLES LUPPINO sworn. - I am a constable; On the 27th of May last, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house at three o'clock in the morning by Wells; he gave me a basket, which I have had the care of ever since, (produces it); it contains the same articles that it contained when I first received it; I asked him his name, and he said, his name was John Kelly; but the next morning he said, at the Office, that his name was John Thompson, and that John Kelly was the man who had beat the woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the Magistrate take down his examination in writing? - A. No, not any thing that the prisoner said.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had charged him with beating the woman? - A.The ostler.</p>

               <p>HENRY GOUGH sworn. - I am a watchman; On the 27th of May, the ostler came to me about half after two o'clock, and made enquiry if I had seen such a man, describing him; about five minutes afterwards, I saw him again, with the prisoner, and he gave me charge of him; I took him to the watch-house, he had a basket upon his arm, which the ostler took from him, I marked it at the watch-house, I saw it delivered into the care of the constable.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Hurst.) Look at that basket? - A. It is mine; these cabbage-net needles are mine, I have had them these twenty years; here is a comb of mine, my cap, and my spectacles, these things were all covered over with paper to keep them dry; here is a pin-cushion, there were three of them.</p>

               <p>Q.How was the man dressed? - A.In a jacket.</p>

               <p>(To Luppino.) How was the man dressed when he was brought to the watch-house? - A.In a blue jacket; the next morning, as I was taking him to the watch-house, the old woman saw him, and immediately exclaimed, that is the villain.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of what is said against me; I left Brentford about ten o'clock; and as I came to Hyde Park turnpike, a sailor came up to me, and we walked together, it was very wet and dark, and in Piccadilly he gave me a glass of gin at the public-house; when we came out, he asked me to carry the basket, while he did a little job for himself, and I thought no harm of it, then this gentleman laid hold of me, I never was at the Chaise and Horses in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she open the door? - A. She lifted up the latch, and when she came away, she left it wide open, they both ran down the street, and round the corner; they came back again in about a quarter of an hour, and one of them said, here goes it again.</p>

               <p>Q.Which of them was that? - A. I believe it was the big one, but they went away and did not do any thing, there were some children about, and they went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen these women except going into a chandler's-shop before that day? - A. Yes, I have seen them a good many times, a long while ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure they are the women? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Anderson.) Did you at any time lose any property out of your house? - A. Yes, on Tuesday, the 21st of June.</p>

               <p>ANN ANDERSON sworn. - Q.Did you at any time in June last lose any thing out of your house? - A.

               <p>Q. Had they been washed by you? - A. Yes, all washed, and ready for sending home; I brought them between two and three o'clock into the front parlour, locked them in, and left the key in the door; I left one window a little way open, with a muslin curtain before it, to let the air in; I went out about four o'clock, and returned between eight and nine; when I got into my own door, I missed my things.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the door when you came back? - A. I cannot tell, I believe it was locked, but cannot say; I have seen one of the handkerchiefs at the pawnbroker's, and one at another, which I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the house? - A.My husband, at work in the shop, in the back part of the house, in the back parlour.</p>

               <p>Sophia Blundell's defence. I live in the same house with Glover; she came to my door about six o'clock, I let her in, she asked me if I would give her any thing to drink, I said, I did not care, she said, she had no money, but would take nine-pence for a pocket-handkerchief, which I gave her, and we had something to drink; she fetched it, I saw the stockings in her possession, and went with her to the pawnbrokers to pawn them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the sheep on Monday morning in the market? - A. I saw all the drove, except five, on the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they all of one lot, or of different lots? - A.They belonged to three different employers.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information you received, did you go to the house of Wells, in Turnmill-street, on the Monday morning? - A. I did, about noon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you there find the carcases of any sheep? - A. I found five sheep hanging by the heels, and the sat and feet of two in a pail.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did they lay? - A. On the ground, by the pail; they were all locked up in a dark place, separated from the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it parted off, so that they were concealed from view? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A.Dark, so that you could not discover what there was without a candle.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you enabled to form any belief, whether they were the carcases of the five sheep you lost? - A. Yes, they certainly were the carcases of the five sheep I had lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and him? - A. No more than I told him to mind the penns, and I would look after them myself.</p>

               <p>Q.How soon did you see him again? - A. About two hours and a half; when I had got some information, I went back and saw the prisoner standing by the penns, I and my master went to the butcher's-shop.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you apprehend Wells? - A. It might be about three quarters of an hour after, between twelve and one.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he left your service, or was he about it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Where is it? - A. Just down Cow-cross.</p>

               <p>Q. If they came direct from Mile-end, they should come down Long-lane? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you know whether the other drove you sent him for, and which he brought came down Long-lane? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the last drove come in by Turnmill-street? - A. Yes; I said, Chubby, this is not the way from Mile-end; he said, the sheep had broke out at the top of Long-lane, and had run that way.</p>

               <p>Q.Had he a dog to assist in driving? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What age is he? - A. I don't know, he may be fourteen or fifteen.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where they broke out? - A. No, that is all that passed between him and me.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you send him for the last lot? - A. It might be about half-past nine at night.</p>

               <p>Q. How long would it require for such a lad to go and fetch them? - A.About a couple of hours, if the sheep are not very lame.</p>

               <p>JOHN BOYLE sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. A patrol.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday night the 24th of April, did you see any sheep in Turnmill-street? - A. Yes, a considerable quantity.</p>

               <p>Q. In whose care were they? - A. The prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other person? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Did you know him before? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Whose house were they opposite? - A. The sheep were between Mr. Booth's, the distiller's, and the street, called Benjamin-street, opposite the house of Harvey, otherwise Wells, a butcher.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did they stop there? - A. Near half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that circumstance induce you to make any particular observation? - A. After I had information by the watchman, and seeing a light in a certain house, I went and put my foot on a window shutter of Wells's house, and looked in, and saw him begin killing the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. How many did you see him kill? - A. I could not say, because he wavered about with the light in his hat, which is deceiving.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him kill more than one or two? - A. Yes, and saw him put them in a concealed place, on the right-hand side of the shop, because I knew where to find them when I obtained the warrant.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Butler watch as well as you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Wells go out in the morning? - A. Yes, about five o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him? - A. Yes, a bundle under his right-arm.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060027"/>Q. You gave such information as led the prosecutor to the house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Did you see the prisoner converse with Wells? - A. I saw him with no person.</p>

               <p>Q.What was he doing? - A.Standing to and fro with the drove very near the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he stand close to the house? - A. Not far from it, within a door or two; he might have been to the house and walked away, as I approached it.</p>

               <p>Q. How were the sheep? - A.Both on the pavement, and on the road, in every direction round the house.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner was not attempting to drive them on? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see Wells take any sheep into his house? - A. No, the house was in darkness, and the camps were out.</p>

               <p>Q.You did not see Wells drive any sheep in? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JAMES BUTLER sworn. - Q.Are you a watch man in Turnmill-street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday night, the 24th of April, did you see any sheep? - A. Yes, a great quantity.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see who had the care of them? - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I had often seen him go by with sheep.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Had you seen him drive any sheep that way the same evening before? - A. No, only that time; there were no sheep on that spot at twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, you saw him go by driving sheep, often before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the sheep standing before Wells's door? - A. No, mostly going on; I never took particular notice.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. There were no sheep in Wells's shop, at twelve o'clock? - A. No, it is close to my box; because I heard nothing at all; the moment I came round, and the slock was gone, I heard them bleating.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did they stand there? - A.About half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. You told Boyle this? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CHALLICE sworn. - I am a Police-Officer, and apprehended the prisoner on the 2d of June, in Smithfield, at the Golden-Lion, between twelve and one at night; the landlord was pushing him out of the house.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.(To Smith.) When you missed the sheep, you say, you talked to the boy about it, that he had brought them the wrong way? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said about being done out of the sheep? - A. No, I said that to the drover.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of the sheep, I brought them along from Mile-end road, down Barbican, when a dog ran in among them, and they ran away from me down Goswell-street; I followed them, and when they stopped, I turned them down the first street I came to into St. John's-street, and then went into Smithfield.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DEAN sworn. - On Friday, the 1st of July, I took the prisoner, who was by the mare; I asked who owned it; it had been pointed out by the prosecutor; the prisoner said it was his, for he bought it that morning; the prosecutor came up, and I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went down the road after some money, and met a man with the mare, who offered to sell her; I gave him eight pounds for her, and brought her to Smithfield, thinking to make a trifle by her; I stood by her side, and offered her for sale for ten pounds; after that came the officers, and asked me if I was owner of the mare; I said, yes; they said they would own the mare and me too, and took me into custody.</p>

               <p>JOHN TUBBS sworn. - I am ostler to Mr. Harrison, at the Castle and Falcon, in Aldersgate-street, and bought the mare of the prisoner on Tuesday, the 14th of June, in Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand; I thought it would suit a waggoner, and gave 3l. 10s. I thought it was so trifling an affair, I asked no questions; I sold it to Sharp, a publican, in Little Britain, about an hour after I bought it; I was taken into custody on account of it; I saw the mare again when I was in custody, but I cannot swear to it; it looked like the same I bought.</p>

               <p>JOHN KIRBY sworn. - I am horsekeeper at the Castle and Falcon, and was going down Angel-street, and saw the prisoner, on the 14th of June, about three minutes after nine in the morning, stooping down rubbing the mare's legs, but I did not see Tubbs with her; I saw her again at Guildhall on Friday, and am sure it was the same black mare, with a star in her forehead; Tubbs was taken to Guildhall on Friday, when I saw the mare which I had seen in the prisoner's possession; Sharp took Tubbs into custody for the mare.</p>

               <p>DANIEL GRAHAM sworn. - On the 17th of June I saw Sharp, who said he was charged with having a stolen mare; I went with him and the prosecutor, and took Tubbs into custody, of whom he bought it; I asked him to give up who he had the mare from; he told me, and I attended Smithfield, and next morning the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GODDARD sworn. - I am a constable; I saw Tubbs in trouble, and, knowing him, I interfered; I found the prisoner was coming into the neighbourhood on Saturday, and I went and took him in Angel-street; he asked why he was a prisoner; I told him, and he denied it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never sold the property, or had it in my possession.</p>

               <p>JOHN COLSEY sworn. - I am a soldier in the Tower Hamlets militia, and was going on duty at four o'clock; the ladder stood opposite where I live; I saw the prisoners come under the ladder standing in the street; I saw Welch go up the ladder, the other remained at bottom, and said, you go up, I'll look out; Welch went up, and jumped off the parapet into the gutter; he attempted to pull the window one way, and it would not open; he then pulled it the other, got it open, and went in; in the course of a minute he brought out these furs into the gutter; I run down, and opened the door gently, and secured Collins; I saw Welch above three paces from the window; seeing me secure Collins, he threw the things towards the window he brought them from, and laid himself down in the gutter to hide himself; I then knocked at the prosecutor's door; while I was securing Collins, the other came down; I saw him come out of White-Lion-passage; the moment I gave the other in charge, I pursued him, and caught him by the New Church, in the Strand; I am sure Welch is the person I saw go up the ladder; when I took him, he said, you'll recollect you took me in the Strand, and I have no property about me; when Welch came out of the passage, Collins said, that is he who went into the window.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM ROBINSON sworn. - I am a staymaker; I got up at four o'clock, and heard a noise in the street; I saw the last witness and Collins scuffling together; I run down, and assisted him; a few minutes after the other came down White-Lion-passage, Collins said, that is the thief; I held Collins while Colsey fetched the other back; I am beadle of the parish, and locked them up.</p>

               <p>Welch's defence. I was going up quick to Tottenham-court-road on an errand, and that man caught me, saying, he was looking for a boy, as he had one in custody who had committed a robbery.</p>

               <p>Collins's defence. I was going to work in Newgate-market, and that man took hold of me, and held me for half an hour, and said there was a man at the top of the house, and then brought this boy to me I never saw before, and took us to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I purchase those hose from your shop? - A. Yes, in the manner I have stated.</p>

               <p>Q. Did I promise to pay the porter? - A.You did.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON sworn. - I am porter to Mr. Lobb; I was ordered by Mr. Wilson to go with the prisoner, and bring back nine guineas for the goods; I followed the prisoner to the India House; up two pair of stairs, on the landing-place, he took the parcel out of my hand, and told me he was to give me nine guineas, and desired me to stop, and he would pay me; he went along the passage, and I followed him at a diftance, as I thought he was gone to some of the Offices; going further on in the passage I perceived a stair-case, and the prisoner nearly at the bottom, when I saw him put the parcel into his pocket; I run down stairs, but could see no more of him till I saw him at Bow-street about a fortnight after.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you hear any words between Wilson and me? - A.You asked for a bill of parcels, and said you would pay the person who took them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. The indictment charges me with having stolen this property; it is evident I went and fairly purchased them, and they were delivered to me at the India-House.</p>

             sworn. - (Produces the skins and tails.) I asked him where he got them; he said, he bought them in the Strand, near Fleet-street; I asked him to shew me the house; he said then, he bought them of a man for a guinea and a half in the street, and he could not find him out.(The property identified by Mr. Lange.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Friday last I was in Fleet-street, and met with the porter in distress with his load; I helped him as well as another man; he asked me to carry the bag to a place just by Somerset-house; I went, but did not know where to go, he got before me; I meant to overtake him, but there was an interruption by the coaches, and I lost him; I came back, and looked about Temple-bar; I could not find him; I went back again, I did not know what to do with the property; I went to my odging, my landlord would not take them in; I went and offered them for sale, being persuaded to do so, as I could not find the owner and not knowing the value of them.</p>

I do perfectly well; she came about eleven o'clock at night, on the 18th of June, and asked for a glass of anniseed, which I gave her, and she tendered me this shillings, (produces it;) I told her it was a very bad one; she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out some halfpence; among them, I saw a shilling; I said, you have got another shilling there, that is a good one, is it not, and immediately took it out of her hand; I saw it was a bad one, and kept that, (produces it;) at that time, the watchman came in, and told me, in her hearing, she had just been over to my opposite neighbour, the butcher, and offered one of them, with a hole in it, I told him I had not got that; I then gave charge of her, and sent her to the watch-house; about ten minutes after I had given charge of her, I heard that some more money was found, and I went to the watch-house.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; I saw the prisoner in the butcher's shop; I saw the young man return a shilling to her; he said, it was a bad one, she went away, and said she would call again; I crossed afterwards almost immediately, because I had knowledge of her before, she went into Mr. Smith's, the Seven-stars, and had some liquor at the bar; Mr. Smith said it was a bad shilling, she then put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out some halfpence; Mr. Smith said, there is another shilling, he took it out of her hand, and said, why, this is a bad one too, I shall keep them both; then Mr. Smith gave me charge of her, I took her to the corner of Church street, she insisted upon it she would not go any farther, and threw herself down upon some steps, there were some pallisadoes close to the steps; I did not then suspect any thing; I called my brother watchman, and took her to the watch-house; going along, she said, you need not take me, for I have ding'd them.</p>

               <p>Q. What does that mean? - A. That she had thrown them away; she was searched by the beadle, at the watch-house, but nothing found upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of what she said, did you go back to the place where she had stopped? - A. My partner did, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you pick them up? - A. I saw the first picked up by a person that was standing there, and the other two were picked up immediately by the light of my lantern.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HART sworn. - Q. You are the beadle of the night? - A. Yes; I searched the prisoner at the watch-house; I asked her how many more bad shillings she had about her; she said she had none, she had taken care and ding'd them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any money upon her, good or bad? - A. No. (Produces the three shillings.)</p>

               <p>Q.(To Pugh.) Look at these three shillings, and tell me, if you recollect either of them? - A. I recollect this one with the hole in it perfectly well.</p>

               <p>THOMAS STEVENSON sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the East-India Company, and am a City constable; my duty is to inspect the lighters; I know the place where the Thames lay moored head and stern at Blackwall, and am sure it was on the Middlesex side, and the Hannah too; I saw her when she went to load the cargo, about two days before, and know she was found, no planks had started, and she hatchways were safe; when she came back to the quay, I saw that two boards had been broken off the foremost hatch; the prisoner is a lighterman, employed by Mr. Bryan, and had the Montreal lighter, employed there at the same time, but his duty was to come up with the Montreal; he had nothing to do with the Hannah.(Ralph Carr confirmed the testimony of Williams.)</p>

             sworn. - I am the East-India Company's surveyor; I saw the bags on board the Hannah; the tea in them was of the same quality as that on board the Thames, and the Hannah, value about three or four and twenty pounds; I saw two empty chests, and some tea scattered upon the floor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is it not customary if a chest breaks in the unloading, to put it in bags? - A. Yes; but they are different bags from those.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you find Skinner and Knife there, who belonged to the Hannah? - A. The lad, Knife, spoke out of the cabin; the Company's bags are always numbered; these bags appear to be the King's bread bags. (The tea and bags produced.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Monday, the 6th of June, I went to Blackwall with Davidson to load the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060035"/>Montreal lighter; I went ashore, and got very much in liquor; Davidson told me he would shove the lighter off, and come for me to go away with the side; I went to sleep, but he never came; I went to the place where he appointed to haul the lighter to, but she was not there; I then went to the place where she was before, and going over the Hannah, I fell down the hold, being in liquor; as soon as I found myself, I got up as well as I could; then they came, and asked me how I came there; I told them I was in liquor, and fell down.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Was there any mark on any of the money? - A. Yes, I think there was, but I cannot tell; I have forgot it, money is so much alike.</p>

               <p>Q.Recollect, you have been before a Justice, and described it to him? - A. I cannot recollect at all; I said there was some mark, but I cannot recollect what, I have got so much on my mind.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it marked with letters? - A. Yes, but I cannot tell what; I will swear I don't recollect it; there are many shillings marked alike.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you heard the prisoner that morning? - A. I heard him go out in the morning about four o'clock, but I cannot say he was the person who took it.</p>

               <p>SARAH TAYLOR sworn. - I am sister to the last witness, and saw her count her money on the table on the Wednesday evening, but did not see where she put it; I suppose she put it into her pocket; I observed one shilling marked; she was very tipsy, and did not know what she did; I have seen the shilling since, and it was marked L. B. N. I saw Browne, the officer, with it, and saw him take it out of the prisoner's box in his room, while the prisoner was in bed.</p>

               <p>- BROWN sworn. - I am an officer: On Thursday morning, the prosecutrix came to Shadwell-office, and said, she had had her house broke open, and described the money, by the marks, to the Magistrate; I examined the prisoner's box while he was by, and found nineteen shillings in silver, and one shilling marked, but not in a glove; I asked Ann Wayman if she knew any of the money; she said, one shilling was marked L. B. N. the B was a cypher, and she picked out the shilling, but she told the marks before, and so did her sister; the prisoner said it was his own money.(The shilling produced and identified by Taylor.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is money I worked hard for; I have lately buried my wife, and have a child at nurse which I pay for; I never touched money not my own any more than I did this; I had a shilling this morning with three letters on it, but I cannot read, no more can Mrs. Wayman.</p>

             sworn. - Taylor came into my house this morning, and said, she should not come against the prisoner, if the officer had not fetched her out, and put words into her mouth, and was very sorry for the prisoner, and what she should do she did not know; she was crying, and positively declared that she would run away from the officer, and not appear against the prisoner.(Grace Hill confirmed the testimony of the last witness.)</p>

               <p>Q.(To Sarah Taylor.) You have heard what Harris has said; is it true that you said you would not have said what you did before the justice, if the officer had not put the words in your mouth? - A. I did not know the nature of an oath; I said, I did not know what I then said.</p>

               <p>Q. Is what she says true? - A. I don't think I said so.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot positively say you did not tell her to? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q.Was the prisoner in the habit of coming into your room to eat or drink? - A. Yes, when his wife was alive, but was not in the room that evening that I know of.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030706-55-verdict318" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you any idea how much you drank that day? - A. I can tell within a glass or two; I had about five glasses in the course of the day, and about two the last hour; I was not so very drunk.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not picked up senseless from liquor, and carried into a house? - A. I was senseless after he choaked me.</p>

               <p>Q.When did you come to your senses? - A. About twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Who the person was, you have no idea? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not been laying down, and rolling about? - A. No, I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>Q.Where had you been that day? - A. The last house I was in was the White Swan in New Gravel-lane; I was two hours in one public-house, and one in another, and at a cook-shop, where I had a glass or two.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you spend two hours that day out of a public-house? - A. Yes, three.</p>

               <p>MARGARET FELLOWES sworn. - I live in Gravel-lane: On the 3d of June I was putting up my shutters, after ten o'clock, and saw the prosecutor sitting on some steps as if he was half asleep, opposite to my house; the watchman came up, and the prisoner said, is that you, watchman; he said, yes, and he gave him some beer which he was carrying towards No. 128, an old ironshop, where he went in; soon after I saw him come up, and stand across the prosecutor's legs, and say something, but cannot say what; I thought he was a friend of the prosecutor's, as I saw him very busy and active in searching his pockets; the last thing I saw him do was to draw something from his neck, which I judged to be a handkerchief, but could not say, he then dragged him to the ground, and left him laying on his right side. I called to him, and told him he had robbed the man; the prosecutor said, he has taken a handkerchief off my neck; I stepped across the way, and saw his handkerchief was gone, and his shirt collar torn. Barrow went into No. 128, and shut the door; I have known him a great while; I followed him, and told him I would charge an officer with him; the woman of the house insisted on my going out, and Barrow came out, shut the door, and made his escape down the New Road; she said her husband was dying, and she could have no officers there. The prisoner went past the prosecutor, and stepped over him as he lay.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you ever had any dispute with the prisoner? - A. No, I never spoke to him before.</p>

               <p>Q.How far was the drunken man from your door? - A. At the corner of No. 130, the width of the street; I was standing at my own door, and went to the door of No. 47, immediately opposite to the prisoner and prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it not very dark? - A. No; I saw him draw the handkerchief off.</p>

               <p>Q. It was easy for whoever did it to see you? - A. Yes, and Barrow did see me I believe; I called him by his name.</p>

               <p>Q. After some person had taken the handkerchief, you went and spoke to the man? - A. I said, you have robbed the man.</p>



               <p>Q. The prosecutor was not laying senseless on the ground? - A. No, or else he could not have spoke; he was stupid when he was taken into the house of Connor. I am informed the prisoner lives in Fox's-lane with his mother; he was taken at a public-house almost opposite to me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent, and have several witnesses of it.</p>

               <p>Evidence for the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Where do you live? - A. In New Gravel-lane, next door to Mrs. Fellowes. I saw the prosecutor on the 3d of June, as he lay on the ground much in liquor, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and the prisoner pass him, but he did nothing to him, I saw Mrs. Fellows feeling about his neck, and then she gave an alarm that he had been robbed; I was sitting at my window, and must have seen it if any body had taken any thing from the man; I helped to carry him into Mrs. Connor's, he was do drunk and senseless.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How far off the place where the man was laying do you lodge? - A. Over the way at No. 47, in the front chamber, one-pair-of-stairs; Margaret Cullen was with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any other persons there? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How were you employed? - A. I was taking care of her, she was sick, and was sitting by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060037"/>window for the air; the sash was up; we might be sitting there for half an hour; when I first looked out the man was laying there; I saw nobody go near him; I saw Barrow pass him after Mrs. Fellowes crossed the way, and went straight down the lane towards New Crane. I was sitting at the window when Mrs. Fellowes called out, and had not been absent from it; there was no candle in the room; I did not say any thing to Mrs. Fellowes, but went down stairs two or three minutes after, and found her standing by the prosecutor, and she then went into her own house, and no where else that I saw; she did not leave the prosecutor till he was carried into the house.</p>

               <p>Q. After you saw Barrow pass the man, Mrs. Fellowes called out he was robbed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you? - A.Looking out at the window.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you sitting? - A. Yes, in a chair, facing the window.</p>

               <p>Q.What was between the chair and the window? - A.Nothing.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you as close to the window as you could go? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What induced you and the sick woman to be at the window at that time? - A. She was sitting up for her husband.</p>

               <p>Q. How did it happen the sick woman, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, was close to the window thrown open? - A. She was getting rather better; I had been with her six months; she had been bad near three years and an half.</p>

I cannot tell, but she was feeling about his neck; she said, she believed he was robbed of his handkerchief, and believed it was by a tall man who had passed; I had seen a tall man go from him; she said, he was not very tall, but he was the villain of a cobler who had hindered her getting her windows paid for by the person who broke them; many other things passed between her and I, we being in the habits of friendship; after that I saw the prosecutor helped by six people or more into Mrs. Connor's house.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you see the tall man do any thing to the prosecutor? - A. No, nobody but Mrs. Fellowes; several people said he had no handkerchief on at all.</p>

               <p>Q.What was the occasion of the candle being there - what were you doing with it? - A. We had it to see to go to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Ann Mountess sup with you? - A. Yes, and went down into the crowd afterwards, which was a quarter past ten; I cannot tell whether she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060038"/>had been sitting at the window or not; I had, for that is my situation always for the sake of the air.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had your husband been at home before supper? - A. He was at home from about four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q.Had he been out afterwards? - A. No, I am sure of that.</p>

My husband was dangerously ill, and I desired she would not make a noise, for she knocked violently at the door; they were not ordered out, but went out together; I never saw the prisoner but twice before, and then he came with shoes for my husband.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.(To Ann Mountess.) Did I understand you rightly, that you had not been absent from the window for better than half an hour? - A. Yes, I did say so.</p>

On Friday the 26th of May, I heard a noise, and heard the prosecutrix say, she had been robbed; I saw Wild come out of the door, and almost at the same time I saw the other prisoner's head out of the window up stairs; Wild walked away, and the prosecutrix pursued him; I went up stairs, and found Haggis hid in a closet; I brought him into the street, where I found Wild, who was taken; I asked them what they had done with the things; Haggis said, if I would go with them, he would produce them; he took me to the closet, and delivered me this bag and watch.(Produces them.)(The watch and cloaths identified.)</p>



               <p>Haggis's defence. My landlord gave me liberty to try the cloaths, as I intended to buy them; I went home soon that day, and the chest was left open for the purpose of trying them on; in trying them, I found the watch in the pocket.</p>

            , jun. sworn. - I live at No. 4, Mitchell-street, near St. Luke's, but did not receive a letter or 5l. note on the 20th of April.</p>

               <p>Mr. HUGH FERGUSON sworn. - I am inspector of the letter-carriers. When letters arrive from different parts of the country, they are sorted in the inland office to twelve districts for London, which are distinguished by numbers; Mitchell-street, in Old-street, is in No. 8. Those first twelve divisions are again subdivided for delivery into 116. It daily happens in the first sorting that letters are sorted to a district to which they do not properly belong; in which case it is the duty of the subdivision to carry it to the proper division. On the 20th of April the prisoner was employed in the 11th division, to sort the franked and paid letters; and supposing a paid letter by mistake to be sent to the 11th division, it would come into his possession, and his duty would have been to hand it over to the 8th. On the 20th of April there were letters missorted; there is a charge taken to each division who keeps a book, and that book contains an account of the charges for letters missorted and sent back; the amount was 2l. 18s. 11d. in the 11th division.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Anthony Foxlow? - A. Yes, he was at the 9th division, and has been employed in the Office near thirty years; he is a hosier as well.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know one Wells? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he? - A. A letter-carrier and sorter.</p>

               <p>Q. At what number did he attend? - A. At the 9th division.</p>

               <p>Q. What is become of him? - A. He has absconded, he being in arrears to the Office.</p>

               <p>Q.Wells would be nearer to No. 8, and so would Foxlow, than the prisoner's place of division? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM NEWTON sworn. - I am clerk in the Bank, and produce a Bank-note, dated the 14th of July, 1802, No. 6413, for 5l. entered on the 21st of April, as received of Esdaile and Co.</p>

               <p>JOHN BOYLES sworn. - I am a clerk in the Bank, and received a list from Esdaile's house on the 21st of April, the total of which was 1741l. there were seventy-eight 5l. notes; we have nothing to do but to see that they are good; this was a good Bank of England note before it was cancelled.</p>

               <p>ROBERT GARFORD sworn. - I am clerk to Mess. Esdaile and Co. bankers to the Receiver-General of the Post-office; I received a parcel of notes from the Receiver-General's late on the 20th, which I counted over, and made the entry on the 21st.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Who delivered the notes to you? - A. I do not recollect; there are no dates and numbers entered; the particular notes are not specified in any book in our house.</p>

            's of the gross sum of 2541l. in Bank-notes and cash, but I cannot specify the Bank-notes.</p>

               <p>DANIEL STONE, Esq. sworn. - I am Superintending President of the Inland Office: On the 14th of July I pointed the prisoner's name out to him on this note, and asked him whether it was his writing; at first he hesitated, and said, he was not quite certain whether it was or not; afterwards he said he believed it was; I asked him where he had received it; he said, he had either received it from Foxlow, or some person who kept a public-house in his walk, and he said, he had paid it to the Receiver-General.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.He said, he paid it to the Receiver-General, and the name of Langbridge was at full length on the note? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you, whether a person belonging to the Post-office would be so mad as to pay it again into the Post-office, if he had stolen it from it? - A. I should think not.</p>

               <p>Q. The persons who carry letters about the town, are a good deal in the habit of getting change for notes? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know that Foxlow is much in the habit of receiving others cash, and giving them notes for it? - A. I have understood so from himself.</p>

               <p>Mr. FRANCIS NALDER sworn. - I am one of the City Marshals; this examination was taken in my presence, and signed by the Lord Mayor, the prisoner, and myself.(Examination read:)</p>

               <p>"The examination of John Langbridge, a letter carrier, employed by the General Post-Office, taken before me, Charles Price, Esq. Mayor of the City of London, and one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said City, this 17th of June, 1803. - The said John Langbridge, a letter carrier, says as follows: The Bank-note, now produced, I paid to the Receiver-General on the 20th of April, and the name of Langbridge on the Banknote is my writing; I received the note of Foxlow before nine the same morning; I gave him change in gold and silver for it; I gave the note, together with the rest, as my payment that morning, being 8l. 4s. 8d. to Atkinson, or Smith, to pay to the Receiver-General; I have been in the habit some months of giving Foxlow all the change I could accumulate, for which I was to have something out of every hundred; I gave Foxlow change in gold and silver for it; there might be a guinea, two half-guineas, and some seven-shilling pieces, or it might be all silver; it appeared that half-guineas and seven-shilling pieces would be as desirable as silver at that time; I have taken many one of Foxlow, and did not think of marking them; I am clear I did take it of Foxlow; I have not taken one five-pound note since of any other person; the Bank-note, now produced, No. 6413, dated 14th July, is the same I received of Foxlow, and paid into the Receiver-General's office; I have taken fifteen or sixteen five-pound notes of Foxlow at different times, and have put my name on some of them, but not all; I have taken many notes, and not put my name on them; I know Bowles, who keeps a public-house, in Seething-lane; I have not received any five-pound notes of Mrs. Bowles for five or six months past."</p>

               <p>Further examination, taken 20th of June, 1803, - "Says that Atkinson, or Smith, or one of them, was the person he left the money with that morning; it is impossible for him to say which of them, but he is conscious he paid it to one before he went out on his delivery, and before nine o'clock in the morning."</p>

               <p>MATTHEW ATKINSON sworn. - I am a letter carrier; this is the bill that was paid into the Receiver on the 20th of April; it is not my writing, but Mr. Tadbumter's, who was the charge-taker; I believe I took the money into the Receiver on the 20th of April, and I make a mark upon the list when I receive the money of each man, but I will not swear I received the prisoner's.</p>

             sworn. - I received a letter from the prisoner on the 15th, but, in consequence of removing, it is mislaid, and I cannot find it; I recommended the prisoner to the Office two years ago, in consequence of the recommendation of another person.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY FOXLOW sworn. - I am a letter carrier in the Post-Office, and have been thirty years in the walk I have now; I live in Lamb-street, Spital-fields, and keep a hosier's shop; I know the prisoner since last January; I collect what silver I can to carry to a banker's, and the prisoner, as well as others, brought me what he had to spare, and I gave Bank-notes for it, but that could not be more than three times a week; with the prisoner it might be once or twice a week generally, at what we call the first round, a quarter before eight in the morning, when we have most spare time at the Post-Office; I always took the Bank-notes with me, as I had not time to seek them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember having any transaction with him on the 20th of April? - A. Not the least in the world.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had any transaction, and got any change, how could you have paid him? - A.With a note out of my book that had been in my pocket ever since the day before.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any recollection what you did on the 20th? - A.Nothing at all.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon no occasion did you do it but with notes you brought from home? - A. I am clear of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060041"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You stood at No. 9, and the prisoner at No. 11? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. A letter intended for No. 8, could not get to No. 11 but by mistake? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. By the same mistake it might get to No. 9? - A. Yes, it might.</p>



               <p>Q. Supposing a person, standing at No. 9, was inclined to take a letter from No. 8, he would have a better opportunity of doing it than a person at No. 11? - A. No doubt of it, No. 11 is not so near by eight or ten yards.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you acquainted with Wells? - A. Not much, about as much as with the prisoner; I never got change of him, he had other people to oblige; I believe he did accommodate me once or twice when he wanted to borrow some money.</p>

               <p>Q. How many persons come to No. 8 or 9 at the time the letters are sorted? - A. At No. 9 there are nine in number, and eight or nine at No. 8.</p>

               <p>Q.Then there would be eight or nine people nearer this lot than those at No. 11? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.And No. 7 is as near as No. 9? - A. Yes, there is only the partition of the seat between.</p>

               <p>Q.You were examined upon this business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you always put your name on the notes you pay? - A. Yes, they will not take them of me without.</p>

               <p>Q. You have said it, and I give you leave to retract it, for I have two or three people to prove the contrary - do you mean to swear, that, whenever you gave a note in exchange for cash, you always put your name on the notes? - A. I did not intend to say I always had done so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you have not, in many instances, passed notes to persons in the Post-Office without putting your name to them, upon your oath? - A. If I have done so, I have told them they must put down the numbers.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not done it? - A. Yes, I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know one Dennett? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not often given him notes without putting your name on them? - A. I cannot say, he knows best; not to my knowledge; I do not mean to say what is false, I would rather acknowledge I had done so than that I had not; I believe I had but two or three transactions with Dennett; I had no meaning for it if I did, but I will not swear I did not; I might do it.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever happened to be suspended before this took place? - A. Yes, once.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - It has been told to your Lordship that I have been in the habit of giving Foxlow change for notes for several months past; I did, on the 20th of April, give him gold and silver, for which he gave me that note; and I do declare most solemnly, I have not received, or taken, or given, any person change for any five-pound note for eight months whatever; when I was before Mr. Parkin, I was asked from whom I received it; I did not hesitate in stating it; Foxlow was present, and Mr. Parkin told him it became him most seriously to account how he came by it, to look at the note, and see if he could recollect from whom he had it; we were then ordered to withdraw, and we went home about our business; we were told there would be no more examinations at his house, but on Friday, the 17th, we must attend the Lord-Mayor; I was the first that attended at the Mansion-house on that day, agreeably to Mr. Parkin's order; I was first examined, and my examination went to prove I received it of Foxlow, and of no other person; the Lord-Mayor asked me several times to recollect, and I am under the necessity of stating, that a more partial case never was known; he asked me whether I could not recollect whether I did not receive it of another person; I could not charge a person from whom I had not received the note; we were ordered to withdraw, and attend again on the Monday following; we attended again, and during this time Mr. Foxlow had made all the interest he could, and every thing was devised that could be thought of, to throw it upon me; I was then ordered to the Compter, to be provided with every thing necessary, and to have my friends to see me, at the expence of the Post-Office: I was ordered to attend again on the Monday following, and then he had got those gentlemen about him, and I was ordered to be tried; I have a number of friends also. Foxlow tells you, he has been suspended no more than once; more than once or twice he has been charged with robbing the seal of his brother officers of their letters, and he has been suspended for that; he has been only suspended when four, five, or six others were dismissed for embezzling Government money, for which he was glad to pay 175l. to save himself from disgrace. During all the time I filled that situation, I have endeavoured to discharge my duty as became a man, and I have a number of friends, if it is necessary to call them, to my character. I hope that your Lordship's mind, and the Jury under your Lordship's direction, will be perfectly satisfied of my innocence.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lettercarrier, and have been so two years; I know Foxlow, and have often given him cash for Banknotes within the last twelve months, twenty or thirty times, or more; when I first gave him change, they used to be signed A. F. at the top, but he has discontinued it, and I have not asked him to do it; one time I gave him forty guineas in gold, and he gave me forty-two pounds in notes, not one of which was signed; a little before this circum<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060042"/>stance, I gave him cash for a twenty-pound note, and that was not signed; and at several other times.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Don't you know, that, by the direction of the Post-master, you are to put your names upon the notes you pay in? - A.

               <p>Q. On the night of Sunday the 15th of May, what time did you come into your master's chambers? - A. A little after ten; I went out about five minutes before eleven; as I went down the stairs, Mr. Kilner was standing, leaning upon the iron rails, outside the staircase; as I passed him, he fell - into a fit of laughter, but said nothing.</p>

               <p>Q.How soon did you return? - A. I was not gone more than five minutes; when I returned, he was leaning on the bannister of the staircase, near Mr. Talbot's outer door; I opened the outer door and went in, and bolted it; I had not been in the chamber above two minutes, when I heard a violent rattling against the door of the chamber, which induced me to open it; Mr. Kilner then went rather back towards his own door, and presented a pistol at me; Mr. Kilner's door is up in the corner, upon the same landing as Mr. Talbot's, upon which I attempted to get in, but before I closed the door, the pistol was fired.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time the pistol was so fired, was it presented at you? - A. It appeared to me to be presented right at me, I was very much frightened.</p>

               <p>Q.How far was he from you? - A. He might be a couple of yards from me.</p>

               <p>Q. How were you able to see him? - A.There was a lamp upon the landing-place; I then opened the window and called the watch, and two watchmen came; Mr. Kilner had then got his own outer door open; I told them that was the man, and they went into his chambers, I saw the bullet had gone into the wall, at some distance from the door.</p>

               <p>Q. It had not passed into the chambers? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.How far from the door? - A. It might be more than a foot.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. The ball was very near the floor, was not it? - A. It was near the skirting board.</p>

               <p>Q. So that it would have hit your legs? - A. It would have hit my legs if I had not gone in.</p>



               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060043"/>Q. He was laughing when you passed him? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any reason for that laughing? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Were you directly opposite the doorway, or were you on one side the door? - A. I had one foot inside the door, and the other out.</p>

               <p>Q.Then his not hitting you was not owing to your going in, but to the pistol being discharged at the side of the door? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In discharging the pistol, did the ball cross the door-way? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Kilner's door is not opposite your master's, but on one side? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the ball must have crossed the line of the door-way? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. This building stands between the Middle-Temple-garden, and Middle Temple-lane? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>ISAAC BLACKBURN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a watchman in the Temple.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of either the report of a pistol, or being called by that lad, did you go to Mr. Kilner's chambers? - A. I went upon hearing the word watch called; I was not the first that went up; when I went up, Mr. Kilner was supporting himself at his own chamber door.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you go into his chamber with him? - A. No; I examined where the bullet had struck, I found it in the wall of the second staircase.</p>

               <p>Q. How near Mr. Talbot's door? - A.About three feet.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from the landing-place? - A. About two foot, it is level with the third stair upon the second flight. (Produces the bill.)</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were the first watchman that go up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you find Mr. Kilner? - A. Inside his outer door, the door was a little a-jar, he smiled at me when I opened the door.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you take him into custody? - A. No, I did not, I only staid at the door, that he should not go out nor come in; he was taken up the next day; I believe, the boy called out, thieves, and said, they are gone in there, and pointed to Mr. Kilner's door.</p>

               <p>Q. After the pistol was fired? - A. Yes; Mr. Kilner stood with the door in his hand, then Mr Raincock came out of his chambers on the same floor, in his shirt, and said, Mr. Kilner, you have not any design against me, and he said, no, nor any person else</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BLACKMAN sworn. - (Produces a pistol;) I found it in Mr. Kilner's pocket the next day, at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>DR. SIMS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Serjeant Best.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the gentleman who now stands at the bar? - A. Many years, I dare say, a dozen years.</p>

               <p>Q. What has been the state of his mind? - A. Above four years, I suppose, he has had very severe turns of insanity; I attended him at his chambers in the King's-bench, and at a private mad-house, kept by a Mr. Warburton.</p>

               <p>Q.During the time you attended him, was he insane? - A.Perfectly so.</p>

               <p>Q.Could you form any judgment of what probably was the state of his mind at this time? - A. My opinion is, that he never will be so serene as not to be liable to it, if any thing agitated his mind; and upon being applied to, to certify that he might be allowed to be at liberty, I most positively refused it, I was convinced it would be attended with dangerous consequences, either to himself or the public, it he was at large; he was then got into that state of mind, that he became very cunning, and able to conceal his insanity, except when certain subjects were touched upon; finding that I would not certity, they came again to me, telling me, that Dr. Wills, who had attended him along with me, during some of his turns of insanity, would certify if I would; I was surprised at it; I said, I would see Dr. Willis, and if I found I was in an error, I would submit; and I found they had been with him in the same manner to endeavour to get him to certify; I saw him several times afterwards, and have passed him in the street; I saw him in the spring, and could not but observe that he was deranged, and in a state of agitation; he would sometimes run, then stop, screw his face in various ways, mutter and talk to himself, I was then thoroughly convinced he was insane.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When was he at Hoxton? - A. It might be about from two to three years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not attended him since his leaving that place to this time? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN KIRBY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>

               <p>Q. You have had the prisoner in your care? - A. Yes; on the 19th of November, 1800, he was with me, he received sentence from the Court of King's bench to be imprisoned eight months, for sending a challenge.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you see any thing particular in his conduct? - A. Yes, and I gave strict orders that he should not be irritated.</p>

               <p>Q. Were those orders given by you upon the idea that he was not correct in his senses? - A. Yes; I went with him in a coach, when he was remanded, and I wished him to make an apology to the Court, and he said, he would not; he appeared to have a deranged mind all the time he was with me; he was musing by himself, and would not speak at times.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has he been with you the last time? - A. I don't know to a day.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060044"/>Q.Has his conduct been of the same nature as that which passed in 1800? - A.Much the same.</p>

               <p>Court. You say, you considered him as deranged, what were the grounds of that opinion? - A. He would not speak sometimes; when I have said, how do you do, he insisted upon it, that my man belonged to a mad-house, and was watching him; I told him he was a very decent man, and did not belong to a mad-house, and he said, he knew better.</p>

               <p>The Jury pronounced their verdict NOT GUILTY,</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Better than half past twelve o'clock at night, as near as I can tell the time; I felt in my pocket, and found a penny-piece; he said, give me that; I said, no, I have no other money about me, and I cannot give you that; but I said, I am a watchman in Bishopsgate-street, opposite the London Tavern door, and whatever man was upon duty for me, I could get three-pence or four-pence for his civility in offering to see me home, and he walked with me; I met with the officer of the night, Mr. Bailey; he asked me why I was not on my duty, and I told him I was going to my stand; I did not come from the society time enough to go to my duty; when we came up to Mr. Pinder's door, opposite the London Tavern, the watchman, who was on duty for me, had called the hour of one o'clock; the prisoner then jumped towards me, and said, d-n you, sir, you have got money; he laid hold of my watch-chain, jirked it out, and set off directly with it; I immediately called out, stop thief, and pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q.Had the watch any seals? - A. Yes, a watch-key, and a little trinket; it was so violently pulled from me in a moment, that I could not make any resistance; I had not time, he pushed up against me.</p>

               <p>Q.What did he do to you? - A.Nothing further than laying hold of the watch with both of his hands, and I pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he lay hands upon you at all? - A.He pushed his body against me at the moment that he got the watch; he pushed me against the gate; the watch-box stands within side the gate; I pursued him into St. Mary Axe; he was brought back about seven or eight minutes afterwards, and taken to Leadenhall watch-house; I saw him in Lime-street, he was then in custody of the watchman; I know he is the man that robbed me; I know him by his having on a dark brownish great-coat, and he was a pock-fretten man; I am sure he is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you at the club that evening? - A.About half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you drink while you were in the club-house? - A. I did not drink any thing there; we returned from the club-house to the Coach and Horses, and spent six-penny worth; I was taken in the same way about six or eight weeks before, when I had had no liquor.</p>

               <p>Q.What had you been drinking? - A.Nothing but porter; there were eight of us, and we spent fifteen-pence among us, that was all; I saw my watch at the Lord-Mayor's the same day; I knew it to be mine; it is an old-fashioned watch, with two seals to it, a key, and a trinket; one seal had a head upon it; the key was a metal key; I shall know it when I see it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Are you able to swear to this person from his being pock-fretten? - A. I can swear to him by a thousand things.</p>

               <p>Q. It was club-night? - A. Yes; I got there about half an hour before ten.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it your duty to have been upon the watch that night? - A. I go every night, except I am engaged.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060046"/>Q.Was it your duty to have been upon the watch that night? - A. I am not compelled any night, when I have other business that I can do.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you meet in your club? - A. No. 129, Whitecross-street; there were fourteen or fifteen hundred; it is the British Assurance Society.</p>

               <p>Q. How many might then meet? - A.There were a hundred there for any thing I know, but while I was there, there were only eight of us.</p>

               <p>Q. You adjourned to where? - A.The Coach and Horses.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - A.About ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know that is a night-house? - A. I don't know; I never visit night-houses.</p>

               <p>Q.How much did you drink? - A. I did not measure it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you drink? - A. I suppose I drank my share.</p>

               <p>Q. It might be a warm night, and you might drink a little more? - A. No, I am no great drinker.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a dizziness upon you? - A. Yes; it comes exactly like the shock of an apoplectic fi.</p>

               <p>Q.While that is upon you, you don't at all know what you are about? - A. I could not.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been a watchman? - A. Three or four years.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever been a witness here before? - A. No; I wish I had not come here now.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a forty pounds reward? - A. I never enquired about it.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever heard of it? - A.There are very few people but what have heard of it, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. You lost a seal with a head on it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.What head is it? - A. I don't know; it is an engraved head.</p>

               <p>Q.Whether it is Buonaparte, or Cicero, you don't know? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. The watch-key, you don't mean to swear was a key of mixed metal? - A. It is a watchkey, I cannot say exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could distinguish that from any other key? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q.And a trinket, with a lover's knot upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the warehouse a part of your house? - A. Yes; there is a communication from one to the other, it is all under one roof; the prisoner lived with me till the 18th of March: On Saturday morning, the 19th of March, between five and six o'clock, she knocked at my door, and said, for God's sake, master, get up, your warehouse is breaking open, and we shall be murdered in the house; I went down immediately, she went down with me; I found two squares of glass in the skylight taken out, and a piece of muslin lying at the top.</p>

               <p>Q.Was the broken glass large enough to admit the muslin through? - A. Yes, big enough to admit a person to get through it; I looked round the warehouse, but could find nobody; I opened the counter under the sky-light, and found it entirely stripped; there were a great quantity of corded dimities, calicoes, muslins, and a great number of other articles, which were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss 142 handkerchiefs? - A. Yes, and 500 yards of muslin.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the handkerchiefs worth? - A. I dare say, full thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the muslin worth? - A.Fifty or sixty pounds, or more; I had some hand-bills sent about, but I discoverd nothing till the 8th of June; I had no suspicion of the prisoner at that time; she left my service about the 14th or 16th of May, and I gave her a character to a Mr. Barnard: On the 8th of June, in consequence of information I received, I sent for Mr. Davis, the constable; he went, and fetched the prisoner to my house; I then said to the prisoner, where did you get money from to get all this quantity of things made up, particularly the cambric aprons.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you told her it would be better to give an account of it? - A. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q.Had the officer said any thing of that kind in your presence? - A. Nothing of the kind; I asked her where she got the money from, to have all these things made up; I said, you have made up a great quantity of corded dimity; she said, the bought it in the Minories; I then sent Davis to search her box; he brought to me some muslins made up into petticoats.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he bring any handkerchiefs? - A. No; Mr. Davis then took her to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the muslin that had been made up into petticoats, muslin belonging to you? - A. Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you ever given her that muslin, or any part of it? - A. No, nothing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Q.Had she, while she was your servant, access to that warehouse? - A. No, none but men-servants; the women had no business in that part at all.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it plain muslin? - A. Some plain, and some figured.</p>

               <p>EDWARD DAVIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable; I was sent to by the prosecutor: On Wednesday, the 8th of June, I went to Mr. Barnard's house, where the prisoner then lived; I told the prisoner she must go with me to Mr. Levy's house; I did not tell her why.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say any thing? - A. No; when she came into Mr. Levy's presence, he asked her how she came by such a quantity of muslin and corded dimities, which he had received information she had made up; she told him she had bought them in the Minories, and she could describe the place where, but could not tell the name; I told her, she must give me the keys to search her boxes; she told me, they were not locked; I went over, and searched her boxes; I found a quantity of muslin, petticoats and corded dimities; there were some muslin handkerchiefs and new bed-gowns; I brought the property over to Mr. Levy's, and he said it was his; I then took her to the Compter,(produces the property), I have had it ever since; I afterwards went to the pawnbroker's, Mr. Morris's, in the Minories, by her direction, where I found pieces of muslin.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060048"/>Q. Did you find any handkerchiefs any where? - A. I believe part of that muslin is handkerchiefs.</p>

               <p>Q.How did you know them to be her boxes? - A.Her mistress pointed them out to me, and I knew them to be her's before; I had searched them at Mr. Levy's before on the 19th of March.</p>

               <p>- MORRIS sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, No. 119, in the Minories; I know the prisoner; she pledged a quantity of muslin and handkerchiefs with me at various times, from the 4th of January to the 31st of May: On the 18th of March, she pledged a quantity of muslin and white muslin handkerchiefs.</p>

               <p>Q.How many handkerchiefs? - A. One piece; I lent her upon different articles that day 24l.</p>

               <p>Q.What is the value of that piece of handkerchiefs? - A.Eighteen shillings; there were twelve of them in a piece.</p>

               <p>Q.What quantity of muslin did she pledge on that day? - A. Thirty-nine pieces.</p>

               <p>Q.What is the value of the muslin? - A. Eighteen shillings each piece.</p>

               <p>Q.Had she been in the habit of using your shop? - A. She had formerly (produces the property) I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Levy. I am sure they are my property.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever permitted her, or any body else, to sell these articles? - A. No, I sell nothing in town, my goods are for exportation; they were rather tarnished, and I sent them to Mr. Starey, at Croydon, to be bleached; they have all been washed, and have Mr. Starey's marks on them; I am sure they are my property.</p>

               <p>Q.Whereabout is the value of that muslin and that piece of handkerchiefs? - A. The forty pieces are worth about 60l. as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the muslins produced by Davis? - A. I am sure they are mine, but now they are made up, it is impossible to swear to them; but I am convinced they are mine.</p>

             sworn. - On Friday morning the 17th of June, as I was walking in Oxford-street, I was accosted by the prisoner at the bar; he came to me, and made beckons to walk with me; I made motions to him to go away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he speak to you? - A. No; he still persisted, and I thought he wanted charity; I offered him some halfpence, and he refused them; he walked with me till we came to the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street; we there met a carpenter with some tools over his back; the carpenter stopped the prisoner at the bar, and I stopped also.</p>

               <p>Q.What caused you to stop? - A. To ask the carpenter if he knew the prisoner at the bar; he said, he did, and he was a carpenter by trade, he pointed to the stars, and then to the ground; I told him I did not want my fortune told.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this? - A.About half past four in the morning; he made motions as if he was not well, and wanted something to drink; I went in with him to the corner public-house, and called for a quartern of gin, he would not have any beer; I sat down upon the bench; he wanted to come near me, and I said, my friend, I wish you would go on the other side, I don't know any thing of you, and then I gave him a glass of gin; I found myself not very well, and went out at the door, and came back again; I laid my head down on the bench where I fat; he was at a distance from me; I fell asleep, and when I woke, the landlord touched me on the shoulder, and said, you have got sixpence to pay; I paid him the sixpence; I then went to feel for my watch, to see what o'clock it was, I found it was gone.</p>

               <p>Q.When had you seen your watch? - A. I looked at it when I went into the house, to see what o'clock it was.</p>

               <p>Q.You were not very sober I fancy by your own account? - A. Yes, I was perfectly sober; I had taken some saloop in Oxford-street, and it had not agreed with me; then I found I had got a hat upon my head not worth sixpence, and my own was gone; then I gave information at Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. You had been up all night? - A. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you been at work at all that morning? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.How many people were there in this public-house? - A.Three besides the prisoner, but there was only him in the box with me; one was a soldier; I have seen the soldier since, and he said he was not there.</p>

               <p>Q.Though you saw him there? - A. Yes.</p>



               <p>Q.What public-house was this? - A.The King and Queen public-house I think it is.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060049"/>Q. Is the publican here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not apprehend the soldier? - A. No.</p>

               <p>JOHN BETTS sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 17th of June, when I went on duty at night, I heard that a man was robbed, and on the 18th my serjeant called me a quarter before five in the morning, to take the prisoner into custody; I found him at the King and Queen, standing in the taproom; I took him from there to the watch-house; I put my hand into his fob, and took out a watch, which the prosecutor swore to at the Justice's. -(Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.Were you on your beat the morning before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the persons at the public-house then? - A.No.</p>

               <p>Q. You could not understand any thing this poor creature said? - A. He made signs, that if I would give him the watch, he would give me something to drink.(The watch was identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

               <p>EVAN VAUGHAN sworn. - Q.What are you? - A. I am in no business; I have known the prisoner nine years.</p>

               <p>Q.During that time has he not had the power of speech? - A. He has not; his brother worked for me, and he for his brother, as a carpenter.</p>

               <p>Q.How did his brother make him assist him? - A. He used to make motions; he understood his motions.</p>

               <p>Q.During that time could he hear at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he ever shew any thing dishonest in the course of that nine years? - A. I never heard any thing dishonest of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What has been his general character as to honesty? - A. He used to be under the guidance of his brother; he could not walk alone; he used to walk with him. <rs id="t18030706-70-verdict387" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, I know her again; I saw her on the 3d of June, about seven o'clock in the evening; a woman came to my shop for a pennyworth of marbles; she gave me a bad shilling; I returned it to her; she said she was going a little further, and would call again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you follow her out? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see whether she joined company with any body else? - A. Yes, I followed her into Weymouth-street, and there I saw her join company with the prisoner; after consulting some time, they went across Portland-place, and Harley-street, to a tallow-chandler's in Weymouth-street; Rowley went in, and the prisoner went gently on; I waited till she came out, upon which I went in to learn what she had done; in consequence of what I heard, I was induced to follow them still further; I came out as Rowley had overtaken the prisoner; they consulted together, and something was exchanged, but I cannot say what; she gave something to the prisoner, who appeared to be feeling in her pocket as if she was going to return something; I followed them into Mary-le-Bonne-street, and observed Rowley go into Mr. Loosely's shop; the prisoner walked gently up Wimpole-street; I went into the shop after she came out, and in consequence of what I heard there, I again followed the prisoner and Rowley; I got the beadle of the parish to assist me, because I was determined to take them up; we followed them to Oxford-street; they several times consulted together; the prisoner never went into a shop, but had a letter in her hand, and often stood against a door, as if she had knocked and waited; Rowley went into a linen-draper's shop, upon which I told the beadle to go and take that woman, and I would take care of the other.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you secure them? - A. Yes, and there were plenty of people to see the prisoner nor the other did not drop any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she searched in your presence? - A. Yes, by Hamilton; there were four or five shillings found in her hand, which she was loath to unclench; in her pocket was found a great many sixpences, and a great deal of copper; the officers searched Rowley, and said there was nothing to be found on her.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060051"/>Q.Look at that bit of wax? - A. That is the wax.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where you bought it? - A. I cannot tell either the street or shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it before she told you never to mind whether it was bad or good? - A. No, it was after that.</p>



               <p>Q.After she told you that, did you not consider her as a bad woman? - A. Yes, there were three men coming after us, and she told me to go away</p>

               <p>Q.Did she afterwards carry you to another shop? - A. Yes, but whether it was that shilling or not I cannot say; I bought two sheets of paper, and paid two-pence for them.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of paper? - A. Like scowering-paper.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to go when she had made such a speech to you? - A. I did consider her as a bad woman when she said there was no danger in the second; I did think it wrong, but the first I did not think so much of.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you pay with? - A. With a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you get it? - A.From Mrs. Barrel.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you pay for the wax with? - A. With a shilling; I had three shillings of her, and they all went away.</p>

               <p>Mr. SAMUEL MENCELIN sworn. - Q. You are one of the Moniers of his Majesty's Mint? - A. Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at the shilling which was paid for the scowering-paper? - A. It is a bad one.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any silver metal in it? - A.Scarcely any.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at those four? - A. They are all counterfeits.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any letter stamped on them? - A. Yes, part of the letter N; they seem to be of the same coinage.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>

               <p>"To the Right Hon. the Lord Judge, and the Honourable the Jury - The humble defence of the prisoner at the bar, sheweth, that she lived lately in two respectable places, and left them with a good character, and has since worked for different shops; on the day she lost her liberty, she was unwilling to go out at all till Mrs. Rowley tried every art to prevail, nor succeeded till Mrs. Rowley produced a paper, containing an advertisement to attend a lady to America, and a lady that they called on in Portland-place, and Mrs. Rowley called at a house while the prisoner waited, and returned, saying, the lady was not at home; in Lower Brook-street I missed her; I went down Welbeck-street, and heard her call after me; I observed to her that three men were following her; she uttered an oath, and said, I don't care for them; she asked me to have some rum; I answered, no, but would wait for her; I took a glass of ale, which was all I bought that day; I proceeded to Hanover-square, when I was seized by a strange man; I enquired the cause, but to no effect; I was hurried to a Magistrate, and on searching my pockets, some change was found which I had received for sundry work, and had taken out for the purpose of buying some mode, having a cloak bespoke; this is all I know, and all I have to say." <rs id="t18030706-73-verdict397" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Have you a father living? - A. Yes, and his name is Jeffery.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? I lost my black mare on the 15th of June; I left her in my own stable, about ten o'clock at night, I missed her on Wednesday morning the 15th, about four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever seen her since? - A. Yes; I have her at home now, at work, a neighbour of mine found her in Smithfield, for sale, on the Friday following.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the mare worth? - A.Five or six pounds to me, or rather more.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL STOCKWELL sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A.At Walworth.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of East's mare? - A. Yes; I drove her for him, I worked for him then.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find his mare? - A. I went on Friday to Smithfield, to buy a pig, and saw the mare tied alongside a horse for sale; I asked the price, the man said, five guineas and a half; I said, she is a stolen mare; he said, his master was down there; I went to him, and told him the same; he said, if she is stolen, I should be glad for the owner to have her, and said, he should be agreeable to send her home; I went to Sell directly, and said it was stolen; he said, he bought her on Saffron-hill; he gave me the mare and I sent her home; I knew her to be the same mare; the stable was broke open, and the mare stolen out.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no conversation with the prisoner? - A. No.</p>

               <p>HENRY SELL sworn. - Q. You were at Smithfield-market, and met Stockwell there? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You delivered him a black mare? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who brought the mare to market? - A. The prisoner, I bought it of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month? - A. The 16th.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060052"/>Q. Did he say where he brought her from? - A. He said, he bought her; he asked me three guineas for it; I said, it was too much for my use; I asked him to walk it along about twenty yards. I thought it might do a little work, and I gave him three pounds, about twelve o'clock on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where he had it from? - A.He said, he gave two pounds fifteen shillings for it, and said, he was incapable of keeping it; he said, he had just bought it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more about it? - A. No, we had a glass a-piece to drink, and parted.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you buy it of him? - A. On Saffron-hill, and paid the money at the Whitehorse public-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from Smithfield? - A. Hardly half a mile.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to part with the mare so early, when Stockwell challenged it? - A. I bought it on Thursday, and sent my man to the market with it, and told him to ask four guineas and a-half for it; I went to the market, and the person was leading her about; I asked him what he was bid for it; he said, three guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>Q.Why did you sell it again? - A. To get half a guinea by it; I bought it for that purpose; I told him, if he could get four pounds for it, to let it go.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to part with it so readily? - A. I have got four or five more; about half an hour afterwards, I was in the middle of the market, and my man came looking for me, and said, the mare was owned; owned, said I, that cannot be; yes, said he, it is, and Stockwell came up to me, and said, it is stolen; I said, I honestly bought it; I said, is it your's; no, he said, it is my neighbour's; a mob began stocking round; he said, he would not stop there; we went over to the Lock and Key public-house, and had some ale; he gave me his address, and the mare was taken home.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Stockwell.) Were you by when your master bought the horse? - A. No, I saw nothing of it till the Friday.</p>
