I am a tailor—on March 1st, I was in the Grapes public-house, Gerrard Street, Soho—I heard a disturbance going on out<lb/>side about 9.20 p.m.—I went out, and saw a crowd of fifty or sixty—some were shouting "Take that shooter from him"—the prisoner was brandish<lb/>ing what I thought was a revolver in his hand—I followed him with the crowd from Macclesfield Street through Shaftesbury Avenue where I seized him from behind—he struggled violently—we fell—he got one of his arms free, and I felt as if I had been punched in the neck on the left side—having got to his feet, he made a rush into the crowd—I followed and seized him again—he struggled violently—I got hold of his hand, gave him a twist, and secured this knife—I took one arm and led him towards the station with a constable, till another constable took the arm, and I followed to the station—when the other constable came up I felt a stick in my neck, and said "I believe I have been stabbed"—at the station I was seen by a doctor—I believe the prisoner was sober—I did not see any violence used on him.</p>

Borough—I am the mother of the deceased—she was twenty months' old—I had been living with the prisoner on and off for five months, I think it was from September—when I was not with him I went into the workhouse in Shepherdess Walk, because he had not the money to pay the rent—I have been to the workhouse twice, once for a month and once for six weeks—the prisoner is a dock labourer—he is an Englishman—the last time I came out was on March 1st—I was pregnant then by him—he took me and the child out of the workhouse two or three times—on March 1st I took the back ground floor room at 15, Little Pearl Street, Spitalfields—the rent was a shilling a night, except Sunday nights, which were free—on Sunday, March 9th, I went out in the morning—the baby was sitting on a chair—she had a blow on her forehead—the prisoner was in the room—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, what a blow she has got on her forehead"—he said, "Yes; I stood her against the cupboard door and the cupboard door fell through"—there is no beading to stop the door, and it goes in and out—he said he bathed it with cold water, and I took no more notice for about half an hour—she was sitting on the floor playing, and the prisoner turned round to me and said, "Has not she got beautiful eyes, I could kill her, for I do love her"—I did not say anything to that, I only took it as a joke, and laughed and he laughed too—on March 15th he came home about 11 a.m.—there was 6s. or 7s. owing then for rent—the prisoner bad done a bit of work on the Friday, but he had not done anything on the Saturday—</p>

               <p>I believe he brought 1s. 9d. home with him—he said to me, "Here, I do not know how we are going on about the rent"—I said, "I don't know"—he said, "It don't matter, go and get a bit of tea and sugar"—I went to get it and took the baby with me—when I came back he said, "You had better go and get a bit of jam and some bread"—I went out a second time and bought some, again taking the baby with me—we had our tea about 4.30 or 5 p.m.—between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. the prisoner sat on a chair, and he laid down for five minutes—after tea he said, "Are you coming out for a little while?"—I said, "Yes"—I dressed the baby—he said, "I will go and see if I can meet any of my mates and see if I can get enough to pay any of my rent"—I had the baby dressed then—he dressed himself and I dressed myself—the baby was going to sleep on my lap, and he said, "Don't take her now, she has gone to sleep; lay her on the bed, she is too heavy for you to carry"—I laid the baby down, and we went out together about 5.30—the baby then had the bruise on her forehead, a mark across her back where she fell into the fire in Christmas week, and a few marks on her bottom—when she was vaccinated she came out in little scars, which left places on her bottom—when I went out with the prisoner we went as far as New North Road, Bow—he looked to see if he could see any of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>—we got to Pitfield Street—he was looking at a public-house and said, "Will you have a glass of ale?"—I had a glass with him—I went out first, he followed me, and said, "Will you come and pay my two nights'<hi rend="italic">kip?"—he</hi> meant his lodging—I said, "No"—he did not mean the rent for the room where we were living, he meant his lodging for two nights at a lodging-house—he said, "Very well, then, you go your way and I will go mine"—he went away and I went my way—he was quite sober, he had only had a glass of ale with me—on the Friday fortnight previous he had had a glass, and he seemed quite silly, so he never had no more—he said to me then, "I feel quite <hi rend="italic">boozed</hi>"—on March 15th, he seemed <hi rend="italic">funnified</hi>, but he spoke all right—I went into Hoxton when he left me—I met a friend, and told him how I was placed—he gave me 2s. for the rent—I had a glass of ale with him—he <hi rend="italic">see</hi> me into the tram, and I went straight home—I got back about 7.30 or 8—I went into our room—there was a candle alight on the mantel<lb/>piece—the child was on the bed, partly dressed, and groaning, her boots and socks, pinafore, red jacket, coat, cape, and bonnet had all been taken off—I saw bruises on her face—she did not seem to know me—I saw a little bit of blood in her mouth—I did not notice any scratches—I went to Mrs. Hughes in the next room—I did not notice the fire-place before I went to Mrs. Hughes—I showed her the baby—I went for the police—when I returned, I went into my own room—I saw a pail inside the fender—the pail always stood behind the door—there was some blood and water in the pail—in front of the fire-place some water had been wiped up, and there was a spot of blood as if somebody had cut their finger—the sheet on the bed had been messed, and had been wiped up—I did not notice anything by the side of the bed—Inspector Hewison and Dr. Olliver came, and in consequence of what they said I went with the child to the Mildmay Hospital—I did not examined its body—I went to the station after the</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon of police, and practice in Kingsland Road—on March 15th, about 8.55 p.m., I was called to 15, Little Pearl Street—I found the deceased lying on a bed in the ground floor room—she was not conscious, and was suffering from contusion to her head and body generally, and from an injury to the genitals—the injury to the perineum I afterwards made a fuller investigation of—on Monday, March 17th, it was reported to me that she had died.—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, with another medical man, at 6.30 that evening—the greater part of the forehead was occupied by a large bruise—it was most marked on the right side, and involved in addition the right upper eye-lid—there were bruises on both cheeks, nose, upper and lower lips, and the tip of the chin was slightly grazed—on the front of the right shoulder there was a superficial bruise as large as a threepenny piece—on the side of the left chest there was a linear bruise 2 1/2 inches long—just to the left of the navel there was a bruise as large as a pigeon's egg—on the abdomen there was a bruise as large as a crown piece, and over the crest of the head a bruise as large as a shilling—on the right thigh there was a bruise on the inner side, as large as a half-crown and an inch above the knee a linear bruise 1 1/2 inches long—there were two superficial scratches over the knee, and two small-bruises—in front of the right shin there was a linear bruise three inches long—on the left thigh there were three bruises just above the knee—on the front of the left shin, 1 1/2 inches below the knee, there was a scratch 1 1/2 inches long, and there was a bruise over the occiput—over the left loin there was an old scar of a burn, which had also been bruised—over the left buttock there was a scratch 1 inch long—the anus was dilated, and its margin bruised, and radiating from its centre there were four superficial lacerations—the perineum was severely and deeply lacerated—this piece of iron would have caused those wounds—the laceration to the perineum started just at the back of the vagina, it just entered the orifice, and extended to the back of the anus—there must have been some force used to inflict that injury—to cause the injuries to the perineum I think there was a prod or a thrust with the instrument—I examined the brain and the scalp—the bruising involved the whole of the right side of the head as far back as the occiput—the brain and organs were normal—the child seemed to have been healthy—the cause of death was collapse following the injury to the perineum and the bruising—the child could never have</p>

               <p>been fully conscious after receiving the injuries—the bruises were all recent, with the exception of the scar of the burn—I have examined this piece of iron—there is just a trace of blood on this end of it—the use of this end, where the blood stains were, would have caused the injuries I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined.</hi> The injury to the head was of a serious nature, and would be dangerous by itself—I think the injury to the point of the right shoulder could have been caused by the child falling, and possibly the injury on the right side of the head—if there was a thrust with the weapon it need not have been intentional if a man was beating the child with this piece of iron.</p>

About 9.40 a.m. on March 10th I was with Sergeant Hodson in Old Street—we were in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners looking into a shop window—when we got within about fifty yards of them I saw Lawrence nudge Elston with his right arm—they went into Tabernacle Square—I went to the corner of Pitfield Street and we made up our minds to go and see what they had got—they went into Rivington Street—when we got to the corner we saw them about 200 yards away both running as hard as they could—seeing it was no use to run after them we ran down Great Eastern Street into High Street, Shoreditch—we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190204070037"/>
               <p>there saw them both walking down on the other side of the road towards us—we crossed over behind some vans—as they passed I seized Elston, who was nearest to me—he broke away—I caught him again, and assisted by Constable Tilley I took him to the station—on searching him I found two watches, two watch-chains, one neck-chain, one match-box, two brooches, one locket, three rings, one scarf-pin, and other articles—whilst I was struggling with him on the ground I heard a revolver shot, and someone said, "He is shooting"—on being charged Elston said, "Are we both charged with that jewellery found in my pocket?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That has nothing to do with him."</p>

Stroud Green Road, belonging to Mr. Carpenter—I examined the window there—I found marks on the catch such as would be caused by its being forced back by a knife of this description—I forced it back quite easily—I did not find any marks on the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant manager of the National Bank of Scotland, Nicholas Lane—Moffat Brothers have had an account there for many years—the prisoner was a member of the firm—this is the pass-book, it is an accurate copy of the ledger—I wrote a letter to Moffat Brothers stating, "In view of the advance in discount you have from us, and looking at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190204070040"/>
               <p>the enquiries that are certain to be made, we should like to see your latest balance-sheet at your early convenience '—in answer to that I received this letter in the prisoner's writing (<hi rend="italic">Dated February</hi> '26<hi rend="italic">th. Enclosing a copy of the balance-sheet and dating that they held security for their loans, and that their last nine months' trading was</hi> £3,000<hi rend="italic">ahead of last year, that their business was never in such a satisfactory position as at present and they hoped in a few days to dear off their overdraft.</hi>)—Their over draft at that date was £2.316 5s.—I was satisfied and continued to allow the over draft—I returned the enclosed document to them—about August 13th 1900. I had an interview with the prisoner at the bank—I think we sent for him—I asked him for a later balance sheet—he said that he would send it—the overdraft then was £1,397 17s.—next day 1 received this letter in the prisoner's writing (<hi rend="italic">Slating that they had not got a copy of the balance sheet, but enclosed a copy of the figures from the ledger.</hi>)—This is the enclosed balance sheet—it is in the prisoner's writing, and gives Moffatt's capital as £-20.448 0s. 3d.—the over draft on May. 31st was £1,577 19s. 4d.—the totals of the balance-sheet agree with the book—there is no such figure as £22.506 in the private ledger, but the sundry debtors and £477 18s. cash at the bankers and in hand make up that sum, but there was an overdraft of £1.500—I was under the impression that they had good debts to the amount of £28,000—if I had known that in that balance sheet the overdraft was ignored I should have called up the over<lb/>draft, but I allowed it to continue and to increase: it had grown to £3,805 15s. 6d. on September 6th 1900—it was £1,397 9s. 6d. in August—we wanted to have security, and a guarantee signed by four persons was deposited with the bank on August 15th, 1900—it was signed by Mr. John Stewart, of the firm of Kay and Stewart, Huddersfield; Walter Sykes of Zetland Mills, Huddersfield: Oliver Hay and John Dalgetty Henderson—our bank has not suffered the overdraft was fully paid off by the firm on February 4th, 1901. in various sums, and then the account became in credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The payments made by the bank and to the bank appear in this pass-book—they include the discounting of bills and if they are returned we debit the account—we were not satisfied with the class of bills they brought us we thought they were accommodation bills, and asked them to give us a guarantee for £4,000—I saw the prisoner in August, and said that I wished the guarantee arranged because of the character of some of the bills, and he sent the names of the guarrantors—that was for the purpose of securing the bank generally—it did not extend to an overdraft, it was confined to discount—they generally had £6.000 or £7,000 worth of bills running—the mind of the bank would be affected by the improved position we had such confidence in him—we had never limited their over draft to any particular sum—the practice was to give—discount on bills coming in—I think payments are made by merchants by four months' bills all the year round—the four months' bills given in August were acceptances of the firm—I was not satisfied, because the over<lb/>draft used to be occasional, but it became more frequent—most of our customers show us their balance-sheets every year—there was £1,500 to</p>

               <p>their credit on August 9th—the difference was caused by large amounts which were paid—the account was better than at any time during that year—when I did get the balance-sheet, I merely looked at two items—I saw that the two partners had £6,000 of capital—the bank had a surplus of between £600 and £700 at the bankruptcy, which was paid to the trustee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The amount of overdraft allowed, depends upon what we consider the position of the firm, and we see the balance-sheet from time to time—when a balance is struck, it generally goes to the bank—the account is generally indebted after August 13th—the overdraft was arranged in September, and I then went for my holiday—the referees, names may have been given to me before I left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer, of Zetland Mills, Huddersfield, and am a creditor for £1.185 in the bankruptcy of Moffat Brothers—I have dealt with them for some time—on September 6th I received this letter signed by the prisoner, "You may positively depend on our cheque with interest on the 11th of this month, and I will ever afterwards toil fur you: our banker will let us have any amount, but would like some security; would you be willing to be one of four friends, it will not exceed £1,000, and will not cost you a shilling, and will only be for a short time, etc."—I know Mr. Stewart, he had such a letter as well, which he showed me—I was going on a trip to Paris, and being in London, called at 21, Warwick Street, on September 19th and saw the prisoner and told him that if I was satisfied with the balance-sheet, Mr. Stewart and I would become guarantors for £1.000 each—he produced two private ledgers for 1898 and 1899. and the last two balance-sheets—on May 31st the capital of Mr. Moffatt was £20.444 0s. 2d. and of Mr. Duthie £5,026 19s. 1d.—I asked if they had been compared by the accountant, he said "Yes"—on the other side was the amount of the book debts and the stock—I looked at the balance-sheet of May 31st, 1900, and that was nearly the same, and there was a balance "By cash at bankers," and "Sundry debtors. £23,000—I believed those were true figures—on August 15th I signed this guarantee and continued to supply goods on credit to Moffatt Brothers—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are my invoices for goods supplied on October, 50th.£67 17s. 2d.; November 2nd. £8 11s. 6d.; November 5th,£64 17s. 9d.; November 27th, £269 8s. 3d.: and £259 0s. 4d. on the same day; December 4th.£28 6s. 4d.: January 16th.£28 2s, 1d.: and January 31st, £33 11s. 6d., which is fur goods sent in on January 30th—the goods sup<lb/>plied on November 20th and 27th were ordered in May or June—the balance-sheet which was produced to me induced me to supply the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My business is carried on on the same lines as Mr. Alfred Sykes'—he is no relation of mine—we send patterns by post in spring for autumn delivery—we seek instructions for delivery—if the date of delivery is specified we deliver according to the orders given in the spring, without instructions from the merchants without waiting for orders; we advise them—that was the course with Moffatt Brothers—those pay<lb/>ments would not fall due till the following spring, and payment would be made in April by cash at 2 1/2 discount or by a four months' bill—we received orders from Moffatt Brothers about May or June, 1900—we have dealt</p>

               <p>with them nearly 20 years, I think—when we took this order from them we did not contemplate asking for cash down at the time of delivery—when I went to see the prisoner in September, 1900, it was for the sole purpose of deciding whether I would be gaurantee to the bank; I was not aware that Mr. Stewart had already agreed to be a party to the guarantee—I believe it is unusual in London for merchants to have an overdraft at the bank, but in the country not at all; I should not think worse of him in Leeds—we should not refuse in Leeds to give credit to a man merely because he had an overdraft at his bank—the thing I chiefly looked at in the balance-sheet of May, 1900, was the capital and the drawings of the partners—I saw that the drawings of T. Moffatt were £1,229 for the year—there were also drawings for Mrs. Moffatt, making it £1,801, and the drawing of Duthie £486—he explained that Moffatt's drawings were more because he was removing into another house—the total drawings of 1899 were £1,091 and Duthie's £499—it was quite clear that the capital was invested in the business, but he said that he had given large credit—the assets consisted of the stock and the debts—I directed my attention to the capital, not to the cash balance at the bank—there was nothing to indicate that there was an overdraft at the bank—what I wanted to know was whether the firm was solvent at that date, and if it was I was willing to become guarantee—the average business I have done with them for 12 years has been £1,500 a year.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Orders were given in spring for delivery in the autumn, and fresh orders would be given in autumn, and these two cases of December 10th and January 30th were no exception to the general rule.</p>

               <p>next morning with Mr. Moffatt at the counting-house in Warwick Street—I told him that we had found about 1,800 of invoices put into 1899 which belonged to the previous year before May, 1899—they were brought into the financial year—he said, "I believe that is so"—I saw him next day—I went on with the audit—I found the balance-sheet for 1899 in<lb/>correct on comparing it with the private ledger—sums were entered in the books as having been paid, which were not paid till after that date, making a total of £8.010 13s. 6d.—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a list of them, giving in one column the date appearing in the cash-book which I call the false date, and in another column the true date as appearing by the pass-book—here are two payments to Mr. Eastwood one of £1.158 11s. 6d. not paid till afterwards, and another of £970 13s. not paid till September—the effect of that is to diminish the apparent liabilities by that amount at that date—I find a number of short casts in the bought ledger accounts purporting to be paid, and the account is ruled off—I also find that a number of manu<lb/>facturer's invoices are omitted which should have come in as liabilities—I produce a schedule of those invoices of earlier date than May 31st—an invoice of May 10th of £364 is omitted from the balance, which ought to have come in and another of April 21st, J. Sykes, £224, not taken into that year, total £1,862 13s. 2d.—a number of bills are omitted from the bill-book—the capital by the prisoner's balance-sheet on May 31st, 1899, is £25,653 11s. 3d., and by the amended balance-sheet £14,069, in round figures £11,000—in the balance-sheet of May 31st, 1900, I find "cash at banker's £349 14s. 3d., and I find that the overdraft was £1,579 19s. 4d.—that liability was never taken into account in the balance-sheet—I find in the previous year invoices omitted amounting to £2,194 18s. 4d.—I produce a schedule of them—cheques and bills are entered prior to May 31st amounting to £8,563 14s. 1d. which were not paid till afterwards—"the difference between the two balances comes to £14,000—I find in the cash-book an entry of £769 7s. as actually paid to Eastwood &amp; Co on May 10th and discount entered as allowed, as though it had been paid in cash—on January 15th, 1901, the prisoner handed this document to Mr. Moffatt who handed it to me—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner, stating that the condition of (he accounts was solely due to him, expressing deep regret for the defalcations, that he had no defence to offer, but desired that they might be debited to him stating that it was only dune to facilitate business, and admitting a deficiency of</hi> £10,000.)—I made my report about January 31st—I found that the firm was insolvent and could not continue to trade and that the creditors must shortly be called together and Mr. Moffatt sold the business to the trustees—I have seen the prisoner write—these letters.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not examined the books prior to 1899—the order began with May 1st, 1899—the firm appeared to be solvent on paper in January, 1901, but they would be forced to pull up, as the manufacturers would not give them credit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in business at 21, Warwick Street, Regent Street—I was formerly in partnership with my brother as Moffatt Brothers, cloth merchants—the prisoner entered our service as clerk in 1884—he was 18 or 19 years of age—in 1895, my brother ceased to be partner, and I carried on the business alone for two years in the same name—from June 1st, 1897, the prisoner was admitted a partner—his business was principally in the counting-house, of which he previously had charge, in conjunction with my brother—I had nothing to do with the books, only with buying and selling—we had a balance sheet to May 31st each year, which was prepared from figures given to the accountant by the defendant by Read, Parker and Company—I was in the place at the audit, but took no part—I did not know the books were not properly kept, nor that the balance-sheet was false, until Mr. Norton discovered it in December 1900, nor that there was an overdraft at the bank at the latter part of that year—I did not look at the pass-book—the prisoner's capital on becom<lb/>ing a partner is stated as £2,500 in the balance-sheet of May 31st—I have serious doubts whether that is correct—my capital stands at £20,000 odd, and his at £3,815—his statement was handed to me by Mr. Slade, in consequence of which I called on Messrs. Norton to investigate the books, and as a result of their report, at the end of January, 1901, I called my creditors together—I found my capital of £20,000 was gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When my brother was partner, the prisoner took the best part of the work in the counting-house, because my brother was in bad health—he died in 1898—the prisoner prepared balance-sheets which my brother did not supervise—I did not analyse the balance-sheets, I looked at the result which appeared satisfactory—I looked at the pass<lb/>book, but never examined it—Parker and Company were employed in their preparation the better part of thirty years—I left it in their hands—they succeeded to a business—I believe before 1897 it had been the practice to exaggerate the assets in the balance-sheets, by taking goods as stock and omitting the liability to pay for them until they were paid for at some date in a subsequent financial year—the defendant brought in as capital about £5,000—£3,000 of it was borrowed from a personal friend of his for the purpose—he became entitled to one-third of the profits—I took the other two-thirds—I attended to the buying and selling, more than the defendant—the latter part of the time goods had to be sacrificed—we had been overbuying, but not materially—it might be to a thousand or two in the course of a year—some years we overbought, sometimes we did</p>

               <p>not—we have to buy in anticipation of coming fashions, and sometimes create fashions—we bought six months beforehand—during 1900, trade conditions were against us—they had been so for two or three years before the failure—after the meeting of creditors, the prisoner offered to come back at a salary—I am not aware if the amount was £300—I did not enter<lb/>tain it—in consequence, he entered the employment of Messrs. Gullish, who are competitors—I have bought the business back again from the trustee in bankruptcy—the trustees Pratt and Norton and I valued it—I gave nothing for the goodwill—I have sent reports to persons the prisoner has been doing business with when asked for—this one to McKinley is in my writing, and this: "Kindly peruse the enclosed at your leisure," possibly I sent that without being asked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have received many inquiries since these proceedings were instituted—I lost confidence on the prisoner in December, 1900—within a month of calling on Pratt and Norton the prisoner never told me at the latter part of 1900, that we had overdrawn £1,000 to £3,000—he never directed my attention to the balance—I considered our position was perfectly good—I frequently inquired how the accounts stood—I had no idea the stock was exaggerated before 1897. and then only from what Norton told me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Pratt, Norton and Company, and trustee in the bankruptcy of Moffatt Brothers—referring to the statement of affairs, I find Joseph Sykes and Company creditors for £1,484 6d.; Walter Sykes, £1,185 3d.; Kay and Stewart, £823 18s. 2d.; and Eastwood and Company, £1,455 18s. 11d.—I have realised the estate, except about £1,500—the deficiency is £6,000 to £7,000 and will pay 14s. 6d., or I anticipate in all 15s. 3d. in the £ dividend; 1s. 6d. is the last statement—Thomas Moffatt gets nothing, he cannot prove—I examined the invoices and find the four purchases mentioned are entered except £3 9s. 4d.—the books showed a deficiency—they are in Duthie's writing—I have compared the cash book and the impersonal ledger with the pass<lb/>book—they do not agree, the totals are not true—large sums are drawn out, which do not appear in cash-book or ledger—from May, 1897, to December 31st, 1900, the pass-book shows £26,393 paid into the bank in excess of that which appears in the cash-book, and £36,069 more drawn out—the difference between those two sums is £9,676—I have been unable to trace what has become of the money—in the balance-sheet of May 31st, 1897, the cash at bankers appears as £201 12s. 7d., but the actual cash in the bank was £2 2s. 1d.—in other respects the balance-sheet appears correct—the actual balance on May 31st was£49 0s. ld.—the total in the pass-book is £23,38414s. 9d.—the entry of May 29th, 1897, £212 12s. 6d., should be £12 12s. 6d.—I have examined Mr. Slade's statement "M" which states that for several years past goods have been passed unwisely, which had seriously reduced the balance-sheet, and I have compared the purchase and sales before and after the partnership—afterwards the gross sales were about £6,000 more than for the three previous years, and the gross purchases about £4,000 more per annum—the total pur<lb/>chases for the three years before were £87,218, and for three years after,</p>

               <p>£100, 195, or an average of £33,198, and the sales previous to the partner<lb/>ship to be £102,603, or an average of £34,202, being £121,498, or an average of £40,499—there is foundation for the allusion in Mr. Slade's statement to extensive experiments with foreign travellers, and a serious loss arising from the opening of new ground—the books show an increase of £6,000 a year in expenses—about £500 a year before, and £527 a year afterwards was written off for losses, including bad debts—I have not been able to account for the disappearance of the £20,000 capital—at the end of the year stock which was out of fashion was disposed of at a loss—I have produced all letters in my possession—I have not been able to find one from Kays of February 24th, or one from Eastwood of September 26th, 1900.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The capital would be invested in stock and debts, and might disappear by injudicious buying and selling—a portion was in the bank—I was present at the prisoner's examination in bankruptcy—it was very long—no one charged him with misappropriation of capital to my knowledge—a bill book was kept, but it did not contain complete entries of bills outstanding—I understood there was a junior to assist the clerk with the books—I heard that the prisoner was frequently away, travelling two or three days together—the firm frequently had to supply money to take up customer's bills—the customer should have been credited with the amount and debited with the bill in the books, but was not always—in a large number of cases I do not find it entered—the prisoner alleged that he lent Duncan of Glasgow £800 Duncan disputed it, and after investiga<lb/>tion I was obliged to admit Duncan as a creditor—Mr. Moffatt has only purchased a small portion of the assets—I have realised the assets in the ordinary way—there was a little over £5,000 of stock—I carried on the busi<lb/>ness, and at the end of two months the Committee of Inspection authorised me to sell the stock to Thomas Moffatt and his nephew for £6,420 12s. 6d., including £380 for lease, goodwill, and fixtures—I heard, but not till during this trial that Moffatt had been offered a profit rental of £400 for these premises—the lease was not put down as of any value—it was a long lease—there were a warehouse on the ground floor and stock rooms in the basement—the upper portion was sub-let—it was in Warwick Street, Regent Street—I saw the good-will put in the bankruptcy statement at £200, and I realised £380 for the goodwill, fixtures, and fittings—before the bankruptcy, the goodwill might have been worth a considerable sum—this bankruptcy has cost about £ 1,900, including the Board of Trade particu<lb/>lars, law costs, out of pocket expenses, and remuneration—the total ex<lb/>penses will be about £2,150—the total deficiency is between £6.000 and £7,000, or deducting the cost about £4.000, but I realised assets above the bankrupt's statement of £1,300 to £1,500 which will go towards part of the expenses, about two-thirds of them—the beginning of 1901, I told Duthie that there was no possible hope of the firm going on unless £10,000 in cash was found at once, and that if he amongst his friends could find £5,000, Thomas Moffatt would find the other £5.000 and save the situation—there was a conference between the solicitors on either side and myself, and then a batch of bills had to be met about a week ahead when I made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190204070049"/>
               <p>that statement—then a notification was sent out to the holders of the bills on the solicitors' and my advice—the figures I have given do not show the net profit for the three years before and after the partnership—I can get them from the books—the books show a profit afterwards, but there was no profit—the figure "2 "has been added to the £12 12s. 6d. in the pass-book, as a debit to the bank, making it £212 12s. 6d.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In my opinion the business did show a profit for twenty<lb/>five years, there was nothing abnormal about it, and I see no reason to account for the loss, except the disappearance of cash—the books show a profit from 1897 to 1900—taking the interest on capital at £1,300 the net profit shown for the year 1898 was £1,153 1s. 9d., for 1899, £727 19s. 10d., and 1900, £1,170 17s. 2d.; there was no profit and loss account, but the accounts depend upon each other, and the prisoner hoodwinked the account<lb/>ants who made the audit.</p>

I am a messenger in the London Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of the bankruptcy of Ernest Edwin Woodhead who was adjudicated bankrupt on April 12th, 1901—he is described as a solicitor of 10, Gray's Inn Square—his liabilities are stated at £1,214 5s., and his assets as £1 10s. in his own statement of affairs—amongst the creditors is Caroline Maud Snowden on a judgment for £800—he was publicly examined, and this is a transcript of that examination which concluded on April 30th, 1901.</p>

               <p>who is 84 years old—Mr. Owen Williams is my brother-in-law—through him I became acquainted with the prisoner about 1894—I saw him at his office, 6, Furnival's Inn, and he did business for me in a manner of which I had no occasion to complain—about that time Miss Hobson was desirous of providing for me—I mentioned to Woodhead £2,200 which she had invested in the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, and in the Glasgow and South<lb/>western Railway debenture stock at 4 per cent.—he said he thought I could obtain better interest by investments in house property around London—about 1895 or 1896, Miss Hobson executed a deed of trust in my favour—Woodhead prepared it. (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence commencing on January</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st.</hi> 1896,<hi rend="italic">between Woodhouse and the witness was put in, in which he recommended house property in the suburbs of London as more desirable investments than railway stock.</hi>) On November 12th I came to London with my husband and saw Woodhouse at his office, and we all three went to look at eight houses, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72.74, 76, and 78, Byne Road, Syden<lb/>ham—I looked at the outside and went inside one—Woodhouse said he thought it was a very nice property, and would give a good return, and he highly recommended the houses—the owner was a Mr. Pharaoh, and the price was to be £3,400, and I believe I was to pay £1,200.—I was very pleased with the houses, and instructed him to buy them—the name of Henderson was not then mentioned, nor of any intermediary between the owner and myself—my husband is a land agent, but had not then any London experience—I formed my own judgment, and decided to purchase and to provide the purchase money by selling one of the railway stocks, and borrowing two-thirds of the purchase money—I had no reason to doubt the prisoner's statement in his letter of November 14th that the vendor asked for the usual deposit of 10 per cent., and I enclosed this cheque for £.340 in my reply of November 16th, which left £887 to pay, and on Novem<lb/>ber 23rd he wrote and sent the particulars I had asked for, and which showed an annual profit of £159 19s.—I afterwards sent him this cheque of December 2nd for £887, which sum I received from the sale of the shares of one of the railways, believing that sum was still due on the purchase-money—the deed of assignment and the declaration of trust which Miss Hobson executed I received in the prisoner's letter of December 7th, but the date was left blank: it now appears—the deed recites the assign<lb/>ment from Pharaoh to Henderson—I did not know that the prisoner was acting for Henderson—I asked him by letter about these matters, and received the reply of December 9th that the deed was in order, the date was left blank for convenience—on March 12th I wrote this letter to the prisoner, asking if he had any nice investment for the remainder of the trust money, and in reply he supplied me with particulars of five lease<lb/>hold houses at Bedford Park, and four at Buckley Road, Streatham, which were to be sold together—I came to London with my husband on May 11th, 1897—we went with the prisoner to see the property at both those places, and as to which he said practically the same as he had said about the Byne Road property, that he highly recommended it—it was arranged that I was to pay one-third of the purchase price, which was stated to be £3,200—he said that Mr. Smith was the owner—I do not</p>

               <p>remember his saving that he was acting for Smith—I agreed to the pur<lb/>chase for £1, (500 for the Bedford Park property, and £1,600 for the Buckley Road property, and the 10 per cent deposit, and I sent him the cheque for the £320 for that deposit, and received this receipt—to provide for that I sold my Baltimore and Ohio Railway bonds—he never told me that there was any intermediary—I sent the bonds to Woodhead for sale in my letter to him of September 2nd, 1897, and received the reply that he had sold them, also his statement showing £175 5s. 4d. due to him—I left the management of the three properties entirely to him, and received quarterly remittances regularly from him till three or four years ago, when they became less regular, till in the spring of 1899 I consulted Mr. Milling a solicitor of Leeds, and we had an interview with him on May 18th, 1899—Mr. Milling asked him about the remittances, and he said that a good many of the houses were empty—about June, 1899. I was served with two writs at the instance of the mortgagee for the non-payment of interest—that was the first I heard of non-payment of interest by Woodhead—I again consulted Mr. Milling—after that Woodhead commenced an action against me for £88 3s. 4d.—I counterclaimed for £880, and got judgment for the balance of £800—he had obtained £400 on the first property and £480 on the second by misrepresentation—the action was tried before Mr. Justice Wills in December 1900—if I had known that Woodhead was acting for Henderson, and buying the Byne Road property for £3,000 which he sold to me for £3,400,1 would not have parted with my money, nor if I had known that I was buy<lb/>ing for more than it was worth—I believed the real owner had been asking £3.400 for it, and that the owners of the other property were asking £3,200, and so parted with the £320—that is what induced me to execute the assignments produced—I believed his representations.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Attenborough and Sons solicitors—our client. Mrs. Amy Attenborough, lent Mr. Pharaoh money on mortgage on premises in the Byne Road, Beckenham—in 1896 Pharaoh was in arrears with his interest and I threatened to realise the security—a contract for the sale of property outright was prepared—I sent it to Woodhead for approval—the purchaser was J. G. Henderson—the contract is dated November 12th, 1896, and is for £3.000 and £150 deposit—the documents were exchanged on November 23rd, 1896—I received a deposit of £150 by this cheque signed by Woodhead, date 3 November 20th, 1896. and £340—I had no knowledge of Mrs. Snowden being inte<lb/>rested at that time—a draft assignment was submitted by Woodhead and approved—the purchase was completed on December 7th, 1896—there were two mortgages amounting to £2.250—this is the assignment by Pharaoh</p>

               <p>to Henderson—Henderson did not attend the appointment, and Woodhead gave me this undertaking to obtain his signature, and I received that day notes and cash for £589—Woodhead and I discussed the rate of interest on the balance of the £3.000, which he thought too high—when the deed was executed with regard to the interest on the mortgage money that was the first time I heard of Mrs. Snowden in connection with the Byne Road property—on July 8th 1897. Woodhead came to me and asked if I could arrange with a client who would lend £2.150 on property in Buckley Road, Streatham and Flanders Road. Bedford Park valued at £2,750—I prepared abstract of title and mortgage <hi rend="italic">deed.</hi> and attended completion on Sep<lb/>tember 8th of the Buckley Road and September 23rd, 1807, of the Flanders Road property—I understood from Woodhead's letter that Mrs. Snowden was the owner of the Byne Road property, but I found there had been an intermediate sale to Smith, and that there was a sub-sale to Mrs. Snowden—Smith was not present at the completion, and I got Wood head's under<lb/>taking to obtain his execution of the assignment—Mr. Stilgoe was the vendor's solicitor and Smith conveyed the property to Mrs. Snowden—it was one deed—I lent £2.130 in sums of £1,430 on one property and £750 on the other—the price to Mrs. Snowden was £1.600 on each property—the mortgage interest was paid by Woodhead at first regularly, and afterwards irregularly—eventually I sued Mrs. Snowden for principal and interest but the matter was put into Mr. Milling's hands and an arrangement was made—we did not want to take possession of the property.</p>

I am assistant manager to a firm of chemists—when I first knew Woodhead fifteen or sixteen years ago I was employed by that firm—he had acted for me in one or two matters and in the begin<lb/>ning of 1897 he came to me and said in effect that he knew of an oppor<lb/>tunity to purchase some house property that he believed to be worth very much more than the price to be paid for it and if I purchased it he believed he could sell it for me again at a good profit—one part of the property was in Buckley Road. Streatham and the other in Flanders Road, Bedford Park, Chiswick—he said that I should not have to find any money. That he would advance that—I consented—I never saw the property—when I saw him again he said, "I have been able to sell the property for you—I never paid a sixpence—I was to attend the completion—I went to Mr. Attenborough's office in Ely Place and signed a deed—I did not read it—I asked Woodhead if it was all right, and he said "Yes"—I was to have £150—when I asked him for it he said it was not convenient for him to pay just then would I lend it to him and I agreed to do so—I got a second charge on his house, but no interest on the money—these are the deeds which I signed—in 1899 I read a letter from Mr. Tremain, a solicitor, and the London agent of Mr. Milling, and saw Woodhead about it—he drafted this letter for me to reply [<hi rend="italic">Dated July</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1899. <hi rend="italic">and stating that he sold the property to Mrs. Snowden and Miss Hobson that the price paid and received was correctly stated, and that he had no desire to be troubled further about it.</hi>] I heard of the writ in an action against Woodhead and asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190204070053"/>

I am assistant examiner in the Official Receiver's Department of the Bankruptcy Court—I have investigated the prisoner's affairs in bankruptcy—I produce his books—I find a credit payment on November 4th of £180 from Charles Erard, and in the cash-book on Novem<lb/>ber 17, 1896, £340 from Mrs. Snowden—in the fair copy Bill of Costs Book Index there is a reference to J. G. Henderson at pages 228 and 229—those pages have been cut out—the preceding page is dated October 11th, 1897, and the following page October 14th, 1897, and do not relate to the same person, but to bills dated on October 11th, July 28th to August 6th, and on October 14th, 1897—in the prisoner's cheque-book I find no cheque or counterfoil for £125 on October 4th, 1897, No. 18921, nor on Septem<lb/>ber, 1897, No. 18937—I know the prisoner's writing—these are press copy letters to Henderson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist's manager—I have known Woodhead fourteen or fifteen years—in 1896 he mentioned some property in Byne Road, Sydenham, which he said was cheap and worth buying at £3,000, and asked if I should like to go in for it—I was then a chemist on my own account—I said I should like to see it—I had not £3,000—after<lb/>wards</p>

               <p>I understood that it was bought for me for £3,000—I paid Wood<lb/>head £150 deposit—I got it from my brother—Woodhead mentioned the deposit—I had no banking account, I gave him notes—he gave me a receipt—I have not got it—it is destroyed—I destroy all my papers because they are too cumbersome to take about—I wrote an acknowledgment to my brother—he sent it in notes by post in an unregistered letter—I have been engaged in similar transactions—this was in October or November, 1896—I have no record of the transaction—in November, 1896, I was in difficulties—on November 14th I could only pay £1 a month on a debt of £10 or £12, and Woodhead wrote asking for leniency—that is all I could find for that purpose—he was acting for me in staving off execution—he knew my circumstances—it is so long ago I cannot remember the exact circumstances—I got the £150 from my brother to buy this property—it was his property, I was buying with his money—my business was going to the bad—I was in great difficulties—Woodhead was staving off the bailiffs—I got the cheque of October 4th, 1897, for £125 from Woodhead—he cashed it for me in notes and gold in his office on the same day—I sug<lb/>gested that most likely—I lost it speculating in horse racing, betting and bookmaking—I never had a similar transaction with Woodhead before; I have since—I have been in the habit of going to him for cash—the same thing happened on October 22nd as to £100—he cashed an open cheque in the office—he gave me notes of small value, I do not recollect what.</p>

Tottenham, and Divisional Surgeon of Police—at 11.13 a.m. on January 26th I received a call to go to the Tottenham Marshes—I got there about 11.30—in a ditch near the shunters' cabin I saw the dead body of a woman which was subsequently identified as the body of Charlotte Cheeseman—her head was towards the wet bank—she had no hat on and was dressed in a tightly-fitting green jacket, the front of which was covered with blood—her face and hands were also covered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190204070057"/>
               <p>with blood—her arms were flexed across her chest and her fingers semi<lb/>flexed—one leg was drawn up—her clothes were not disturbed—she was not quite cold—the ground was particularly hard, and there was no sign of a struggle in the ditch—<hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> was then commencing—I saw a blood stain on the bank nearest to the railway and opposite her hips—after the arrival of the inspector we lifted her on to an ambulance, and we found there was larger blood stain at the bottom of the ditch where her head had laid—I had the body removed to the mortuary where I made a careful examination of it—I found the marks of violence solely confined to the hands and head—the injuries had been produced by a chisel or a gardener's knife with a spring to it so that it would not close—on the dorsal aspect of the second right metacarpal bone on the right hand I found an incised wound inch deep and—) inch long, on the dorsal aspect of the right fore<lb/>finger a wound 2 inches long, exposing the bone, an abrasion to the right knuckle, a compound facture of the second phalanx of the forefinger of the right hand, and a wound at the extremity of the finger—the whole of the hand was generally bruised and covered with blood—the left hand was covered with blood, and was much bruised and the little finger was abraised on the outer aspect—the face and head were covered with blood, and the hair which I had shaven off, contained clotted blood—there was a wound over the bridge of the nose one inch long, in a slanting direction from right to left; this had broken the nasal bones, and so admitted a probe 3 1/2 inches into the nasal cavity—there was a straight cut down the nose half an inch long, and two small wounds at the base of the nose—there was a large circular wound on the outer side of the right eye three inches long—the instrument which had caused it had fractured the mala or cheek bone, so that the outer orbit was not intact—in my opinion the blow which caused that had ruptured the eyeball—there was a wound on the right temporal bone one inch long, and extensive bruising over it—there was a wound behind the right ear two inches long—the upper part of the auricle was nicked, and there was a small wound at the basis of the junction of the ear with the head—there was a large amount of bruising on the left side of the top of the head and two wounds dividing the left auricle in its upper and lower third—there were two wounds corresponding to these auricle wounds at the junction of the auricle and the head—altogether I found seventeen incised wounds, but some of them had been caused by the same blow—on January 28th I made a <hi rend="italic">Post mortem</hi>—the nasal bones were broken, the cheek bone, which is very thick, was broken—the wounds on the nose, eye, and fingers were caused by a very powerful and stubby instrument—a file like this drawing, sharpened at both ends, would cause the wounds if it was very sharp—you would expect, seeing that the end of it is oblique, that it would have slipped off a bit, and that might account for the wound being so large—an instrument of this description is, in my opinion, consisted with the injuries—I examined the brain—on removing the scalp I found there was extensive bruising over both the side bones—on removing the skull cap a hemorrhage was found on the surface of the right side of the brain—the hemorrhage was clotted, and about the size of a bantam's egg, but flattened—the injury to the nose did not cause very extensive internal bleeding—</p>

               <p>if the woman was lying on her back the blood would find its way into the pharynx; that would make her cough—if she could not cough it all away it would impede respiration, and if the hemorrhage was sufficient it would choke her.—I should think the injuries to the eye and nose would cause very considerable pain and I should think would stun the person who received them—after receiving either of the blows I think she would be incapable of resistance—I think both those blows had been repeated quickly one after the other—the cause of death in my opinion was failure of the heart's action caused by exhaustion and hemorrhage caused by the blows on the head—I think death had been gradual—I formed that opinion because the amount of hemorrhage had not been large—it was a mere smear on the bank, and exactly the shape of the woman's head—it was only enough to redden the blades of grass, it was not in the substance of the earth—where the head had rested at the bottom of the ditch there was more hemorrhage, but if it had been all collected together it would not have amounted to much more than a quarter of a pint—the amount of hemor<lb/>rhage does not necessarily depend on the length of time the woman lived after she received the blows—she did not recover consciousness—there was a clot of blood on the surface of the brain which would cause her to remain unconscious—I think she had been dead six or eight hours before 11.30, but I think it was longer than six hours—she might have died at any time—I was present when the body was exhumed on March 12th, to be examined by Mr. Pepper—it was the same body that I had seen at the mortuary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On that occasion the woman's nails were examined to see whether there was any skin under them—I did not expect to find any, because I believe the scratches on the prisoner's face were very super<lb/>ficial—I never saw the prisoner, so, as far as my own knowledge goes. I do not know if they were superficial or not—if they had been deep scratches I should have expected to see skin under the nails—there was nothing in the deceased's nails to lead me to believe that they had scratched any<lb/>body—the instruments I mentioned at the police court were a gouge a chisel and a knife—the instrument must have had a sharp edge—when I first saw the body I thought it had been moved—I satisfied myself then that she was dead, and had died from violence—I made a careful examina<lb/>tion of her then and of the way she was lying—I thought she had been moved, because I saw where her head had rested on the bank—and I saw also that underneath her head there was more blood than there had been in the other place—I thought she had been lifted and not dragged—I did not weigh the body—I think she weighed over nine stone—she was very chubby—an inanimate body is more difficult to carry than an animate one although the same weight—I do not believe one man could have carried her very far—if a chisel was the instrument used, the blunt end must have been <hi rend="italic">used</hi> as well as the sharpened end—I should think all the injuries were done pretty quickly, and in rapid succession—that would indicate two different parts of the same weapon—two of the wounds could have been caused by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> kick, they wore abrasions, not wounds, there was no blood coming from them—I am not prepared to say if the woman had had connec<lb/>tion that night—I should say that sexual intercourse had taken place</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think the body was removed after the receipt of the injuries—the quantity of blood on the bank was so small that it made me think the body had only rested there for a minute—the patch of blood may have been <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> inches by nine inches, but it was very thin—if her head had rested there when she received the injuries, her body could have been swung into the bottom of the ditch without taking it off the ground at all because it was taking it from high to lower ground—if the woman was lying down voluntarily, and then received the injury to her eye, I should not expect to find evidence' of a struggle, but I should expect to find footmarks, because the person who caused it probably would not have stood in one place—if he was going to have connection, and was kneeling, I should expect to find marks from the toes of his boots—I took the spermatozoa from the body on the Thursday after the inquest was adjourned—the deceased was not a virgin—I cannot say if the first connection had been recent or not, there was no sign of recent rupture—the first connec<lb/>tion could not have been as recent as the night before, it must have taken place some time ago but I cannot say whether it was a month or a year—she was not pregnant.</p>

The upper blood mark on the bank was half the woman's height—from the lower mark, that would be about two feet six inches—if the centre of the body remained on the ground, that would bring the head from the place where it was first to where it was last—it would not take such a strong man to do that as to lift her—the blood was not scattered about—I think the injury must have been caused while she was on the ground, because it could not have been caused unless there was an opposing object, and the ground was the opposing object—if she had been standing up; the blow would not have been so severe.</p>

               <p>Hospital—I have for many years past given expert evidence on questions of surgery in Courts of Justice—I was asked to examine the body of the deceased, and on March 12th I saw the coffin opened—the injuries were practically as described by Dr. Wainwright—the body was in a good state of preservation and not in any way interfering with observation and formation of judgment—in my opinion the deceased was lying on her back when the injuries were inflicted—one of my reasons for that opinion is because of the wounds all over the back of the hands and on the face and head—there were no wounds below that—another reason is because I understood the blood was found on the upper part of the dress and cloth<lb/>ing merely, and the lower part of the jacket—if the wounds had been inflicted while the woman was in a standing position there would be a great deal of blood on the ground, the dress, and the boots—the nasal bones, and the bone on the outer side of the right eye socket were smashed; that could not be done nearly so easily if she had been standing there was practically no trace of the right eyeball, and Dr. Wainwright at the time told me it was burst when he made his first examination—the instrument to have inflicted such injuries must have been a cutting instrument, such as a chisel—I doubt if a knife would do it because it is very difficult with a knife to produce such wounds as these—the two wounds on the nose were clean cut wounds, from end to end, and the same depth throughout—however strong a knife may be, a wound inflicted by it almost always tails a little at the ends—it must have been a very strong instrument indeed to break the bones—a file sharpened at both ends like this drawing could quite easily cause the injuries I saw—the person receiving either of the severe wounds to the head would become unconscious almost immediately—the bursting of the eyeball and the injuries to the nose, would make a person faint right off, the bursting of the eyeball alone would probably do so—the state of the brain would continue the unconsciousness and render it permanent—if the person was lying on her back the blood from the nose would go down the back of the throat—the bleeding would be very pro<lb/>fuse—one result would be a sensation of choking, and another result would be real choking if the person was unconscious—a patient could not get rid of the blood in the windpipe—I should think the blows were all in<lb/>flicted in quick succession—the bruising at the side of the head could be caused by a kick or violent bashing of the head against the ground-in my opinion the woman would be dead within a few minutes after the receipt of the injuries—I carefully examined the nails of the deceased—they would be able to inflict scratches on a man's face, they were not particularly long or short—I examined the substance beneath them to see if there was any human skin there—there was none, simply some blood clots—her hands were covered with blood—I have seen the plans and photographs of this ditch—it would be possible and with the greatest ease, to swing the deceased from the side of the ditch to the bottom and without the person doing it getting blood on his clothes—this box (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>) contains a small piece of skin and a piece of bone which I think come from the nose or is a little piece of the cheek or off the outer side of the eye socket, they are too small to identify absolutely.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I agree with Dr. Wainwright's evidence in the main—it is not at all improbable that a man moving the deceased would get blood on him—if a person scratched another down the face you might find skin in the nails or not; I think in the majority of cases you would not find any—I have examined a good many cases to find skin, but I have never found any—if the scratches were superficial then of course, you would not get skin—the ends of a file would have to have a distinct cutting edge, not necessarily quite so sharp as a knife, to cause the wounds—it is possible, but exceedingly improbable, that a knife would cause them—I do not think it' the ends of a file were very pointed that they would slip off, because" the mere fact of its being pointed would fix it—the deceased could not have lived for two or three hours—there must have been considerable bleeding.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44, St. Paul's Buildings. Allen Street, Goswell Road, and attend to a paper staining machine at Messrs. Carlile and Clegg's—the prisoner was a machine labourer there—he worked sometimes in one department and sometimes in another for about fifteen months up to January 20th—he spoke to me several times about the deceased between January 13th and 16th—he said he was in serious trouble with her—I asked him what the trouble was about, and he told me he had been giving her a good hiding, and that her brother and some more men were waiting outside the factory to give him one—he said she was six weeks gone and he would get <hi rend="italic">shut</hi> of her—on January 16th he told me they had made up the quarrel, and on the 18th he said he had been to a music-hall with her the night before—he said I should see her at the corner of the street at one o'clock that day waiting for him, which I did—I had seen her the Monday previous waiting for him—this is a photograph of the girl I saw—on Monday, January 20th, he came to work, and told me that on Sunday night he had been looking for me, but not being able to find me him and his girl called at his uncle's, Mr. Symonds who keeps a public house in St. Luke's, that he told his uncle that he intended to get married, and his uncle told him that he would make him a handsome wedding present—I told him that getting married was the best thing he could do and that frequent quarreling would get him into trouble—he said he was going to take half-a-day's holiday, to have a ramble round the Lea—he did not say with the deceased—I told him if he did he would be discharged—he said he should have the half-day's holiday, and he did not care if he was discharged—he did not come back in the afternoon, and I never saw him again until the inquest.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had a particular reason for going to the Rosemary Branch, which was to get some money from a gentleman—on the following Monday I heard of the body being found on Tottenham Marshes, and I spoke to Mrs. Matthews between ten and eleven on that morning—I do not think the body had been recognised then—I only looked at the photo<lb/>graph to please the police—I was not anxious to give evidence—the reason I did not look particularly at the photograph was because I did not want to be mixed up <hi rend="italic">in the case</hi>—I saw a row of men at the Coroner's Court before he sat to hear evidence—there were about fourteen men, and. I was asked if I could pick out the man I saw in the Rosemary Branch—the man I saw was the prisoner—when I saw them there I do not think the girl was quite sober—she looked as if she had had a glass—I did not notice the man—I was in the Rosemary about ten minutes, when I finished my glass and went out—they came in while I was there—I cannot say how long they stayed there—altogether I was ten minutes in there before they came in, and I remained ten minutes longer, as far as I remember.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were three people serving in the bar when I came in after my supper, the potman, the head barman, and the governor—they would have the same opportunity as I had of seeing anyone who was in the public bar, if they were on the same side, as I was—they were all on duty on the Saturday night—I usually took the public bar, and the others would help if we were busy—Saturday is a busy night as a rule between nine and ten—the saloon bar is more select than the public bar, and the prices are higher—the prisoner and the deceased always came in at the same bar—they were not there the previous night, but I am sure they were there once that week, on the Tuesday or Wednesday—they usually came earlier, about 8.30—as a rule they remained there about the same length of time—I do not always go in to supper at the same time—I have no doubt whatever on the Saturday that they were in the bar sometime between 9 and 9.30—I did not see them go out—it would be about 9.15 when I last saw them—I am quite sure it was some minutes past nine—it was between ten minutes and a quarter past—I am not sure what day it was when Inspector Pearn came with the photo—I cannot be certain if it was Thursday, January 30th, but it was a Thursday—it way a week after I went to Stoke Newington to identify the prisoner—I had seen the photo a week before that—I was only shown one, which I did not at first recognise as the prisoner, but afterwards did—I could not recognise it at the first glance, although I had been seeing the prisoner three or four times a week—when I saw the photo the second time I think Inspector Martin was with Inspector Pearn—at Stoke Newington Police Court 1 picked out the prisoner—to the best of my belief on the Saturday the prisoner was wearing a scarf, but I am not quite sure.</p>

               <p>hailed the driver of the car and then me—the car eased up and the man jumped on—when the car stopped a woman jumped on—as the man got on I thought he looked under the influence of drink, and I was going to object to his getting on, but I did not—I did not take particular notice how the young woman was dressed—she had a broad-brimmed hat on—the hat produced appears to be about the same size—they went on the car to the Manor House, travelling outside, because it was full in—they occupied the first seat on the left as you get on the top—I went on the top several times before reaching Manor House—the thoroughfare Southgate Road is well lighted with electric light for nearly a mile—it was a clear night, cold, but not extra cold—on one occasion when I was on the top I noticed the young woman throw the knee apron off her knees and throw it over the next seat in front of her—the car was cleared at Manor House, but I did not see them get off—I observed that the man was dressed in a brown-coloured coat, with no overcoat on, and a small cloth peaked cap on his head—round his neck he had a coloured handkerchief and no collar—on Saturday, February 2nd, I was shown the photo (No. 10)—on February 25th I saw a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> of about twenty-two men at the Coroner's Court, the same day that I gave my evidence, and I picked out the prisoner as the man I had seen on the car—I saw no photo of the prisoner between February 2nd and 25th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first saw the photo I was not at all sure of the man—a great number of the working men who go to and fro on our trams wear caps, I will not say half, and a great number wear scarves round their necks—a great many wear <hi rend="italic">bowler</hi> hats—it is not unusual to see some with a scarf and cap, and a scarf and collar is not unusual—most of the men wear billycocks—I should describe the jacket the prisoner wore as a straight-cut jacket—I mean it comes to a corner, it is not rounded—his jacket looked brown to me, not grey—I am not well up in colours—I had never seen the man before that I am aware of—the prisoner was well enough to ride on the tram, although I believed he was under the influence of drink—that I could see before he got on the tram—I did not think he would create a disturbance—I did not take sufficient notice to say that the girl was drunk—there would be about four minutes' interval between the passing of my tram and the next one at the Rosemary Branch, mine could pass at 8.55, and the next 8.59—I should get to the Rosemary at 24 or 9.25—there is a printed list of the times on the cars—I have not been on the same car since to work it at night time.</p>

I did not think anything about it at the time—the reason I recollect it is, that on January 23rd, Thursday.I was summoned at the North London Police Court for over crowding, and on the Friday I had another day off and on the Saturday I missed my car and my relief—there was nothing to impress upon my mind what the exact colour of the scarf was—so with regard to the whole of the dress there was nothing specially to draw my attention to it, and it is my recollection as to what the man had on.</p>

I took up the man about twenty-eight or thirty yards from the Rosemary Branch public house, just on the bridge—we run along the Southgate Road and Brickford Place—Brunswick Place I do not know.</p>

I am a stableman employed at the Park Hotel, Tottenham—on Saturday, January 25th I was in the middle bar of the public-house—there were two people there when I entered, a young man and young woman—I remained in the bar with them about ten minutes—I left before they did—the young man was sitting on a chair with his head resting on his hand—he was on the right of the woman—I was standing on the right hand of the door, leaning on the bar in the corner by the partition facing them—the man was looking up at the woman—I did not hear them speak—I noticed the woman was sitting very still, and that she had a green coat and felt hat with a kind of feather in it, a light skirt and a black umbrella in her hand, with a green knob to it, I identify this umbrella (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) also the jacket and hat—I afterwards recognised the woman's body at the mortuary on the Tuesday following—the woman looked as if she had had sufficient to drink—as to the man, I cannot say—I did not</p>

I am a private in the Militia Battalion, East Surrey Regiment—I met the prisoner at the canteen at Kingston about January 30th and arranged to go to London with him on Saturday, February 1st—we left at a quarter past three in the afternoon—he took me to Eagle Wharf Road, and asked me to go to No. 20 and ask for Mr. Woolfe, whom he said was his father—he asked me to speak to him in a whisper, because he did not wish people in the house to hear—he gave as the reason he did not go himself that he had had a row in the house—he told me to tell Mr. Woolfe his son wanted to see him at the bottom of the street—I was in uniform—I told the father—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the bottom of the street, and told him his father was going to lock him up—he said, "Come on"—we walked away as sharp as we could to the Bank, and took the Tube to Shepherd's Bush, where my sister lives—we had tea there, and then went to my father's, 36, Claybrim Road, Fulham Palace Road, Hammersmith, where the prisoner stopped on the Saturday night—on the following Sunday morning, February 2nd, we had a Lloyd's Sunday paper—I said, "Look here, murder at Tottenham; you come from that way, don't you?" and I read the paper to him—that is the paper produced, and I read as far as the red line marked on it—(<hi rend="italic">This gave an account of the finding of the body and of the identification.</hi>)</p>

Pall Mall, and the head European office is at 11, Rue Screed, Paris, and the head office at New York—they have eight or ten other offices throughout Europe—their business is issuing notes of credit, upon which a commission is charged—they are issued in America and at some of the offices in Europe—the name of the person who buys them should be put in the top corner at the time of issue, so as to give a specimen of his genuine signature, and before they are cashed they are signed by the same signature—if a note is payable to John Jones, he has to write his name on it—the identification is only that of the original holder—if a supposed John Jones comes and says, "I want £4 1s. 7d.," we should give it to him—we might require some identification, but this would be considered as an ordinary cheque—we compare the signature at the top with that at the bottom to see that they tally—every cheque bears a number in serial order in the right-hand corner—we never issue two cheques bearing the same number, there are no duplicates in existence—on Friday. April 26th, 1891, I was in charge of the cashier's department in Paris, and left about (6.15—I had the key in my possession—I locked up the safe before I left, leaving in it a number of unissued cheques—I returned on the morning of the 27th and found the police there—I saw no outer marks on the office, it must have been opened by a key—the safe was lying on its side on the floor—it had been burst open by putting some explosive into the keyhole—it was a good deal broken—I missed a number of the blank cheques—510 of them were for 20 dollars each—the numbers were 204135 to 204645—I have examined these twenty-two cheques—one figure in each has been altered.

                  </hi>. I was director and manager of the Anglo-American Exchange, 3, Northumberland Avenue, in February last—part of our business was to exchange foreign money and notes—on Thurs-day, February 27th, Inger having sent a message called and said that he had a friend, who had a friend, who had some notes to change—he asked me to go to the Northumberland Arms with him—when there he said, "I want some of the commission"—our commission is 2 1/2 per cent.—he said he believed his people would consent to about 20 per cent.—I thought he misunderstood his position—he introduced me to Lewis at the Hotel</p>

               <p>Victoria—he said, "This is the friend of my friend who has the notes"—I said, "I am pleased to meet him, I cannot give an opinion about the notes unless I see them"—he said, "My friend has them down at the Clarence"—I volunteered to go to the Clarence to see him, that is imme<lb/>diately behind Old Scotland Yard—Grosberger was introduced to me there as Mr. Schmidt—I asked to see the notes. Schmidt said to Lewis, "Oh, not here"—then they spoke in an undertone which I did not hear—Inger was alongside of me—coining back Schmidt gave Lewis a packet, and when Lewis came to me I saw three of the notes out of the packet—the packet was open in an envelope—they were twenty dollar notes of the American Express Company—I saw on the top of them "Ellias Rolles," and they were countersigned at the bottom—I said, "These are all right, there are not funds sufficient now in the office, but if you come to our office at 10.30 in the morning they can be changed"—Lewis said, "All right, I will be there"—they said they had twenty, and could bring £300 worth more so that I might get the cash to meet the demand—I gave Lewis the notes back at once, and he put them back in the same packet—something was said about Inger having a third of the commission and trying to earn £5—I walked back into the office—Inger said something at the second hearing at Bow Street about the notes being signed, which I do not recollect—I telegraphed to Inspector Froest, who was not in—I saw him the next morning at 9.50—I had come to the conclusion that there was something wrong—I afterwards saw Inspector Sexton at Bow Street—in consequence of what he said I put off the interview about three times during the day, twice by telephone and once by going to Inger's place at Henrietta Street,—acting under the Inspector's instructions, when I saw him in his office about noon, I said "I want time to get further money to be able to change the lot," and I invited him out to the Bedford Head, because I wanted to telephone to my office to say when I would be there, but Inger asked me to go into the Covent Garden Hotel basement where I saw Grosberger and Lewis at a table—I recognised but did not speak to them—Inger accompanied me to the Bedford Head in Maiden Lane, where I wanted to telephone—I saw Sexton, I did not speak to him, but carried out instruc<lb/>tions by accompanying Inger into the street while he told me about the £300 worth of notes, and that they would come to my office as near four as possible—at four o'clock I was in my office—Lewis came in and made inquiries for passages and got the refusal of passages to New York by Cunard boats—the refusal means the right to take the berth up to a certain time—he produced twenty or twenty-two notes and wanted change to pay the hotel bill, and he said he would consult his wife at Bailey's Hotel, Kensington, as to the passages and come back in an hour and a-half, and eventually he was asked for identification from the issuing firm, and he said he would bring it with him—he had this envelope addressed on the counter, but it was not a letter of identification—I said, "I require a letter of identification issued by the Express Company"—he said that when he came back he would bring it—he said the passage was for himself, wife, and two children—he left—I saw Inger about an hour or three-quarters of an hour afterwards standing on the police way half way over the road</p>

C. Bolles "on these cheques—they are not the same, nor is the counter signature—"Elias Rolles" has been altered from "E.C. Bolles"—the capitals E and C have been obliterated, and "lias "placed there, and the bottom of the B has been obliterated and a tail put to the R—the ink is a different colour in some cases, and in some the capital "C "is quite distinct—I do not think acid was used, but an ordinary sharp eraser—an ordinary acid would have made the colour run—the roughness is proved by the running of the ink—"E.

You know, Mr. Inspector, I have told you the truth when you saw me; I have given it to you in writing"—I took him to the station—some thirty yards from the office he said, "The statement I have given you is only a copy; will you permit me to return and get the original, which is in my own writing"—we went back to No. 6, and from a desk on the ground floor he took this envelope, containing the statement I now produce, and handed it to me—I took him to Scotland Yard, where he took from his pocket two circulars, and said, "There are two balance-sheets of the Royal British Bank, received by me, and they will show I had an account there, and that is why I went to Mr. Pettersen's; I want that produced in Court "'—I said, "This is no balance-sheet, it is only a circular"'—he asked for bail—I said, that it was on a warrant—he said, "I will go into the witness-box and tell the whole truth, the same as you have it in my statement—"I found in Lewis's pocket ten pawn-tickets, twenty-two cheques, the subject of this charge, and some memoranda.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FORDHAM</hi>. When I first heard from Caygill I did not tell him to say to Lewis that the notes were all right, he said it entirely on his own responsibility—I did not tell him to say to Lewis that the notes must be signed top and bottom—I did not give him any directions for Lewis to do anything with the notes—his actions were not guided by me only the laying of the trap—the arrest was in Northumberland Avenue about 4 p.m.—there were not half a dozen people at that point—the arrest did not cause people to come up—there were several, but they did not know what was going on, they did not know he was in custody—he said, "Don't make a fuss"—I took hold of his arm—the majority of the pawn tickets were in the name of Lewis—I returned them by the Magistrate's order.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. When I put my hand on Lewis Grosberger was not half a yard from him—he was not in the carriage-way leading to Trafalgar Square—it was about two hours after the arrest that I had a conversation with Grosberger—he was in a cell at Great Scotland Yard—it was communicated to me that he desired to have a friend there, and I went to his cell with Inspector Fraser, in uniform,</p>

               <p>and Sergeant Bell—I said, "What is it you want 1"—he said that he wanted to be allowed to communicate with his friends—I did not say, "I cannot allow you, I have not completed my inquiries"—he was allowed to do so—I did not say, '-' Can you tell me anything about the rest of the £300?" nor did he answer that he had not had any of it—he handed me a key and said, "This is the key of the box, but my wife has just come out of hospital, and if you go there she is sure to drop down dead"—I knew that to be the fact, and did not go—I did not leave the cell door—just as the conversation terminated the solicitor arrived—I did not leave the cell door with the Inspector and afterwards return by myself—the cell door is the desk upon which I made a note as the prisoner said it—I did not make it at the cell gate, but two or three yards away at a desk—I I did not take the statement down as he made it, but a short distance off, outside the cell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HALL</hi>. I spoke to Inger first on Saturday, March 1st, because I had seen him with the other two men—they were arrested on February 28th, and Inger on April 2nd—there were five remands, which Inger attended by my advice, with the object absolutely of being called as a witness—he told me everything fairly and frankly—when he took me up to his office on March 1st a gentleman came in—that is he [<hi rend="italic">Mr. Scarborough.</hi>] I believe—Inger was so excited that I do not know what he said—he did not say, "This gentleman has come to see me about Lewis and Grosberger"—I did not say to him, "Mr. Inger is a lucky man, I came here to arrest him, but being satisfied with what he says I intend to call him as a witness," nothing like it—when I went there on April 2nd I saw a number of people on the ground floor, and asked him to go into a private room—he was very excited—his condition was that of a man who was absolutely surprised—when he asked to go back he did not say that he wanted to hand the statement to the solicitor, he said, "In his defence"—I handed a copy of the statement to his solicitor—he tele<lb/>phoned for him from his office to the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was at Inger's office a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes on March 1st—while I put the questions to him Sergeant Bell put down his answers—we three were alone in the room—Mr. Scar<lb/>borough did not come in till the very end of the interview, it was really his presence that brought our interview to a close—no questions were put after Mr. Scarborough was in the room—I was introduced to Mr. Scarborough as a friend of his, but he was so excited that he could not get out his name—Scarborough was in the room with us two minutes at the very outside—I said nothing to him about Inger being a lucky man—he said, "How do you do?" and shook hands with me—the pawn-tickets I found on Lewis were all within ten months—the six or seven on Grosberger were taken possession of by the sergeant.</p>

               <p>two letters of John Lewis, 9, Hereford Road, Acton.a telegram to the same address, and about half a dozen pawn tickets, all within the last twelve months, which were handed back by the Magistrate's order—I was with Sexton at Inger's office on March 6th—I have been in Court this morning—there is no truth in the statement that Sexton said "Mr. Inger is a lucky man; I came here to arrest him, but being satisfied with what he says I intend to call him as a witness"—Sexton has given a correct account of what passed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HALL</hi>. I was with Sexton when he spoke to Inger in the street—I did not hear Inger suggest anything that passed at the interview—I had been in the room about a quarter of an hour when Scarborough came in—I believe Sexton shook hands with him, I can't remember—there was no conversation between them—I heard Inger say. "These two gentlemen have come to inquire about Lewis and Grosberger"—we went from there to a public-house and had some refreshment.</p>

Rolles</hi>, 9, <hi rend="italic">Hereford Road, Acton, and on that day Inger intro<lb/>duced him to Caygill as "My friend, Mr. Smith," in a jocular manner; that Caygill looked at the notes and said, "These are all in order" and that anybody could sign them; that some were signed Elias Rolles and some were unsigned; that he went to Inger's office next day, who asked him to call later as Caygill had not got the money ready, and directed him to go to the Express office and ask for a passage for America as an indication to Caygill that he was the person who had come about the notes but nothing was done then; that he called at the office again on the Friday, and Inger told him that he had seen the notes and to go upstairs and sign the notes which were in blank, which he did, and Inger came up and blotted them as he signed them; that he took them to Caygill's office about</hi> 3.45 <hi rend="italic">and as his coat was very shabby it was suggested that he should change coats with Gros<lb/>berger and when they re-changed coats the next day there were four letters in his pocket; that when he asked the price of a passage to America at</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">the office Caygill was at the entrance, and said, "I will attend to this gentle<lb/>man," and asked for a letter of identification which he had not got, and that it was not true that he showed him a letter with "Rolles "upon it; that somebody in his house signed the registered letter, and there was nothing inside it, and that another letter came next day in the same name with nothing in it; that he could not explain why Inger should write to him as E. Rolles, except to get him to personate Rolles, but he did not do so, and did not produce the envelopes: that he wrote the letters "as" after "E" on the notes as he thought he had a right to do so, and wrote the bottom signatures himself all except two, but did not try to imitate the top signa<lb/>tures, though one of them looked the same. (Signing his name, by the direction of the Court.); that he did not tell Caygill he could bring him</hi> £300 <hi rend="italic">worth of the notes, or said anything about</hi> £300, <hi rend="italic">which was a pure invention, and that his interest in the matter was only the obtaining of</hi> £5,<hi rend="italic">and he did not throw any blame upon Inger, believing the notes were obtained in gambling.</hi>

               <p>to Stillwell's house on March 15th—my bad temper had not quite worn off then—I invited him to come and stay at Ashford—I cannot say if I was in his kitchen or in a public-house when I invited him—it was before we got to Waterloo—I told him that I and the prisoner had quarrelled, and he suggested that he should come down and put things straight—he did not come down simply for a change of air, he came to interfere in our affairs—his wife heard me invite him down—I think he thought he was going to stop in my own rooms—the prisoner pays for those rooms, they are in his name—I think we got to St. Margaret's House about nine—I do not know if Stillwell is a good boxer—he was going to take my part—I did not know if there would be a fight—I do not think I had any thought at the time—I do not think I have heard of Stillwell acting as Don Quixote to a lady in distress before—when we got home the prisoner offered to shake hands with Stillwell in a perfectly friendly way—Stillwell had a bag in his hand, I do not know which hand—he could have shaken hands if he had been minded to—I told the prisoner I had brought my fancy man down to give him a good hiding—of course I did not mean it, he is not my fancy man—Stillwell heard what I said—he stood right alongside of me—the prisoner went out then—he returned in a few minutes and said, "What did you want to fetch him down to make a disturbance?"—I said, "To please myself" and that I should fetch who I liked—he told Stillwell to go out, us the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> had given him strict orders not to' have anyone in the house and would he kindly leave it—Stillwell must have heard that—he told the prisoner to go and drown his b----self—the prisoner said then or afterwards that he would make it warm for me—he was going to tell my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>—then he went out—the kitchen window was shut—he came to the scullery door, which was open, and said to Stillwell, "I suppose you have come down to give me a good hiding "or"to make a row?"—Stillwell said, "Yes, I have, and you can have it"—I heard a report of a gun, and I thought I was shot—it is true to say, "Stillwell and I were not quite sober when we got to St. Margaret's House, and were impudent to the prisoner"—the disturbance originated through me.</p>

Mrs. Dowd, and a lot of people came in—they went out, and after I had drunk my beer I followed them—Pool spoke to me outside—I saw the prisoner in the road—I heard him say something about making it warm—I do not know if he heard what Pool said—afterwards I went to St. Margaret's House—I opened the gate and went into the kitchen—I saw Pool, Stillwell, and Mrs. Dowd there—Mrs. Dowd said, "Oh, it is you, George come in '—I stood leaning against the wall till I heard the report of a gun—Stillwell was then on the right-hand side of the doorway going in—before the shot Mrs. Dowd</p>

               <p>George Daniel Bernard Clark, he was four <hi rend="italic">years</hi> old and my son, his general health was fair. He was taken ill with scarlet fever before Christ<lb/>mas. I knew it was scarlet fever from experience, and I informed the Sanitary Officer; he got over the attack, but did not appear the same in strength; about a fortnight ago he got a cold, he was so hot and feverish; he did not begin to cough until the Saturday before he died, he took his food all right. On Wednesday, the 19th inst., I called in Mr. Benton, an elder of the Peculiar People who came and laid his hands on him and anointed him, I thought the child was in need of deliverance; on the following day the child was better, Mr. Benton did not attend. On Satur<lb/>day. March 22nd, his breathing was bad, and I called in Mr. Benton again, I put flannel on his chest: he began to cough on Saturday, and he became easier. On Friday, the 21st, he-was weaker, and I called in Mr. Benton; I sat up with the deceased on Saturday night, he laid calmly, but did not sleep, his cough had stopped, he took lemonade and weak brandy and milk and black-currant jelly, he took nourishment up to half an hour of his death: he died at 5.10 p.m. on Sunday evening, March 23rd, he was prayed for in the chapel on that day, the elders did not come, my husband earns 28s. a week, I did not call in a doctor on account of my creed; I thought the child was very ill, he had been so for three days, and ailing before: he did not suffer pain, so far as I could see, he was not in acute painh, is breathing was bad, I thought he had a cold and bronchitis. On Sunday I saw he was very ill, Mrs. Benton saw the child on Sun<lb/>day, Emma Skington, my mother saw the child from time to time"—<hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, "The deceased was my son, his general health was not very strong. He was at school until Tuesday fortnight last, he seemed to have got a cold, so much so that he was not allowed to go to school, I noticed he did not seem quite well. He went on about the same until Wednesday, March 19th, he did not seem so well then, he did not seem to want to lie on the couch: my wife called on Elder Benton with my sanction: he got better on Thursday, the 20th. On Friday, the 21st, he was not quite so well again, when I got home in the evening my wife told me that the deceased had not been so well, he seemed to be breathing rather heavily, and seemed dull he was on a couch in the kitchen. On Saturday, the 22nd, I rose at 4 a.m. and noticed he breathed more heavily, I saw him again at 2 p.m., he was about the same as when I left him in the morning, in the evening the elder was called in. He was kept in bed from Friday evening, but my wife and I nursed him, wrapped in blankets from time to time. On Sunday I noticed he was breathing more heavily, the cough ceased on Saturday night.I did not call a doctor because I believe the Bible tells me what to do in sickness, I have myself suffered from an influenza cold and suffered pain: I thought the child had a cold and bronchitis. On the Sunday the child complained of a pain in his heart, that was the first time he complained. I do not always complain when I suffer pain, I and my wife asked the child several times if he was suffering and he said no, he was very sensible, if he was really dying I should not call in a doctor."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, M.</hi>). About 10.15 p.m. on March 21st I was called to a fire at 74, Bankside, near Blackfriars Bridge, on the south side—there is a large hay and straw wharf there—the hay and straw is kept in three corrugated iron buildings—two out of the three were burned—I did not go into them—when I got there the fire was not out—I remained there about two hours while it was burning—the entrance to the wharf is not locked up at night—there is a large gateway which' is never closed and the ends of the buildings themselves are open—there is no watchman—at 12.30 I went back to the Borough Police Station, which is about fifteen minutes' walk from the wharf, and I saw the three prisoners there—they had been there only a few minutes when I got there—I asked them if they had any money—I found they were destitute—they seemed hungry—I charged them with wandering without visible means of subsistence—they said they wanted to make a statement—I said, "Come into my room: I will take your statements, but understand, anything you say may</p>

               <p>be used in evidence against you; now do you wish to make this statement?—they each said "Yes"—I took each prisoner into my room separately, Murphy first because he was senior—I wrote it down—he read it and signed it—then I called in Ludford—he read Murphy's statement and signed it, and Oates did the same—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>). Murphy said, "About 10 p.m. on the 21st inst.I went with Ludford and Oates to the Walkleys' wharf to have a sleep on the hay and straw. We climbed to the top, and I lit a match to light a cigarette. We had only one cigarette, and were passing it round. We sat talking a few minutes, and all of a sudden smoke came from the hay, and then flames, and we ran out; we did not raise any alarm as we were frightened. We watched the fire from the Embankment, and after<lb/>wards came on to the station, as we thought we should get found out. After lighting the match I put the end out with my fingers, and then threw it down on the hay, but I think a portion of it must have fallen down upon the straw.I had no intention of setting fire to the straw, and I have had no home for the past eight or nine months, but used to live in the boys' home, Westminster Bridge Road, and have slept on the straw with the other two lads for the past two or three nights"—Ludford said, "I have read the statement made by Murphy, and it is correct.I have had no home for the past three months, but previously lived in the same house as Murphy"—Oates said, "I have read the statement made by Murphy, and it is correct.I have had no home for the past two months, but was pre<lb/>viously in the same home as Murphy and Ludford"—next morning I saw them again, and said, "I do not believe the statement you made to me last night, but I think you set fire to the straw for the same reason, to bring yourselves under notice,"I meant to get locked up and taken care of—. Murphy said, "No, Sir, I did not; it was an accident"—the others also said it was an accident and that they did not mean to set light to it—they were then charged.</p>

Ltd., at 74, Bankside—they had three buildings for storing horse fodder—two of them were burnt on the night of March 21st—the fodder was compressed foreign hay, some from Canada and some from Norway—it was packed as close as possible—it is not a lock-up place, and we have no watchman—we have been there about fifty years, and have never had a fire before—there was about three or three and a half loads of straw on top of the hay that was not compressed, it was in trusses—there was a corrugated iron roof over it—it was all dry—the fire originated among the straw on the top, right at the water side—I was there in less than five minutes after the fire broke out.</p>

I am a superintendent in the London Salvage Corps—I was called to this fire on March 21st—about £1,000 worth of damage was done—the premises are insured for £13,250—compressed hay would be difficult to light with the dying embers of a match—there would be about the same difficulty in lighting straw—a lighted wooden match thrown down on straw would go out nine times out of ten, but a wax vesta would be a different thing altogether—if a wooden match kept alight it would set fire</p>

               <p>Mortlake, and am a salesman employed at Clark's Nursery, Putney.I have been married to the deceased for about 7 1/2 years—we went to live at Mortlake two years ago last March—we became acquainted with the prisoner about a month after we went there—he was living there before we went there—he lived at No. 83, Second Avenue—lie represented him self to me as a retired baker—he is married—we became friendly, and he used to visit our house—my wife was not in business at that time, but in October she went to work at Messrs. Butt and Sons. High Street. Ken<lb/>sington, where she stayed till March 6th—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> met the prisoner outside Palmer's Stores, Bridge Road, Hammersmith in March, 1901—he was only a neighbourly acquaintance but he used to come to my house and play at cards—we generally played dummy whist—he was waiting against a van which I used to use on my rounds—we shook hands and passed the time of day, when he began to blackguard me—he said I was a dirty Frenchman, that I did not keep my wife, that she went to work and kept me, that I was a drunkard, a thief, and all sorts of things—I saw him subsequently in the streets at Mortlake from time to time, when the same abuse took place—he said he was going to mark me, that his life had been ruined, and he was going to ruin me—in March and April our relationship was very unfriendly—in April he came and smashed my windows, and on July 20th I lodged a complaint with the police that he had threatened to shoot or stab either my wife or myself—I asked for police protection—he left us alone for about a week or a fortnight, then he came and made a disturbance outside our house—I went out and thrashed him, he returned and smashed my windows—when he was outside he said, "You dirty Frenchman, take your b----h----to bed and—"—I went to the police court and took out a summons against him for using abusive language and damaging my windows—I was served with a cross-summons for assault—they were heard on August 28th—the summons against me was dismissed, and the summons I had taken out against him was confirmed, and he was fined—I met him next day in Priory lane—he asked me if I was satisfied—on February 23rd I had an accident to my ankle while skating and I was unable to go to work till March 6th—my wife continued to go to business—on March 6th she returned at her usual hour of 6.30—two friends, Mr. Church and Mr. Oneil came in to spend the evening—we were all sitting in the front sitting-room, and about 6.20 there was a knock at the door—my wife went to open it—there was no light in the hallit was a very foggy night—I heard the front door open, and I heard a voice, which I recognised as the prisoner's, he said, "Is Mr. Pamphilon in '?"—I did not hear any reply, but I instantly heard a pistol shot and then two more—I did not hear a fall—I was sitting in front of the fire, with my leg on some cushions—immediately I jumped towards the door, my ankle gave way, and I fell down—all I remember after that is getting to the window, and breaking it and calling for help—when I got into the passage I saw my wife there, dead or dying, with her head against the sitting-room door.</p>

               <p>those eleven months he conducted himself in a perfectly friendly way—I did not notice that his conversation with other people was abusive or foul-mouthed—there was no foundation for his accusing me of not keeping my wife, she was allowed to keep her own wages and mine—his sudden change from friendship to enmity took my breath away—when he made the charge against me about my wife I said that if we had not been so friendly for such a time I should have had him locked up—he said, "That is what I want you to do. Hammersmith police court is just round the corner; take me round there, and I will expose you"—I asked him what he had to expose, there was nothing to expose—the Magistrate tried to get him to say what he had to expose and he said nothing—when he said, "Take me to the police court,"I said "You are drunk or mad. I will leave you," and I got up into my van and drove away—I said at the police court that I had said, "Oh. you must have suddenly gone mad, I shall not stop to speak to you"—there is not the slightest ground, so far as I know, for saying that my wife had separated him from his wife.</p>
