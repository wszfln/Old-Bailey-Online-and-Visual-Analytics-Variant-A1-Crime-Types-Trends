            . I live with my mother in Newman Street; I was at a lady's house opposite my mamma's whilst my mother was out of town. I was informed on Tuesday the 19th of May, that my mother's house had been broke open; I went immediately to the house and missed a great quantity of clothes; the back kitchen door (which is the back door of the house) was open; there were two holes broke large enough to put a man's hand in; the holes were made just over the bolts, that was the back door of the house. There was in the back room a bureau and a clothes press broke open, but nothing was taken out; in the two pair of stairs front room all the things were taken out of the chest. These are the things that are produced; I lost four negligees and sacks and a night gown. I went directly to Mr. Cox's where I saw two bundles, one was opened, which I found contained several things of my mother's and mine; th e other bundle was not opened. I went down to my mother in the country; she was about four miles from home; she came up the Friday following.</p>

I came to town on Friday with my mistress, and found the house had been broke open; the back area door and the parlour had two holes in them. I know these clothes to be my mistress's; they were in a chest in the two pair of stairs room when we went into the country.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Pancras Parish; on Tuesday morning, the 19th of May, I saw the prisoners about a quarter after four come out of Windmill-street, Tottenham-court road, each of them had a bundle on his back; they crossed down on the left hand side towards Russel-street; Henry Green, a brother watchman, and I pursued them; we thought it was bedding, one was tied up in a blanket, the other in a coverlid; when we came to Russel-street corner, Emmington, a watchman of St. Giles's, was smoaking his pipe, I beckoned to him and he came up; I thought before we were not sufficient to seize them; Emmerton came up and we seized Alsworth at the corner of Russel-street; Adshead upon that threw down his bundle and ran up Russel-street, another watchman of St. Giles's pursued him, and he was stopt; we took Alsworth away to Giles's round-house; Adshead was brought in soon afterwards. Leadbetter searched Alsworth before Adshead came in; I don't know what he took out of his pocket, we opened the bundle in the public house; they were both secured then. The bundles contained all these cloaths and many more; we carried the clothes to Justice Cox's, and from thence we took them to the Justices Office in Litchfield-street. When we first stopt them and asked them what they had got there; Alsworth said, what is that to you? we asked them where they were going with them? they said they were their own property, and it was hard they should be stopt, that they were going to remove them to prevent their being seized.</p>

Bannister and Emmington took Alsworth to the round house; I took the bundles to a public house, from whence we went with them to Mr. Cox's; we looked at them there, and then tied them up again; these are the things that were in the bundles.</p>

             to come to my assistance; I was standing near the Duke's-head, four or five doors this side of Russel-street, smoking my pipe; I told Oldham I thought it was some bedding coming down the road; he said step on and attack them, and I will be with you. Bannister made a sort of a signal to me to stop them; I had called to Oldham to stop them before he made that sign; I saw them at the distance of 200 yards before they came up. I stopt Adshead, and said, my friend, what have you got here? he immediately threw it down and ran away; I turned short round and caught Alsworth by the collar, and kept him fast till Bannister came to my assistance, and we took him to the round house; while we were examining his pockets, Adshead was brought in by Oldham and one Mitchell. Justice Cox heard of it, and he sent for us to his office; I saw the goods opened at the Duke's-head. These are some of the things.</p>

               <p>Bannister. He began to search him on the outside, but searched him in the inside: Emmington held the hat inside the watch house, and Leadbetter put them into his hat as he took them out of his pocket.</p>

I said where Mrs. Bellamy lived before Justice Cox, that the things might be found; I said we would carry them home; we took them on our backs; some things tumbled out of the bundles, Adshead put some of the things in his pocket, and I put some in mine; they are the things that have been produced in court. When we came down Tottenham-court-road that man laid hold of me; he asked me where I was going with the bundles; I said if he chose it he might go and see where I was going with them.

I was with Mr. Rose; I was attacked by two foot-pads; one came on one side, one on the other; one demanded my money; Rose kept them in talk some time; he did not care to deliver his money, at last he did deliver it, and they got his watch.

Jones and I stopped the prosecutor; we desired him to give us his money; he collared me; I still insisted on having his money; but the gentlewoman along with him desired we would not take away any thing from him as he was a hard working man. The prosecutor turned back again; I saw his watch and took it from him, and insisted on having his money: he gave his money into Jones's hand, but Jones did not ask for it. We went away together, and spent the money between us; we were taken up and carried to Bridewell next night for having run away from our master, and the watch was found in the place next day.

When I came to myself, I found one of them standing by my side, one sitting opposite me, and the other was doing with me as my husband did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which that was?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; two of them had to do with me, or else one of them twice, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Where his private parts in yours?</p>

               <p>Smith. Yes; I took hold of it with my hand; I screamed, and one of them said he would cut my throat if I was not quiet; I was in such confusion I can't tell which; they cut my apron string.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing come from the man that was using you so?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he actual carnal knowledge of you?</p>
               <p>Smith. He had indeed. I put my head out of the window as soon as I could, and cried out murder! the men kept hollowing and hooting inside and outside the coach; a brother of one in the coach was upon the box with the coachman, and there were some more behind the coach; they kept pulling me into the coach; I did not know where I was; I believe the coachman did not drive up the main street. They hauled me up and down, and pulled me about as they chose. I did not know whether they were men or boys; I said if you have fathers or mothers or wives, if you are men, have humanity towards me, for I have just lain in; they said they would lye in with me; they kept cursing, swearing and hallowing; they made no particular answer to any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was lain with twice: when was the second time?</p>
               <p>Smith. Some time after the first.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the same manner?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was not quite so plain; I found they had hold of me, and had lain with me, but I cannot be so punctual to that as the other. I am a married woman; I am sure of it from circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they entered your body?</p>
               <p>Smith. I am sure they had the first time, and I had reason to believe they had the second time; the coach was stopt at Aldgate at twelve o'clock by the mob upon my screaming, where they had drove me during that time I can't say; a person came up to the coach; they told him. I was a woman of the town and was in liquor; there was a clergyman asked me where I lived, I told him; he ordered the coachman to drive me home. The men jumped out of the coach window, and a man came into the coach to see me home; I was afraid that man was as bad as themselves. The coachman was taken into custody; he gave us the names of the men and told us where we might find them, and they were accordingly taken that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the three men?</p>
               <p>Smith. They owned they were before my Lord Mayor, and confessed all but the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear these are the three men that were in the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. I can't tell, it was dark; they owned they were.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said,</p>
               <p>"that her husband had kept a public house, but was now out of employment; that she had been married three years; that she had been informed her husband was an officer of the marshall's court, before her marriage; that she spent the evening of the 16th of January with her brother, at the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, where they supped, and had a bowl of punch with Mr. Hargrave, one of the proprietors of the stage coaches; that they took the coach about half after ten; that she was quite sober; that her brother put her into the coach, and was himself getting in when the coachman came out of the house; that they did not desire her to get out of the coach, but rushed in immediately; that her brother wanted her to get out of the coach, but they would not let her."</p>

               <p>Baker. No; I run out of the door; I had my eye on the girl; she was running across Piccadilly, about forty yards on the other side Bond-street, towards the Hay-market; I laid hold of her, and said pray give me what you took out of that window just now; I put my hand under her cloak, and took the pocket-book from her; I brought her back to the shop; there she fell a crying, and desired to be let go for that time; she said she never did such a thing before.</p>

The prisoners and I were coming home from Kilburn, we had been all round that part, in order to see what money we could get by robbing the first gentleman that came; we met the prosecutor; we walked past him because there were people behind him, when these people were gone by, we returned and robbed him; they said, Stand, and give us you money; but they used no other force or threats, only put a pistol to him. Waters took his money, and Adams took his buckles; the buckles were afterwards sold by one Jones; we all went to his lodging in Maynard-street, St. Giles'; they broke them to pieces in his lodging before he came.</p>

               <p>Errington. I have no reason to doubt that they are the men; I have seen them before; I know them perfectly well; one of them desired I would make haste; I served them with the pot of beer. There were some carriages at the door; a gentleman, one Mr. Francis, came by, to whom I had lent my horse; he was in a chaise; I asked him what he had done with my horse? he said he had tied him to a rail at Paddington. Knowing my horse to be shy, I was fearful that by a number of horses and carriages passing, he might break his bridle and get away; therefore I was very angry at Mr. Francis, and told him, I would never let him have my horse again, upon any account; then I sent a man after my horse.

I was in Hackney Road last Monday evening; I met with the prisoner there about five or six in the evening; she asked me to treat her with a pot of beer. I had seen her five or six times before. I went with her to the sign of the Gibralter; we went into the tap room; she said she would see me home; afterwards, when we came out of the house, I felt her hand in my pocket, where my money was in a green worsted purse. She had hold of my arm.</p>

I stopped the prisoner with these things, on Sunday morning between six and seven; she and three men came to the house and called for a pot of beer; the evidence called me on one side, and said, he believed the woman had something she had no business with; he went out for a constable, and when he came back, she said, they were her brother's; she was a little in liquor. I thought proper to stop them till her brother came. I took her to Bridewell; she said, when taxed with the things, that they were her brother's.</p>

Between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was in the fore part of the house, when one of the maids run down stairs, and said there were thieves in the parlour. I went backwards and missed a waiter; I ran to the window and saw several persons, one called out, We have taken one, and there are more in the yard; I went into the shop, and told my servant to run round by Creed-lane, and stop all he met; I went back to the window, and saw the prisoner by the palisadoes in the yard; I went out, my servants came to my assistance, and we pulled him into the parlour; we sent for the constable, and searched him; we found a chissel in his side pocket; we searched for fire-arms, but found none. When we had him in the parlour I taxed him with breaking into my house eight months ago; he said no, he did not; for this was his first offence. I lost a silver waiter, a table spoon, a salt seller, and salt-spoon out of the parlour; the palisadoes are breast high and sharp-pointed; the ground is nearly on a line with the bottom of the window; I was in the parlour about twenty minutes before, the plate was safe then; the window was shut down; there is a sort of a spring bolt; the candles had been lighted, but they were put out. When I went out of the parlour, Mrs. Greenough followed me and put them out.</p>

               <p>- Greenough, jun. On the 19th of May, in the evening, between nine and ten, nearer than nine; I happened to come into the counting house to my father; the servant came down, crying thieves! I went round according to my father's order; I found several persons with plate, that I knew to be my father's; I took it from them, and brought it home with me. I saw the man within the rails, and there were two or three persons came up, who would have got him over the rails, with a pretence to have him directly before the justice; but I thought he was more secure within the rails; (the plate produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I left work that evening about eight o'clock; I lodge in Holiday yard; I went home about ten minutes before ten. I saw the prisoner and another man looking into Mr. Greenough's window; they gave a cough and parted. I went in, and told the woman of the house where I lodge, I believed there were thieves in the court. I came again to the door and looked, and they had got close to the windows; I shut the door and said they were there; I looked again, and they had got the window up, and one jumped in; I then said there is one in; she said, I had better go to the fore door of Mr. Greenough's, and alarm them; I went to go, but the man came out, with a piece of plate in his hand; I asked him what he did there? he then put the plate down, and pretended to put the shutters too; then I made an alarm of thieves! and he attempted to make his escape; I gave him a knock of the head, and he fell immediately: I kept him there till I got assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say before my lord mayor, that I had nothing in my hand?</p>
               <p>Weed. I said no such thing, but that you had plate in your hand.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been clerk?</p>
               <p>Bark. Ever since the 3d of September. Hitchcock became a member of that society on the 4th of August, 1766. He became a steward on the 5th of November 1771; (the note shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that before?</p>
               <p>Bark. Yes; before it was missing the 5th of January, the quarterly night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep the money of the society?</p>
               <p>Bark. In the box. The keys are kept by the two stewards, each has one, and the landlord of the house has another. On the 5th of January I saw the prisoner put the note in the box; the box stands before the stewards and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it continue open any time?</p>

               <p>Bark. Yes; but not after he put it in, for that was the last thing; I did not see it afterwards, till I saw it at Mr. Deacon's, just before the last sessions.</p>

               <p>Eversage. Guyant, I believe. Then he bid me turn round, and drive in at the gate. I heard somebody run down the road; presently after that, the man that stopped the cart, and the young fellow came back to me again; I was ordered to drive till I got to the bottom of the field, then into the next field, and to the bottom of that; then the man that stopped the cart, bid me get off, and come along with him; I begged he would not hurt me; he said, he would not hurt a hair of my head, but he should tie my hands and legs; he tied my hands and bid me sit down.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the cart when he tied you?</p>
               <p>Eversage. Twenty or thirty yards; the other boy was with me; he tied us both, and then went away; he came again almost directly, and asked if I had got a key; I told him, no; he said, he knew very well how to get it open without; then he went away back to the cart, and I heard a great noise, and fire flew at every stroke; the noise continued ten minutes; then the other came, and said, my lads sit still, till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030030"/> we load our horses, and we will come and release you and give you five guineas to yourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any horses they had?</p>
               <p>Eversage. No; they never came near us any more; we sat there an hour and a half till day light; then Thomas got one of his hands out; I desired him to put it in again, left they should come and shoot us; he put it in again for a quarter of an hour; then it was quite light, and we saw the cart and horses. Thomas got loose and untied me; there was a large hole in the roof of the cart, some of the iron had been cut as if with an ax; there were the St. Ive's bag unopened, and another old bag lay near the cart; we took the reins off the horses, and rode to Mr. Hamilton's, and then came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning was it when they met you?</p>
               <p>Eversage. Wet and dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it grow light enough while they were with you, for you to observe their persons?</p>
               <p>Eversage. No; the man that stopped the cart had a light-coloured coat and a flapped hat; the other a dark coat, and a cocked hat; the biggest was about five feet eight inches, and the other about five feet six inches; [nearly the size of the prisoners;] when I heard All press's voice afterwards, I said, it was like the voice I heard in the field.</p>

            . I am a cock-founder. On the 12th of October, I set off between one and two o'clock, to go a fishing. I was waiting for an acquaintance; he never came; I went on to the Old Street Turnpike; I asked if the mail cart was gone by? the turnpike man said, no; I waited till Eversage came; hollo, Eversage! said I; he said, ah, are you here at this time? we went on to Enfield. There came a man and took hold of the horse's head and held it fast; Eversage gave a cut; then the man said, if you don't stop I'll blow your brains out; he said, dismount! Eversage went to get down; he said not you, then I got down; I said, I was only going a fishing; he said he knew it, and bid me go on; then I heard him ask if the gate was ready, and the other man said, yes, and ordered the boy to drive in at the gate. I was about twenty yards off I believe, and presently I heard a man say, ho! I turned about and saw him just by me; it was Allpress I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Allpress?</p>
               <p>Thomas. By his height and voice; which I recollected when I came to Sir John's; he had a lightish coloured coat, and his hat flaped; his coat looked like a surtout coat; he said to me when I was got into the field, halt! I turned about, and he was close on my back; he said, Look the other way, take no notice of me; when I came pretty near the gate, there was a man stood by it, who said go in there; I said in here, Sir? he said, yes, and follow the carriage: by the softness of his voice, he appeared to be the other man Guyant. I had an oil skin over my hat; the wind blew it off; I stooped to pick it up. He then said, don't be afraid; I said, you know I can't help being afraid, being stopped as we are; he said, he would not hurt a hair of my head. They stopped the carriage, and desired me to stand on one side; he then brought Eversage to me, and ordered him to sit down; he tied his hands behind him, and then tied his legs; Eversage desired they would not hurt him, he had a sore leg; he said he would not, and what they were doing was only for their own safety; he took a knife and cut the string, and then tied my legs, which he had a hard matter to do, because I am lame; then he came behind me, and said, put your hands behind you; I did; and he trembled as he tied my hands behind me; then he went away, he returned again, and said, have you got the key? Eversage said, no. The biggest man said, he would find a method to get at it, and away he went. Then I heard him in about a minute, with something like an ax, beating on the carriage, and it struck light several times; then something cracked like the breaking of boards; after the cracking was done; I heard something like a tearing, and I had not heard that long before it was done.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the cracking?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Three or four minutes; one of them came back, and said, as soon as the other men came into the field, and they had loaded their horses, they would give us five guineas. I said, gentlemen, I hope you will not leave us tied, in this deplorable condition; for I did not know when we should get undone; he said, they would not; about a few minutes after that, I listened, and said to Eversage, I can't hear any noise; we sat a little longer, it grew a little lighter, and he said, there is the grey-faced mare feeding; I looked and thought I saw it too; I directly began to wrench, and got one of my hands out; I told Eversage I had it out; oh, said he, put it in again, for if they come they will shoot us. In about ten minutes I wrenched my hands out, and untied my legs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030031"/> and went and got him untied. Then we went to the carriage; the reins seemed to be cut and were loose; the carriage was broke at the roof of it, and there was nothing left in it; there was a little bag I saw near it, with a girt about it and an empty bag. I got up on one mare, and he on the other, and rode to Mr. Hamilton's, at Enfield. When we got into the gate, Mr. Hamilton said, what now? Eversage said, we had been stopped and robbed; he ordered his chaise to be got ready, and came with his chaise, and we followed him. Mr. Hamilton put the bag in the chaise, and we came to London.</p>

            . I am post-master at Enfield. On Sunday the 13th of October, I saw the post boy on one horse, and the last witness on another; which surprised me greatly: I thought some accident might have happened by breaking; I asked what was the matter? Eversage said, they had been stopped and robbed; that the cart was broke in two pieces. I immediately ordered the chaise to be got ready, and went to the place and them with me; there I found the cart in the condition the witnesses have described cut with an ax, or something of that sort; there was nothing in the cart. I made the boy look into it; I found the St. Ives bag unopened, and a large bag ticketed</p>
               <p>"Ferrybridge;</p>
               <p>"I believe there was one letter in that not opened. I ordered the boy to harness the horses, and put them to the cart, and go before me, and I followed them in the past chaise; I put into the chaise the St. Ives bag, the Louth and Ferrybridge bag, and went to the General Post Office. On coming back some people stopped me, and said, they had found a great number of bags. I think there were forty-two; I got out of the chaise, and sent my letter-carrier with them to the office.</p>

            . I am a waggoner to Mr. Gosling. I know Allpress; I saw him at Earith 17th of February; he gave me a letter to give to Guyant, and desired me to leave it with him, the night at a shop where I saw him, but being a wet night I left it at Ponder's End, wit Mr. Hogan's. I called before I want down at Guyant's for an answer, but it was not ready; when I went back, Allpress asked me when I saw his master? I told him, when I came down I did not see him, when I went up; he said, no! what did you do with the letter? I told him, I left it at Ponder's End; he said, why did I do for I told him, I could not stop in a wet night with my horses, half an hour to call his master up; he seemed very angry about it, and bid me never leave any more there; that if I tied it at the top of my whip, and taped at the window, he would rise and take it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Guyant say he had received that letter?</p>

I ordered the post boy to drive beyond Guyant's house; I got out of the chaise and walked to the house, and enquired for him; I left word with his wife, that somebody wanted him to come to the public house; he came and I took him. I searched him and found this pocket book; (producing it) I did not at first find the bank note in the pocket book, nor till I came home; then I gave it to Mr. Leigh; it was in a memorandum book in the pocket; it was opened in my presence. I saw the note, this is it. When we brought him to Sir John's, Sir John said to him, here is one of the notes found on you, what have you done with the rest? Guyant said, he had but one more, that he passed away to Mr. Brown, a butcher in Shoreditch. Afterward I went down and found a pistol in a shed, by Guyant's direction. Guyant said before the Justice that pistol was his own making.</p>

            . On the 13th of March last, Guyant was brought to Tothil-fields Bridewell; on Saturday morning the 14th, I went with him to Sir John's from our gaol; there he confessed that he and Allpress committed the robbery, and mentioned some particulars; that Allpress tied the two boys together. After he had been examined, he was committed again to our prison; as we were going back, he said, Mr. Wright, I forgot to tell Sir John where the pistol was; I ordered the coach to turn round, and go to Sir John's again; when we came to Sir John's, he was just going to Brompton; I told him what Guyant said; he said, take him in, and let Mr. Leigh take it down; Mr. Leigh took it down; he said it was in a gutter on the top of a shed. I took him to gaol; on Tuesday morning by his desire, I went down with him to Edmonton; he said, he had some notes there, and he would restore them for the good of the publick; when he came there, he told his man to take the pick ax and dig under the grindstone; accordingly we dug a long while; it was very hard; we dug one of the posts up, and under the post there was this bag; (producing it;) it was very wet; I doubled it up, and put it in a handkerchief; there was nothing in it; he desired me to go into a field behind the house, and there I should find some notes wrapped up in a piece of canvas by mistake. I went to the wrong field and came back, and said, he had a mind to play the fool with me; he said, no; you went to the wrong field, and told me to go to the second, and by the post I should find it; I went and found this pocket, and in it these notes; (producing one 20 l. bank note, two twenty guinea draughts and a 10 l. draught.</p>
               <p>Q. He carried you on purpose to show you the notes he had robbed the mail of?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; (the notes read.)</p>
               <p>Q. from Guyant to Bond. He asked if I had any papers in my pocket; I gave him my pocket-book; he looked it over half an hour; it is clear there was no bank note in it at that time; he said, there is nothing here affecting you, but a letter about notes becoming due the same night. After he got to Sir John's office; he said there was a 20 l. note in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on his delivering up his pocket book look it over leaf by leaf?</p>
               <p>Bond. I did look over the pocket book, but not over the memorandum book; (the pocket book produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Aldredge. Look on the leaves of this book, and see if you see any of Mr. Guyant's hand writing; can you tell whose hand writing is on that leaf?</p>

            . Allpress came to lodge with me in May, 1771. I never heard any ill of him; he lodged with me till January; he kept as good hours as any man; he never stayed out after dusk so far as I know; for the general part he was in before dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at home on Saturday the 12th of October?</p>
               <p>Chandler. He was at home in the afternoon; I cannot say to night. I heard him in his room about seven the next morning; I did not see him.</p>

I told him I had taken the shop very lately (I had been in it but a month) I asked him if he was a creditor; he said he was no creditor. He pulled out a paper which he said was a list of some goods he wanted to purchase of this Mr. Biggs, as I understood him; I told him, I could serve him as well as Mr. Biggs could; he then said, he had no objection to deal with me, for he was not engaged to any one; he then gave me an order for sundry goods, to the amount of 10 l. and 6 d. including the package and every thing. He took a little parcel of Persian blue with him, and was to send a cart for the rest; he said, if I would make out a bill and receipt against he came back, he would call and pay me for them; he went away, and came again in the afternoon; he said he was in a hurry, as he must go by the coach, and was afraid it was gone out; he told me his name was

               <p>Gregory. Yes; this is the draft he presented to me?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any such man as 
               <persName id="t17720603-45-person508">
                  Robert

            ?</p>
               <p>Gregory. No; there is no such man keeps cash at our house; nor no such name, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that name to be crossed?</p>
               <p>Gregory. I did it to prevent its being negotiated again; I am not certain whether Mr. Fordyce or I cancelled it, it was done at our office.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. How long was it before you saw the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Scoles. I came home, mentioned it to my neighbours; they advised me to keep close; they said, I should catch him in Holliwell Lane. I happened to read in the news paper one day, that Mr. Clark was defrauded in the same manner; I went to his house, and compared the drafts together, and found them nearly the same. I went to Justice Wilmot's and saw the prisoner there; the Justice bound me to prosecute him.</p>

               <p>I never wrote any of them, nor filled them up, nor did I know them to be bad ones; I took it of a man in trade.</p>

On the 14th of last March, I delivered to the prisoners 177 pieces of white Irish linen; on the 26th of March, 60 pieces of cotton; he had a very considerable quantity of our cloth in his possession; when he went off it was delivered to his carter, that commonly came with their cart. On the 28th of March, I delivered him 60 pieces of fine white cotton, for the purpose of being printed only; there are 22 yards in a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were their printing grounds?</p>
               <p>Graves. At Garrat, near Wandsworth, in Surry. I never saw a piece again, till I found them on ship board; they both came to shew me the patterns before the delivery, about the latter end of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come of their own accord to you, or did you send for them?</p>
               <p>Graves. We had spoke to the prisoners to draw us some patterns; but with respect to the patterns, Gross came to show me, when I ordered the last 60 pieces of cotton; I never had applied to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you desired him to bring you some patterns to choose out of?</p>
               <p>Graves. I had with respect to this linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any patterns of the cottons spoke of?</p>
               <p>Graves. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bedwell speak of patterns for the cottons?</p>
               <p>Graves. No; Gross came to me and brought me a pattern I liked; I agreed he should print me such a pattern for the cottons; we agreed to give him, I and another of us, 100 pieces. I delivered him 60 pieces; we bought the cottons on purpose for that pattern; he came naturally of his own accord. I frequently saw Gross<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030037"/> I was down at his house; they don't live together. On Friday the 1st of May, I went down to the prisoner at Garrat; I was mentioning to him about my work; I desired he would be expeditious with all my work in general, the cottons among the rest; I desired he would send the work home; he said before the latter end of May, or the beginning of June, you shall not have a piece left on the premises; he had told me of Bedwell's intention to go out of business a fortnight before that. I believe that conversation was before the delivery of the cottons, about the time of the delivery of the linens.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any notice given you that they would take the linens or cotton abroad?</p>
               <p>Graves. No; on the 7th of May my partner had intimation of it. I and several other linen drapers went down and took an account of all the goods on the premises, at Garrat; according to that account, I found 250 pieces of my goods, linen and cotton deficient; there might be about 150 linens and 100 cottons: he had more cottons delivered before this last time. We heard Gross was gone off, we did not find either of them there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the 60 of the last parcel were included in that 100?</p>
               <p>Graves. All of them were missing. When I came to town, on Friday, I found my partner had been to Mrs. Bedwell's, to enquire if she could make any thing out, and found the house shut up. A neighbour said, a considerable quantity of goods had been carried in there; some were packed up, and carried off by such a waterman. We found he had carried a considerable quantity of linen on board the John; I went on board the John, from Iron Gate Wharf. I found in one case (we did not stay to open more than one then) three pieces of our cotton; the marks were cut off; but they had been marked in a slovenly manner, and in the marking they had left an impression on another part of the cloth, which remained very plain, marked with oil and lamb black; I have no doubt of it. I found afterwards in other cases, more of the cotton; all the cases were afterwards removed to a warehouse. They are in the same state I delivered them, except the circumstance of the mark being cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. When these goods were delivered was there any pretence to get money from you for the excise duty?</p>
               <p>Graves. Not at the time for the delivery of the goods; Mr. Gross's townsman brought in the bill; I paid him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go away, or stay carrying on their trade as usual?</p>
               <p>Graves. Their intention of going off was reported to be known for sometime before.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You dealt with the gentlemen sometime?</p>
               <p>Graves. I employed them in the callico printing business.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the method of dealing; do you send to know if they have a pattern at any time?</p>
               <p>Graves. No; it is the custom of the callico printers for their drawer to make a pattern: if we approve of their patterns we give them cloth to print, if not, we give them none.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it no uncommon thing to produce patterns to you?</p>
               <p>Graves. No, it is done every week in the year I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. And if approved of what them?</p>
               <p>Graves. Then the printer sends his cart and fetches the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. It is at your option when to send them?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; and we send when it suits us.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes it is a considerable while after you approve of the patterns that you send the cloth?</p>
               <p>Graves. Not a long time, seldom more than a month, when we approve of patterns.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not very apt to send to you, to ask you, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose?</p>
               <p>Graves. To get the cloth into their hands, for the sake of having a good deal of work.</p>
               <p>Q. In February you say they offered you a pattern?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes, several patterns.</p>
               <p>Q. And before the first cloth was printed you approved other patterns and sent them other cloth?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing different in their coming at that time more than the other?</p>
               <p>Graves. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems odd to me that they should pay the excise on these occasions?</p>
               <p>Graves. I believe it is done to save the trouble of the drapers; they make out the bills; the duty cannot be due not for six weeks after the goods are delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't apprehend the excise have any demand upon you for that duty after having delivered the cloth to the printer?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030038"/>Graves. We have paid this excise twice over.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether in the course of trade, you consider yourself as liable in the first instance, to pay the duty to the excise office?</p>
               <p>Graves. We do; it is all charged in our name; it is done to save trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. Your goods would be seized if it was not done so I apprehend?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; and seized as our property.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; I have known two instances of it?</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a loss by unavoidable floods should happen to this linen, you delivered; upon your oath, who would stand at that loss?</p>
               <p>Graves. In an instance that happened by fire, we took council's opinion.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any known settled usage?</p>
               <p>Graves. It depends entirely on accident.</p>
               <p>Court. I am asking you if there is any known usage in the trade concerning it?</p>
               <p>Graves. If the callico-printers do not produce the pieces, we expect they will pay us for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing there is a loss by floods, according to the usage of the trade, where is that loss to fall, on the draper or the printer?</p>
               <p>Graves. I do not know that we have had that accident happen; I believe it is customary for the printer to pay the draper if any loss happens, let the accident be what it will.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you do not know of your own knowledge, that the utensils of callico-printers have been taken by the excise office for not paying duty?</p>
               <p>Graves. It is always usual if an extent is taken, if there is any white cloth belonging to drapers, they take that first, if not, they take what they can find.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what I understand is, if any accident happens to cloth, after it is in the hands of the printers, they are liable.</p>
               <p>Graves. We always look upon it, they are to return every piece again to our possession.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you saw a great quantity of goods on board the vessel, besides those that you suppose belong to you?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; a great quantity of linen printed, and white linen and cotton printed, a good deal of household furniture, wearing apparel, bedding, and things of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray whose premises are entered at the Excise Office, with regard to these duties; the callico-printer or the house in town?</p>
               <p>Graves. The premises are entered.</p>
               <p>Q. But I believe these gentlemen had the misfortune to be bankrupts.</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course their goods are in possession of assignees.</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been so ever since this complaint has been made against them?</p>
               <p>Graves. They were about two or three days afterwards taken into custody of the messenger in whose hands they have been ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Were none of your goods manufactured that were found on board this vessel?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; one piece I can swear to. Part of them were manufactured in part, some are quite finished fit to send home, a good many.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say any were quite manufactured?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And some a part manufactured?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not some partly prepared?</p>
               <p>Graves. None of these white cottons were, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been steeped or any ways prepared?</p>
               <p>Graves. No, I believe none; for the mark would have gone out if they had.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me leave to ask, whether it is not a matter of some little difficulty, to know if it was prepared at all or not?</p>
               <p>Graves. It alters the look of the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any charge on these gentlemen, in the month of February, on account of any loss?</p>
               <p>Graves. None at all that I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of fifty of your cottons being found on board a ship, fifty part of the sixty?</p>
               <p>Graves. They are marked in a particular manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they that original mark on them?</p>
               <p>Graves. No, it is impressed on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the petitioning creditor under this commission?</p>
               <p>Graves. Mr. Wallace and Co. in Cheapside, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. Has any debt been proved under it?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; I have proved part of my debt; for money lent.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not treated this as a debt, have you?</p>
               <p>Graves. Not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030039"/>Q. How do you enter this in your books?</p>
               <p>Graves. We take an account of debtor and creditor; Mr. Gross debtor so many pieces; we only enter down so many pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you enter the value to them?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; but that is not by way of making debtor and creditor; we enter the value they cost us.</p>
               <p>Q. from Gross. Did not you employ me to draw patterns?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I drew you some for that purpose?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes; I chose three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire me to draw something that you thought would be taken for cotton? and how came you to give me these 60 cottons, and desire them to be done with all expedition?</p>
               <p>Graves. Because the patterns pleased me?</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I give you a pattern; all these patterns?</p>
               <p>Graves. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find on my premises some part of these cottons and Irish printed?</p>
               <p>Graves. I found a few of the Irish, none of the cottons printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what do you think these four blocks, cutting, drawing and putting on, &amp;c. cost me?</p>
               <p>Graves. It might cost 5 or 6 and 20 l.</p>
               <p>Gross. They cost me a great deal more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I as soon as I took the cloth down, put these patterns in it, get it cut immediately; you know I gave a pattern cloth of them?</p>
               <p>Graves. The blocks were cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you think as I put myself to that expence, that I had an intention to manufacture them?</p>
               <p>Graves. The value of cutting these prints, &amp;c. was comparatively small to the value of the pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what time did I come to you about this cloth and about the cottons?</p>
               <p>Graves. I believe about the 12th or 14th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in March?</p>
               <p>Graves. I am clear of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say on your oath it was in March?</p>
               <p>Graves. I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Gross's Defence.</p>
               <p>My lord and gentlemen of the jury, As this is a matter of great importance to me, I hope you will indulge me with time, to hear what I have to say. I stand before you, gentlemen of the jury, accused of a crime that I will not go about to excuse; what I have done is wrong to be sure, in the highest degree; yet I hope it will not appear so criminal to you as the prosecutor would make it appear to be. I will, if you will give me leave, state my method of acting in trade, since the time I commenced a callico printer. I was about nine years at a handicraft trade, at which I saved a little money. I thought to get into a business by which I might get a fortune; a person persuaded me to go into linen printing, and said himself was master of it, and would put me in a proper manner to go on; a brother-in-law and myself engaged, with a fortune of 1400 l. In the course of a year or two we run our money out; and the consequence to him was, he broke his heart; I wish I had broke mine too, it would have been happy for me. With the persuasion of some of my friends I carried it on again; I went on with I thought tolerable success; but when I came to settle with the gentlemen I dealt with, they made great abatements. I thought it was owing to my want of attention; I doubled my diligence; very near the same time, in the year 1766, I struck out something new; I acquired by that and next year 3000 l. On the 10th of August 1767, while I was absent, my premises were burnt to the ground, I sustained a loss of my own property about 1000 l. the property in trust of the drapers to manufactures amounted to about 5000 l. when I came home to look into my affairs, I found my assurance greatly under the loss. I insured my own loss a 1000 l. but for stock in trust, that drapers gave me to manufacture, I only insured 2000 l. When I looked into my book, I found money enough to enable me to pay all my debts and carry on trade again. I saw the drapers were very much chagrined at the loss; I proposed to throw my insurance into the capital stock; I proposed it to Mr. Williams to conciliate them; he said it would do me much service, to make over my whole money of my insurance to them, for the purpose of dividing equally between myself and the drapers. I received many compliments from the whole body of drapers for the rectitude I was doing; yet, I am sorry to say, that very thing which should have redounded so much to my honor, was the foundation of all my misfortunes, and brought me to stand in this odious light before you; it rendered me dependent on my employers, who never failed to take advantage and oppress me; they were not content with what I had done, but insisted I was absolutely and bona fide debtor, for the whole of the cloth put into my hands, were all my own. These gentlemen, that now so eagerly seek my life, say now, they only put it into my trust; they then said, they were my own property. I was obliged to stop my business, reduced to the greatest distress, had it not been for the humanity of Mr.

I was arrested fourteen times in the course of six weeks; my creditors were so enraged that I should make that concession, and put the money out of my own hands, that they would not be pacified.

             of Cheapside; the matter was too great for him; he engaged with Rogers, Graves, Harris and Prescot. Mr. Wallace's motive really was to serve me; I cannot say so much of the other gentlemen; they had lost about 5000 l. and with the aid I gave to the insurance, it would not amount to more than 10 s. in the pound; they agreed, they would support me if I would pay them the whole of the loss; I agreed to it; I made over for their security all I possessed in the world; they advanced me a sum of money, during the year 1768, amounting I think (they have my books from me) to the amount of 2000 l. they paid 700 l. I stood in debt for; the remainder was advanced to pay my men; I carried on the business during the course of that year, not in my own name, but for the benefit of my creditors. I did work to the amount of 1800 l. that year. I paid them large deductions on that work; I allowed them 10 per cent. discount on that, and 5 per cent, for interest. I found I had run back considerably; the gentlemen were willing I should go on another year; but that I might go on with rather more reputation, they agreed they would countenance a report that I had paid them entirely; that I should carry on business in my own name, and that would introduce me to credit; what they agreed to do was done. I carried on business, and did get into a good deal of credit by my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030042"/> punctuality in paying my bills of every kind. My business was then in a reputable and profitable way, and would have been, but for the abatements they made me; my abatements then were 10 per cent, though 10 per cent. discount should imply ready money, yet they would oblige me to take draughts for six weeks and two months, which I was obliged to discount; that at the end of the second year, in spite of the greatest industry I could make use of. I was 400 l. worse. I saw all the printers round about me breaking by the same case that hurt me; I continued business another year; I took down a prodigious deal of work, redoubled my industry in order to see if I could restore myself, and get matters before hand again. In October in that year, I took this young gentleman into partnership with me; he had been apprentice with me; he had but a small sum of money, about 300 l. yet as I was subject to the gout, sometimes laid up for five or six months together, I thought it would be of great utility to me to have one to over look the business. On February following, when the bills began to be settled, Mr. Bedwell began to be uneasy; my abatements were 30 per cent. 10 per cent. discount, and 1 per cent. for servants. I never could get any cash from any of them, the best assistance I could get was a draught two or one month after date, which I was obliged to get discounted. In February Mr. Bedwell began to be uneasy concerning his property that remained in my hands; he said, he thought he was drawn into the business by the drapers only to take the whole little matter he had from him. In February and March we had a great loss by the floods. I will mention one instance of speculation, and it is a pity it should not be known, of that gentleman, Mr. Prescott; he and his partner asked me to do them 64 l. worth of a particular kind of work, scarlet ground, to do them in the best manner, and they would allow me a good price if I did them well, not to stint them in the goodness or the quality of the drugs, and begged to have them done well; I asked them 12 d. a yard, that is 28 s. on each piece; they were well pleased, and said there would be no abatement on them; they were done in the best manner; they sold a great many at the price I charged them, and got a good profit. About a month after that Mr. Prescott said himself to me, he overpaid me for these very goods, insisted I should make an abatement of 3 d. per yard, 25 per cent, under forfeiture of his favor, or never have any more work from him; had he used the common decency, and said they were spoiled, or some accident had happened to them, I would have submitted, but this was so bad, I complained to my friends, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Graves, and Mr.

            , and they shamed Mr. Prescott out of his purpose, that he did not take that money from me; yet nevertheless, he would not make up the matter with me, till I agreed to do 60 pieces more cotton of the same kind, and do it at 10 d. per yard. Mr. Bedwell grew uneasy about his money, seeing the great abatement we were obliged to allow, amounting to one half; he desired to have his money out of the trade, and he would go to the East Indies; I made no secret of it; I communicated it to all the trade; I believe Mr. Graves mentioned it in his evidence. In March, when our affairs began to grow very bad, by losses by the floods, Bedwell said he would go to North America, and desired I would let him have his money; I could not then; I had bought some linnens of Mr. Pierrepont, Mr. Sainsbury and Edwards, Woodwell and Darley, to the amount of near 300 l. with intent to send to Guernsey for a venture; as Bedwell was so pressing for his money, I said, if he chose to accept them, he might have them; these were the first Irish that were carried to Mrs. Bedwell's house. I had no intention then to go; I was ill of the gout. What encreased my ruin was, I had borrowed acceptances of different gentlemen in London, to the amount of 6 or 700 l. they had such great confidence in me, that they have lent me from six weeks to six weeks, and I have always paid them constantly; while I was ill, these acceptances became due to Mr. Graves, Wallace, Prescott, &amp;c. not being able to pay them, the gentlemen all declared they would not renew them any more. I then found I was entirely ruined; that it was impossible to carry on any business from the losses I had sustained, and from the abatements these gentlemen made upon me. Then I declared to Bedwell, and not before, that I would go with him to America; I then formed the intention to take the goods: I call God Almighty to witness, I thought when I got there, to turn them into money, and return it to them, to encourage a trade with them; it was easy for me to have got goods to the amount of 10000 l. in London; and all tradesmen know if a man has a mind to turn goods into ready money, there are people enough in this city of London to take them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177206030043"/> without asking many questions; the very goods I sent on shipboard I could have turned into cash; instead of that I sent them on shipboard openly; indeed as my affairs were bad, I had no intention of letting them know where I was going. I was going to America, where they must have known of it; if I had gone to Flanders, &amp;c. it might not have been known; they say I had 400 guineas; it belonged to this gentleman's mother; they by force took it from her. Now gentlemen, I appeal to your feelings, if under this load of complicated misfortunes, it was not something. I appeal to your knowledge and understanding, if under such great discounts and deductions, it was not impossible for the most profitable business to have supported it. I left a paper behind me, if the gentlemen had had candour to have produced it, that I was going to mend my fortune, and return it to them. I did not chuse to stand my ground, and be made a bankrupt; for this reason, all I had was made over to Rogers and Graves, Harris, Prescott, Walker and Barker; it was not known but the securities I had given them were reverted to me again, and I paid them the debts owing me. I had got into credit under that notion; so when that was known, the people who had no security at all, would have immediately arrested me, and I should have ended my days in gaol; it was to avoid that, that I took this method. I appeal to you, whether I had any felonious intention; when I took these goods, I began manufacturing them immediately, and cut the blocks at a large expence. I must trust the rest to your candor, humanity and justice.</p>
               <p>Bedwell's Defence.</p>
               <p>After the defence Mr. Gross has just made, where in he has fully set forth every misfortune, and oppression that has happened to him, I think it is needless to mention those circumstances; I must accuse the drapers themselves for want of justice to me; for at the same time they advised me to enter into partnership with Mr. Gross, they were sensible they had the whole of his effects made over to them. As to the mention of my going by a false name, it was merely accidentally; goods were ordered by my mother to enter them in her name, and as they belonged to her and her mother, when I paid the money to Sims, I thought it best for a man's name to be concerned, than two women; therefore I took on me the name of

               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Preston. I am a callico printer. I am acquainted with the transactions between the drapers and printers; the way the account is kept is, we have a book we call the delivery book, it is kept thus, To white cloth delivered to be printed, debtor so and so, to printed goods received, creditor by; when that is done, it sometimes happens, that of 500 pieces, that may be delivered, but 400 shall be returned to the drapers; then I am debtor to him, and at Christmas pay him for the 100 that are wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. You must make him satisfaction if you do not return the quantity?</p>
               <p>Preston. The most reputable callico printers in trade, sell white cotton before printed or after; if we meet with an accident; we sell them to the best account we can; people of the best reputation in trade do it; I can mention a house in London that returns thousands per annum. The callico printers entry, is an entry of one copper house, one printing shop, &amp;c. the Excise know nothing of the drapers; if I was to fail to-morrow, the excise would come on the premises, and the drapers to whom they belong could do nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the goods that have been manufactured, are on your premises, they would be seized for the duty?</p>
               <p>Preston. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would they be seized in the first instance, or in common with the rest of your goods?</p>
               <p>Preston. They may take goods, utensils, furniture, cattle, or any part of my property they please.</p>

               <p>Mr. Preston. I have known Gross seven years; I never knew Bedwell till since this affair; I always conceived him a very ingenious intelligent character; I never doubted his integrity; I never heard it impeached till on this affair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maidwell. I have known Mr. Gross about nine years; his character is that of a very industrious pains-taking man; I have traded with him for many thousand pounds; he has always dealt honestly by me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cummings. I have known Mr. Gross between five and six years; I never had any dealing with him; he is a very worthy honest man; I never heard a person say a disrespectful word of him in the world. I have known Bedwell from 13 or 14 years old; he is about 21 now; he is a very sober, honest, good lad. I never heard a disrespectful word of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Prescott, you seemed desirous of saying something while Gross was speaking; I did not think fit to interrupt him then; you have been examined already; if you have any fact to mention, you may relate it.</p>
               <p>Prescott. I have his handwriting, where he has confessed me to be one of his best friends he has in the world; I only mention that in vindication of myself; I have no particular prejudice against Mr. Gross. I found the 400 guineas under his key in his bureau; I can prove that assertion relative to the scarlet ground a total falsity; Mr. Gregory will prove it; he offered to work it for another house afterwards, for Mr. Griffiths, in Cheapside, and he worked it afterwards for 10 d. a yard. I did agree to give him 60 pieces more, to be printed at 10 d. a yard I confess, because he offered to print it for Mr. Griffiths; I can prove these goods were sold by Gross instead of sending them home, I can prove every reflection respecting myself totally false, excepting that particular instance of the security, that I grant is a fact, that he has very ill naturedly laid before this court; I grant we had a great confidence in him; we took him out of a spunging house when he could not be bailed for 25 guineas; he sent for Mr.
