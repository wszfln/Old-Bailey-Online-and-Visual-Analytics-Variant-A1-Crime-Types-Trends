I looked at my watch a quarter before nine on the 11th of November; I was crossing the passage from the parlour to the bedroom, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a bundle; he dropt it on the stairs; he said nothing to me; he came to me; he came to the bottom of the stairs, and I collared him, and cried, Brother, brother, a thief, a thief, a thief! He gave me a blow on the breast, and ran out of the house; he left the bundle behind him. My brother pursued him immediately; he was brought back in less than ten minutes. I am positive the prisoner is the person who ran out of the house. The street-door is always open on account of the shop; he ran out at that door; the parlour door was open, and I had a candle in my hand, so that there was light both ways. The prisoner was taken to the watch-house; the constable has the bundle.</p>

               <p>I live in Eagle-street; I am a housekeeper. On the 13th of November, about a quarter before nine, I was sitting in my parlour, I heard my sister cry out, Brother, brother, a thief! I got up, and ran out; I saw the prisoner in the passage running out; I had a very good view of him, because there is a very good light; my sister had a candle in her hand. I pursued him into Holborn; as he turned the corner of Dean-street I lost sight of him; that may be 20 yards. Mr. Walker stopped him in Holborn. I went up to them. The prisoner is the man that I saw run out of the house. When he was brought back, he said, he was not the man. He was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>- WALKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard the alarm before he ran out about a quarter of a minute; the man that came out of the house came out stumbling; he ran past me; I endeavoured to lay hold of him, but I missed him the first time; I then followed him down Dean street about threescore yards; I seized him in Holborn by the skirt of his coat; he struck back at me; I caught his arm, and held him by that arm and his collar; he swore at me, and asked what I wanted; I told him, I did not want him, it was those who called after him that wanted him. Mr. Cutt then came up; he was secured, and brought back. I never was three yards from him.</p>

I said, soldier, where have you been at work? He said, at the capstan. I saw his hand all over sugar, his breeches were full, and lined all round his body. I took seven pounds of sugar from under his clothes; it was raw sugar. I weighed the hogshead, and it wanted a quarter and seven pounds. I never lost sight of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I live in Swan-yard, Bishopsgate-street; I am a farrier. This iron is mine. This bar has been in my shop two years and a half; it is stouter than that which I usually use in my business. On the 19th of October, I was drinking a pot of beer with Mr. Parr, from whom I took the shop, and was observing, that I had not used all the iron he had left. Skelton asked Parr to give him something to drink, (I only swear to one bar) and said, he wished he had to work up that iron, as it was very unhandy; he said this because Parr refused him drink. This bar is cracked, which renders it remarkable; I know the bar; I am positive.</p>

I had eighteen guineas and a half in gold, three pocket pieces I bought in London resembling half guineas, and about thirteen shillings in money, the money was in a tin box. We were drinking together at the Salutation; I went down the town, and got some victuals, and saw the prisoner at the Running Horse, and asked him to drink a glass; I sat there some time; the prisoner was in company, and he took hold of me by the shoulder, and said, Come, shipmate, go with me, I will provide you a good lodging; I did not look at first; he made a stop at once. I asked him where he was going; he took me up a very narrow passage, gave me a sudden jerk all of a sudden on the shoulder, and took my tin box and money out of my pocket. He went away all at once. I went to the next house, and told them, and that he had only left me one copper. They searched my pockets, and sent for a constable. I staid there all night; it was a lodging-house; none of the people are here. The next morning I went to the Running Horses, and told the landlord, and seized the prisoner, who stood by the fire. He took out half a guinea for change; he swore many heavy oaths, and pulled out two more; they were my property: I gave a penny a piece for them; they were half-guinea pieces resembling half-guineas; one of them was found in the ashes. I understood the tin box was picked up by a schoolboy, who is here.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070008"/>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Was the Salutation the first house you drank at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you been there? - Near an hour.</p>
               <p>What liquor did you drink? - Part of two pints of beer between me and two more.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Running Horses? - The space of an hour.</p>
               <p>You drank there too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect fighting any body in the street after you went out of the Running Horses? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you so sober as to recollect all that happened to you? - Yes; I was not paid off when the ship was paid.</p>
               <p>Had you been at the Bull public-house that night? - At the Bull, Sir.</p>
               <p>Aye, recollect yourself; and recollect, there is less offence in a sailor's getting drunk after a long voyage than in swearing against a man? - I was in the Bull.</p>
               <p>And there you invited a young woman to pass the night with you? - I was in no woman's company any further than this, I saw a woman in a black gown; she asked me what countryman I was; I told her, I was of the West of England, and I asked her for a cook's shop; I went into the cook's shop, and asked her to sit down; she did not come in then, she returned again in five minutes; she came up through the street with me again; I went along with her to the Salutation, then the landlord asked her what she did there.</p>
               <p>She was a common woman? - I never saw her before; he asked her what she did there? she said, she came to drink a glass of something with me. He said, he would as soon see her backside as see her face; and I never saw the woman afterwards.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that after that you was not at the Bull with this young woman? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why, you was not so ungallant surely as an English sailor to let her go out of the house by herself? - I never saw her afterwards; I was at the Bull before I went to the eating-house.</p>
               <p>What became of you after you had lost this woman, that would not have been a pleasant circumstance, you know? I went back again to the Running Horses after that.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue drinking there? You drank at the Salutation, then you got to the Running Horses, then to the eating-house, then to the Salutation again, and then to the Running Horses again; at all of which you took a little drop of a nip? - I staid at the Running Horses about half an hour after eight, and had two pints of slip; I did not drink it all myself; there was four or five of us.</p>
               <p>How far off did you pass your night from these running horses? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect fighting with any body? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>No man in a sailor's dress? - No.</p>
               <p>Now, after all this drinking, do you really think you was any thing like sober? - I was sober and sensible to know what I said and did.</p>

               <p>I keep the Running Horses at Brentford. I remember the prosecutor coming in; it was between eight and nine when he came in; he was not more than an hour; the prisoner was there some of the time. Bryant paid for three pints of liquor, that was all he had; they went out together. I saw a tin box in the prosecutor's hand, but what he had in it I cannot tell; nobody else went out with the prosecutor. He came in next morning, and the prisoner was there; he said, he had lost his money. I cannot tell what passed; but soon after the prisoner went out, and brought a piece of money to pay for what he had. The prosecutor did not stop him then. The prisoner's master is a pipe-maker. He produced me half a guinea to take my reckoning; I told him it was a counterfeit; he desired I would weigh it, and it was so; the prisoner said, it was his money. The sailor charged him in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe whether he was a little in liquor? - I did not observe; they went out to get a lodging.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070009"/>How long has the prisoner lived in your neighbourhood? - About six months; he frequented our house, and came there that morning, as he had been accustomed to do; he went out, and came in again some time after with this piece of money.</p>
               <p>He might have put it all into the pipe-furnace if he had been conscious of any thing of the sort?</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner applied to you for one of these very half-guineas? - Yes; he came to me for one of the half-guineas to go back and treat Bryan at that very publick house. He has worked for me about seven months; I never saw any dishonesty by him; he bore the character of an honest man; I never missed or found any thing lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Violet. This man had worked next door to you for some months, what character did he bear? - I have nothing to say against him; I never heard any thing to the contrary of an honest man.</p>
               <p>Did Clamtree come in there? - Yes, some time after Bryan and the prisoner had left our house; they went out very good friends; he was to shew him a lodging. I saw him afterwards give Clamtree two of the small pieces; I did not see him give the other two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Clamtree. He gave you this money in the open tap-room, without any secret? - Yes.</p>

I paid for the first pint; I told him not to call for any more; I had no more money; he said, it did not matter, he had plenty of money, and he said, he had saved up 3 l. for the Christmas holidays, which he had in a pipe-clay box; and soon after that, I think it might be in the space of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, in came the prosecutor, and declared he had been robbed of all his property, which was 18 guineas and a half, and some odd money; what, I cannot justly say; and that the prisoner was the man that robbed him, and he would have a constable. Soon after that the prisoner beckoned me into the back parlour, and I went, and he put his hand into the sob of his trowsers, and pulled out a guinea, and two half guineas, as they appeared to me, but whether they were half guineas or counterfeits I could not tell; he offered me the two half guineas, as they appeared, to take them and keep them, and say nothing about it; I did not take them; I went and told my master, who was in the publick house, and the landlord; and before they could get a constable they were demolished some how or other; they could could not be found. My master's name is Callaghan. He was searched by Mr. Cox, the constable.</p>

               <p>Cox. Here is a certificate in it; I searched the prisoner, and found one guinea in his hand. (Produced.) This pocket-piece was on the table in the tap-room; the prosecutor told me to take it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Violet. I did not take notice of it, but the prisoner offered me such a one as this that morning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my box, and my certificate and card. This medal is my property, part of what I lost that evening; here is a particular scratch upon the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. How many of these medals did you buy? - Three, there was never another in his shop; there is a scratch on the King's head side.</p>
               <p>Do you mean a long one all down the crown? - It is not so very long.</p>
               <p>Does it reach from the top to the bottom? - Almost.</p>
               <p>And that is on the head side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you are quite sure of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So much for certainty; now it happens to be on the other side. When you speak of the head, you do not mean the tail? - No.</p>
               <p>(Shews him a guinea) Which is the head side of that? - (He points to the head side, and persists in the scratch being on the head side.) I saw him chuck this medal on the floor.</p>

               <p>Court to Bryant. When you went out of the publick house in company with the prisoner, you say you went to get a lodging, and in a narrow place, a sort of alley, he gave you a jerk, and put his hand in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070011"/>pocket, and took your property from you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am sorry to trouble the Court. but they took one guinea, a sixpence, and a penny; the guinea I worked hard for I think I have a right to have: my defence is as this; I gave my master one guinea, and three pocket-pieces, a quarter before nine; I went out of this house with the prosecutor; the prosecutor had all his money at nine o'clock; the guinea and the three pocket-pieces I gave to my master before I went out with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Court to Clamtree. What time was it? - It was near a quarter before nine that I received them of him at the Running Horses tap-room; I never saw the prosecutor till the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor was gone backwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner afterwards leave the Running Horses? - He went home after us, I understand; the prosecutor was not in his company then.</p>

I replied, yes; he said, Mr. Richardson have recommended me for a horse at any time; I told him I knew Mr. Richardson, but that he was out of town; yes, the prisoner said, he went out of town on the Sunday before; he said, he wanted a horse to go to Low Layton; and on his saying he came from Mr. Richardson, I let him have a horse; he again said he wanted a horse to go to Low Layton, on particular business; he should return about eight o'clock in the evening; nothing was said about the price; I lent him a bit of stick; when he got on to the horse, he said he was clerk and rider to some great shop in Cheapside, and that his name was Brown: he mentioned the name of the shop, but I do not remember: it was a black gelding; I saw nothing more of him that evening; I saw the horse again on the 25th, at Mr. Hopkins's stables, in Holborn; it is a repository; my master bought him in spring. My reason for being particular about the time of his going, was, having a gentleman to go out about the same time, an old customer; it was half past four, or a little after.</p>

               <p>Are you sure that he is the person? - Yes; the yard is very light, and it is lighted between five and six; the horse was not hired generally, but to return that evening.</p>

On the 19th of November, I was paying the men; the prisoner knocked at the compting-house door, when I was paying the men; I had seen him before; he put his head just in the door, and said, I ask your pardon for disturbing you; I shall be glad to speak with you; I stepped out, and said, well, Sir, what is your pleasure? says he, I will thank you to lend me a guinea; I replied I could not spare one, having a number of men to pay; he then asked me if I had seen Mr. Wise? I said, I will tell you what, Mr. Robins, I have some money to take to morrow; if I succeed, I will lend you a guinea; he came on the morrow; I told him I did not succeed, and could not lend him a guinea; about a fortnight before this, he told me he had a horse or two to sell; I told him, if he brought them, I would endeavour to sell them for him, as for other gentlemen; he said he had one, and that he should bring him; this was on the 20th of November; on the 22d, Tuesday, about half past five o'clock, a few minutes under or over, he brought a black gelding; he told me that was it he spoke about; I said, Sir, says I, what do you want for this; he rode it into the yard with a saddle and bridle on it; says he, this is a better than the other; and he booked it at eight guineas; he then said he wanted some money on it; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070018"/>I had but a guinea in my pocket; he said that would do for the present, but he must have some more in the evening; I told him I was going to Park-lane to receive some; if I succeeded, I would let him have some more; I told him I lent him the guinea; I did not lend it as a pawn-broker; I did not consider the horse a pawn for it; he asked me when I should return? I said, in an hour; he asked me if I should ride that horse he brought in? I said, no, I had a hack of my own; I made it eleven o'clock before I came home; and not expecting to see him that night, as I could not see the aforesaid Mr. Wise; and he was waiting under the window of my bed-chamber, behind a pheaton; he said I had kept him waiting a long while; I said I was sorry for it; he asked me if I had succeeded? and I told him no; he pressed me very hard again, and said he did not know what to do for money; I then told him I would endeavour to get him another guinea; I went to Mrs. Blick, who keeps the Bull and Gate, and borrowed the second guinea; but in the mean time he left this letter; I have seen him write, and am certain this is his hand-writing; Mr. Hopkins gave me the letter the next morning; I gave him the second guinea; he then asked me where he should settle the business; the time was fixed on the next evening at five; I was to give him eight guineas for the horse for myself; at five he came; I told him I would settle in half an hour; he came, and I asked him to go to the public-house, as there were some gentlemen in the compting-house: Wise was there, and said how do you do, Mr. Bean? this convinced me he had done wrong, as he entered his name Robins, and gave me that name always; he called Mr. Wise out of the public house, and they went out together; I kept close to him; he kept drawing out of the yard, as it were, a little at a time; and I said, Mr. Robins, I must know how you came by this horse? I rather suspect you; he then said it belonged to some foreign gentleman, whose name he mentioned, but I do not recollect, who is gone abroad; and I asked him if he knew any body that did know the horse? he made no other answer, but that the gentleman was gone to France; then I asked him for his address? he pulled a pencil and a bit of paper out of his pocket, and wrote No. 4, or some other number, in St. Martin's-le-grand; I told him that was not a plain direction for me; if he would go into the compting-house, and write it with pen and ink, I would endeavour to be convinced if it was right; he then said he had a lady waiting for him at the gateway end; that he would go and speak to her, and return immediately; I then told him I should be plain with him; I would not let him go from me; he then went with me into the compting-house, and owned his address was fictitious; I then told him I would hesitate no longer, but he should give a satisfactory account at Bow-street; he told me he thought it might be settled without going there; if he repaid me the two guineas, would I be then satisfied; I then told him it was a serious business, and ought to be brought to light; and nothing but going to Bow-street would satisfy me; I sent for a coach, and took him there; going along, he pressed me very hard to settle it; hoped I would take it into consideration, and not be the ruin of a young man; I told him it was not my intention to injure him, only to have a satisfactory account to the justice; for had I not taken him, it might have been a serious thing to myself: before the justice, he owned the horse belonged to Mr. Taylor, of Chiswell-street: Mott came and saw the horse; it was the same horse; the letter I received on the 23d, about ten o'clock; it was left the 22d.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Humphries, what sort of a stable-yard is this of Mr. Hopkins's? - It is a place for sale and a livery-yard.</p>
               <p>It is a repository, is not it? - By private contract; we do not sell by public auction, nor have not done for these four years.</p>
               <p>The custom then of the repository is, to take in horses from any body that comes, without enquiring any thing at all about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070019"/>them? - Not with us; we always take the address.</p>
               <p>What capacity might you be in? - Foreman to the salesman, about twelve years.</p>
               <p>Anything you did in the yard, was on Mr. Hopkins's account? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - From the 10th of November; I saw him again the 19th, by bringing a horse of Mr. Jocelyn's of London-wall.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of November, there was some conversation about a horse, which horse was not owned till Monday last, after the prisoner was apprehended? - He brought no horse before the 22d.</p>
               <p>Was not there a horse that he was charged with before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of that charge? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it was discharged? - I do not; Mr. Jocelyn did swear to his horse; and on Monday last he was to have done something in the business.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner on that other warrant? - I bought that horse and had a receipt for it.</p>
               <p>Let us look at the receipt; (produces it); I see by this receipt you gave him seven guineas? - I did.</p>
               <p>I see it is received of Mr. Humphries, seven guineas for a black gelding? - This was in my own name: but it never was unknown to Mr. Hopkins; we never hinder any body bringing horses to us for sale, especially if we have any suspicion; I certainly had suspicions, or would not let him have had one guinea; I made no enquiries, because I thought he would come again; the first enquiry I made, was of Mr. Wise; and if he had come to me for fifty shillings, without a horse, I should have let him have it on his name. Mr. Wise did come; the prisoner and he were acquainted.</p>
               <p>When he first brought the horse, what did he particularly say? - He brought a black horse, and said this is the black horse I told you of; and that that was one of the pair that he drove in his curricle; I then asked him whether it was a sound one or not; he said, yes; there was nothing ailed him, only a little hair was rubbed off the side with the harness, which he pointed to me, but I did not see it; and he compared it with the other horse, and I then thought they were a pair.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you when he left them, that he left them for sale? - No doubt of it; for sale for eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say that he would not sell him, but would pay for his keep; did not he tell you that he would not sell him, but would pay for his keep? - I did not hear any such thing mentioned; he said he was distressed or would not sell it.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of this last horse? - Yes, I believe it was an intire black one, only a single star in the forehead; it was not material for me to take particular notice.</p>
               <p>You have been used to a great many horses, and have seen a great many? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of course you know that a white leg before or behind is a particular mark? - When people take particular notice of it it is, there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>How long had you the horse in your custody? - Six nights.</p>
               <p>Of course you had an opportunity of seeing him many times? - I had and I had not; he was put by in a corner stall till an owner came; I saw him stand in the stable, and went to see whether the horse was fed.</p>
               <p>If the horse had had a white leg, should not you have taken notice of it? - If I had had any particular reason; I remember the horse; but I could not swear to that other horse; nor I do not know that I could swear to this.</p>
               <p>Which horse was chopped away? - The other horse was in my custody about two days.</p>
               <p>Court. You frequently saw this horse fed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to swear that that was the horse brought by the prisoner, and seen by Mott? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. How often have you seen this man write? - Only once.</p>

With respect to the horse being booked for sale, Mr. Humphries has an undoubted right to write what he pleases in his own book: it was never my intention to sell him, nor to leave him as a pledge: the second time I called, I wrote that night requesting him to lend me eight guineas: I never conceived it to be lent on the horse; and I am sure Mr. Humphries does not: I am sure he cannot; I called again after I had left the note, and Mr. Humphries was not at home: but he presently after came home, and I then asked him to oblige me with the money? he said, no, he had been disappointed: he had been after a Mr. Allingham, a sheriff's officer, to arrest a Mr.

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to Sir Sampson Wright. On the 4th of November, in the evening, about seven o'clock, I was on the Kilburn road; I met with the two prisoners at the bar; they were coming towards town; I suppose this might be three miles from Mutter's house; I stopped them, and asked Dickeman what he had there? he said, ducks, and had bought them at Kensington; I said, this is not the way from Kensington; I found four ducks on him; he said he bought them out of a country cart; I took them into custody, and placed them in the watch-house; there were sixteen snares for catching hares, and a brass candlestick, found on Dickeman.</p>
               <p>- BAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>Deposed to the same effect, only that he understood Dickeman to have said he bought them at Kilburn, instead of Kensington.</p>

               <p>I was coming along the road, and met a man with a basket of ducks; this young man bought four ducks for four and sixpence and a pot of beer; I came up behind, and bought the other four.</p>
               <p>Cridland. On my return, I took them into a new public-house; he never pointed out any person of whom they bought them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I take it for granted, there was a great deal of the same kind of coals in the pool? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Fagan has been accustomed to this business? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of November, about six o'clock, I called at the George in Piccadilly; the boy said, your father is in the parlour; going into the parlour, I saw Mr. James coming out; I said, how do you do, Mr. James? he said, are not you Mr. Barnes's son? I said, yes; I called him on one side, and asked him to lend me a shilling or two; upon this he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out his money, and gave me half a guinea and four shillings; I said, I do not want so much; he said, poh, poh, keep it; I am going to receive a sum of money of your father; nothing more occurred for two hours; Mr. James came out of the parlour again, and was going into the street into the coach; he was put into the coach, and the coachman asked him where he was to drive him to? he was so drunk he could not tell him; I said, he lives on the other side of Black-friar's-bridge; my father was in liquor, and could not tell the coachman where to drive Mr. James to; the man that keeps the public-house, said to me, Ned, get upon the coach-box, and see him home; I said, I do not rightly know where he lives; I got upon the coach-box, along with the coachman, about one hundred yards; Mr. James called me then, and said, Barnes, come in the coach, it rains; I told the coachman not to mind him; he then called out, God damn you, stop; the coachman got down, and let him out; he made me get in before him; we went to the sign of the Sun, near St. Clement's; there we both got out; as soon as I got into the house, he, without any provocation, struck me in the mouth, and knocked out one of my teeth; I struck him on the nose, and he fell behind the grate; the coachman asked what all that was about, and asked for his fare, which was seven or eight shillings; he refused to pay it, and said he did not hire the coach; then we shook hands; but afterwards the coachman and I gave charge of him for assaulting us; they took me down a court to the watch-house; they put me up stairs; I had a bed, for which I paid a shilling; Mr. James was brought in soon after; and he had a bed in the next room; he broke the pannel of the door, and I crept under the bed for fear, as he said he would be the death of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 13th of November, about a quarter past twelve at night, I was called up by the lodger, who said there were people stealing lead; I went on the top of the house, and missed the lead from off the sky-light; I went to the swatch-man; I did not hear any noise myself; I suspected the lead was put into the adjoining house; when I was getting upon the tiles, there was a little fresh dirt; from the sky-light to the next house, is about twelve feet; there is a fixed ladder to the trap-door, and the trap-door was standing wide open; I went down the ladder, and knocked at the door of the prisoner; it was some time before he answered, or before they opened the door; the father of the prisoner wanted to know who was at the door? the watchman told him there was some lead missing; the father opened the door, and said, there was no lead there to his knowledge; the watchman went in, and I stood at the door; the lead was found in a room where the prisoner slept; there are three apartments; the father has two, and the prisoner one; the prisoner was in the room where the lead was found; there was nothing found in the first or second room; the lead was found on entering the door; the watchman found it first; the prisoner was in bed; I had not seen him during our search before; the prisoner said, good God! how did the lead come here; the prisoner had only his coat off; then we took the prisoner to the watch-house, and his father and brother; I went directly, and called my master.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Smith. Which room did he search first? - The father's, which was the first we came to.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>My lord, I was calling the hour, half past twelve, in New Bond-street: I heard the sound of a rattle, and ran to my partner's assistance: that is Mr. Gent: I went up to the place where the father's apartments were, and found Mr. Smith and Gent on the outside of the door: there was no fastening to hinder my getting in: the father came to the door, and the watchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070032"/>told him he had suspicion there was some lead in the apartment; the watchman said, if you know yourself to be honest and clear, open the door: he said, by all means: nothing was found there: I went afterwards to the room where the prisoner was: I do not think it was fastened: he opened the door: he said to me, you are welcome to search any where: just as I came up to the door, I saw him covering something with a rug: I went and took the rug off, and threw it on the foot of his bed: a parcel of lead lay in a wine-basket: I said to my comrades, you need not look any farther; here is the lead: I took it out of the basket, and laid it down on the floor: I asked him how the lead came there? he seemed to hem and hah: he said a man brought it to the step of the door about half an hour before, and asked him to keep it till Monday morning: he was then asked how he could think of taking such a thing into his apartment? he said he did it out of good nature to the man: then we took them all three to the watch-house: I have had the lead ever since: it was before the magistrate: (produces it): he had his coat off, and I think, his stockings and shoes.</p>
               <p>Smith. I tried the lead to the sky-light: this is the lead last lost: I nailed it on myself: the heads of the old nails were decayed. (Produces three nails.) I made these nails myself.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think you said there was one nail left in the wood? - There was.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming home late on Saturday night: I met a helper on the stair-case, who asked for a coachman? I told him he was not there: then he asked me to let him leave that bundle till Monday? I said, yes, and welcome: he put down the bundle, and I went into the next room to get a tinder box: I had no sooner struck a light, than five or six people came in.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. When had you last seen this lead safe? - The same afternoon, about three o'clock: I made a point of seeing the place every day.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>(The case opened by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. Gentlemen, you have very lately heard, from the Clerk of the Arraigns, the stress of the indictment against the prisoner, who comes before you for judgment, on the state of an indictment for misdemeanor only; and, Gentlemen, in the course of some experience in this place, attended very often with painful circumstances, I have never been called upon to lend my poor assistance to a prosecution in which I have contributed my aid with so much satisfaction as on the present occasion; because you have before you, as the evidence will prove, a man carrying on one of the most prostigate and abandoned systems of imposition on a person the last in the world on whom such a system should be practised: I am most perfectly sure, that when the facts are laid before you, that you and the whole Court, and every man that hears me, will be of opinion that banishment from this country does not reach his offences, and that all that the Court can do falls short of doing justice to him. Gentlemen, having laid hold of a poor woman of the name of Yostus, whose husband had been convicted at this place for a felony, he pretended to her that he would prepare a petition, in order to obtain the extension of the Royal mercy to that husband; he afterwards pretended he had prepared such a petition, and had laid it before his Majesty; that it had had its effect, and was then laying in the office of the noble Secretary of State, and all that was necessary now to be done was to obtain a sum of money to carry that petition from the office. One would hardly believe that depraved human nature would furnish a man with pretences to strip a miserable widow, deprived of her husband, and to strip five miserable orphan children, of every rag they had to cover them, to support himself in his vices, by amusing them with the hopes of obtaining this pardon. Besides, Gentlemen, if one considers the nature of a crime like this, there are circumstances in it that make one shudder: suppose there had been any favourable circumstances in this poor man's case, if he had fallen into honest and honourable hands, his case would have been presented to the worthy Recorder; and if there had been any favourable circumstances, it is a libel, for the first time uttered by the prisoner, that it is necessary to grease the wheels of government, as he calls it, that it is necessary to give a fee to the Clerk of the Record, the officer at the Secretary of State's office, and to all the various hands, in order to procure the extension of the Royal mercy. Gentlemen, it is right it should be stated, it is perfectly well known to us, that there is nothing necessary to obtain that mercy; but that there should appear to the Judge, who tries, favourable circumstances; and if there is any department of the Government more chastely or more honourably administred than another, it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070043"/>that of extending the Royal mercy to persons who are suitors for that mercy: but if this man had any favourable circumstances which could have been made appear, the prisoner was preventing the application of them by deluding her with a fallacious hope; therefore I am warranted to state, that a more complicated misdemeanor cannot come before any Court. Gentlemen, the day after the poor man had been convicted of stealing coals to the value of 5 s. the prisoner applied to him; he told him he should be able to procure a pardon, if he could raise two guineas; one guinea of which was to be delivered into the office of the Secretary of State (a most impudent and audacious libel!). The poor man, locked up in that strong house, sent to his wife; she was anxious to get her husband home: he told her the business would be presently done - stealing a few coals - no difficulty. He prepared a petition, shewed it to the poor woman, who approved of it, and gave it to her to get it signed by a number of her friends: then, says he, some of my friends shall sign it, and he hinted some parliamentary interest (another audacious libel!). Thank God, in this country, the Royal mercy is not dealt out on such terms. He said, I have several names, and among the rest two members of parliament: so he took her to Whitehall, and went into some office, which he said was the Secretary of State's; there was somebody ready to attend on this gentleman: now, says he, I shall attend on this, day by day, till the petition is considered; and as soon as it is you shall hear from me; upon which the poor woman went home, for that time at least, happy. Gentlemen, in the course of a few days Mr. Waine found his way to her again; says he, here is sad news; you have been talking about this to somebody, and we shall be defeated; the poor woman said no, nobody could have heard of it from her; says he, there is more difficulty than I expected, I must have more money; that was the first application: then somebody had got scent of this; that she had enemies; that her husband had enemies: then there was an anonymous letter sent to Mr. Recorder: at last he found two gentlemen, very respectable men, to answer for his good behaviour; but they must have a guinea a-piece: so he went on (not to fatigue you with the variety of frauds this man practised upon her), taking the miserable pence out of her pocket, and pretending that indeed more was wanted; but he, in charity and kindness, would make up the rest: at last he told her - says he, now I have good news to tell you; I saw my Lord Grenville last night (and these people are always very intimate, you know, with great men), and Lord Grenville said, Waine, your business shall be settled immediately: says he, I do not like to come into this house; you have some enemies; they are always writing to the Recorder about it; I will tell you when your husband will come home: the poor woman began to be very uneasy; why the convicts are to be removed from Newgate on board the transport; says he, they will not remove him, for I saw my Lord Grenville, and he told me the thing was all in a train: at last he came, says he, well, I could do nothing better, I have got a conditional pardon for him, to go for an East-India soldier: this did not suit with the poor woman; says he, why so downcast? the serjeant, for a guinea, will let him go any where you please; says she, I have some friends at Windsor first; oh, says he, that is the best place in the world; still more money was procured; then the petition lay in Lord Grenville's office; nothing was to be done without money: well, Gentlemen, at last the husband is sent down to Portsmouth to the transport ship; the poor woman now began to suspect there was something very wrong indeed; she said, Sir, this is sad work; says he, do not fear, I have been down to the ship myself, and left a shilling for him, and really the smell of the ship has made me so sick (though I did not see him); cannot you lend me a trifle to get something to drink, to make me better. In short, Gentlemen, not to pursue this wicked story, the sequel is, that the poor man is now on his voyage to Botany-bay,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070044"/>and the poor woman is now come here before you, Gentlemen, for a resource and restitution very inadequate indeed to the great-loss she has sustained. Gentlemen, this case reminds one of a story that we crown lawyers hear very early in the opening of our profession, of an attorney who used to practise in this place formerly, and had undertaken the defence of a prisoner; the man was indicted, and he sent cash to this attorney to take care of him; but when his trial came on, he found himself deserted, without either counsellor or solicitor; he sent in great rage for the attorney, and told him his situation; he sent him word not to fear, for the Court would not try him; however, he was tried and convicted: he then sent with double haste; oh, says he, there is a flaw in the indictment, they will not pass sentence upon you; however, they did pass sentence upon him with the other convicts: then he was frightened indeed, and he sent to his friend the attorney; well, says he, you have brought me into a dreadful situation indeed! here I am in the condemned cell; says the attorney (who kept out of the way all the while himself), all is safe, do not be uneasy, they will not venture to pass sentence on you; however, sentence was passed upon him with the rest of the convicts: then he sent again, all terror and alarm; oh, says the attorney, they will not put you in the death-warrant, all will be safe; however, in a few days Mr. Recorder's warrant came down to Mr. Akerman for the execution of those convicts, and this poor man among the rest; then the poor creature, whose situation I pretend not to describe, sent to this unfeeling wretch of an attorney again; says he, for God's sake, come to me, do something for me, I am very much alarmed, for Mr. Akerman's people tell me we are to be hanged on Wednesday next; to which this unfeeling attorney, for the last time, replied, Never fear, says he, they dare not hang you; but I wish I could see them do it; for if they hang you, I will punish them very severely: so it was with Mr. Waine.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, now comes the pleasant part of the picture: thank God Almighty, there is no situation, however abject, and miserable, and distressed, in this country, which, when that distress comes to be known by their superiors, is not protected: the case came to be known to the late sheriff, Mr. Alderman Macaulay, who immediately directed the poor woman to apply to Mr. Shelton, who was instructed to submit the case, as it is properly submitted, to you. Gentlemen, thank God, whilst the office is in such hands, and in such a succession of officers, there is no great danger that these things will pass with impunity: this is the first case that modern iniquity has presented to us for judgement; I know very well that it will be made a terrible example to those who have been preying but too much on the miseries of their fellow-creatures: you will feel considerable satisfaction in pronouncing on his guilt, if he is found guilty; and the Court will take care to punish, that men of the like description may not fancy, in future, that they are to sport with the feelings and miseries of the distressed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are the wife of the unfortunate man who was convicted for stealing coals? - Yes; a man left a direction for the prisoner; in consequence of which I went to him, and he promised to procure a pardon for my husband in a few days; he said he had great intercession with somebody at the Secretary of State's, and that he was not in the least afraid but he should soon have a pardon for my husband; I was very earnest to have it done, and willing to submit to any thing that he told me; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070045"/>was to have a guinea for the petition, and a guinea to give in with the petition at the Secretary of State's office; he was to call on me the next day with the petition, and I was to get my friends to sign it; he would try my friends, but he did not care whether I had any or not, as he had plenty of hands to sign it; he called on me the next day, and brought me a petition, which some of my friends signed, and some were not at home; then I went with him to some of his friends, and they were willing to sign it; then he said there were sufficient hands, and two members of parliament; he had the two guineas when he brought the petition, which was the second day; then I went with him to some office, I cannot tell what office, nor what part of the town; he gave it to some gentleman; then he said it was all right; I was very much unacquainted with the town at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You had better state to her the situation of Lord Grenville's office, and then she can know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You may do that on cross examination.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Yostus. I never was there in my life; I do not know the situation of the office.</p>

               <p>He was to solicit this petition every day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my Lord, I will pass shortly over all the rest till I come to the pretensions upon which the indictment is founded.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Yostus. He said he would take particular care to do my business; at length, my husband was removed from Newgate to the ship; I met him somewhere near Patten-court, in Fleet-street; I was quite distressed, and was looking for him; he said he was seeking for me; I told him I thought my husband was not to be sent away; he said they did not dare to send him away, but he was sent in the room of one of the men who stabbed himself, and he was sent to make up the number; he said it would be very easy to fetch him back from the ship, and then Mr. Akerman's fees on being discharged would be all saved, so that it was better than if he had not; he said he had called on Mr. Akerman, and he was very angry, because he had wronged him of his fees; the next time I saw him he bid me have good spirits, for it was easy to fetch him away, and he said he must see him; and at night he came, and said he had been within four or five miles of Gravesend, but he could not see him; he said he was very ill, at the smell of the ship, and had left a shilling for my husband: he came again, and said there was a pardon lying in the office for my husband, but it could not be got out without having two men to be bound for his good behaviour for two or three years; and that he had two men of property, but they would not be bound under two guineas, and then there would be nothing more to do: I gave him two guineas for that purpose the next day; then he came and asked me if I was ready for him, and I gave it him with all the pleasure in the world.</p>
               <p>How did you get the money together? - By pawning my clothes, and the bed from under me: I have six children, all boys; he knew my distress, and saw all this; one of my boys had the misfortune, the very day I went with him to go to the ship, to fall down an area and break his thigh; when I returned, I found my child under the doctor's hands: the pardon was to come in a few days: a few days after this, I called at his lodgings again; he said he was doing my business, neglecting his own, as if I was his sister, but he could not get the pardon from the office: at last, he came to my apartments, and said, I have good news for you, I have a conditional pardon for your husband, to go for an East-India soldier; and he said, our labour is all lost, and the expences all thrown away; he had better have been as he was; I was of the same opinion; I asked him if there were any means of getting him off; he said yes, there were, but he knew I could not stand the expence, as I had been so much distressed before; and I asked him what it would be at the outside; he took a pen and ink, and wrote down something for 4 l. and then he could get him off from being a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070046"/>soldier; could arrest him, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did he get by this last lie? - He got the value of 4 l. I sold my bed for two guineas, and pawned my buckles, and sold and pawned every thing I could make money of, but I could not raise the 4 l. I could only raise about 3 l. 17 s. or thereabouts; he said he would make up the rest for me.</p>
               <p>You never got a pardon? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor never would, in such hands, till the day of judgment, certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, being deprived of counsel, I should esteem it a favour to be permitted to examine the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, you may ask her any questions you please.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I wish to ask Mrs. Yostus how she first became acquainted with me? - A person came and wrote his name down.</p>
               <p>Did not you come to the Red-lion, in Old-Bethlehem, and apply to me to get a petition drawn, in order to get your husband a pardon? - Yes, I did; it was somewhere by Old Bethlehem; I do not know the sign.</p>
               <p>Was not it then agreed on for me to draw a petition for that purpose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After I had drawn that petition, and carried it to your house, and read it over to you, whether several of your friends, and particularly your husband's master, refused to sign the same? - Some refused it, because they did not know him, because he had been in town but a short time.</p>
               <p>Whether or no I did not get several of your friends to sign this petition? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After that, whether or no you did not go with me to several respectable people; the first was Mr. Evans, the wine and brandy merchant, the corner of York-street? - I said so before.</p>
               <p>Did not you give me one guinea, not two? - You had a guinea for writing the petition, and a guinea to give in with the petition.</p>
               <p>At that same time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not I desire you to meet me at the Prince

               <p>Now, Mrs. Yostus, we went into the Treasury, as I call it, and I went up a great number of stone stairs, till we came to the top of the building, to a green door; do you recollect going up a large flight of stairs? - I do not remember any thing of the door; I remember going up a sight of stairs, but I do not know what office it was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, after that, my drawing a petition to the worshipful Recorder? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went with me, and saw me deliver it in to his lordship's servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect another petition being also drawn up to

               <p>Do you recollect my taking a letter to Lord Grenville's house in St. James's-street with you? - Yes, I went with you with all the three letters that you have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Now, Mrs. Yostus, I shall be glad to know at what time the 3 l. 17 s. was paid to me; when was that? - You had it of me, and you know you had it of me.</p>
               <p>It is amazing to me that you cannot recollect the day; if I pay any money, I can recollect the day. - It is not surprising, considering the state of mind I was in.</p>
               <p>After this supposed time of receiving these different sums, did you employ me any further in the business respecting your husband? - You know I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you continued to employ him afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think another circumstance, but you speak so low, but only I gain information from the learned counsel, it was when going to the side of the ship, that I came up and told you I could not see him, and you said you would go yourself? - Yes, and indeed I did go, but you had never been there.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - They told me you never had been there.</p>

               <p>Did not I use every endeavour in my power to prevail on the Captain to let you go aboard to see your husband? - Certainly you did, but it was a false pretence you made to him.</p>
               <p>I am not talking about a false pretence, or what pretence it was; was not the Captain's orders that he should be on board on the Friday following, and if I would send a letter by you to him, you should be permitted to go on board? - That is very true.</p>

             should tell you, if your husband was so unfortunate to go out in the ship Pitt, he should be liberated from his irons, and assist the cook? - Yes, he told me so.</p>

               <p>Likewise another to the Queen? - As you informed me.</p>
               <p>Have not you, before and since that time, expressed that you was fully satisfied with my conduct, that I had done every thing to serve you? - It was all a pretence, for you got me no pardon.</p>
               <p>Have you not said so? - I was not satisfied.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever said that you was satisfied with him, and that he had done all he could? - Never any thing of that kind; all I said was, that he should bring my husband to me, and I should be satisfied; that was what I gave him the money for; if I had had ten times as much, I should have given it him; he said he would bring my husband to me, and he would forfeit his life if he did not.</p>
               <p>Have you any other witnesses to prove the payments? - No; he always wished me to keep it as a secret, and so I did, or else I should not have done as I have, if I had let my friends know it.</p>

            , it would have come to your knowledge? - I cannot possibly charge my memory; they all go through my hands; I have carefully perused my book, which I have with me; there is no reference to the Judge, which is a previous step to the ordering of a pardon.</p>
               <p>Therefore, of course, no pardon could have been applied for? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>If by any accident such pardon had been there, no fee whatever would have been taken with it, but it would have been sent to the Judge who tried the prisoner in the regular course of office? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>I mean the Secretary of State's letter? - It is the sign manual, directed to the Recorder of London, and in the country to the sheriffs.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to these pardons, I may have been misinformed, but I wish to know whether any person is not intitled to take that pardon out of your office? - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>When these are taken out, is not there a certain fee by act of parliament? - Yes, by the established fees of the office, there is a fee of 1 l. 7 s. 6 d.; that does not occur three times in a long period.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Could it have been true that a pardon for this man, Yostus, had been laying in the office, and might be fetched away for paying the fees? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. But in this case neither was there any pardon, any sign manual, or any reference to the Judge? - No, there is no pardon whatever granted, unless there is a reference to the Judge; and it appears,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179112070048"/>from my book, that there was no reference, and consequently could not be any pardon.</p>

My Lord, I have acted throughout this business with no intent, either directly or indirectly, to take advantage of this woman whatever; I did every thing as far as lay in my power in the business; and in consequence of which I must observe, that my wife was the person who got the petition to the Queen into the Countess Dowager of Effingham's family; it was sent by her, and presented; whether it had any effect, I cannot say; she got a violent cold by so doing, and has never since been able to do the domestic duties of the family: I have three children, and one of them blind: I have only to say, that, upon this charge only, were I this night summoned before the great tribunal of the awful seat of God, to answer for the deeds I have done in this life, and had no other charge to answer for, I am sure I should be perfectly happy; I am totally innocent; I never received any sum or sums of money on those pretences whatever; I have received sums of money as necessary for a person acting for six weeks, going here and there, backwards and forwards, from Shoreditch to Charing-cross, to meet this good woman at different public-houses; undoubtedly her mind was very uneasy; I put her to no expence on that account; she has often declared she was fully satisfied with my conduct: I now address myself to your candour and benevolence in this business; I am perfectly satisfied that I have done every thing to serve the woman. Gentlemen of the Jury, I trust to your discrimination and candour in this affair; I hope you will see this prosecution like to a man that builds his house on the sand, without any foundation.</p>
