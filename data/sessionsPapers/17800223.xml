I happened to step up stairs upon some business, and upon my return I perceived that a pair of leather pumps which hung upon some hooks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230003"/>in my shop to dry were missing; I followed her out of the shop and asked her if she had not taken the pumps; she said, how could I think any such thing as that? and she wished God Almighty might strike her dead if she had any such thing. I took her back to the shop, and said I would send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time miss any thing besides these pumps? - Not at that time; I had missed a great number of shoes before that. When I threatened to send for a constable, the prisoner took the pumps out of her pocket and begged I would forgive her; I told her she had robbed me of a great quantity of goods, and I was determined to punish her. Then she confessed that she had pawned in Oxford-street, two pair of men's shoes which she had stolen from me. She likewise confessed selling two pair of shoes and two odd ones; the fellows to which odd shoes a woman purchased of me afterwards. The next morning the officer and I went and searched the prisoner's lodging; I found a shoe upon the foot of the prisoner's sister.</p>

               <p>I keep a clothes shop at Knightsbridge. The prisoner brought a pair of shoes and two odd shoes to my shop, and asked me to buy them; I scrupled buying them on account of two of the shoes being odd ones.</p>
               <p>Did not you enquire from that circumstance how she came by them? - Yes; she said her father was ill in the hospital, and starving for want of necessaries; that he had taken a shop at Kensington Gravel-pits, and that the two odd ones were fellows to two shoes her father had sold in mistake; and as soon as her father got better she said he should make two shoes to match them. I gave her 4 s. for the four shoes.</p>
               <p>What is the fair value of those shoes? - I cannot tell. I sell a great many shoes and odd kind of things old and new.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. What is the value of the shoes? - One pair seven shillings, and the other, to the best of my remembrance, seven shillings and sixpence; they were bespoke work. This woman has four small children, and therefore I did not prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Court to Reynolds. I hope you have not many such dealings as these? - I never bought any such before.</p>
               <p>Court. If there were not such people as you there would be fewer thieves.</p>
               <p>Have you the shoes here which you purchased of the prisoner? - There are the two odd shoes (producing them) I had of the prisoner; I sold the pair of shoes for four shillings.</p>

He then said somebody had left them there, for he knew nothing of them, and asked his mother and sister who left them; after that he said the persons who cut the trunk off were at a house at Temple-bar, if I would go and see for them.

               <p>Do you remember any things being stolen from Mr. Walsh's house in January last? - Yes. Upon the buckles being missing I went the next day to the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Give an account how the things were missed? - Mr. Walsh missed the gold knee-buckles on the morning of Thursday the 20th of January, and some circumstances led us to suspect the prisoner. I went the next day to the prisoner's lodgings, which were in Duke-street. The prisoner had lived servant with Mr. Walsh; he left the house on the evening of Tuesday the 18th. In his trunk we found all the things mentioned in the indictment, except the coat and the buckles, they were tied up in the blue baize.</p>
               <p>Did you take a constable with you? - Yes, and the other witnesses were with me. These are the things (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Do you know them sufficiently to speak to the property? - I can speak to those of them which have Mr. Walsh's mark upon them. Here are three books which have Mr. Walsh's arms pasted on them. There is no mark on those stockings, but Mr. Walsh's stockings are exactly of the same sort.</p>
               <p>What number is there of the stockings? - Fifteen pair of worsted under stockings.</p>
               <p>These stockings appear to be new? - They have never been worn. I know Mr. Walsh had such a number of new stockings, which resembled these, and those stockings were missing. Here are twelve pair of thread stockings marked with Mr. Walsh's initials; they are Mr. Walsh's property. Here are a pair of mottled stockings which are Mr. Walsh's; I remember them perfectly well. Here are thirteen pair of cotton stockings and two quilted dimity waistcoats, which are my master's. I know my master had such a piece of woollen cloth as this, it matches to the piece which is left behind.</p>

               <p>Is the piece of baize they were wrapped in your master's property? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present when you searched? - He was not, he was taken up the day before.</p>
               <p>How long before these things were missing had you seen them in the house? - They had been in the prisoner's charge; they were delivered by him to

               <p>When was he discharged? - Mr. Walsh discharged him on the 4th; the receipt for his wages bears date the 10th of January.</p>
               <p>On what day did he leave the house? - On the 18th.</p>
               <p>Did he leave his trunk behind him? - No, he took it away with him.</p>
               <p>Do you of your own knowledge know when the things mentioned in the indictment were missed? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that they were missed? - I know the buckles were missed on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Who went with you to the prisoner's lodgings? - Ingram and the constable.</p>
               <p>You say the three books have Mr. Walsh's arms on them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If they had not had those arms in them you would not have known them? - No.</p>
               <p>You not being a servant about the person of Mr. Walsh, I suppose you cannot know much of these things? - I deliver over the things to the valets.</p>
               <p>The stockings have some a W. and some an I upon them? - They have.</p>
               <p>If there were others there of the same kind I imagine you could not tell which were Mr. Walsh's? - I could not tell.</p>

               <p>Were Mr. Walsh's things delivered into your charge? - The inventory was looked over and the things delivered into my charge on Monday and Tuesday the 3d and 4th.</p>

            . This is the inventory (producing it).</p>
               <p>Is that the inventory which was delivered to you by the prisoner? - It is; here are some marks which I made upon it.</p>
               <p>Are the things that were lost contained in that inventory? - Yes, except the woollen stockings, the socks, and the cloth.</p>
               <p>Were the things which are in that inventory, and, among the rest, the things produced there, delivered to you by the prisoner? - They were.</p>
               <p>Were any such things as the woollen stockings, the cloth, and the socks delivered to you by the prisoner? - There was cloth of this kind delivered to me by the prisoner, but that was not in the inventory; I cannot swear to that, it has been out of my possession; it is like the cloth which was delivered to me. Nor can I swear to the other things, except the coat, that I can swear to, because I put my mark upon it, as they have been out of my possession. Mr. Walsh had things like these.</p>

               <p>When the things were delivered into your care, where did you keep them? - In Mr. Walsh's dressing-room. The stockings were in the drawers, the waistcoats and this coat were in the clothes press, which I kept locked.</p>
               <p>When did you first miss these things? - On Thursday the 20th of January. Mr. Walsh in the morning missed a penknife out of a drawer; he rang his bell and asked me if I knew any thing of his penknife; I said I supposed it was in the drawer of his dressing-table; upon searching for the knife Mr. Walsh looked into the drawer of the bureau, where the gold shoe and knee-buckles were kept, and missed the buckles; he desired me to bring him the inventory of the things; he looked it over, and then bid me bring him his gold shoe and knee-buckles; I went to the drawer, but could not find them; as the were not in wear I had put them into the same drawer in which they used to be kept. When they were delivered to me I locked the drawer and kept the key. I cannot say it was always locked; I had frequent occasion to go to that drawer more than others, and as one key opened them all I might have left that drawer open. When I could give no account of the buckles, Mr. Walsh ordered all the servants up into the room together. The prisoner was gone then. We were all searched, and nothing was found. As the prisoner had been in the house till the 18th, the footman William Flint and I went to his lodgings to ask him if he knew any thing about them. We saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Had you looked over the inventory to see if any thing else was missing? - We did not suspect any thing else was missing at that time. When we got to the door of the prisoner's lodging the prisoner came out and said we could not go in, because he had got somebody there; I asked him to go down stairs with us; when we came down stairs I told him a disagreeable thing had happened among us; I asked him what he had done with the gold buckles when he delivered the inventory; he said he put them in the drawer again; he said he would go and speak to Mr. Walsh; I told him that was of no use unless he could tell where the buckles were; I said we had been searched, and we were sent to search his effects; he said we might search his things with all his heart; he said he would go up stairs, and he desired we would not come up, as he had somebody there, and he would come down as soon as he could; he ran up stairs, and we followed him immediately, I opened the door and saw him at the bed; he seemed to be in some confusion. We went to the bed; it was turned down, and there we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230008"/>found this coat; as soon as I saw the coat under the pillow, I said here is one of Mr. Walsh's coats; he said no it is not; I took it up and opened it, I then said this is Mr. Walsh's coat, is it not? He said yes, take it and tie it up in a handkerchief and carry it home; I said, Mr. Booker, this is a disagreeable affair, you knew I must be answerable for all these things, I shall be obliged to you if you could inform me where the buckles are. He looked very much confused; he said I tell you what, Mr. Ingram, if you will promise not to say any thing to Mr. Walsh till six o'clock in the evening, or to any body else, I will give you the buckles, or tell you where they are. I gave him my word I would not say any thing to any body till that hour, or in the evening. Both Flint and I made him that promise. We went home to my master's and informed Mr. Gibson what we had done, that we had given our words not to tell Mr. Walsh or any body till fix in the evening. Mr. Gibson said if I would not tell Mr. Walsh, he would; upon that we went up directly and told Mr. Walsh; Mr. Walsh ordered us to go and fetch the prisoner to him, and Mr. Walsh assured us he did not intend to hurt any man.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Walsh say that in the presence of the prisoner? - No; only in the presence of us two. While we were gone Mr. Walsh and Mr. Gibson got a constable to take charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner when you went back to him, that he might safely come and tell all about it, that Mr. Walsh would not hurt him? - I did not tell him that; Flint might, he went up first. We brought the prisoner to Mr. Walsh; Mr. Walsh said to him, I find you have taken a pair of my gold shoe buckles away, and that coat? He said yes, sir. Mr. Walsh said, have you any thing else? the prisoner's answer was no.</p>
               <p>Who were present at this time? - Mr. Gibson, the constable, and myself.</p>
               <p>What more passed? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>We then went with him before Justice Hyde.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Walsh before he asked any thing respecting the buckles or coat make use of any threats, or make any promises to him? - I did not hear any.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when he was before the justice? - He confessed taking all these things, but said he had tied them up in order to return them to Mr. Walsh; he said he took the buckles to serve a friend in distress.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he had done with them? - I could not learn what he had done with them; he said he could not tell; he had given them to a person, and did not know what he had done with them.</p>
               <p>Did he at any subsequent time in your hearing say what he had done with the buckles? - No.</p>
               <p>Have the buckles ever been found? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You came I think into Mr. Walsh's service on the 2d? - I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner went away on the 18th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was discharged on the 4th, but was to come backwards and forwards till the Sunday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did he leave Mr. Walsh's service absolutely? - His pay went on till Sunday next after the 2d day of the month.</p>
               <p>He lay at Mr. Walsh's I am informed after the 4th? - The servants indulged him with lying there, because he had no lodging.</p>
               <p>His trunk remained there till the 18th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>None of the things were missed till the 20th? - None of them.</p>
               <p>You and a fellow-servant on the 20th went to the prisoner's lodging to enquire after these things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Recollect now what promises you made to the prisoner at that time? - We promised we would say nothing at all of it till six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did not you make some promises to induce him to confess? - We said nothing, only promising that we would not say any thing about it till six in the evening.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was left at liberty all that time? - All that time he was left at liberty.</p>
               <p>Did you go the second time that evening? - Yes, we went again in about an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230009"/>Did no words of favour fall from your mouth when you went to the prisoner's apartment the second time; did you mention nothing of what Mr. Walsh said? - He said he did not like to go, would not writing do? I said he had better go and tell Mr. Walsh how it was, and perhaps he might meet with some favour; I could not give him much hope, Mr. Walsh is too rigid a a man to hope for favour.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Walsh. I went with Mr. Ingram to the prisoner's lodging on the 20th of last month. We found the prisoner at his lodging.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the room immediately? - No, we went down stairs first; he said he had somebody in bed; we went down into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Is he a married or a single man? - Single I believe. He met us at the door; Mr. Ingram asked him where the buckles were put; he said in the dressing-room. Mr. Ingram said they could not be found; the prisoner said he did not know where they were. The prisoner went up stairs; we followed him. We found the coat behind the bolster on the bed, then we suspected he knew something about the buckles.</p>
               <p>Did you know that coat? - I knew my master wore such a sort of coat; I believe this is his coat, but I never had it in my care.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say about it? - He first said it was not Mr. Walsh's; afterwards he said it was. When we found the coat we said possibly he knew something about the buckles; and we said if he confessed perhaps it would be the better for him.</p>
               <p>Who said that? - We both spoke to him, I cannot say which said it; he then said, if you will say nothing I will tell you about the buckles. I promised him I would not, and so did Mr. Ingram. He said if we would call about six o'clock in the evening he would get us the buckles and every thing else that he had.</p>
               <p>You promised you would never say any thing about this if he told you? - Not till six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was that the promise he requested, or did he require you should never discover it - He mentioned that time in particular. Then we went home and reasoned with ourselves whether we should acquaint Mr. Walsh with it then or stay till we had got the buckles, or till six o'clock. We spoke to Mr. Gibson about it; Mr. Gibson said we must go and tell Mr. Walsh directly, or he would. I then went up and told Mr. Walsh of it; he bid me go and tell the prisoner to come to him. I said we had promised not to mention it, and hoped he would not hurt him; Mr. Walsh said he was not going to hurt him, he did not want to prosecute any man; he said go and tell him to come to me. When I got to the door I said, sir, I hope you will not hurt him; he said no, he did not want to prosecute any man.</p>
               <p>Did he desire you to tell the prisoner that in order to induce him to confess? - No, but to desire the prisoner to come to him. Then we went to the prisoner's lodgings; I left Mr. Ingram below, and I went up stairs and told the prisoner my master wanted to speak to him. He said I am afraid my master is very angry. I said yes, he is angry, but if you will go to him and own the things, and ask his pardon, I dare say he will forgive you. He said he would go upon that condition. Ingram said the same, that he dared say he would forgive him. He went along with us to Mr. Walsh's; he went up stairs with us, and to our great surprise my master had got a constable up stairs, and charged the constable with him.</p>
               <p>What passed? - My master said, Booker, you have robbed me; he said he had. My master said you, have stolen my buckles; the prisoner said he had, and went down on his knees and asked my master's pardon; my master said you are in the hands of justice now, and delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Did your master make use of any promises when the prisoner came to him to induce him to confess? - No, not to him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The first time you went to the prisoner's lodging you found the coat before there was any promise at all made to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And upon finding that you said if he would confess the other things it would be better for him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230010"/>Upon that he confessed he knew of the other things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The second time you gave him hopes that his master would forgive him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He might have gone away if he had not relied upon a hope of forgiveness? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Are you the person who was sent for by Mr. Walsh? - Yes. I went with Mr. Ingram and Mr. Flint to search the prisoner's lodging, after he was in Tothil-fields Bridewell; I found in a trunk in the prisoner's lodging the things which have now been produced, at least they were things of the same kind; I believe these are the same, they have been in Mr. Walsh's house.</p>
               <p>Who carried them there? - I do not know; they have not been in my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>He gave you the key of his trunk voluntarily? - Yes. I went down to Bridewell to him; he gave me the key; he said there was nothing in the box but his own.</p>
               <p>To Ingram. You said the things, found at the prisoner's lodging, were taken out of drawers which were usually kept locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any of the drawers appear to be broken open? - There was no appearance of the kind.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner to your knowledge the key of those drawers before he left the house? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had any one else but yourself the key? - Mr. Walsh had the key; I know of no body else having any key. One key opened all the drawers, the presses and all.</p>
               <p>Were these things delivered to you on the 4th, and the drawers kept locked from that time? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Where was the coat kept? - In the press</p>
               <p>Was that press kept locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have things of the same kind of my own, stockings and waistcoats; I have some things in prison which I believe will answer the same things.</p>
               <p>To Ingram. Was that the trunk in which the things were found which the prisoner had at your master's house? - I do not know the trunk, I never saw it till I saw it in the prisoner's room.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. A porter came to my house and said he had been robbed of two hampers of bottles, that he had got a man whom he desired me to go and take charge of. I went with him to a publick-house; there I saw the prisoner. I asked him how he came by the hamper. He said a man hired him to take it over the kennel, he having boots on; it was at the breaking up of the frost. I took him to the Compter, and there I left him.</p>
               <p>To Buckle. You had intelligence from a woman or man sweeping the kennel, that two persons were gone along with hampers on their backs? - I had.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - By the Old Change Cheapside.</p>

               <p>I am a carman. I was driving the cart in which the hampers were. When Mr. Kenton's man left me on Ludgate-hill to go round the foot-way the hampers were in the cart; when he came again to the cart there were two hampers gone. He left me immediately, and came again and said he had got one of them.</p>

               <p>What time was the alarm given? - About seven o'clock, between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the trunk? - I had not seen it then. I ran down Wood-street to London-wall, and crossing over to Little Basinghall-street, I saw the prisoner with a trunk; I took him by the collar and asked him where he was going with that trunk? He said he was going to carry it for a gentleman. I said he had carried it far enough, and bid him put it down; he put it down and wanted to get away. There was a man on the opposite side of the street, whom he called Jones, who crossed the way with a stick in his hand; I called for assistance, and that man ran away when he saw some people coming up. I brought the prisoner and the trunk back to the Castle-Inn.</p>

               <p>There is only the watch in court.</p>
               <p>Worrell. I never saw the watch before.</p>
               <p>Did you see the trunk opened? - No; the constable did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Taylor. On Tuesday evening the 1st of February I came to the Castle-Inn; a few minutes after I got out of the coach, the trunk was missed. A book-keeper and some of the attendants at the inn went after it; the prisoner was brought back to the inn, with the trunk. I can only speak to the property.</p>
               <p>How long was it after the trunk was missing that Worrell brought back the prisoner with it? - I suppose about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you open the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there nothing in court but the watch? - No, I have on the breeches and stocking; they were in the trunk.</p>
               <p>Was the watch in the trunk? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you put up the trunk and put the watch in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the watch? - Yes; I have the inventory of the things which were in the trunk; the trunk had not been opened when it was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you know the number of the watch?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I think, to the best of my remembrance, it is 623. made by Easton, of London. There are two seals to it, one seal has a cypher. I am sure the watch and seal are mine.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner before the trunk was missing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body of the name of Jones? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you lose any part of your property at any time? - Yes, two pieces of stuff quilting intended for petticoats, the outside green and the inside white quilted with wool; the outside is called durant to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What was it worth? - About twenty shillings, I believe I lost it on the 5th of January last.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason for charging the prisoner with taking the stuff? - Yes, from my little girl telling me she took it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know any thing of it of your own knowledge? - Yes; when I found her she told me she took it.</p>
               <p>When she made that confession did you make any promise of favour to her? - When she told me she took them, she said they were pawned; I desired to have the duplicates; I told her if I could have my property I would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>What age is the child? - She will be thirteen the 23d of next May.</p>

               <p>I am servant to a pawnbroker, No. 13, Holywell-street, Shoreditch. I have a petticoat here which I received from two women, but I cannot recollect either of their faces; I have looked at the prisoner, but cannot recollect her to be the person I took it in of.</p>

               <p>Can you upon your oath say that the petticoat now produced was the stuff you lost? - I believe this to be my property; the coat I saw by day-light at Justice Wilmot's I could swear to.</p>
               <p>To Harvey. Is that the petticoat which was produced at Justice Wilmot's? - It is the petticoat she swore to at the justice's.</p>

               <p>I hired the prisoner to look after my family; she was setting forth her distresses; she said she had a family, and had been out of place two months, and that she had supported herself by pawning her things. She said she had a petticoat in pawn which she would sell for two shillings more than it was pawned for, rather than the pawnbroker should run away with it. I redeemed it out of pawn, they had lent seven shillings upon it; I paid the interest and gave the prisoner a shilling more. She told me it was her own, and by her producing the duplicate I thought it was her own.</p>

               <p>How many drams had you? - Four drams.</p>

               <p>Had you been a-bed? - Yes, from nine o'clock. We got up to get some water, as it was Christmas time we had been drinking and were thirsty.</p>

I did not know the other three men, but the two prisoners are the men who lay with the woman. When they came by the watch-house door

Then as we were about to go home we met with the excise-officer again; we went up the Bank again with him; then we saw the deceased stuck up against a door; I said to her are not you ashamed, such an old woman as you, to lie with so many fellows? She replied, how could I help myself against so many?</p>


               <p>Did she come by the place where the five men went on? - She was farther on towards Rosemary-lane. She had no marks of violence upon her but only her eyes were swelled very much.</p>
               <p>You understood at that time that the men had lain with her, by her consent? - Yes. Those were the words she said to me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230016"/>that was the last time we came down the Bank. I saw no more of her after that.</p>

               <p>Was it more than fifty yards? - I dare say it was above fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Where did you see that the deceased's eyes were swelled? - When she was at the next door to the King of Prussia's Head.</p>
               <p>There is no lamp I believe on Saltpetre-Bank? - There may be one at the top, and one at the bottom for what I know.</p>
               <p>If you saw it, it was by moon-light? - It was a very moon-light, sharp, frosty night.</p>
               <p>Saltpetre-Bank is a place pretty much frequented at all hours of the night, I believe? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You know Saltpetre Bank very well, and what sort of houses there are there? - I was born and bred in the parish, and therefore ought to know it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a surgeon? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body of the deceased? - On Monday the 27th of December last I was desired by the churchwardens to examine the body of the deceased, to see whether it was necessary to have a coroner's inquest upon it. She was bruised in a violent manner in various parts of the body; her knees were bruised and discoloured exceedingly; her arms were excoriated from the elbow; her eyes were black, and swelled almost out of her head; there was a blow upon her temple, and a wound under her left jaw, which wound was triangular, and seemed to be made by a tuck out of a stick, or something of that fort. I told the churchwarden it would be highly necessary to have a coroner's inquest. On the Tuesday following I was desired to open the body, which I did, I then traced the wound to its exit; I found it about three quarters of an inch deep. I took off the scalp, and part of the skull, and examined the brain. I did not perceive any injury upon the brain.</p>
               <p>Were any of the bruises that you saw likely to occasion her death, or in your judgement did occasion it? - I could not take upon me to swear that any of the wounds or bruises were the immediate cause of the death. I look upon it that the treatment the woman received was the first cause, and the inclemency of the weather the second or finishing cause.</p>
               <p>But none of the wounds would have occasioned her death? - Not from their appearance they would not.</p>


               <p>Upon the whole you imputed her death to the inclemency of the weather, her being out all night as you heard she was? - I look upon that to be only the secondary cause. I believe the inclemency of the weather would not have destroyed her if she had not been so ill treated before; being struggling, and her spirits exhausted, she might be left in such a state that the inclemency of the weather might take greater effect.</p>
               <p>Was the weather remarkably severe then? - Exceedingly so.</p>
               <p>If a person was in a state of health before, might not the inclemency of the weather have occasioned death though these bruises or wounds had never happened? - Unless they were intoxicated and lay exposed motionless, but that did not seem to be her case.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was it on the Monday or the Tuesday that you was called upon? - The Monday.</p>
               <p>Were you the first surgeon that examined the body? - I know nothing about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230018"/>Do you know Mr. Slater and Mr. Hodgson? - I have seen the gentlemen once.</p>
               <p>And a Mr. Trower; do not you know a gentleman of the faculty of that name? - No. I never saw Mr. Slater in my life till he came to my house to examine me about the state of the woman's case.</p>
               <p>Are they men of character, and men of reputation in their profession? - I have nothing to say against the gentlemen's character. I know nothing of them; I never saw them in my life till they came to my house.</p>
               <p>Was there no surgeon before the coroner that examined the body besides you? - Not while I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Then it is mere conjecture whether any body examined the body besides you? - I was not present therefore I do not know what other people examined.</p>
               <p>You have heard of no examination? - The churchwarden told me afterwards it had been examined by other surgeons, but I was not present at that examination.</p>
               <p>You have informed the court that the weather may have been a secondary cause, because you suppose that her struggling, and spirits being exhausted, might have hastened her death; how can you possibly know whether she had struggled and her spirits were exhausted? - Her elbows being bruised, and the skin rubbed, I look upon to be a struggling to get clear of the men.</p>
               <p>And you conclude from thence that her spirits must be exhausted too? - I should suppose that a woman who is laid with against her will would struggle till she is much exhausted.</p>
               <p>You never heard of any person being frozen to death? - Certainly they have.</p>
               <p>But not unless the person is intoxicated? - Yes, if a person falls asleep.</p>
               <p>Why is not Mary Hill here? - She desired of myself and the churchwarden, that if it was possible to do without her, she might not to be called.</p>
               <p>- CHINNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the overseers of the parish of St. John, Wapping. On Sunday the 26th of December, after the morning service, word was brought to the church that there was a woman brought into the work-house and died almost instantly as she was brought in. I never saw her till after she was dead. The churchwarden and myself after the service was over went up to the work-house; we saw the body, and there appeared to us, myself and the upper churchwarden Mr. William, some marks of violence; we called upon Mr. Hodgson desiring him to go up with us to see the body; he was not at home; we went up by ourselves and viewed the body; it was our opinion there were marks of violence; we thought we should not be justified in burying the body without having a coroner's inquest held upon it; we applied to Mr. Horsfall. I did not think proper to retain any counsel in this matter, for I think that simple truth, without any dress, will have more weight than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Court. You should have had Mary Hill here. - The women have been threatened if they give evidence. I submit it to your lordship if that is right?</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly not, those threats are very wrong.</p>
               <p>- Jewson. I belong to the workhouse; we were sent to fetch her away in the chair; we found her lying upon the foot pavement facing the Swan in East Smithfield, about nine in the morning; we found her much bruised and beat.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you? - She never spoke a word, we carried her to the work-house; we delivered her to the nurse of the ward; she died in five or six minutes after we got her in.</p>
               <p>You were not acquainted with the woman before? - No, I never saw her before.</p>

               <p>You have heard the account given by Mr. Horsfall? - I have.</p>
               <p>You examined the body accurately; inform the court whether there was any appearance of injury upon the body. - The external part of the trunk I examined most minutely; there was a very small wound on the lower part of the left jaw; I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230019"/>any probe in my pocket; I borrowed a knitting needle to probe the depth of that wound, it went in a diagonal form, rather inclining upwards, it pointed as if coming out of the skin again; it seemed to be a superficial wound; it did not penetrate more than three quarters of an inch; her eyes were black as if she had received a blow or two upon them, there likewise were some bruises on the elbows, and on the knees; I think a trifling blow upon one side of the cheek, which appeared to me to be done by falling down, as if the woman had fallen, and by that means bruised herself: seeing these bruises of so trifling a nature, I was desirous of examining the viscera of the body and the brain, but Mr. Hodgson who examined with me said it was so clear a case it was not worth while to enter into the minutiae further. It appeared to me the woman died from the inclemency of the weather, and not from those bruises she had received. Mr. Trower, a gentleman of the faculty, who is now at Margate, was likewise with me, it was then our opinion that the bruises the woman had received could not by any means in the world have occasioned her death.</p>
               <p>And that is your opinion now? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. HODGSON sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a surgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You examined the body of this woman at the same time that Mr. Slater did? - Yes; I did not see any marks of violence, or wound that could have occasioned death.</p>
               <p>There was a Mr. Trower, a surgeon, with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You all concurred in the opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have heard Mr. Horsfall's opinion about a primary and secondary cause, which I do not understand; is that opinion well or ill founded, can you make any sense of that distinction? - It is a rule for me only to speak to the facts that are before me.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Slater. Can you make any sense of this primary and secondary cause? - I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM STANLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>What time on Sunday morning did you got up? - At four o'clock in the morning; this woman was standing at the watch-house door then.</p>
               <p>How did she appear to you then, to be sober or in liquor? - I found it was four o'clock; I went home to bed again; I went home about a quarter before seven; this woman was upon her knees beating her head against the flag stones.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>- KENT sworn.</p>
               <p>I was house-man at the watch-house. There was a woman came to the door about four o'clock; she laid hold of the spikes at the door and begged to come in. The officers, seeing her in liquor, would not let her in. They told her she had better go home to her lodging; she said she had got none, but d - n her the would come in there. The officer said she should not. At a quarter after five I locked up the watch-house and went away, and saw no more of her. I remember these women were going by the watch-house at the same time she stood there; she had something wrapped round her head, so that I could not see whether she was bruised or not.</p>
               <p>How near is your watch-house to the place where the two men had been lying with her? - I cannot say what part of Saltpetre Bank it was, because I heard no complaint about it. When she came to the watch-house she never made any complaint about her being ill used or any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I did not indeed.</p>

On the 15th of January, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. Every one of the things mentioned in the indictment were my pro- property; they were all previous to that time in my house. The prisoner was my <rs id="t17800223-11-deflabel63" type="occupation">housemaid</rs>

I made an enquiry after her; I got a search warrant from a justice of the peace of search her father's house, where I apprehended I should find her. The prisoner was found at her father's house in Buckles-Court, St. Martin's-Lane, and several of the things I had lost were found in her possession; they were delivered up to the constable; she there confessed taking all the things which are mentioned in the indictment. She said some of them were at a lodging she had taken in Swallow-street, the others were pawned. She directed us to the pawn-broker's, and also to her lodgings. The bed, blanket, bolster, tea-kettle, candlestick, and a coarse sheet were found at her lodging in Swallow-street, and some things were in the possession of the pawn-broker.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether she did not offer me these things in lieu of money? I was hired a servant to her. She had four girls that saw company. The woman kept the house. She wanted me to go into company. I would not. She sent a gentleman down stairs after me; I would not comply<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230023"/>with him; he went out in a passion; she came down stairs and abused me, and said I hindered her of a guinea to her house; after that, she sent me up to the bed room, a gentleman came up, and she locked me in; she kept me there all night, the gentleman was to give me five guineas; he said he left it in her hands. She said she was distressed, and was going to live in a house at Brompton. She kept a very disorderly house in King's-Place.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. Had you the sum of five guineas deposited with you for that girl? - There never were such words mentioned, if it was the last moment I had to live, nor ever such speeches came out of my mouth; it is all a falsity; she has raised this, in order that it should be against me, on account of the things she carried off. I never heard a word of this before.</p>
               <p>Did you promise her any money? - No; I had fourteen shillings of her's, which she had received as vails, she put into my hands, and I told her I would buy her a gown with it.</p>
               <p>Then you did not offer her these things voluntarily in lieu of money she was to have? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The things she accuses me of stealing from her, with a bed-gown she gave me to do my work in of a morning, I left it dirty in the pail. I gave her warning several times, and she would not pay me what she owed me. I went away between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning. She gave me a shift and other things; she claimed a right to every thing she gave me, which was a bed-gown and shift and other things, which I gave up to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her this bed-gown? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lock this girl up in company with any gentleman? - I never mentioned any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you ever do the fact? - Never upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has drawn many a girl in the cord and debauched them.</p>
               <p>Court. Has the girl ever warned you to quit your service? - No; I warned her before, and she always cried to stay. She would not work; she frequently got in liquor, drank beer and gin much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask the constables; they know she keeps a bad house; there are people come every night and break her windows, and her house is tore to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That does not concern you; that is nothing to you.</p>

On the 14th of January a counterpane, sheet, and napkin were pledged with me by the prisoner. Half a guinea was lent upon the sopha cover, a guinea upon the others.

She delivered up to us the duplicates of the several things that have been pledged at the pawn-brokers, and she said she would show us where the other things were in the lodgings she had taken, and she delivered over the other things at her father's house; she went with us to her lodgings; there the other things were found; the prisoner said she would give them up to her mistress, provided she would not prosecute her.</p>

We took her before the justice; there, upon examination, the prisoner said there was no person concerned in the business but herself, but she said something about the girls persuading her to take them away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My mistress sent me to pawn those things; she would not have duplicates in her pocket for fear she should pull them out of her pocket. She pawned those things to pay her landlady.</p>

               <p>Court. What are you? - I live upon my means; my husband maintains me in a genteel manner. I went to ask the prosecutrix two or three questions about her. I went to ask her what the affair was; she told me of the things that were taken, and she told me that she came to her for a service; and she told me she was something I do not like to mention, unless I must do it; she said she kept girls, and she thought the prisoner at the bar in a little time might become one of her girls, or her women; I do not know what she called them; I cannot tell what it is. She said she meant to go out the week following to buy her a pretty linen gown, and send her into her business. I supposed so by her meaning.</p>

               <p>Court. When was this? - After this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner was then in custody? - Yes. But this is what she told me was her intention, and that she might have made very well of it, if she had not gone away.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this all? - There was a great deal more said, for I talked an hour or two with her, but I cannot remember any more at present.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prosecutrix about her situation, whether she was a married woman or no? - I do not recollect; the prisoner is a married woman, because I was present at the prisoner's marriage.</p>
               <p>What is become of her husband now? - Her husband was out of town at the time; he left her distressed, so she went there to live in his absence.</p>
               <p>What is her general character? - Very good; she has lived with me.</p>
               <p>You have not had any knowledge of the prosecutrix, have you? - I never saw her till I went to speak to her; she herself discounted her life to me, for I did not know what she was.</p>

My wife came back before me. When I returned I examined the door and found that the staple was forced out and the work was gone. It consisted of three-quarters of mode silk.

               <p>Archer. This silk has the same mark and is of the same breadth as some which was left in the room, for the piece was cut. The value is nearly three pounds. The quantity now produced and that left in the room together make exactly the quantity of my silk, and correspond with that quantity which I had delivered out to Boston, my workman, to weave for me; and there is a white knot in it by which Boston knew it the moment he saw it; indeed he had before so described it.</p>
               <p>Boston. There is a mark upon it by which I can positively swear it is the silk worked by me. The mark is a white knot of silk tied to three threads. There is nobody in the trade that ever used that mark but myself.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner between seven and eight years. I never heard any harm of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at her house that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he at your house that evening? - He was at my house, from the hour of five till nine; he never was out of my house.</p>
               <p>What day was that? - On the 12th of January.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - For a particular reason, I took a memorandum of it.</p>
               <p>How came you to do that? - I had a carpenter did a little job for me and I set down the day, it was old New-year's day.</p>
               <p>Where is your house? - No. 1, Swedeland-court, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>How far is that from where Boston lives? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you got that memorandum of the carpenter's about you? - The carpenter has it.</p>
               <p>Have you looked over it since? - I saw it in his book.</p>
               <p>Was it the 12th of January there? - Yes, it was Old New-year's-day. The prisoner lighted the carpenter while he was doing the job.</p>
               <p>Was the carpenter there more days than one? - Not at that little trifling job, but he was before that, the particular days I cannot remember, he had been there before.</p>
               <p>Why do you fix it for the 12th of January that the prisoner lighted the carpenter? - The man's work was finished that day, and he could put in no more till that was off the loom.</p>
               <p>Was he absent at all during that time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether he was or not? - To my knowledge he was not; I was down below stairs, up and down; I never missed him or heard him open the door.</p>
               <p>Was you out of the room where he was? - Not half an hour together.</p>
               <p>Archer. I would have you be so kind to understand, and the jury, I never saw the man; and were they to bring him in guilty, I would strive to the utmost of my power not to have him executed. This woman should be cautious, to say she never heard any thing amiss of him! Only please to ask her whether he was not sent from the justice's on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Was he sent from the justice's on board a ship? - He never wronged me; he was sent as a pressed man.</p>
               <p>The question is, what is his character in general? - As an impressed man he was sent from justice Wilmot's office for a soldier.</p>

The hat appeared to have been taken off his head in a joke, and he put his own hat on the prisoner's head and had walked about the room and cried out how fine I look in this hat! When the man came and enquired after his hat, with some difficulty the prisoner returned it. There was not any evidence to trace the watch to the hands of the prisoner. Some bad women were in the house. The watch was found in the possession of a woman who admitted in evidence, that she disposed of it, and said she had received it from the prisoner. It appeared she had been tried for felony and convicted, so was not in law a competent witness.)</p>

As I put up my arm for the gentlewoman to lay hold of it to get out, I perceived the slap of the boot go up. As soon as the lady let go my arm, I went to the side of the boot and saw the prisoner, he had got the trunk from the bottom of the boot to the top of it. The prisoner was not the person I had observed before.</p>

               <p>Had he got it out of the boot? - No.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday se'nnight, at half after five o'clock in the afternoon, I was upon London-Bridge looking at the waterworks; there had been a fire there. I came out of the country. I was looking at the wheels as they went round, and one Jones, who sells goods about the country, whom I had seen at my brother's who keeps a publick-house at Marlborough in Wiltshire, came up to me, and said he hoped my brother in the country was well. We went together into the Borough and drank two pints of beer at one publick-house, and one at another. We staid in the Borough till about nine o'clock. He asked me which way I was going; I said into the city, I lodged in the city. He said so did he. We went together, and he took me to the prisoner's in <placeName id="t17800223-16-crimeloc87">Turnagain-lane, Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>A publick-house? - No, it is a private house; that was about a quarter after nine. The prisoner was in the room dressed in deep mourning. We supped there; in discourse at supper, the prisoner said she lived servant ten years in Hatton-garden, and went every night to lay out the supper.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - About half an hour. While Jones's wife was putting away the supper Jones shammed to be asleep.</p>
               <p>Was Jones's wife there? - There was a woman who passed for his wife. I stood up and the Prisoner came and stood by me, and unbuttoned both the buttons of my breeches, and took my purse out. I found my breeches unbuttoned, I buttoned them, and said, ma'am, what are you doing. I felt in my pocket and missed my purse. She immediately started down stairs, and I pursued her.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober at this time? - As sober as I am now, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>When you missed your purse did you say any thing? - As soon as I missed my purse she flew down stairs; I had no time to say any thing; I pursued her down stairs into a room; she made at my breeches again, and put the purse into my pocket and immediately ran out; the gold was in one end and the silver in the other. I found my gold was lightened. I followed her to the Magpie in Newgate-street. She slipped into that house; there is a glass door. I stopped half a minute or a second and looked through to see if she gave the money to any body. I thought perhaps she would give the money at the bar, or to some acquaintance. Not seeing her give it to any body, I went in and saw a good many russian kind of people; I knew nothing of the people or of the house; she called for two glasses of shrub, I drank one with her and she drank the other.</p>

               <p>How long did she stay there? - Not above two or three minutes, no longer than while we drank the stuff; when we came out again the watch was just set, it was ten o'clock. I met a watchman and charged him with her.</p>
               <p>Did you charge her at all with any thing while you were in the publick-house in Newgate-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did you not? - There were many kind of russian-men; I did not know whether they were my friends or no; I was afraid I might have my brains knocked out; I thought when I came out the watch would be set, and I would charge the watch with her. She was taken to the watch-house. She delivered a guinea to the high constable, and told him that was all she had about her. She was searched, and there was nothing more found upon her.</p>
               <p>She did not say that was your guinea? - No, she did not. I examined my purse in the watch-house, and found I had lost ten guineas, a half crown, and three shillings.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your purse before you went into this house? - Twenty-two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230030"/>guineas, eleven shillings and sixpence. I counted my money in the morning as I got out of bed.</p>
               <p>How often had you had your purse out during that day? - I had my purse out twice.</p>
               <p>You took it out to pay something? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you pay away some of it then? - Not of that money. I paid away one shilling and four-pence in the Borough. I paid two-pence at one publick-house; we went over to the King's-Bench, there I paid for a shilling's worth of punch and twopence.</p>
               <p>Was your purse tied up? - Yes, and the money was safe in it at the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Had you counted the money any time in the day after the morning? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know the money was all in the purse then? - Because I did not miss any. I was very sober. I never get drunk, and indeed I had a cold and could not drink. I drank but little of the liquor that was called for.</p>
               <p>How long was you in the house before Jones pretended to be asleep? - As soon as the supper was over.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you when she unbuttoned your breeches and took the purse - in what manner did she do it? - She pretended to give me a kiss. She gave me a good tug when she undid my breeches. The button hole of the pocket was broke; they were very roomy breeches, made two years ago when they wore them very large; macaroni breeches I believe they call them. She was not very softly about it; she almost pulled my breeches off. She was very impudent in doing it.</p>
               <p>When you went down stairs, you say, she came to you again? - Yes, in the same manner, to undo my breeches; and made a pretence to kiss me again, and said Hum, and put the purse into my pocket.</p>
               <p>You pursued her directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of her? - No; only while she turned into the room below stairs. I followed her into the room immediately; she had time enough to conceal the money.</p>
               <p>Was the purse tied or untied when she put it into your pocket again? - Untied.</p>
               <p>Did you know Jones before? - I had seen him at my brother's house at Marlborough; he is run away; I have never been able to hear of him since. I took up the other woman, she was discharged before the sitting alderman; I have not been able to find her since. When the prisoner was examined before the alderman, she denied ever being with me; she said I knocked her down in Newgate-street, and attempted to take her cloak away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told the alderman that I picked him up in the street, and took him home to supper. - It is all false.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A serjeant. I was employed on the recruiting service at this time. The twenty pounds was the the colonel's money.</p>
               <p>How much was left in the purse? - Twelve guineas and six shillings.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night; the prisoner was brought into the watch-house. I was going to search her; she said she had only a guinea, and produced it. We took her into a private room, and searched her, but found no more money upon her. She denied being along with Mr. Bailey; she said Bailey seised her in Newgate-street; that he catched her by the back part of her cloak and struck her, and used her very ill.</p>
               <p>Was you present when she was examined before the alderman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he give the same account he has now? - Yes, as far as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Whether he said he was taken by Jones to the prisoner's house, or that the prisoner picked him up in the street? - Exactly the same as he has described to you, my lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether he did not say he was robbed in a house in Fleet-lane or Field-lane? - Mr. Bailey was not certain to the street; he thought it must be Fleet-lane, but the next morning he found out the house.</p>

I would not; then he said I was the person who had robbed him; that he had been robbed in Fleet-lane, and he charged the watch with me. I told the constable in the watch-house that I had but a guinea.</p>

               <p>I live next door to Mr. Goodwin's. On the 18th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, the child came to the door and halloo'd over the counter, I am robbed. I saw the prisoner run by me, I ran directly after him to the bottom of Church-row, there he threw something down by Mr. King Thompson, what it was I do not know. I pursued him into Shoemaker-row; there was a barber's and piece-broker's shop both together; he ran into one of them, I did not know which. I looked through the window into the piece-broker's, and saw the prisoner buying some blue binding; he was leaning over the counter all of a twitter. I went in and laid hold of him by the collar, and said he had robbed a child just by; he said he had not. I brought him back, and King Thompson who picked up the watch brought it back to the house. As soon as I brought him back into the house, the child said that is the man that robbed me, he took my daddy's watch from me. As we had him in the coach going to his first examination he owned the fact.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man you pursued? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you in the coach when he acknowledged that? - Yes; along with the constable.</p>
               <p>Did you or the constable, or any body in the coach give him any reason to expect you would be favourable to him? - Yes; we said we would speak what we could for him; as we were working men we did not like to go on with the prosecution, because of the trouble of it; he thanked us for being so kind.</p>

               <p>I keep the sign of the Bell behind Aldgate Church. On the 18th of January, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran out and saw several people running. I ran as far as the end of the brick wall. I returned back, and picked up the watch. I then followed them into Shoemaker-row. I saw a heap of people with the prisoner. I asked what was the matter; they said he had stolen something, they did not know what. We went back with him to the house, and the child said he came in to buy a toy, and stole her daddy's watch. As we were taking him in a coach before the magistrate, he begged we would show mercy to him, and let him go to sea.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor. How old is your daughter? - Between seven and eight years. If you will ask her any soft questions, she will answer you very punctually.</p>

               <p>Thompson. The watch was thrown down opposite my house, about forty yards from the prosecutor's. The prisoner confessed it as we were going along, and begged we would get him off to go to sea.</p>
               <p>To Cannon. Where did you see this watch thrown down - how far from the prosecutor's house? - It might be a hundred or two hundred yards, or but fifty; I do not know the ground; I cannot particularly say.</p>
               <p>Thompson. Cannon laid hold of his coat and said, You villain, I saw you throw the watch down.</p>

I let the matter go till Saturday; I then took a remnant of cloth in the afternoon; I desired my servant to bring me a small trunk; the boy brought the small trunk into the compting-house. I put another remnant of cloth into the said trunk; I then sent the trunk with a remnant of cloth to the lodgings of the prisoner to his wife. I desired the boy to tell the wife of the prisoner, that Long the prisoner had sent her that piece of cloth in the said trunk. The boy came to me and said -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not mention what he said? - My motive for sending the remnant was, that I had the piece brought back again to me that was stolen. After I had obtained my property by that means, I sent for Long into the compting-house; I said sit down in the chair.</p>
               <p>What is Long? - My <rs id="t17800223-18-deflabel102" type="occupation">journeyman</rs>

I said, I have lost many things, locks, skins, and so forth, and if you will inform me where I can obtain them, we will settle the matter now. I did not say a word about the checque; he did not at that time know that I had got the piece of checque from his wife. He declared he had not robbed me of any skins, nor had he robbed me at all. I told him I would send for a constable if he did not confess, and he declared he never robbed me of any thing; that being done I ordered my servant who was in the compting-house to hand me the piece of checque up, that was behind a trunk in the said compting-house; this was the piece of checque that I had sent to his wife. I showed him that piece of checque, and asked him if he knew any thing of it. I told him it was brought into the house. He denied knowing any thing of that piece of checque, then I ordered the boy to hand me the piece of checque he had taken away the night before.</p>
               <p>What piece of check was the first you showed him? - The piece I sent to obtain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230033"/>the piece that was stolen. He knew nothing of that. The piece of checque I then showed him, he confessed he had stolen. I held it to him, and asked him if he knew any thing of it. He said Yes, that was the piece he had taken.</p>
               <p>Did he say when or how he took it? - That he took it on Friday evening from the shop. It was concealed behind some of the trunks.</p>
               <p>Where was the checque kept? - In a house of mine in Fenchurch-street; not my dwelling-house, but another house I have.</p>
               <p>Where was it taken from? - The house that I live in.</p>
               <p>Where from? - Out of a three pair of stairs room forward, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Was it in any drawer or box? - No; in no drawer or box. He took the checque to line a trunk; this is the remainder which came off, and that was the piece that was cut off of that said piece; he confessed taking it from the shop over the way. This time twelvemonth I lost sundry brass locks.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us any thing of that: What did he say about this piece of checque? - That he would pay us for it.</p>
               <p>What means did you take to induce him to confess this? - Holding it up in this manner (describing it.)</p>
               <p>What did you say to him - did you threaten him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him that you would do, if he did not confess? - That I would prosecute him if he did not confess upon the former matter; that was upon the locks and the things I had lost.</p>
               <p>I am talking about this checque - What did you tell him you would do to him if he did not confess about this checque? - I did not tell him I would do any thing but send for a constable. I held it up to him in this manner, and he confessed instantly.</p>
               <p>What threats did you make use of to induce him to confess he had stolen this piece of checque? - No threats at all.</p>
               <p>What promises did you make him to induce him to confess? - No promises at all respecting this piece of checque, only I said I would send for a constable, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Did he make any excuse for taking it? - None at all, only that he would pay for it.</p>
               <p>What is your boy's name you sent with this? -

On Tuesday night the prisoner and another person came into my house about half after eight in the evening; they sat about an hour, drank a couple of tankards of beer, and smoked a pipe of tobacco. The prisoner came to me and said he wanted some supper; I showed him the parlour. He said that would do very well. When the supper was ready I called them out of the great parlour and told them the supper was ready, and followed them with this tankard with the remaining beer in it.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - About a quarter or half an hour after nine; when I carried in the supper, I saw no more of them for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. I said to my man, these gentlemen must have done with the meat, and desired him to carry in the cheese, which he did. About a quarter of an hour after a person brought in the prisoner, and said to me, do you know this man? I told him that I did know him, for he had just had a supper carried into the little parlour. I opened the door of the parlour, the window was open, there was nobody in the room, and the tankard, the pepper castor, and the silver spoon were gone.</p>
               <p>When the man brought him in did you know him again? - Yes; I knew him immediately. The window which was fastened, was open, the window-shutters unbolted, the curtain undrawn, and the candle left alight.</p>
               <p>Are you sure when these men were left alone in the room, that the tankard, the pepper castor, and spoon were there? - Yes, I am certain of it; I carried in the tankard, and saw the pepper castor upon the table. He desired to go into the room; I went in with him, and he immediately began to pull the tankard out of his pocket; the lid made a noise; my boy took up his coat and said See! see! he is pulling the tankard out of his pocket; it was in his side-pocket. There was the mark where the beer had run down out of the tankard in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing? - No, I do not recollect he said any thing. After that I took him into the great parlour to several gentlemen who were there smoking, to show them how he had served me. There he was further searched, and I saw this pepper box taken from him; it is my property, my name is upon it.</p>
               <p>What might be the worth of these things? - Five or six shillings the pepper box, and four or five pounds the tankard. The spoon I have not got yet, that I believe his partner had.</p>
               <p>These men were left alone in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This man was not quite sober I suppose? - I declare upon my oath I did not see that he was the least disguised in liquor; he had been three or four times at my house, and had behaved very decent and genteel.</p>
               <p>Had he been in good company in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to have the other witnesses examined separate.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses were ordered to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Is the parlour in Newman-street, or Oxford-street? - The windows of the large<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230035"/>and little parlour both look into Newman-street.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday se'nnight as I was going from my work about ten o'clock at night, I saw two men jump out of the window of Mr. Abbott's house. I went directly to the window, and seeing nobody in the parlour I suspected there was a robbery. I desired my fellow-servant to follow me, and I directly pursued them into Berners-street.</p>
               <p>Did they both go the same way or separate? - Both the same way. I took the prisoner; the other was about ten or a dozen yards before him. I directly brought him back to Mr. Abbott's house, and asked him if he knew any thing of the prisoner; he said he had been there before and had had a supper there.</p>
               <p>Did you go in with him when he went into the little parlour? - Yes. Directly as he went in he sidled up to a chair, and dropped the tankard in the chair.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do it? - I saw the tankard drop from his clothes. After that we took him out of the little parlour into the great parlour; there I searched him; I took out of his hand a pepper-box, a pocketbook and some keys.</p>
               <p>Have you these things in court? - The pepper-box I have; the pocket-book and keys the beadle has.</p>
               <p>What sort of keys were they; a bunch of keys? - No, loose keys; one was a street door key with a hinge in the middle to shut it together.</p>

               <p>Were you with Wellington last Tuesday se'nnight in the evening going past Mr. Abbott's house? - Yes. Going past, about ten o'clock, we saw two men jump out of the window of the little room. My fellow-servant looked into the room, and seeing nobody, he said there was some mischief done. I followed him to Berners-street, there I collared the prisoner on one side, supposing he was the man who jumped out of the window.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man who jumped out of the window? - I cannot say, I lost sight of him; my fellow-servant was before me. We brought him back to Mr. Abbott's. When we brought him in, he was very desirous of going into the room; I said he should not go in till I saw Mr. Abbott. Then he went in; I stood at the door; I saw him with his hand shuffling in his pocket; I heard the tankard rattle, and immediately after I saw it on the chair.</p>
               <p>Did you see him further searched in the other room? - Yes, I saw him searched, and the pepper-box taken out of his hand.</p>

               <p>Was the glass cut out? - There was a jar in it; I had put a piece of putty to it; the putty was taken off and a piece of glass taken out.</p>
               <p>Did you see it done yourself? - No, I did not see it done. I missed the watch about six o'clock. There were three boys; I was sitting at tea with my wife; I heard the boys say d - n your eyes, now is the time, they are all in the kitchen; that is a room I have partitioned off the shop. I said to my wife, I will take the show-glasses in, there will be some of the glass broke and something stolen. I went immediately and took the show-glasses in which were on the other side; I went after I had taken the show-glasses in to the other side, where the watches were, to see if they were safe.</p>
               <p>Is it a corner shop? - Yes. I hung a watch upon the pin the other was stolen off, not knowing a watch had been stolen, and felt the wind come through the window.</p>
               <p>Then you missed the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it in the show-glass or in the window? - It was in the window in the inside of the shop, beside my work-board, within six or seven inches of the show-glasses. It is a kind of a bow window, I found the watch was gone, and immediately remembered whose watch it was.</p>

               <p>The woman was offering a watch to sell? - The duplicate of a watch. I went up to her and asked her what she had got to sell; she told me she had got a watch in pawn for half a guinea, and she wanted to sell it out; she wanted a little money to go to Billingsgate to buy her some fish. I went with her to the pawnbroker's, and looked at it. I gave her six shillings and left it in pawn for the half guinea.</p>
               <p>To Marshall. How much do you look upon this watch to be worth? - About seven or eight and twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>To Thompson. Did you know Griffin before? - I never saw her to my knowledge in my life before.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her how she came by it? - Yes; she said it was her brother's, that he gave her leave to sell it. I little thought it was a stolen watch while it was in pawn.</p>
               <p>Did not you make any enquiry of the pawnbroker if he knew the woman or how she came by it? - No, I made no further enquiries about it. The watch-maker and Farrel came to me and asked me if I had such a watch; I said I had; and went with them to Justice Sherwood's, and delivered up the watch.</p>
               <p>From Griffin. Did you pay me for the watch?</p>

               <p>You took him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the boy or his mother? - I know his mother, she used to deal in fish. The next day I went down to Thompson to Mr. Greaves's yard, and asked him about the watch; he delivered the watch to me, and I brought him in custody to Mr. Sherwood's.</p>

               <p>I was employed to load the cart with some goods to be carried from Mr. Palmer's in St. Martin's-lane, to Bow-Church-yard. I assisted the prisoner and Pass. Myers sent me for some brown paper. I saw him make up the parcel, and lay it on the compter; that was the last I saw of it. I did not know but some of the other porters had put it in the cart. When I unloaded the cart, I did not observe whether or no it was in the cart: there were some circumstances that led me to suspect the prisoner. I went after him, and on the Friday evening following I sent for him to a publick-house, the corner of St. Martin's-court, and asked him about the parcel. He gave me some ill language. I got a constable and had him taken up. When we were together I said, it was very hard for me, for my master charged me thirteen pounds for that parcel. He said, Well then, I will tell you where the parcel is; I have got it, and if you will go with me you shall have it. The constable went with him and I followed him to his lodging. When we came to his lodging, I asked his wife for the parcel. She fell a crying, and said she had taken it to a house by the New-Church in the Strand; if you will go with me I will go and fetch it. The constable and one of the justice's runners went with her and returned in about an hour to the publick-house with the parcel.</p>
               <p>Did you look at the parcel when they brought it? - Yes; the garters were in a bag, some of them were turned out upon the table before the justice. I believe them to be the same garters, I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>What was said to induce him to confess? - Nothing; only I said it was very hard for me to pay thirteen pounds. His apartment was below stairs, under ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he must make them good, and if I would deliver them up to him, he would be very friendly to me? - I did not.</p>

               <p>What was said to him before he confessed this? - I asked him whether he knew any thing of the parcel or not, and then he said directly, the parcel I will fetch you in five minutes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing said to induce him to confess? - Nothing at all. His wife fell a crying, and said, she had taken the parcel out of the house, and would go and fetch it.</p>
               <p>How did you know she was his wife? - They lived together as man and wife. I went with her to one Mr. Sharpe's, a stationer, by the New Church in the Strand. I stopped on the outside. The man who has the things went in with her. In the morning I told him if he knew any thing of the parcel, and would tell us, I would be a friend to him; he said then that he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Did you repeat that when he confessed in the publick-house? - No; it was four or five hours after I said I would be a friend to him that he confessed.</p>

               <p>To Woolley. Was this parcel one of the last things to be put in the cart? - It was very near the last.</p>
               <p>Was it a covered cart, or an open cart? - An open cart, a common town cart.</p>
               <p>Was it pretty full? - About as high as the sides of the cart. There were some chests of drawers, and a bed on the copse of the cart.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether the parcel was put in the cart? - I never saw it taken off the compter to be put into the cart.</p>
               <p>You published a hand-bill? - Yes (producing it). I and Pass went to deliver them all round the trade. Myers got them printed; they were brought to our house to be distributed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you read the bills before you distributed them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The bill says,</p>
               <p>"Lost or stolen out of a cart on Friday last, between St. Martin's-lane and Bow-Church-yard," &amp;c. Did you tell your master or Mr. Myers that the bill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230040"/>was wrong? - No. My master asked me if I followed the cart, I said yes. He said, was I sure it was in the cart; I said I did not see it in the cart at all.</p>
               <p>To Myers. Did you direct the printing of the hand-bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the parcel in St. Martin's-lane. It was very wet. I carried it home and put it out of the paper into the bag. I did not know whose they were.</p>
               <p>To Woolley. Did you follow the cart immediately? - No; I overtook it just as it came to Chandos-street.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday night the 11th of January, I was out. On Wednesday morning the 12th, I lost my pocket-book in a hackney-coach which set me down in Leadenhall-street. I did not miss it till some hours after. I had it in my hand in the coach; I meant to put it into my pocket. I suppose I put it past my pocket. I missed it looking for a knife that was in it, and had it advertised.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - After twelve when the coach set me down. There was a gentleman in the coach with me who went further, and whom I left in the coach. That gentleman was a stranger to me; he had been in company where I had been; his name is Wilson; I do not know his Christian name, nor who, nor what he was, only I fell in company with him where I was.</p>

            's men. On the 25th of January the prosecutrix's uncle came to the office about this pocket-book and bank-note. Upon some information given by them, I went to Mills's house, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230043"/>was not at home. I found him in a stable-yard where he is employed. I asked him about it, he went with great readiness to his lodging. He showed a readiness to give every information he could respecting this book. I asked for the book, he and his wife said, they had not got it. He said he was sorry for what had been done, and wished his wife had taken her brother's advice, and carried the book back again after they had seen the advertisement. (The note was changed before.) The prisoner said he found the book in the coach. The prisoner's wife told the young man where to go; he went and fetched it. The prisoner said that was the book he found in the coach. He seemed very willing to give every information about it. I did not hear him say whether he knew who the book belonged to or not.</p>
               <p>(The pocket-book was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The Bank-note was in the book when I lost it. It was in the book at twelve o'clock in the day. I had not seen it afterwards. The book had been left by me upon the table where I was. I cannot tell how long it had lain there; it was given to me in the coach.</p>

               <p>What were the coals worth? - They were fairly worth seven shillings and threepence. At first the three servants would not tell where they had disposed of the coals; upon which I said if you will not tell I shall compel you to it. When I had paid them their wages I asked what the account was. I had heard the coals had been taken out, then it was they confessed they had taken them.</p>

               <p>Was her master present when you found it? - Yes. I found three chair covers in Mrs. Harvey's lodging.</p>
               <p>Harvey. I had the chair covers from the prisoner to pawn, but had not pawned them.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. You was present when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230045"/>Halliburton found the window curtain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What room was it in? - The prisoner's room; it belonged to the opposite room.</p>
               <p>Was it up? - No; lying in the room.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My master promised to pardon me if I restored the things, upon my word, and not to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Was it the confession the prisoner made that led you to the discovery of the things pawned with Whitlock, and the things you found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you found any of the things before the promise? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of the things but in consequence of that promise? - No; except the curtain.</p>
               <p>Did you make the promise before you sent for the constable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where the curtain was? - She lifted up the bed to show us where the curtain was, but said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is likely that the curtain would have been found if she had not so done? - No.</p>

She brought a young girl up stairs with her; the young woman who was in bed with me said to the girl she brought up with her, Susannah, will you light the fire? She said Yes, I will. The young woman who was in bed with me then turned round to me and we fell asleep and slept about ten minutes. When we waked we missed the things off the table; we laid them on the table when we undressed ourselves.</p>

               <p>I belong to the Rotation-Office in Litchfield-street. I was sent for to the pawnbroker's, the corner of Hanway-yard, last Monday week, about six o'clock at night. I found the things on the compter, and the prisoner in the box. I asked her if she owned the things, she said yes. I searched her, and found two keys and a handkerchief upon her. I asked her whose handkerchief that was; she said her own. As I was taking her to the office, I asked her how she came by the things; she said she had them from a young man who was to give her a shilling to pawn them. I asked her where he lived, she said she did not know. I asked her what trade he was; she said a watch-chaser; then she said he was a watch-engraver, and then she said he was a shoe-maker. She said he was a tall man in a great coat, buttoned up; that he was at a publick-house. I went with her to the publick-house, and desired her to show me the man; she said what signified her going in, perhaps he might not be there.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230047"/>I went in and enquired, but could not find any such person. She never acknowledged where she had the things.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. When you came out of the room at two o'clock, did you lock the door after you? - No; I left Belcher in the room.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor lodges along with me. Last Monday week I was in his room, at two o'clock. I staid no longer than while I ate my dinner. There was nobody there but myself. When I came out, I locked the door. When he went up at four o'clock he came and told me the door was broke open. When the prisoner was taken, she gave two false accounts of her lodging.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>To Belcher. Do you know any thing of her? - No.</p>
               <p>Are there any other lodgers in your house? - Yes. It is a lodging-house; the rooms are let out.</p>

               <p>A young man gave me the things to pawn, and said he would give me a shilling for my trouble. He said they were his own; that it was no harm to pawn them. I went to pawn them, and the pawnbroker stopped me, and sent for one of the runners. When I went back to the publick-house, I suppose he saw the runner with me, and made off. I never could find him since. I know nothing of the things.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Twyne. On the 25th of January, about twelve o'clock at night or a little after, I was going to light a gentleman to bed; I heard a foot go up before me; I looked into the two pair-of-stairs room and saw the prisoner sitting in a chair just by the window, with her hands before her, and the things mentioned in the indictment were taken off the bed. I had a candle in my hand, and the gentleman I was lighting to bed was behind me. I went into the room and asked her how she came there; she said a gentleman sent her up there, that he was a tall thin man in brown clothes, with a toupee; that he bid her go up stairs and stay till morning, and he would let her out; that she was sitting on the stairs, but when she heard me coming up stairs, she went up and sat down in the room.</p>
               <p>When had you been in the room before? - I made the bed that day, and put the things to rights. The other servants had been in the room to turn the bed down about ten o'clock. They are not here. The sheets were wrapped up on the bed, and the night-cap, pillow-case, and the towel were on the ground by the side of the bed. The bed was unmade, the sheets were on the bed, the pillow-case on the pillow when I made the bed. I imagine she was coming down with them, but on hearing me coming up stairs, returned into the room, and threw them on the bed. I asked her what she was doing with the things; she made me no answer.</p>

The things were as she has described them. When she was asked about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230048"/>the things she made no answer. She said she was sent up there by a gentleman.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to support me but singing of ballads. I came up to town to buy some ballads. I went to this house. I thought I could get a cast there in the morning to Hounslow for sixpence. A gentleman was making water at the door; he told me he would make me a handsome present if I would sleep with him all night, and bid me go up to this room. I went and sat on the stairs; I thought I heard him coming up, and went and sat down in the room.</p>
               <p>To Aston. What were the things worth that were taken off the bed? - Seven or eight shillings.</p>

On the 7th of this month, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went down in the yard for a pail of water; I lodge up three pair of stairs; I stopped a little at the first pair of stairs; going up to my lodging I heard a noise up stairs, and I met the prisoner coming down. I asked her who she wanted; she said a mantua-maker. I asked her the mantua-maker's name; she said Mrs. Wood. I asked her what she wanted with Mrs. Wood; she said she had got a gown of her's. I said no such person lived in the house, nor in the neighbourhood, that I knew of; then she drew from under her cloak in her hand a dirty towel. I suspected it was mine; at the second look I found it was not mine. Seeing she had a great bundle in a checque apron, I asked her to let me look what she had got in her apron, she willingly let me, and I saw in her apron the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

She wanted me to take the things; when I would not, she said she would do for me; she called up this woman, and then sent for her husband, who sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Did you leave it with her? - No. I left my clothes and my watch in the other room, and in the morning when I went to put on my clothes, I found my watch and some silver which I had in my pocket, were gone.</p>

               <p>I was going along King-street, Covent-Garden; the prosecutor followed me and asked me if I would go and drink any thing. He treated me with a glass of brandy. He went home with me, and he asked me if I chose any thing more to drink; we had a pot of gin hot; he gave me a shilling to fetch it. He said, I have got no money about me, but if you will take my watch till the morning, I will come and redeem it. He was gone four hours, then he brought a constable; the constable asked me if I had got the watch. I said I had; that he left it with me for sleeping with me all night. The prosecutor said, give me my watch, I will give you five shillings. I said no, that was not the agreement, that he promised to give me half a guinea, and if he would give me that I would give him his watch. I offered to give it him if he would give me the half guinea.</p>

               <p>I was told that there was a constable wanting in Russel-street, that a woman had stolen a gentleman's watch. I went, and found Mr. Walker bringing the prisoner along. I assisted to bring her into the office. In the office I asked if she had been searched; they said no. I said, you have done wrong not to search her before now; she has certainly disposed of the watch by this time. I searched her; there was nothing in the right-hand pocket; with great difficulty I got hold of the left-hand pocket, and pulled the pocket off before I could get my hand into it, she resisted so much; there I found this watch. She denied having the watch till I found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman who stands there was not the man who brought me before the justice. He said, will you give me the watch? I said I had it in my pocket but would not deliver it without the gentleman delivered me the half guinea he agreed for; then he took it by force out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that true? - Halliburton. It is not; no such thing passed; she denied having the watch.</p>

               <p>You followed the men? - Yes, I did; I never saw their faces, nor they mine; they turned short, and ran quick at me and knocked me down. When I was down I saw one behind and the other before me; I was apprehensive they were going to cut my throat; I halloo'd out; there was a sentry near; the men might imagine the sentry would be alarmed, they snatched my hat and cloak immediately and away they ran.</p>
               <p>Do you know who those two men were? - No: I never swore to their persons. As I was going to my own home, in Peter-street, at the bottom of Strutton-ground, I saw two <rs id="t17800223-33-viclabel186" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

I directly followed Burrows into the pawnbroker's shop; supposing them to be the men who had robbed me. As he was showing the cloak to the pawnbroker, I snatched it out of his hand, said it was mine, and asked him where he got it? He said it was his wife's.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230051"/>I said, I believed he was the villain who had knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Was it your cloak? - Yes; it was the same cloak that had been snatched off my back. Burrows said it was so, he would take me where I might have my hat and all.</p>
               <p>At first he said it was his wife's cloak? - Yes; I said, I must know how his wife came by that cloak; then he said, as it had happened so, if I would be at peace he would take we where my hat was.</p>
               <p>Was the other prisoner in his company? - They were both together; when he found Burrows was detained in the pawnbroker's shop he went home to his lodgings; I detained Burrows till the constable was sent for; I had a great scuffle with him in the pawnbroker's shop; when I insisted upon its being my cloak, he violently seised my arm, but I would not let him go upon any account; we kept him till the constable came; then we took him before Justice Jordain in Petty France; the other prisoner Burden was then brought before the Justice; they both there confessed that they were the men who committed the fact.</p>
               <p>Did you say that you would not prosecute them, or give them any hopes of favour? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was any menance made use of to induce them to confess? - No: there was not; it was all voluntary.</p>

               <p>Was that house broke open at any time; - Some people entered into it in the night of the 28th of last month; they entered the house through a garret window; the window was only raised up I believe.</p>
               <p>How late in the evening did you see that window? - I cannot say that I saw it in the evening at all; they came in through an empty house adjoining, and so along the gutter which leads from the leads of the empty house to this garret-window; they broke open several locks of drawers and trunks.</p>
               <p>No part of the house was broke open, only the window was open? - Not that I could see; I discovered it about one in the morning; I was then going to bed. I saw the things taken out of the trunk that belonged to Mr. Guion, and the trunk opened, therefore I knew somebody had been there. On looking farther, I found the other trunks were opened.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing that was in the room before that was then missing? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing of your own? - Yes; some things that were my wife's; a gold watch, and a brilliant diamond hoop ring, and two silver thimbles, as she informs me, I know she had such things, but I cannot say that they were there.</p>

               <p>I belong to Sir John Fielding's office. On the 29th in the morning some of us had an order to go to Andrew's house, concerning another fact. As we were going along Worship-street, at the top of Moorfields, we met the two prisoners, they were walking 30 or 40 yards before us. I saw Andrews give the other a nudge with his elbow for him to make off, upon which Palmer turned out of the footway into the coach-road; I turned out after him and stopped him, and from under Palmer's arm I took this bundle.</p>
               <p>Did Andrews say any thing to him when he touched his elbow? - Not that I heard. Jealous came up and searched Palmer; these things were found upon him. (Some shirts and stockings, and a linen waistcoat were produced in court).</p>
               <p>Guion. These are mine; they are marked with my name.</p>
               <p>To Morant. Who was with you when you took the prisoners? - Jealous, Macmanus, and three more; we found nothing upon Andrews; we took him directly home to his own house, he kept the Rose, a public house in Rose-lane, Spittalfields; in Andrew's bed room, in a chair covered over with a blanket, we found some more linen, which Mr. Jealous has got.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came by them? - He said Palmer left them there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Whether I did not tell him I knew nothing of them; but that I would call my wife and ask her how they came there? - Yes, his wife was called.</p>
               <p>What account did she give when she was called? - That they were left there by Palmer.</p>
               <p>Did you find the watch chain? - No, Jealous found that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You met these people in Worship-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Rose-lane? - Pretty near a mile, I believe.</p>
               <p>You was going to Andrew's house, and met them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Palmer you say went into the middle of the street? - Yes, after the other gave him a nudge.</p>
               <p>He did not turn back, did he? - No.</p>
               <p>He was coming towards you? - No; his face was towards us, he was rather going off.</p>
               <p>And these things you found on him were like those you found in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know were Palmer lived? - Palmer, they told us, lodged in Andrew's house; he told us he had left his own house.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your own knowledge whether at that time he lived in Andrew's house or not? - No; only what Andrew's wife said.</p>
               <p>Was that in Palmer's presence? - No.</p>

            . I was along with Morant in Worship-street at the time he stopped Palmer and Andrews; after he had taken that bundle from under Palmer's arm, I then found in Palmer's pocket a chissel and a loaded pistol; in another of his pockets I found a bunch of picklock keys and a tinder box, a steel and flint; in another pocket I found a woman's watch chain. (They were all produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Eleanor Furlong. This is mine.</p>
               <p>Are you certain it is your's? - I am. These same trinkets were to the watch when I saw it that day.</p>
               <p>Did you search Andrews? - Morant searched him, but did not find any thing at all upon him.</p>
               <p>Jealous. I went along with Andrews into his room up stairs; in his own bed room I found these things (produced them). Here is as nearly half as possibly can be; even the ruffles were divided.</p>
               <p>Are they the same quantity of shirts as were found in Palmer's bundle? - There were four shirts, which are the number as were in Palmer's bundle, and there were the same number of ruffles and stocks found upon the chair under a blanket. I asked Andrews how he came by them; he said they did not belong to him, but desired I would call his wife up stairs; she came up. He asked her who had left them there; she said one Palmer left them there.</p>
               <p>(Four shirts, three stocks, and ruffles, and five pair of silk stockings were produced in court and deposed to by Guion.)</p>
               <p>To Morant. What were the stockings which were in Palmer's bundle? - There were no stockings at all in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Jealous. There were four pair taken out of Palmer's pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did not Andrews tell you when you asked him about these things, that they not only were not his, but that he knew nothing about them? - He said he had not seen the man for the space of twenty minutes in his life time.</p>
               <p>He desired you to call up his wife, and said he knew nothing about them? - Yes, he desired his wife to be sent for up.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether Palmer and Andrews were acquainted? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Andrews. Palmer and I have been acquainted a great many years.</p>
               <p>You say you found them in Andrews's bedroom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was only one bed in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is Andrews a married man? - I always took him to be such.</p>
               <p>Had you ever known any thing of Palmer before that time? - I always took him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find any pistol or any picklock upon Andrews? - Nothing at all upon him; all was upon Palmer.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you say that Andrews told you he had not known him twenty minutes? - Yes; that he had seen him but a very little while before. I do not believe I should have taken Palmer into custody if it had not been for seeing him with Andrews. I had known Palmer before.</p>
               <p>What was his character? - I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>

            's people in the morning of the 29th. We saw the two prisoners coming along; Andrews winked to Palmer to go out of the way; Palmer went into the coach-way. We immediately laid hold of them, and in searching found this dark lantern, some trinkets, and four pair of silk stockings in Palmer's pocket. Jealous came and took hold of Palmer, and Morant and I went on to Andrews's house; when we came there Andrews's wife was in the bar. We went in and searched the bar particularly. Andrews wanted to go up stairs; I said you shall not stir from this place till I go along with you; well, said he, then come up. He stopped a quarter of an hour longer than that I believe, then he said, are you ready to go up stairs now? I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230055"/>said, yes. We went up. On entering the room we found a bundle of loose linen in a chair with a blanket thrown over it, and I believe a woman's petticoat. The first thing I looked at was a shirt. I said, Jealous, here is the same mark on this as those shirts in Palmer's bundle have on them. We found the rest had the same mark. We took Andrews. He begged us to go the back way out of his house, which we did, and then took him to Bow-street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you in company with Andrews on Friday night? - Yes, I had been in company with him down Holborn. I happened to call in at the Red-Cow for a pint of beer, there I saw Andrews. We staid and drank there till between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening did you go to this Red-Cow? - Between five and six o'clock, it was just at dusk.</p>
               <p>Did you go home with Andrews? - We came out of the house and called a coach off the stand. We got pretty much in liquor. I said I cannot very well walk, because I have a cough upon me, and it was pretty much of a fog, so I said let us have a coach; we did, and went home to his house.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when you got to his house? - About half after ten o'clock, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>He was never out of your company, from between 5 and 6 till he went home to bed, was he? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any body else in company with you drinking? - No, not to stay any time, there was another man came in and drank, and asked him how he did; for he had been at Smithfield in the afternoon, about some business I understood.</p>
               <p>Did he and you go together to the Red-Cow? - No; I called in there for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. He came in after you. - I did not see him the instant I went in, therefore I suppose he came in after.</p>

               <p>How came you to notice the time that it was between nine and ten o'clock? - Just as we came out of the Red-Cow, I heard the watchman go half past nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>On what day of the month was this? - It is a month ago next Friday, I believe.</p>
               <p>Do you know when he was taken up? - No. I did not hear any thing of his being taken up till a fortnight after, and more.</p>
               <p>Can you say now what Friday it was? - The 28th day of the month, I think it was.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was the 28th day of the month? - I cannot say particularly, it was three weeks ago last Friday.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - I think it is.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of it? - I cannot be certain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230057"/>farther than I think it was three weeks last Friday, but did not take any particular marks of the day.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot undertake to swear, whether it was the 28th of January or not, only that it was on a Friday? - Yes, it was on a Friday.</p>
               <p>How far is the Red Cow from Andrews's house? - The Red Cow is in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>How far is that from his house? - Better than a mile I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the watchman cry the hour ten that night? - I did not take particular notice of that; I heard him go past nine, or half after nine, soon after we came out of the Red Cow.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner to Hitch. Is that the man that came home with your master on the Friday night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your master went to bed immediately upon his coming home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And did not go out at all that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Hayward. He did not go out, for we had a pint of half-and-half to drink, and then he was lighted to bed.</p>

               <p>I went to Smithfield, after I had sold my goods off, to sell my horse; that was on Friday. I met Mr. Andrews in Smithfield; he went in with me to a public house; we had some brandy and water after I had sold the horse; coming along, that was between 7 and 8 o'clock, we shook hands with each other; I went towards Cow-Cross. I came strait home. Mr. Silvester was with me; he went with me to my home; I shook hands with Mr. Andrews, and bid him good night. The next morning, being about to take a publick-house, and Andrews owing me a little money, I went up to his house to ask him for it; he said, he could not just at that time let me have any, but if I would wait till his wife got up he would endeavour to get some. I waited till she came down stairs, between seven and eight o'clock; he said, stop, I will go with you; he went up stairs and brought down a bundle; he said, if you will go with me, I will get you some money; he put these things into my hand, and bid me go along and he would follow me. The handkerchief was old, it tore, these things sell out; I said, how can you put such a bundle into my hands? He said, take care of them; carry them a little farther and I will take them of you; I am going to carry them to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230058"/>person they belong to. If they had searched Andrews, at the time they searched me, they must have found the property that belonged to these other things.</p>

               <p>I lived in the same room with the prisoner, and slept with her. I lost four pair of stockings on this day was a week. I brought in ten pair to mend; I put six pair in a basket.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230059"/>I went out about two o'clock and came home again in the evening. I owed her half a crown; I gave her a shilling, and told her when I carried home the stockings I would give her some more. I left her in the room and the stockings in the basket when I went out. I came home about five o'clock, and in about half an hour I missed the stockings. I asked the the prisoner about them; she began to laugh at me. I said pray, ma'am, give me my stockings. I was almost mad because I knew she had not a good character. At last she produced a pawnbroker's ticket for two pair, which she had pawned for two shillings. There were five pair missing. I found four pair; she would not tell me where the other pair was. She said they are safe enough. She was in liquor. She ran away, and I followed her three times, and prayed her to give me my stockings. Two pair were pawned, and the constable found two pair in her pocket.</p>

The prosecutrix said she owed her eighteen-pence.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of February the prisoner had two of my children to take care of. I went there about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the prosecutrix went out? - I was in the fore room when the prosecutrix went out. The prisoner told me the prosecutrix was gone to pawn some stockings to get out two neckcloths she had pawned of her's. When the prosecutrix returned and knocked at the door I opened it. She gave me a neckcloth and desired me to give it to the prisoner. She went out again directly without coming into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing when she gave you the neckcloth? - Not a word. After she was gone the prisoner gave me two pair of stockings to pawn, to get out the other neckcloth, because the prosecutrix had brought but one, and she said she could not carry home her linen without it. I said she had better go herself. She said she had lent the prosecutrix her hat and cloak, and could not go out without them. I went and pawned them in her name for two shillings, and gave her the money and a duplicate of them. Then the prisoner borrowed a hat and cloak of the woman of the house; she went out and brought in a neckcloth, ironed them both, and went home with the linen. When she returned she said she had not taken the money for the linen. I went home directly.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix. Had you pawned two neckcloths for the prisoner? - Yes; she gave them me to pawn for her, which I did, and gave her the money.</p>
               <p>Did you bring one of these neckcloths home that afternoon? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What did you pawn in order to redeem that? - Nothing; I had a shilling; I went and brought it home.</p>
               <p>Why did not you bring them both home? - They were not mine; I did not pawn them for myself. I had no more money; I promised to bring her own home.</p>
               <p>How came you to go and redeem that neckcloth with your own money if you pawned it for her? - It was pawned in my name.</p>

               <p>Did you buy the stay-hook at the same time? - Yes. I gave three guineas for the necklace, and three shillings and sixpence for the stay-hook. I went into a house in Rosemary-lane, as I went home, where the prisoner was; it is a private house; the woman of the house was an acquaintance of mine. There was a cat in the house; I asked her if she could spare her for me; she said yes, if I would give something for her; I gave her a shilling. She bid me tie it up in a handkerchief. She asked me where I had been; I said to buy some gold beads.</p>
               <p>You took them out I suppose to shew her your bargain? - Yes. The prisoner took them and tried them on her neck, and said she liked them very well. I took them and put them in my pocket again. They were wrapped up in a piece of brown paper, and the stay-hook with them. I tied the cat up in the handkerchief, and the prisoner carried her home for me. When I came home she let the cat out on the floor. It being two o'clock I asked her to eat some thing; she consented, and went up stairs. I keep a lodging-house myself. When she came down she sat down by me, and thanked me for her dinner. She whispered to me, and I felt her hand by my side about my pocket, but I did not suspect any thing.</p>
               <p>Did she see which pocket you put them in? - Yes. She went out directly. When she had been gone about an hour I felt in my pocket, and missed the necklace and stay-hook. I sent after her to the woman's house where I had seen her, but could not hear of her. I was so ill I could not go myself. On the 20th the woman of the house where I was came to me and said. -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not say what she said. Did you find your necklace again? - Yes, at a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of the prisoner afterwards? - Not till she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was you present when she was examined? - Yes. She said she did not take if out of my pocket, but she picked it off the floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether she ever saw me before she saw me at the house where she got the cat?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether she did not tell her men lodgers (there were about fourteen in the house) whether she did not tell me to tell the people, if they asked me how long she had known me, that she had known me seven years. She said the reason she would tell them so was, as I was a likely young woman, and some of her lodgers had a good deal of money, they might make me a present of something?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not.</p>

               <p>I am servant to a pawnbroker. On the 19th of January I believe, about nine or ten in the morning. The prisoner offered to pawn a necklace with me; it was on an execution day. She said she wanted the money to spend at the execution, and that it was her own. I had known her four or five months. She was a customer to the shop. I looked upon her to be a girl of the town. They are the sort of women who wear these necklaces. I lent her a guinea upon it.</p>
               <p>What name did she pawn it in? -

               <p>What may the necklace be worth? - I bought the necklace of the prisoner in the afternoon of the same day for one pound six shillings, that was the weight of the gold.</p>
               <p>Was you present at her examination? - Yes. She said then she found it in Mrs. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise or threat made use of to induce her to confess? - None that I know of. I had sold the necklace before I knew any thing of it. I bought it on the Wednesday, and sold it on the Friday morning.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough. I took up the prisoner, and told her she had made a foolish step, for we had found out where she had sold the stay-hook. She said she sold it for a shilling and a quartern of gin at the Black-Horse. She said she found them beside Mrs. Smith, in her house.</p>

               <p>When I had been up stairs and had some dinner, I came down; Mrs. Smith was in the back parlour with about eighteen or nineteen outlandish men. One of them got up. She said if I had a mind to sleep in her house I might. I went out, and one of the men followed me, and put the necklace and stay-hook into my hand. I said what was that for? He said to lie with me. I said, I did not choose it. Her maid is witness to it.</p>

               <p>How long before had you seen the ring? - About six weeks ago. I had not occasion often to open the place where it was; it was a brilliant diamond ring; one stone in the middle and two on each side. It was a family ring. It was my mother's.

               <p>I live at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>You carried this ring to Mr. Parker to ask the value of it on the Wednesday? - I went with it to ask him whether it was gold or not; I did not want to know the value of it.</p>
               <p>Where did you get the ring? - I went to Knightsbridge to see my father and mother on the Wednesday. As I came back, the prisoner, who is my sister, came a little way with me, and pulled a ring out of her pocket, and said she found it. I said I believed it was of no great value; we would go into some shop and ask the value of it. I went into Mr. Parker's shop to ask the value of it, and he stopped me. She stood on the outside.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell Mr. Parker you had it of another person? - Because it rather frightened me. I did not know what to think of it at first. When he stopped the ring, I came out and said, Molly, where did you get this ring? She said she found it under a chest. I said, why did not you ask somebody the value of it? She said, she did not think it was of much value.</p>
               <p>All the story you told Mr. Parker was invented at the time? - Yes. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>What became of her after she found the ring was stopped? - She went home.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Parker. What is the value of that ring? - About two or three guineas.</p>
               <p>(The ring was deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They have valued it at more in the indictment than I think they should. It is a very old-fashioned ring.</p>
               <p>The cabinet was usually kept locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of it having been broke open? - None.</p>
               <p>Had you left it open at any time? - I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found it. I did not know that it was of any value. I kept it in my pocket several weeks. When my sister came I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230063"/>it her to enquire whether it was of any value or not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I always found her extremely honest in money matters. I left my purse with a guinea and half a crown in it on the table, and she brought it me very honestly.</p>

             came into Mr. Lee's shop with another woman and asked to look at some silver shoe-buckles. I took out a drawer of shoe-buckles and showed them; they said there were none of those that would do. I took out another drawer and showed them. While they were looking at the second drawer, Potten and Spencer came into the shop and enquired for some gold wires for ear-rings; I desired them to wait till the other women were served; they said they were in a hurry.

             went beside them, and said as they were in a hurry, they would wait while I showed them the gold wires. I saw one of the two drawers I had left in the glass-case moved, and some buckles gone, and I missed the buckles. Smith and the other woman who came in first said, there were none that would do, and they went out of the shop. I went after them and took hold of Smith by the cloak, and desired them to come back. Spencer and Potten were in the shop; I desired them to stop likewise. As soon as Smith came into the shop one silver buckle dropped down between her and the other two prisoners, on the floor, and one catched by the chase in the apron of Spencer. Smith was close to Spencer when she came in. I missed three buckles; the other was not found.</p>
               <p>The other woman did not come back? - No; I did not suspect her.</p>
               <p>(The buckles were produced in court and deposed to by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Taylor. I charged the prisoner Smith with taking the buckles. She said she knew nothing at all of them, and expressed her surprise at my charging her with any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you charge the others? - No, I desired them, as they were in the shop, to stop.</p>
               <p>Did Smith and the woman who came in with her seem to have any acquaintance with the women who came in afterwards? - Not in the least that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did Spencer and Potten submit to be searched? - Not till they came before the justice. There was nothing of Mr. Lee's property found upon them.</p>
               <p>Was Smith searched? - Yes. There was nothing of Mr. Lee's found upon her.</p>
               <p>From Smith. Did not I desire you to search me when I was first brought back into the shop.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Might not the buckles drop out of the drawer without any body taking them out? - It was impossible; the drawer was shut close in, and the top of the glass-case down.</p>
               <p>One of the buckles was quite lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And one of the women went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Smith. The woman I went in with had nursed me two years ago; I met her, and she asked me to go with her to buy a pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230065"/>of silver buckles. We went in and looked at the buckles; he asked twenty shillings for them; she said they were for another woman and she would tell her.</p>

I searched Smith; she had no money. I asked her how she was to buy silver buckles without any money? She said she did not go in to buy, only to ask the price. Potten and Spencer had only a shilling between them. I asked them how they were to buy gold ear-rings, when they had no money; they made the same answer, that they did not go in to buy, only to ask the price.</p>

               <p>I lost a pair of sheets in September last. The prisoner was a lodger in my house; she went away about Christmas. I missed them about six weeks ago. When she went away she left the key on the bulk of the stairs. We found it about a week after. When we went into the room we missed an iron pot. The sheets were taken out of the next room to her's. </p>
               <p>How came you not to miss them sooner? - Because some people lived in the room; they went away about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>What is become of those people? - Upon my word I do not know. After they were gone I missed the sheets out of their room. I found a pawnbroker's duplicate in the room they were taken from. I went to the pawnbroker's and found them; the prisoner owned to her taking of them.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am the person who was convicted for shooting at that man, almost five years ago. I received his majesty's clemency for fourteen years transportation. I had not been in the country long before they compelled me to take up arms against my king and country. I took the first opportunity of deserting from their service and going over to the king's troops; I surrendered myself to Lord Cornwallis, and took the benefit of the proclamation which offered a free pardon, and leave to return to their own country, to all persons who would come over to the king's troops. I was innocent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230068"/>of the crime for which I was tried. George Hartley, who was convicted about two years ago, declared and took his sacrament upon it, that he was the man who shot at this man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner produced a certificate under the hand of General Pigot of his having deserted from the American forces and taken the benefit of the proclamation.</p>

I then went into the room adjoining to this on the ground-floor, and there lay my clothes, some on the bed and some on the floor. I suspected the thief had got in at the back part of the house.

            . They both denied it with a great deal of fortitude. When I saw the clothes were all safe, I said to my wife, we have certainly lost the money; she said no, nobody could get that because it was on the top of a cupboard, close to the cieling, nobody could get their hand in, without it was flat. The money was in a purse. I had been robbed about two years before, and had put it there for safety. It was in the room where I lay. My wife counted it in the morning. She went to look, and it was gone indeed. I asked my maid if she had not a sister; she said she had two, that they lived in the New Buildings, by the side of the Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Do you know that she had a sister? - The prisoner is my maid's sister. I went to the constable of St. Sepulchre; he went with me and a watchman to the house; we knocked at the door; the sister looked out and asked what was the matter; I said her sister was in hold and wanted to speak to her; she hesitated a little and spoke to somebody; she called Mary, and then came down and opened the door. I asked her if she had not another sister there; she said she had another sister who came there sometimes, but she was not there then. The constable said let us go up stairs; we went up, and the prisoner was in the garret dressing herself very slowly. The constable took hold of her pocket and asked her if she knew what money she had in her pocket; she said a shilling or two and some half-pence, and half a crown. The constable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230070"/>searched her and found about eleven shillings or eleven and six-pence in silver. We took her to St. Sepulchre's watch-house. She behaved with all the insolence possible; she said the constable tickled her, and she would not be searched. The constable felt some money in her hair but somehow it was conveyed away.</p>
               <p>What did she say about the money? - She said it was not in her hair; she said she knew nothing of it, though her sister told her to her face that she had taken it away.</p>
               <p>Was it ever found upon her? - I never found any of it.</p>

               <p>This is not all you know of this matter, there is one thing more, you know she was taken before a magistrate and discharged? - She was. The magistrate took more cognizance of my maid, who said the prisoner was a week seducing her to do it.</p>
               <p>Who searched her? - Mr. Roberts and Mr. Jones.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I went with Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Perdue to the prisoner's lodging, on the 2d of January, between one and two in the morning; the sister denied the prisoner being in the house. I went up stairs and found her; I searched her and found upon her eleven shillings and some half-pence. She said her sister had sent her of an errand on Saturday night, and the change belonged to her.</p>
               <p>Was she questioned about Mr. Carpenter's money? - Yes, she made no answer to it.</p>
               <p>Did you find any money any where upon her besides the eleven shillings and the half-pence? - I searched as far as I could with decency. My brother officer thought he felt some money in her hair.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>You must not tell us what he said. Did you find any? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The indictment is not laid capital, I think she ought to have some punishment.</p>

            , my apprentice, on the 1st of April. I mark my work I. L. There are no others in the trade that use that mark, as I found upon enquiry at the Hall. I wrote a letter of advice and inclosed a bill of parcels on the came day. The things were sent on the 1st of April, but the coach did not go till the next day.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular directions from Mr. Eden to send them by that coach? - We usually send by that coach unless he orders them to be sent by the waggon.</p>
               <p>Who was to be the loser if the things were lost? - I suppose Mr. Eden would be the principal sufferer.</p>

               <p>"No. 10 value 12 l. carriage paid, 3 s." It lies in the warehouse till the coach goes off; when the coach is going off they are called over by the coachman to see that they answer to the book; they did answer right to the book that night. When they are called over, the porter carries them from the warehouse to the coach. The prisoner was porter to the house at that time.</p>
               <p>And officiated as porter that night? - He did.</p>
               <p>Do you remember receiving that box from Nevill? - I do not remember receiving it from him, I remember the box; I put it in the cupboard where we keep the Liverpool goods. I was present when they were called over, but did not checque them off, Misterset did, the porter is to take care of the warehouse, and deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason for remembering that the prisoner was there on that particular night? - There is a person in court can give a better account of that.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner porter there that night? - He was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember who the porter was that night? - I remember very well the prisoner was there, in the room of Powell who is the regular porter, that was the last night of our slow work when we go out at ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he porter some time before that? - Yes.</p>


               <p>A week or more? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you called over the parcels do you remember calling over this particular box? - Yes; we have a strong travelling box where we put our small boxes into, that locks up, this was too large to go into that. I called it over twice; it went through my hands three times I believe.</p>
               <p>Who do you deliver them to when you have called them over? - It is my business to load the coach; the porter brings out the things to me to load the coach.</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether this box was, or not, delivered to you? - I cannot say whether I did load it or not, there were many articles that night, I believe thirty-seven or thirty-eight. I had a candle to load the coach by, if it had been day-light I might have observed better.</p>
               <p>Can you say this box was not delivered to you when you loaded the coach? - I cannot say whether I loaded it or not.</p>
               <p>As you saw this box, and took particular notice of it before, and tried to put it into the box, for which it was too large, should you not have taken notice if you had not loaded it, and enquired for it? - We load so many things; we do not take notice after we have called them over; I never had a complaint before; I have driven the coach many years; I did not think any thing was missing.</p>
               <p>You drove to St. Alban's; do not you deliver a number of parcels between here and St. Alban's? - No; I never take up any parcels for that short space; I have never delivered any since I drove the coach.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to remember that no parcels were delivered before you came to St. Alban's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you come to St. Alban's, and have delivered the bill of the parcels, you have nothing more to do with the coach? - I have done with it.</p>
               <p>You cannot say then whether any thing is taken out there? - I can safely say there was nothing taken out; I generally stand by the coach till it sets out again.</p>

               <p>I see there are several other boxes, besides No. 10, that are not marked off? - Perhaps there is B put against them, which means they are in the strong box.</p>
               <p>Some with the B are marked off, some not; what is the reason of that? - Perhaps they were to be left at Wellington, they have the key of the box at Wellington; I never mark off the things in the strong box, I cannot come at them.</p>

               <p>I am a watchmaker at Leeds, some time in the month of July, the prisoner came to my shop, and said he had got some watch-cases to sell. I said, they are things not common to sell, how came you by them? He said, he came to London with some cloth to sell, and took these watch-cases in payment for his cloth.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Yes; I knew him before, but had not seen him for years. I asked him what he would take for them? He said 18 s. a pair. I said, I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230074"/>they were not worth so much. I weighed them, and bid him a price for them.</p>
               <p>Did you buy any? - Yes, eighteen pair.</p>
               <p>What did you give for them? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark upon them? - Nothing but what is common.</p>
               <p>Have you them here? - I have some of them; I had sold several before I heard any thing of this; I have none but what have been out of my possession. I desired him to leave them two or three days, and I would enquire his character. I enquired his character and then bought them of him. When I first knew him he lived at Hartford, about six miles from Leeds; he lived servant with a gentleman; his father was a cloth-maker; I believe the prisoner at first was apprentice to a cloth-maker.</p>
               <p>Did he deal in cloth? - I heard he did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>He sold them publickly in your shop? - Yes; in the middle of the day; there were several people in the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Was 18 s. a pair above or under the value of these cases? - I think it was more than they were worth.</p>
               <p>You did not take notice of any particular marks which distinguished these cases from any other cases? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>These have been out of your possession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where had you the two cases from, which you produce now? - From Coventry; I sent them there to have movements put into them.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with certainty to these being the cases you sent there, and bought of this man? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>To Lathwaite. Did you make these cases? - Yes; these are my marking.</p>
               <p>You have sold a vast number besides those you sent to Liverpool? - Yes; vast numbers; we never lost a box before.</p>

I found upon him a pair of watch cases; as soon as we had apprehended him, the two gentlemen who came down after him, Mr. Denham and Mr. Heley, accused him of stealing the box, at the Swan with two Necks, in Lad-lane; he denied it at first, upon a letter being produced from Mr. Radford at Leeds, giving an account how he had sold eighteen pair of watch cases to him, he seemed in a fright, and owned he had sold the watch cases to Mr. Radford; he was so much frightened he could hardly speak, he then said he had one pair by him.</p>

               <p>To Mr. Denham. How soon did you receive advice from Liverpool, that this box was not received? - On the 8th of April the advice was dated the 6th. The coach is two days coming to town.</p>

               <p>Was it not known to the porters? - I do not know that. We do not make these things known to the porters. I thought the box was sent, and they might have made some mistake on the road.</p>

               <p>Do you mean there was no furniture or goods in any part of the house? - Yes; there was, but not up stairs. We then went down into the cellar; there we found a large press fixed with two dies in it, and a cutting out press near it.</p>
               <p>What was the large press for? - Making half-pence. There was one half-penny between the dies. The other was for cutting out of blanks. I then came up stairs and asked the young woman below who the house belonged to; she said she was nothing but a servant and did not know. We found a vast quantity of blanks; and I think there are fourteen pair of dies besides the pair out of the fly. We also found a vast quantity of copper which is here.

               <p>Is that the letter? - It is. I shewed it to Mr. Prothero; he desired I would go immediately with the city constable to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230076"/>Crown in Lad-lane. I went there, and found Pickering and Corn both sitting together. We took them to the house where the tools were found. I asked Corn if that was his lodging; he said it was not.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to Pickering? - I did not; Mr. Phillips was with him. I searched Corn, but found nothing upon him. I did not search the other.</p>

            's officers? - I am. I went with Jealous to Holford-court. When I got in at the window, I saw a woman sitting in the room; I opened the passage door to let the rest of the officers in; then I ran up stairs. The information was, that they coined silver as well as half-pence, and generally coined the silver up stairs, that caused me to run up stairs first. I found all the rooms up stairs empty; there was not any furniture in them. Then I ran down stairs again and went into the cellar, there I found a great press with a large fly.</p>
               <p>Is thathere? - It is in a cart in the yard, it is too heavy to be brought into court. There were two dies in it. These cuttings lay near the press.</p>
               <p>These are what they call secil? - They are. Here are a vast quantity of blanks which lay by the press; there are a great many more in the box. These were put in a sieve. There is a hole made in the ground to sit down to feed the die with them. There was a cutting out press. These two dies (producing them) I took out of the press; and I have some half-pence, which I believe were struck with these (producing a large box full) there are some for farthings and some for half-pence.</p>
               <p>All the implements were there that are necessary to complete this process of coining? - Yes, sawdust and oily sacks. They put them into sacks with dust, and oil them, and then they shake them backwards and forwards to clean them.</p>
               <p>The other press is bigger than this, is it not? - It is ten times as big as this. Jealous told me he had found a letter which was addressed to Pickering and Corn at an alehouse in Lad-lane. I bid him take Phillips, a city constable, and go there, and secure them, and bring them to the house. They went and found them there. They found two half-pence amongst some others upon Pickering, which half-pence tally with these dies.</p>

               <p>The house wherein the press was found, belonged to me. I let it to Pickering at Christmas last. While it was empty there was a bill stuck up at the end of the court signifying that there was a house to let; he offered himself to me as a tenant. I asked him his trade; he said he was a fancy weaver. I asked him who he was known to; he said to a neighbour of mine, Mr. Spratlin, a haberdasher. I went to Mr. Spratlin, who said he had purchased goods of Pickering in his business. In consequence of that I received him as a tenant. He continued my tenant till the time he was taken up.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I live next door but one. I heard the cry of stop thief. I went out to see what was the matter; they gave me charge of the prisoner. I took the prisoner in one hand, and the trunk in the other; these are the straps which were cut away (producing them).</p>
               <p>To Thorpe. Are you sure the trunk was fixed to the post chaise? - Yes; and very fast. I felt it as soon as I came to the door.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of January I lost a handkerchief and 3 s. 6 d. in monies out of a drawer in the room where I sleep.</p>
               <p>At what time? - Between eleven and twelve at night. I was called down by my landlady, when I went up again they were gone. I took my cloak out of the drawer just before I went down; and then I saw the handkerchief and money. I left no one but the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - A <rs id="t17800223-53-deflabel294" type="occupation">hair-dresser</rs>

               <p>How long did you stay down stairs? - About a quarter of an hour; when I came up he was gone.</p>
               <p>Is your room up one pair of stairs or two? - Two pair of stairs forward.</p>
               <p>What room was you in below stairs? - In the fore room of the next house; when I returned I went to the closet to see if he was there, I thought he might be there out of fun. When I found he was not there, I immediately looked in the drawer and missed the handkerchief and money.</p>
               <p>How came you to go and look immediately in the drawer? - Because he had served me so before, this is not the first time of his serving me so.</p>
               <p>Were these other things in the same drawer? - Some caps; there was nothing but what was trifling. I went after him, and found him at a night house in Covent Garden, and the property was found upon him, in his great coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was your own handkerchief? - Yes; there was

             upon the corner of it at full length, in Indian characters; it was my cousin's, who is gone to sea. I did not want to hurt the prisoner, he was willing to give it me back again, and make it up.</p>
               <p>Did he acknowledge the handkerchief was your's? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>The money was like other money, you could not swear to that? - I could not say any thing to the money.</p>

               <p>Where did he pick you up? - In James-street.</p>

               <p>He went home with you at that time of the night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left him in the room though you knew he had robbed you before? - I locked the street door when I went out.</p>
               <p>You expected to have him there all night? - He might have stayed all night if he would.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell this gentleman you was going to meet some of your friends, the constables of St. Giles's? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came back from the next door he was gone, and you found him at the night-house, where you had met with him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And though you charged him with the robbery, he would not give up this handkerchief, he would keep it for your sake? - He would not give it up.</p>
               <p>It was past eleven o'clock when you met with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he came up stairs you desired him, I suppose, to pull his hat and great coat off, and sit down, did not you, and bid him go to bed, when you went out? - I said there was a bed, he might go to bed if he would.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he went away to the night house, because you mentioned going to the constables of St. Giles's to drink with them? - He said he thought I was gone for some constables.</p>
               <p>He thought you was gone to get the constables to press him, do not you do such things? - No.</p>
               <p>You never heard of any such thing in your way? - I do not.</p>
               <p>You know there is money to be got that way? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You get your money then in the fair trade? How did he get out if you locked the door after you? - He said somebody let him out; I did not leave any body in the house but him, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether there was any one else in the house at that time? - I do not know whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. When you came to this house, and said he had a handkerchief, and he said he had not, I believe you pointed to the great coat, and bid the constable look there? - No, I did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; on the 25th of January while I was at the watch-house a watchman told me there was a man in the night-house in James-Street, who had robbed a woman of a handkerchief. I went to the night-house; I saw the prisoner there; I brought him to the watch-house; I desired him to turn his pockets inside out, to see if a handkerchief was concealed in his pockets; he pulled out two handkerchiefs which were in his under coat pocket, and said he had no other. I observed a bulk in the right-hand side of his great coat pocket, I insisted on searching it, and he then pulled out this handkerchief (producing it) which answered to the descrlption the prosecutrix had given of it; he said he did not know how that handkerchief came into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Did he seem surprised when he found that handkerchief? - I think he was surprised; the handkerchief is very remarkable, for there is the name Stubbs stamped on the handkerchief; he said he did not know there were pockets in the great coat, that he had borrowed it of a gentleman that night.</p>
               <p>Did the young woman claim the handkerchief when she saw it? - Yes, immediately; he still persisted in being innocent of taking it, or knowing that it was in his pocket; she also accused him of taking 3 s. 6 d. in monies. I desired him to turn the money out of his pocket, which he readily did, there was about 9 s. 2 d. he accounted for that by saying he had changed half a guinea to pay for some purl that he and his serjeant had drank together, and that was the remainder of the change.</p>
               <p>Who first told you the man was at the night-house and had stolen the handkerchief?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230080"/>- One Gibson, a watchman, in James-Street; the girl had given him the information.</p>
               <p>Did you see the girl before you went into the night-house? - I saw the girl in the passage of the night-house; she said there was a man who had robbed her of a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did she give you any directions where to search for this handkerchief? - Not the least in the world upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Had you any intimation from any one where to search for this handkerchief? - not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prosecutrix? - About nine or ten months.</p>
               <p>What business does she follow? - I looked upon her to be a girl of the town.</p>
               <p>She is a notorious street-walker? - Most certainly she is.</p>
               <p>You have known her follow the business ten months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know she has lived in Short's Gardens these ten months? - I hardly knew where she lived; they said she lived in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>When you came to the night-house she was waiting at the door for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Who first gave you an intimation where the handkerchief was? - Nobody, I first observed the bulk; she said perhaps he had thrown the handkerchief away; he seemed quite surprised when he found the handkerchief; he seemed to have a deal of innocency about him, for that reason I locked up the girl.</p>
               <p>Did he know before you came to the night-house that any body was coming for him? - I believe not by his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of your sight before he got to the watch-house? - No, never, I told him at the watch-house it might become a serious matter, and if he had played any trick with the girl's handkerchief, he had better give it her again; as we went to the watch-house I held him by the left arm.</p>
               <p>Might not he have put his right hand into his pocket and thrown the handkerchief away as he went to the watch-house? - He might; he had all the appearance of innocence as much as I ever saw in a man in my life, except the handkerchief being found upon him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The constable asked me what handkerchiefs I had about me? I told him two and no more. I pulled one out of one pocket, and the other out of the other, and then sat down again; He said had I no other pockets? I said I had no waistcoat pockets, and I never put a handkerchief in my breeches pocket. She said you have forgot to search your great coat pockets, I said I did not know that I had any great coat pockets; that I had borrowed the coat of a gentleman. I felt in the pocket and found this handkerchief there; I said it was not mine, I did not know whose it was.</p>

               <p>- READ sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchmaker in Little Britain; I have known the prisoner from a child, I know him to be as honest a man as ever lived. As soon as I heard he was in trouble, I bailed him; I would have trusted him with any sum of money; he is a hair-dresser, he waits upon gentlemen at Ealing, Acton. and round about the country; I believe he is as honest as any man I ever knew.</p>

Then immediately another gun went off, that gun was pointed rather upwards; I stood in such a surprise, I did not know how to contain myself. I have been drowning and catching for life, and I never was so frightened before. I said, What are you? Who are you? One Mr.

I believe I said I would take them into custody, they were fit to serve the king. They said they had a right to fire their guns, and they would do as they liked, they bid the law defiance, and bid me defiance. I said to Kelly, I charge you to aid and assist in the king's name, for I would have taken them all to gaol that night. The women cried out, Do not take them! do not take them! They persuaded me not, because they knew them; as Bower was going along, he still abused me; afterwards I went to the bench of justices.</p>
               <p>(On his cross examination he said, he was a constable, that he was perfectly sober; that it was so dark that the person who fired the gun could not have seen him; that he saw the gun pointed towards him by the flash before he removed the gun from his shoulder; that there was another man with the prisoner, but the prisoner did not know which of them it was that fired towards him; that he waited to make a charge against the prisoner 'till a bench of justices sat, when he attended, and was bound over to prosecute them.)</p>

I saw the second gun; Mr. Brooks said you shall go to the cage or are fit to serve the king. I went over the rail to Mr. Bower, and said Mr. Bower you are a man that pretends to know yourself very well, I am surprised you should fire a gun at this unseasonable time of night, on purpose to frighten us; he said, is not this a proper place to fire a gun? No; said I, I do not think it is a proper place just by a nobleman's window, and in the footpath by the king's highway. Bower said, you are all very red indeed. Mr. Brooks was in a sad passion, he charged us to aid and assist in the king's name, and he would have them in the cage. I saw the gun which was fired second up at Bower's shoulder. I saw by the flash it was pointed in the air.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of this bundle which was lost at your house? - Yes. Mr. Stevenson came in with a bundle and laid it down on the table in the back parlour. He sat down in company with the prisoner and another man who was with him; the prisoner and the other man went out; Stevenson missed his bundle. He said to me Mather do you know any thing of my bundle? I said, there had been none in the room but the prisoner, and the other man. I went out after the prisoner, and took him in Holborn with the bundle. I brought him back to the house, and delivered him to a constable; before the justice he said he kicked the bundle before him in the passage.</p>
               <p>You are sure you found the bundle upon him? - Yes; he had it in his left hand, the other man was with him; he said he did not know that he had the bundle till I took hold of it.</p>
               <p>(The coat and handkerchief were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This coat is my property; I am sure it was made on my shop-board.</p>
               <p>Is the handkerchief your's? - I bought it.</p>

               <p>Is that the bundle you laid on the table in Mather's house? - This is the bundle.</p>
               <p>PRISONER DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Though I am before a court of judicature, I hope I have a jury which will look in an impartial manner on every thing; I went into the publick-house to have a pint of beer; meeting with some agreeable company, especially the prosecutor, I stayed the whole evening. I then was going away; a man who was there asked me where I was going. I went out with him; as I was going along he asked me to hold the bundle while he made water; as I was holding it, the publican came up, and the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>To Mather . Did they both come in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you took the prisoner, did the other man run away? - No; he came back to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did the prisoner appear to be drunk or sober when he was in the house? - He might be intoxicated, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>To Mather. Did he appear to be drunk or sober? - He could not be sober; he had been there four or five hours.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character</p>
