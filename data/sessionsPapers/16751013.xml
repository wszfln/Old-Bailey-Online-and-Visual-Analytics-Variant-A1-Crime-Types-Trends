               <p>THe pleasures of sin are but for a season; and after some numbers of years spent in lewd and dissolute Courses, the time of Reckoning comes, and the secure sinner is call'd to an unthought-of account for his past Crimes; How quick and sudden then, though sad and gloomy, are the periods and dispatches of that poor life, that must terminate in a deserv'd punishment! To the end therefore that the Looser sort of people may beware by the dreadful Examples of these that have already deservedly suffer'd, let them take this following account of their Confessions in Newgate.</p>

He desires his Friends to see her and bid her be careful of the Infant, and to betake her self to some honest Labour, wherein she would finde more comfort than in those ways to which the Trade seduced him. Of the latter, we can onely say, that he continued with that seeming repentance which was most suitable for a dying Man.</p>

That he had been a very great scoffer at the miscarriages of other men, and too much Guilty of that huffing pride and insolency, which is too common among men of their Condition, he exhorted therefore and those that had the same Imployment to take warning by him, not to exceed the bounds of Mercy, nor to stand upon the utmost points of Rigour and Justice but above all to beware of being false to their trusts and of extortion, by which he had undone many poor people.</p>
