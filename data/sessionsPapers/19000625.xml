I am a stage carriage driver, of 98, Horton Street, Kensington—I have known the prisoner since last year—she came to us on April 10th on a visit—she brought some pawn-tickets—she stayed two days, and on the second day when she was going away she pulled the tickets out of her pocket, and as the dates were drawing to a close for the last year's interest, said, "As you have been a great friend to me you can have the tickets. I cannot afford to get them out myself. I would rather you had them than anybody else, so do as you like with them"—in consequence, I went with my wife to pay the interest on this ticket for jewellery—we went to Mr. Ayres, of Hammersmith that night, and I paid £1 8s. 3d. for the last year's interest; that was on the same day that the tickets were given to me—I received a new ticket dated April 10th—I saw the jewellery on the counter and left it there—it had been pawned for £6 10s.—I kept the ticket; it was numbered 151—some time after that my</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 532, South Park Road—on May 27th, about 11p.m., I was waiting for a 'bus opposite London Bridge Station—I had just taken a penny out of my purse to pay my 'bus fare—there was 34s. and a small photograph of myself in my purse—I put it back into my pocket, and felt a hand at my back, and I saw a man jump on to another 'bus—I ran after it, and stopped it, and had the man brought down—it was the prisoner—I said, "You have got my purse; will you give it me? Never mind the contents; I am only a working girl"—he said, "I am only a working man; will you take a sovereign?"—he had a white band on his hat—there was another fellow with him, and he offered me his card, which I would not accept.</p>

I was station sergeant at Edgware on January 5th—at 1.30 a.m. the prosecutor came to the station—he was covered with blood—his shirt was a complete mass, and there were wounds on his face and head—he fainted directly he got into the station, after telling me what had occurred—I sent for a doctor, and then went to the barn, when I saw Smith, the prisoner, and three other men—Smith appeared to be awake, the others asleep—I woke the prisoner up, and said to Smith, "What is up here?"—he said, "The accused has assaulted my mate; he has been Knocking my mate about"—I said, "What did the others do for him?"—the prisoner replied, "Oh! they did not touch him, only me.

I am Divisional Surgeon at Edgware—I was called to the Edgware Police-station on the early morning of June 5th—I examined the prosecutor—I found him suffering from a severe cut on the cheek, one on the top of his head, and a fractured rib—I dressed the wounds, and ordered his removal to the workhouse infirmary—the wounds would probably be caused by a stick, and the fractured rib by being kneeled on—the wound on the cheek was caused by this stick, the other would have caused more bruising—the rib was recently fractured.</p>

You have killed my sister"—he said, "I know what I have done, and I don't care if I die for it"—my husband also went to my sister—it was not light enough to see where she was injured, but someone lit a match, and then I saw blood running from her throat—some people came up and assisted us, and she was taken to King's College Hospital, where she remained till May 22nd, when she died—I saw her from time to time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased—she lived with me up to last Easter—she left on the Saturday following Easter Monday, when she went to the Temple Bar Restaurant—before that she had been employed at Edwards and Skinner's, on Holborn Viaduct—she had been there just on five years—she had been keeping company with the prisoner five or six years—I heard that they were supposed to be married on the coming Bank Holiday—up to Easter Monday they were apparently on good terms—I knew she was in the habit of writing to him, and he to her—on Easter Monday I did not see the prisoner all day, because I was at work in the morning, and they went out—he was supposed to call for her—she came home about 12 p.m.—on Easter Tuesday the prisoner came to my place to ask for Edie—I noticed his face was scratched—I said, "Oh, Alf, whatever is the matter with your face?"—he smiled, and said, "I have been in a bit of a bother at the brewery, and one of the chaps has scratched my face"—I said, "What a funny thing for him to scratch your face!"—nothing more was said—my daughter was not at home when he called—when he heard that she was out I think he said he would call back—I told my daughter that he had been—I cannot remember whether he ever came to the house again after that—if he did, it must have been when I was out, as I never saw him—I do not think I ever saw my daughter and the prisoner together after the Easter Monday—I know his handwriting, and also my daughter's—I took the dress my daughter had been wearing on this Sunday night from the hospital, and I took a letter and a handkerchief from the pocket—I think this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I gave it to Inspector Cutbush—I afterwards went to the Temple Bar Restaurant, and brought away her boxes—at the request of the police, I looked in them for any letters—I found these three letters (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—this one is in my daughter's writing, and the other two in the prisoner's—they wrote to each other pretty often—they paid money into a bank—my daughter kept the bankbook—I do not know where it is—I could find it perhaps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My daughter had been in her new situation a fort<lb/>night before this happened—I believe their banking account was in the Post Office Savings Bank—the money was drawn out, I do not know when or by whom—my daughter was a member of a clothes club in her other situation, to which she would have to subscribe—I cannot say whether the prisoner helped her at all in her subscriptions—there were things bought for a home which was to come into existence on August Bank holiday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brewer and manager of the Westminster brewery—the prisoner was employed there for some time as a labourer—at Easter he wrote me a letter resigning his post, and subsequently a Mr. Eade called one day when I was out, with regard to the prisoner's cha<lb/>racter—he left a note saying he would call again, but he sent a telegram enclosing a prepaid reply—the telegram to me was "Is Highfield's character satisfactory?"—I replied, "Highfield is honest and can work"—I intended that to be a good reference, but, by a mistake of the telegraph clerk, "honest" was transferred into "lowest"—I suppose it read, "High<lb/>field lowest, but can work," but I have not seen the telegram—I can mostcertainly give the prisoner a good character; his father has been in our employment 25 or 26 years; his people are of great respectability.</p>

I am the landlord of 22, Russia Lane—the prisoner has lodged with me five years and a-half—between 4 and 5 a.m. on Sunday, May 27th, I was roused by a knocking, and a voice shouted, "I have done it; come upstairs"—I got out of bed and went upstairs—I saw the prisoner's son, Alfred, bleeding slightly from a wound in his throat—I gave the boy in charge of my wife, who placed him in our bed and</p>

Upper Clapton—I am employed in the City as an office boy—on Thursday, May 10th, about 2.30 p.m., near the Royal Exchange, the prisoner, who was a stranger, said to me, 'Will you do me a favour, and I will give you sixpence"—I said I would, and he told me to go to the London and Westminster Bank in Lothbury to get a book of 500 cheques and to bring it back to where he said he would wait, outside the Royal Exchange—he gave me a letter to take—(<hi rend="italic">This was an order for 500 cheques on a memorandum form, purporting to be signed by W.

T.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On May 10th, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner detained at the Minories Police-station—he had been brought there by a constable—I told him he would be charged with forging and uttering a request, and obtaining a cheque-book of 500 cheques from the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury, purporting to be signed by W. T. Restell, 29, Mark Lane—he said, "I am no thief. I was in a restaurant, No. 2, Pearl Street, where I went to have my supper, and while there I saw Troubman, who keeps the restaurant, and a man named Muscovitz, talking together; Muscovitz called me on one side and asked me if I would do a job for him to-morrow, and he would give me 5s.; I said 'Yes'; he told me to be there next morning. I was there, and Muscovitz gave me a letter and said, 'This man (whom he pointed to, whom I had seen in their company before) will go with you, and you are to get a boy to go into a place which will be pointed out to you, and you are to give the boy sixpence, and he will bring something out, and you are to take it from the boy and give it to him; he will give you 5s. for yourself, and 6d. for the boy.'

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Inspector</hi>). There were two or three re<lb/>mands of this case at the Police-court—on May 25th I received a com<lb/>munication that the prisoner wanted to see me, and went and saw him in the cells—he said he wanted to make a full statement, so that the Magistrate should know all about the case—I cautioned him that what<lb/>ever he said I should take down in writing, and it might be used in evidence against him—I then took this statement down in writing as he said it, and he signed it after I had read it to him: "I am a working man, have been nine years in London; have worked six years at Schneider's cap factory, Whitechapel. Muscovitz spoke to me on the night before I was arrested, after I had left work. He said, 'I want to speak to you to-morrow morning.' He then gave me 1s., and told me to meet him in Hanbury Street next morning, 'as I want you to do me a favour, to take</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190006250042"/>
               <p>a letter to the bank, and I will give you 5s.' I said, 'I am afraid I shall get the sack if I stop away from work.' He said, 'Tell your governor that you are not well.' I met him on Thursday morning shortly before 10 o'clock in Hanbury Street, and went with him to the Post-office in Whitechapel Road and bought a post-card. He (Muscovitz) waited outside He then said, 'Meet me again at 2 p.m. at the coffee-shop in Hanbury Street'; but he sent another man to meet me there, and this man spoke to me and said, 'What are you waiting for?' I said, 'Mr. Muscovitz.' He said, 'Muscovitz cannot come to you, but you come with me.' I went with him to the Royal Exchange. We never spoke on the way there. He then pointed out a bank to me, and said at the time, handing me a letter, 'This is the letter Muscovitz wanted you to take to the bank.' I said to this man, 'What have I got to do with this?' He said, 'Get a boy and give him 6d., and tell him to go to the bank with this letter and ask for a cheque-book.' I then found a boy, and sent him to the bank at the bottom of the street. I waited some time, but missed the boy. I wanted the other man to meet the boy and get the cheque-book when he came out of the bank, but he would not. About half an hour afterwards I met the boy. At this time the other man was following me. I did not recognise the boy at first, but said to him, 'Did not I speak to you a short time ago?' The boy said, 'Yes.' I said, 'What have you done with that letter?' He said, 'I took it to the bank and got the cheque-book, but when I came out I could not see you, so I took it to Mr. Restell's and left it there.' I then spoke to the other man who was with me, and told him what the boy had done, after which I wanted him to go with the boy, but he would not. He (the man) then told me to go with the boy and get the book. I went with the boy, and this man followed behind. The boy went and got the book, and when he was coming up to me I was arrested, and the other man went away. When a✗rrested I said I was innocent, and say so now. I do not know this man, although I have seen him at Troubman's restaurant and talking to Troubman and Muscovitz, On Wednesday morning Troubman gave me a cheque for £2 to get changed at his bank, the London and Provincial Bank, Spitalfields, which I did, and gave the money to Troubman. A man named Elias Weinstein wrote out this, and Troubman signed it. I saw this done."</p>

Muscovite, April 19th, 1900, Troubman, No. 90408, the counterfoil being in the book I found on him when I partially searched him showing simply the amount, £20—about 5 p.m. he was taken from Old Jewry to Moor Lane Police-station and charged with being concerned with other men not in custody in forging and uttering an order or request on March 16th for a cheque-book of Barclay's Bank, pur<lb/>porting to be signed by Mr. Sayer; also with forging and uttering a cheque for £484 9s. 6d. on March 17th, purporting to be signed by John L. Sayer—in answer to the charge he said, "I have committed no forgery"—a week after Muscovitz was brought in, the Gladstone bag and a light dust coat were shown to him—he said, "They belong to me, and I left them at Troubman's"—the things were given up to him, and he wore some of them.</p>

Joseph on May 12th—(<hi rend="italic">Read: Stating that the Postmaster-General accepted their tender for condemned string and canvas during the year 1900, and that the remainder of the tender was declined with thanks.</hi>)—the name "A. Joseph" is the name signed on the form of tender—at the beginning of every month I have a written report from the assistant storekeeper, stating how much string or canvas there is to be disposed of—I then write informing the contractors for a cheque to the value of the string, in accordance with the terms of their contract—I send the contract to the Accountant-General's office and ask for the quantity of string that the contractors are entitled to—it is presented by them to the storekeeper and the matter passes out of my hands—the condemned string and painted</p>

               <p>canvas is kept in what is known as the bag-room—no other Post Office stores pass through the same room, to my knowledge—I do not know any<lb/>thing about the bag duties; that is a separate room downstairs.</p>

I believe Newham has been in the Post Office about 10 years—I have not made any inquiry with regard to his mode of living—I think his wages were 24s. a week—the bags are sorted in the basement, which is somewhat imperfectly lighted, and some<lb/>times very much overcrowded; it was overcrowded in April last—new bags were packed at Kennington—I do not know if bags of the same sort and string of the same sort that were packed at the Central Post Office were packed at Kennington.</p>

I have nothing to do with the prac<lb/>tical working of the rooms: that is the duty of the storekeeper or his assistant—my business is in connection with the clerical work—the con<lb/>tractors pay for the goods before they take them away, and must take whatever they get—they are not allowed to raise any question as to the quality—there is a clause in the contract to that effect—whatever is given to the people that the contractors send they must take away, but any complaints would be attended to—if there was anything in the com<lb/>plaint the Department would treat the contractor in a reasonable way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, G</hi>). I kept observation at the Postal Stores at Mount Pleasant on Thursday and Friday, April 19th and 20th—on the afternoon of the 19th I saw a van leave the Postal Stores—a man named Selby was driving—a man named Albert Dear as well as Burford was on the van—I followed it to Messrs. Joseph's premises at Earl Street, Southwark—I handed over the duty of observation to Girdle—on the 20th I followed a van in the same way from the Postal Stores; Burford was there, Slade was driving, and Musbrook was also on the van—I handed over the observation to Girdle—in the evening of the same day I went to Messrs. Joseph's warehouse in Ontario Street with Sergeant Divall, Inspector Godley, and Detective Walker from the Post Office—I saw Mr. Morris Joseph, and at my request he accompanied me to the Ontario Street entrance, where Burford was unloading a van—I said to Burford, "Here, Burford, I want you"—he came up to Mr. Joseph and myself—I said, addressing both of them, "We are inspectors of police"—Mr. Morris Joseph said "Where do you come from!"—I produced my warrant card and said, "I am Inspector Morgan, of King's Cross and this is Inspector Godley from the Southwark District, and this is Inspector Walker from the General Post Office. Now listen to me. We have seen some Post Office bags delivered here this afternoon from the Mount Pleasant stores at Clerkenwell, and from information we have received, we have reason to believe that bags of old string bought by you from the Post Office authorities are believed to contain canvas"—Mr. Morris Joseph said, "I do not know what you are referring to; I buy canvas and string from the Post Office at Mount Pleasant, but I do not go for it, and I do not know what has been brought here"—there were 11 old Post Office bags piled one on another about two yards from the Ontario Street warehouse—they were by themselves, and full—addressing both of them, I said, "I want those bags opened"—Mr. Joseph directed Burford to open them, which he did by ripping them open—before he opened them I saw there was a slit on one side of each bag, and string was protruding—all that could be observed was old string—all the 11 were opened in my presence, Morris Joseph standing by—they all con<lb/>tained old string and canvas, but the largest proportion of canvas—I</p>

               <p>said, "How do you account for this?"—Mr. Morris Joseph said, "I did not go to Mount Pleasant for it; I have not seen it until now, and I know nothing about it"—Burford made no reply—addressing both of them, I said, "Now, I want to go to the stable adjoining the warehouse in Earl Street, as I have reason to believe that I shall find more bags there"—Mr. Joseph and Burford accompanied me, and I was followed by Godley and Walker—upon entering the old stable, I found 24 full old Post Office bags piled one on another—they were about the centre of the stable by themselves—there were only a few bags of rags in the stable besides—addressing both of them, I said, "I want those bags opened"—Mr. Morris Joseph directed Burford to open them, which he did, as he had the others, in a similar way—each bag was packed as the others were, with old string and canvas, and had string protruding; the largest proportion was of canvas—as the bags were being opened Mr. Morris Joseph said, "I have something else to do"—I said, "This is a serious matter which affects both of you, and I must insist on your stopping"—he again wanted to leave—I said, "No, you must stop"—we then returned to Ontario-Street, leaving Girdle to look after the bags—I said to Mr. Morris Joseph, "Now I want you to show us your books relating to the purchase and sale of canvas"—he said, "Wait until I consult my partners to-morrow"—I said, "So far as we know your partners are your brothers"—he said, "I must consult my partners"—I then asked him to give us the name of any person to whom he had sold or from whom he had bought Post Office canvas other than painted canvas"—he said, "I cannot until I have consulted my partners to-morrow"—I said, "Well, you are a responsible tradesman and a large Government contractor, and, with the exception of allowing us to go through your warehouse without opposition, you have not rendered us any assistance, or given us any information"—he said, "I hope you will not think or say that"—I said, "You have not rendered us any assistance, and it will now rest with the Post Office authorities as to what action they may take against you," and to Burford I said, "As for you, Burford, you will now be taken into custody, and charged with being concerned, with others, in stealing this canvas from the Post Office stores"—he made no answer—next day I went to the bag store-room, at the Postal Stores, Mount Pleasant, about 11.30 a.m.—I was accompanied by Mr. Curtiss, Mr. Aldridge, Mr. Skinner, and Mr. Walker, all belonging to the Post-Office—I saw Newham and a man named Barnsley, a witness in the case—I told them that we had two men in custody for stealing canvas—we arrested Slade as well, but he was discharged by the Magistrate—I said to them, "I want you to show us where Messrs. Joseph's vans were loaded from on the last three days, the 18th, 19th and 20th"—they both pointed to a large stack of Post Office bags at one corner of the store-room, and said, "They loaded from there"—I said, "I want some of those bags cut open"—they cut open 20 or 30—some of them were taken from the top pile, and some from another part—they all contained old string and no canvas at all—I invited them to cut open any bag, but none of them contained canvas—I said to Barnsley, "Were you here when Messrs. Joseph's van was loaded here the last three days?"—he said, "No, I was in another part of the premises"—I said to Newham "Were you here when the vans were loaded on the last three days?"—he said, "Yes"—I said,</p>

               <p>"Was anybody else here?"—he said, "The overseer came down each day to see the bags removed, but when they had carried out about six or eight bags he went upstairs into the fresh air in the yard and there counted the bags as they were put on to the waggon, and did not return to the store-room"—I said, "Was anyone else here when the vans were loaded?"—he said, "Other men may have paid a flying visit, but they did not remain"—I said, "Is it possible that either of Messrs. Joseph's men could have packed the van with this canvas without your having seen them?"—he said, "No"—that was on Saturday, April 23rd—on Monday I went with Godley to Messrs. Joseph's warehouse about 9.30 a.m.—we made a search and found some old canvas, and when Mr. Emanuel Joseph arrived we were examining it with Mr. Wilson from the Post-office—Mr. Emanuel Joseph said, "I cannot under<lb/>stand the meaning of this; you appear to be acting only upon suspicion, probably the information of a malicious discharged servant or an anony<lb/>mous letter"—I said, "We are not so much concerned about the suspi<lb/>cion as about the Post Office canvas, which we found on your premises, which you did not buy from the Post Office, and we want to know how it came here"—he said, "We cannot assist you"—we then went into Mr. Joseph's office in Earl Street; it is in the same building—I said, "We want to see the men who went with the vans to Mount Pleasant on the 18th, 19th, and 20th"—he said, "I do not know who they were"—I said, "It is absurd, because in the event of your being robbed or an accident, you certainly could find out"—he said, "I will see," and he sent for a man named Holmes, who ultimately gave us the names of the men—we proceeded to take statements, and as we were taking statements from a man named Flatterly, who was on the van on the first day, Mr. Emanuel Joseph interrupted—I said, "Please don't inter<lb/>rupt; you may have a copy of the men's statements after we have done"—we then went on, and Mr. Joseph ceased to interrupt—when we asked Flatterly to sign Mr. Emanuel Joseph said, "Remember you are not obliged to sign anything"—I asked Flatterly to sign—I did the talking, while Godley was writing—I said, "Please do not interfere; this man is responsible for his own actions; if the statement is true there can be no objection to his signing it; if it is untrue there is the greatest possible objection"—Flatterly then put his mark on the paper, as he could not write—I went back there again at 2 o'clock to take a statement from a man named Musbrook, who was not there before—Emanuel Joseph was there—he said, "We have found canvas in the bags of string from time to time, but said nothing about if, as the string was inferior in quality for which we contract; we have found canvas in the bags of string at other times, and have had them placed in the stable, where you found them, with the intention of writing to the postal authorities to cull attention to it; I am sorry you came and found them before we had an opportunity of writing; this has worried me consider<lb/>ably, and I shall be glad when it is all over"—I again asked him for the names and addresses of persons of whom they had bought and to whom they had sold canvas—he told me they had sold cauvas to Messrs. Dickenson &amp; Co., paper manufacturers, Old Bailey, but he could not think of anyone else, and that they had bought some canvas from a firm named Cohen, whose premises are at Southwark.</p>

Joseph's premises in Ontario Street, and saw the 11 bags just under the entrance, and 24 bags in the shed at the stable in Earl Street—I examined them in the presence of Maudsley and Dooley—I afterwards saw those bags at the King's Cross Police-station—I saw their contents weighed in the station-yard—the total weight of canvas was 15 cwt. 2 qr. 19 lb., and of string 1 cwt. 2lb., and of coverings 3 cwt. 8 lb., making 18 cwt. 3 qr. 1 lb.—most of the canvas was plain—there were also six pieces of painted canvas, including one bag which weighed 9 1/4 lb.—the 15 cwt. 2 qr. 19lb. was less the 9 1/4 lb.—I went to Dover and saw Mr. Holiday, the manager to Wiggins, Teap &amp; Co, paper-makers, of Buckland, who pointed out 20 canvas bags—I brought them to London and deposited them at King's Cross Station, and pointed them out to Mr. King on the 20th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post Office—on the evening of April 20th, after Burford's arrest, I saw Newham, and as no charge had been made against him, I asked him what he was doing on the 18th, 19th, and 20th; he said that he had been filling bags for removal by the con<lb/>tractors, Messrs. Joseph, and that the bags had been placed on the new stack of string, and had not been taken away, as far as he knew, and that a man named Critchley had been working with him in doing this, and that he had put the string and canvas into separate stacks, the string to the right and the canvas to the left, and did not pack canvas and string together; that Critchley had been wheeling up to him, and he was on duty when the contractors' men came on the 18th, 19th and 20th, and that he did not know who had filled the bags, which had been put into the van on those days—he said that it was his duty to fill the bags, and he did his duty, but that he did not do the parking of the bags on the 18th, 19th and 20th, as it was not his duty to do it on those days; that he did not pack the bags which the Josephs took away on those days, and which were taken from stacks which had been there for years; that the bags of stuff taken by the Josephs should have contained string only, as they had not cleared any canvas that week, or he should have seen them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190006250056"/>
               <p>do so, and he should not have known what was in the bags unless they or their representatives told him; that Mr. Joseph had taken some coloured canvas, as he supposed they got a certain proportion of plain with the coloured, but canvas would not be string; that he did not know the name of the employing contractors who came there on the three days; it was possible that the Josephs had employed someone without his knowledge, but he did not say how it could occur that Joseph could receive string and canvas in one bag without his knowledge, but he did no give the contractors' men the sacks that he had on the three days named—it was not his duty to do so; it was the duty of the checker, Mr. Hawkins—he said that he was filling bags for re-issue when the contractors' men were there; that he could not account for the fact that all the 35 bags found at Messrs. Joseph's contained canvas wrapped in string; that it was his duty to fill the bags for the contractors, but he had been assisted by other men, and the contractors' men could not have put the canvas into the bags without his knowledge; that on the 18th, 19th, and 20th there was only one man at the place, and he assisted in filling the bags for removal, and to his knowledge the old sacks had been there about 14 months, and the Josephs were served from it on the 18th, 19th, and 20th—I saw him again on April 23rd, and be said that it was his duty to indicate under the direction of his superior officer, Mr. Barnsby, to the contractors' men, who came for the string, the heap from which they should take their bags—he gave Stewart, Bates, Katze, and Sunn as the men who assisted him to pack string during the last 12 months; that on the 18th, 19th, and 20th, when the men were removing the string, he was in the bag-room, and Mr. Barnsby came into the room and asked him if all was right—on June 8th I went; to Mr. Joinson's mill at St. Mary Cray, and he pointed out to me a number of bales which appeared to be Post Office bags, gunny bags—I examined two of them; they contained 1 cwt. 3 qr. 20 lb. and 2 cwt. 0 qr. 17 1b. of Post Office bags; the second contained 1 cwt. 12 qr. 12 lb., and contained 1 cwt. 0 qr. 1 lb. of Post Oflice bags.</p>

I am a first class store man at the Post Office Stores, Mount Pleasant—on April 18th I was on duty and went with Hawkins to the bag-room about 3.45, and found Burford, Tucker, and Newham there—Newham was the only Post Office official there—I asked him to point me out the sacks where Messrs. Joseph were clearing away the old string—he did so; they were in the place where the string was supposed to be—there were slits in them by which I could see that they contained string—I then gave permission to load—I did not examine them; I accepted what Newham said, and I was satisfied when I saw that it was string—I then went upstairs with Hawkins, whose duty it was to check the number of bags which were loaded on the cart—Mr. Barnsby is Newham's superior officer; he has an office of his own, which is divided from Newham's by the road—the room is dark; it is underground, and is lighted by the electric light all day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a third class store man—I have been in charge of the bagroom since October, 1898—my duty consists in examining bags for condemnation and weighing old string and arranging bags for re-issue—three men were employed under me; Newham was one of them—he has been employed since about June, 1899—Boyton was another, and Grant, Hancock and Cline, and, I believe, Crutchley; sometimes one and sometimes another—they changed them sometimes—Newham worked in the old bagroom—I worked on the other side in a separate building, and there was a yard between us—the other two men worked in the same room as me—one was weighing canvas, and the other cutting waterproof straps—my duty was to examine bags sent for condemnation—since March last we took the rings from the canvas, according to orders—before that they were left on—when con<lb/>demned it is bagged by one of my assistants—the weight would be 2lb. less without the ring—Newham has had nothing to do with bagging up old canvas since March last—when a bag is condemned it is tied up and carried across the road, and the name of the office stencilled on it in the</p>

               <p>old bagroom where Newham worked—I take the canvas as well as the string—the bag is slit to see what the contents are, and put away—Newham turns the bag out, and passes it on if it is good, and it is taken away to the depot by a van to Kennington—I am speaking of the bags which are re-issued—bags which are found not fit for duty are placed on one side for my inspection, and I decide whether they are to be repaired or condemned—bags are examined daily to see if they are fit for service—those which I condemn are sent to the bag-room—I did not condemn any in Newham's room—Newham would exercise his discretion on the bags sent to his room, and those that were unfit would be placed on one side for my inspection, and I should examine them and condemn them or not—the rings would then be cut off, and they would be made up into 66lb. and sent back—a bag contains 66lb. of old canvas—other beings would arrive containing string and old canvas—the bag would be cut, and if he saw it was canvas it would be placed on one side for the ring to be cut off—there was no means of checking what Newham sent to me with what he received—the old canvas would be bagged up with the old canvas which I condemned—the old string comes to Newham's room from all parts of the kingdom, and if it comes from the London district it would weigh 58 lb.—60 lb. is the proper weight—his duty is to take it out and re-bag it in bags of the same weight as the others—on April 18th, 19th and 20th I was on duty when Messrs. Joseph's van arrived, in my room on the opposite side of the road—Newham was doing bag-folding in the Old Bailey—his duty would be to receive the driver's ticket forwarded by the contractors' showing the amount of goods—I should then send it by one of my own assistants to the checker-out first-class office, and he would come down to the Old Bailey and check the string out—it was my duty to point out to the contractors' men what their work was—I should then sometimes go on with my work, and sometimes I should go down and see what was going on—I should give the order to the checker-out—I have no idea how it was that the canvas and string were mixed together.</p>

               <p>the store porter takes them out, and if they want 20 bags or 100 bags they ask for them and take them away and despatch them—there are also four boys who come in for bags for the contractors' office—the con<lb/>tractors' men generally come in once a day for them—the bags I condemn are stacked up and sent across, so that the whole time Newham is work<lb/>ing there are messengers from different departments coming in—I have occasion to go there five or six times a day—if I saw anyone mixing up<lb/>string and canvas I should detect it at once—to open a bag of string and a bag of canvas and mix them together could not be done under eight or nine minutes, working hard—the men had not a lot of spare time—the bags must be completely turned out, and they would have to be mixed; he would have to turn two bags out—if he did it in the old bag room he would have to get a bag of canvas from my room and bag it up in his room—old canvas comes to his room, and he simply takes them and places them on the rack—in addition to string, which comes from all parts of the country, there are bags from the General Post Office, Lon<lb/>don, already packed and weighed—when they arrive at Mount Pleasant they are already slit, and Newham's duty is to test the weight and put them away without opening them—about 100 bags a week, on an average, come to Mount Pleasant in that way, weighing 60 1b. each; that is 6,000 lb.—I have sometimes been present when they arrived—only one here and there is weighed—if Newham found that one weighed heavier than the other it would he his duty to take it out—all bags that go to the country are weighed before going—60 lb. is the weight of the bags of string, and 58 lb. the canvas, but 56 lb. only since the rings have been cut off—the bags come in ready weighed from the Kennington Stores; sometimes 15 or 16 bags of canvas would come from there, and 18 or 19 bags of string, but sometimes we do not receive any for two or three weeks; they would be slit in the same way to show their contents—Newham bad also the duty of filling bags with string of a certain weight—he was sometimes assisted in that—I do not remember anyinstance when he did it alone—one man holds the bag, and the other fills it—some<lb/>times I have not a man to assist him, but I generally send one or go myself—one of the doors leading into this underground place is secured with a lock and bolt, and the other which leads from the back is a lock door; the messenger has the key; I hand it to him, and he hands it to me in the morning—the yard goes out into Farringdon Street—the old bag-room was pretty full on April 18th, 19th, and 20th, going up to the ceiling very high—I was not there when the heap was put there, and I have been there since October, 1898; it is a very old stack—the stacks are close together—the back door is not a lock-fast door; it leads into the back yard; anybody could get access to it from Mount Pleasant, but there is a bolt on it now.</p>

Joseph—I have done business with them from time to time—we buy rags or canvas to be made into pulp in the paper factory—on March 8th last I called on Mr. Emanuel Joseph at Earl Street, and I gave him an order—he asked me if I wanted Post Office bags—I said I would let them know—subsequently I received this letter from them, dated March 17th: "You promised to let me know about 3 or 4 tons P.O. bags. They are a good, cheap parcel. Can I send them to you?"—on March 20th I wrote in reply, "We have yours of the 17th inst but regret that at the present we are not in want of Post Office bags</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Wiggings, Teap &amp; Co., paper manufacturers, of Dover—I know Emanuel Joseph in the way of trade—I have bought rags from him on behalf of my firm—I remember his calling on me at Dover on March 12th—he asked me to buy some rags—at the finish of the conversation he said, "What about Post Office bags; will you buy any?" or words to that effect—I asked him the price—he said 13s. 6d. per cwt.—I ordered 30 cwt.—they arrived—I think there was 31 cwt—this is the invoice—(<hi rend="italic">Read: giving the weight as 31 cwt. 23 lb. at 13s. 6d.; £21 1s. 4d.; and dated Marchl5th</hi>)—they remained at our premises untouched till June 1st, when Inspector Walker came and</p>

               <p>removed them—I think that is the only transaction in Post Office bags we ever had with Messrs. A. Joseph—if there was another, it was 10 or 12 years ago.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">NASH</hi>. I am a member of the firm of William Nash, paper manufacturers, of St. Paul's Cray—since June, 1899, we have had a con<lb/>tract with the Post Office for the purchase of plain canvas for the period of one year, at £14 per ton—this is our tender (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—some of the canvas that we have bought we have used ourselves—some we have sold to Messrs. Joynson, and some we have now in stock; we have not disposed of any of it to anybody else—I know Messrs. Marsden—I have not met anyone connected with them till I met them at this trial, but I have had dealings with them—between June, 1899, and April last we have bought 31 cwt. of canvas bags containing bags since June, 1899, up to April last we have bought 85 tons of old canvas from the Post Office—that was removed by us from the bag-room at Mount Pleasant—that represented a large number of bags; we never found any string in them, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">KING</hi>. I am assistant storekeeper at the Postal Stores at Mount Pleasant—the bag-room is in my department—Barnsby and Newham are both under my supervision. The third class storeman Barnsby is the man at present employed in examining canvas, with an assistant to help him to bag—Critchley is the assistant—the packing of the string is principally done by Newham in the lower bag-room—he would have a man casually helping him; there have been several men who have helped him, our floating staff would be so employed—Newham's principal duty would be folding bags—when the bags come down the shute, Newham would turn them out of the containing bags and examine them, and, if worth repairing, lay them aside for repair, and if sound lay them aside for re-issuing, and if bad lay them aside for Barnsby to examine, and they would be condemned—the ones that were to be re-issued would be taken from Newham's room; those are departmental bags; the other bags would come in the same way, but dealt with differently; some of them would be delivered by the railway company into Newham's room, when they would be examined by Newham or Barnsby—they would be mail bags—if they were put down the shute they would be examined by Newham and Barnsby, and treated in the same way as the other bags, out not folded—they would be mainly from the provinces—Newham's ordinary hours were from 9 till 5—if his bag-folding work was pretty free, he would assist Barnsly or the casual labourer in packing up the condemned canvas—the painted canvas should be kept separate from the plain, and the string kept by itself—I used to go to the rooms under my control twice a day—I have seen Newham packing string and canvas—Barnsby might help him if his own work was light, but it has not been for the last few months—the responsible person downstairs would be Newham—I was on duty at the Postal Stores on April 18th, 19th, and 20th—I saw Messrs. Joseph's vans loading—on the 20th I went to the bag-room in the afternoon, while the bags were being taken away—Newham was against the stack, directing the men—I went down to ensure that Hawkins, who was a new man, was doing his work correctly—I went to see why Newham had not</p>

               <p>opened the shute doors—he said he was directing the men where to take the string from—I said, "You must not keep the men waiting; run up and open the doors at once," and he did so—there was no other Post Office official there except the man checking, and he was at the top of the stairs—I have myself examined the contents of the 35 bags which were found in Ontario Street—I saw them in a cell at King's Cross Police-station—they were pointed out to me by Walker—altogether I found 234 parcel-post bags, 224 of those were ripped, 300 mail bags, 91 postal store bugs, 125 tops and bottoms of bags, 21 old canvas aprons, 335 old parcel-post canvas labels, one canvas Scotch wallet, and 9 1/4 lb. of painted and coloured canvas, the total weight being 15 cwt. 2 qr. 19 lb., out of which only 9 1/4 lb. was painted and coloured—all the goods I found were the property of the Post Office, and except the 9 1/4 lb. of plain canvas, it was all outside the Josephs' contract, and bad not been paid for, as it had been taken as string—the 35 bags which contained the material had had the stencilling on them obliterated, but that is the practice, and would be done in the bag-room—I found these papers (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in the bags—many of our bags are used by provincial postmasters to send up their waste paper, and these are what was left in them—I found a piece of newspaper of January 1st, 1900, with the Liverpool post-mark on it, also an official cover of February 5th, 1900, addressed to the Accountant of the Post Office, Dublin—I found a registered letter list dated February 5th. 1900, with the Liverpool post-mark—there is a Liverpool Guide of 1897; it is an old un<lb/>saleable guide, which has been put away for two years—this is a label of April 2nd—it is attached to this bag, and is the latest date I have—there is "Great Western T.P.O., '00, up night mail" on the bag—a great number of the bags had the rings cut off—an order was issued that the rings should be first cut off the bags on February 27th, so I should infer that these were cut off subsequent to that—on June 8th I examined the canvas which was found at Joynson's mill—there was 12 tons, 7 cwt. 3 qr. 4 lb., out of which I found that 8 tons 15 cwt. 3 qr, 21 lb were plain canvas, that consisted of 3875 mail bags and news<lb/>paper sacks, 525 parcel post bags, 1080 Postal Stores Department bags, 150 entirely plain bags with no stencilling, all of which had been ripped and cut as condemned—I also found 960 mail bags and newspaper sacks which had not been ripped, 118 parcel-post bags and 55 Postal Stores Department bags, and 51 entirely plain bags—they had not been cut as condemned; in most cases they were proper bags to condemn—there were a few exceptions—there were many which should have been repaired—in those also I found pieces of paper and labels, a large number of the year 1899, commencing in October, 1898, and ending in December, 1899—there were also a few between 1886 and 1898 which had come from Ireland—I found three labels attached to old bags for repair, dated October 3rd, 16th, and December 22nd, 1899—I also examined the canvas taken from Messrs. Wiggins, Teap &amp; Co. at Dover—I examined 30 cwt. 0qr. 6 lb., 20 bales in all—I found 16 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb. of plain canvas—the containing bags weighed 1 cwt. 3 qr. 11 lb.—the plain canvas consisted of two Postal Stores bags and 21 new plain canvas bags—they had no stencilling at all on them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190006250064"/>
               <p>—they were probably issued for Christmas pressure and returned back to store unused, and in some cases they might have been condemned—I found 22 mail bags with the rings cut off, 36 parcel-post bags, three with the rings cut off, 325 mail bags and newspaper bags, all of which had been ripped and cut as condemned; there were also 24 mail bags with the rings cut off, four parcel-post bags, one with the ring cut off, 167 mail bags and newspaper sacks, none of which had been ripped—it was quite improper to send them out in that form—there were also 39 Post Office Savings Bank paper bags, some of which were ripped and some unripped—the whole bag only weighed 20 lb., but was the property of the Post Office—with it I found a large number of old papers with dates between November 18th, 1899, and January 3rd, 1900; I also found a repair label—between June 1st, 1899, and April last 5,640 bags of string were delivered to Messrs. Joseph in 1/2 cwts.; that is 140 tons—the weight of the containing bags would be 6 1/4 tons, or possibly a little more—they should have had nothing but string in them—between June, 1889, and April, 1890, Newham had duty attached to the bag-room every day, with three exceptions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MUIR</hi>. I do not preside over the Mount Pleasant Department—I am assistant to the storekeeper—I have only partly control over Newham by issuing instructions to him—I am there constantly—there is a similar department to that at which Newham worked at the General Post Office, where, as far as I know, the same sort'of work is done—parting of string and slitting of bags is done at the General Post Office, and the same weight of bags—the slitting of bags has not been done at the General Post Office since January, 1899—when bags come there they are supposed to send them to Mount Pleasant for examination—our main bag depot is at Kennington—they do not put canvas in mail bags there to my knowledge—they do not pack string or bags at all—they send parcel post bags, from Mount Pleasant to Kenning<lb/>ton daily, but under no circumstances do they send them there under pressure—the change of system was in January, 1899—we took over the whole of the women who repair the bags—up to that time there might have been a great state of chaos at Mount Pleasant, but that would not affect us—bags of string are not packed at Kennington, or sent from our place, only parcel-post bags in their own containing bags, which are known by a mark; they are obliterated and slit—those bags are sent from my department in another bag—2 or 3 tons of string a week come from the Post Office, and that has to be bagged up and weighed—there are about 20 bags in each containing bag, and having got them into his room, he would empty them on the floor, and make up his mind as to which were fit for repair, which were fit for use, and which he was to tie up—he would have assistance at the time of very great pressure—there are on the average 13 tons a month—we should have plenty of space if the contract was carried out properly—Newham had to dispose of 3 tons a week, but he gets half from the Post Office packed already—he must have assistance in packing string, which is sent him by the officer in charge of the work—he does not select his assistant; he might not have the same assistant two days in succession—there are four assistants engaged in the bag department—they are all here—they are third class</p>

               <p>labourers—the work is heavy in the underground room, but we never allow a man to overwork, we have assistants—on April 20th the work was in arrear—I have said that there is insufficient space to contain these bags, because we have two rooms—during the summer months there is plenty of light, but not during winter—when I went there on April 20th Joseph's van was there, and had commenced to load—I stayed about two or three minutes—men were carrying the string up, and a man was checking them, and I saw another man waiting at the shoot door, about two yards from the van when I came; the door was not opened then—if a quantity of stuff had been shot down, the shoot doors would not have impeded the van at all.</p>

One of the rooms is called the lower room, that is the same as the lower bag-room—I cannot say whether there are always three men with Josephs van—I have seen a carman and two labourers—it is not a fact that from June, 1897, to April, 1900, there had been eight checkers, only four—Barnsby has not acted as checker for some years—Smith has done it for four years, and there were Hopkins and Hawkins; they ask me which is the old heap, and which is the new, and the officers would instruct them which heap it is to be moved from.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. There is about 4 ft. between, but no rail—in those heaps there are bags of canvas and string, all kept in separate heaps—that is the room in which I said that we were very much cramped for space, and not sufficient light, and artificial light is used, and in which there were complaints of the work being very heavy and greatly in arrear—what I call a division is a gangway through which you can walk—foreign bags are all painted with a line of paint—we have specimens here; this is a Brindisi bag; it has a line of paint outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> They had been turned inside out in the sacks—we made the contracts—the dealings were entirely with Mount Pleasant, not with the General Post Office—there was a quantity of string there which Joseph's did not take the delivery of, and that accounts for our shortness of space—I wrote to the foreman, com<lb/>plaining of their delay—the contract price is £4 5s. 1d—there is electric light there, and there is plenty of light in summer, but if I was blind I could tell the difference between string and canvas—the men who point out the heap would have to inquire of Newham or the officer who was working there.</p>

               <p>but the weight on April 21st was 2 tons; in the ordinary course it would be 70 or 80 tons—I found no canvas in any of the bags of string—the agreement was that we should buy in the Post Office bags—in June, 1899, they were not in Post Office bags, and there was considerable corre<lb/>spondence, and ultimately I gave it up on the understanding that they should be in Post Office bags in future—afterwards there was not the con<lb/>taining bag—we sold the containing bags to Mr. Nash—I was not aware that he had a contract with the Post Office—he came from St. Paul's Cray—I sold him 1 ton 11 cwt.—I have about 3 tons on hand, counting the unused string.</p>

I was at Lavender Hill Police-station on the morning of May 20th—the prosecutor came there, and in consequence of what he said I went out with him—I saw the prisoner coming towards the station—she was waving a walking-stick—the prosecutor said, "That is the woman," and at my approach, and before I could speak, she said, "Yes, I did it; I did it;" and before I could speak, she shouted, "You thief! you scoundrel! you murderer!"—I took the stick from her and took her into the station, where she said to the prosecutor, "I told you I would do it"—some time afterwards I found the bottle on the ground at the corner of Stormont Road—when charged she said, "I wish all of it had went over him; he deserves it, the scoundrel!"</p>

                  </hi>, L.R.C.P. and M.R.C.S. The prosecutor came to me about 8.a.m. on May 20th—he was suffering from burns all down his left arm, the side of his face, and his wrists and hands—it was the effect of sulphuric acid—his clothing was also in a very dilapidated state from the same corrosive fluid—I saw the prisoner afterwards at the Police-station—she was suffering from the same kind of burns on her face—I have seen some pieces of a bottle, and have examined them—the bottle had contained sulphuric acid, or what is commonly called oil of vitriol—it is the same as I found on the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 47, Marmion Road, Battersea—the prisoner took rooms there about a month or five weeks before this happened—I went into her room from time to time—I saw a bottle there—when she went out she sometimes took it with her—she has never pointed the prosecutor out to me.</p>

On January 19th I was at the Police-court, presided over by Mr. Curtis Bennett—he gave me certain directions, and I went to see the prisoner—I told her that I had been directed by the Magistrate to caution her for making threats to the prosecutor—she spoke very bitterly against him about the way she had been treated—I went twice; the other time, on December 14th, 1899, was because she had detained some things belonging to the prosecutor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in her defence, on oath, said that she met the prosecutor in the road; that he tried to give her a blow with his stick; that she put up her hand with the bottle in it to protect her face; that he hit the bottle, and the contents went all over her face, and she then threw the bottle at him; that she had brought the bottle out with her because she thought her landlady's children might get it; that she did not come out with the intention of throw<lb/>ing it at him, and that she Kept the vitriol for cleaning purposes.</hi>
