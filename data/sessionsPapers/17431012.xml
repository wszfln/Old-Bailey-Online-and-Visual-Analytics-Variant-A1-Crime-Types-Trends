               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Stevens before?</p>
               <p>Tomkins. He forced himself into my Company in a House, and scraped Acquaintance with me, and said he knew my Mother, and desired me to give him a Glass of Liquor; which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Russel do to you?</p>
               <p>Tomkins. Russel put his Hand into my Pocket, and took out three Guineas and an half, and some Silver, and run away. Stevens afterwards run away, I pursued him and took him, and told him, they had got my Money; he said he had not, but he would carry me to the Person who had it; we went into George-Yard, and when I came there, Russel knocked me down; and by the Ball in George-Alley, I was knocked down again and beat, so that I could not see out of my Eyes for several Days.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any Weapons with them?</p>
               <p>Tomkins. I do not know, but I received a Wound across my Hand, which seemed to be like the Cut of a Knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these were the Persons?</p>
               <p>Tomkins. Stevens was never out of my Sight.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Was not you drinking with us at a Brandy-Shop, and proposed to lay a Wager?</p>
               <p>Tomkins. We were there, and Stevens said he was to fight one Buckhorse, a famous Fellow for fighting - I did offer to lay a Wager, and pulled all the Money I had out of my Pocket, - there was Gold and Silver, and Half-pence with the Gold. - I pulled it out to pay the Reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer to make this Matter up ?</p>
               <p>Tomkins. I was offered Money by a certain Person to make it up, but I would not do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you ever acquainted with these People before you saw them at the Brandy-Shop ?</p>
               <p>Tomkins. Never to be acquainted with them, but I have frequently seen these Fellows about the Market, as my Mother keeps the Market.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by this Money?</p>

I had been beating the Hour of twelve in Shoe-lane, and went to the Watch house; I had not been there above two Minutes, before Stevens was brought in; An't, please you, said he, to the constable, I did not rob the Man, but I know who did; Mr Tomkins, the Prosecutor, was very much beat, and his Face manl'd - I have known him a great while; he served his Time just by our Watch-house - the Prosecutor was very sober between six and seven in the Evening; I cannot tell whether he was drunk then; when a Man is beat and abused so, one cannot tell whether he is drunk or no.</p>

On the 18th of September Mr Tomkins came into Mr Wood's House, with a Man, which I take to be Stevens the Chimney-Sweeper, Arm in Arm, in a friendly Manner; when they came in they asked for a Dram (I am Cellar-Man to the Gentleman where Mr Wood is Clerk, and Mr Wood desires me to go behind the Counter sometimes, and serve Liquor) Stevens said, he had no Money; said Tomkins, It shall cost you nothing here, call for what you please; and they ordered a Dram of Gin; in the mean Time, came in a Man, who said, Mr Tomkins, You are the Man, who offered to fight any Man upon a publick Stage, here is a Man will fight you for a Guinea; the Man was a Stranger to me; before they came in, they had a Dispute, and Tomkins said to the Man, who came in, You pretend to fight, you know nothing of fighting; said Tomkins, I can fight upon a Stage if I please, but I do not love to expose myself; says the other, Here's a Man that shall fight you for a Guinea To-morrow; Tomkins put his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120003"/> Hand into his Pocket and drew out 5 s. in Silver, a Six-pence, and some Half-pence; says he, This is all the Money I have now, but I will make it a Guinea To morrow, or This shall go; taking hold of his Coat; and the other said, he should fight him for a Guinea; thereupon some Words arose; said I, This is a peaceable House, we will have no Quarrelling here; so I went to turn them out - I believe he was not very sober, nor very drunk; I know the Man was rational; because, there was a Hole broke in the Door; says he, Mrs Wood, I am a Carpenter; I will use your House, if you will employ me; said Mrs Wood, Mr Tomkins, I have no Occasion at present; but, if I had, I am engaged to another; I believe this Man staid about a Quarter of an Hour, and then I went to Bed; sometime afterwards, Mr Wood came up to me, and said, John, do you remember those Men who were in the Shop just now; Tomkins says, he was robbed; I went to the Watch-house, and saw Tomkins and Stevens both very much suddled, and quite different from what they were in the Shop; the Constable asked Tomkins some Questions; and he said, he had been in our Shop six Hours; said I, You have not been there above half an Hour, for I was there all the Time - they had two Glasses of Cherry-Brandy; said Tomkins, what is that; said I, a Penny; a Half-penny a Glass; said Tomkins, if Cherry-Brandy is so cheap, we will have two Glasses more, which they had - Mr Wood keeps a Brandy-Shop as well as a Tavern.</p>

            . I live at the Blackmoor's-Head in Barbican: my House was broke open September the 7th, at Night; it was fast about ten o'Clock, when I went to Bed; there was a Piece of the Shutter of the Shop taken out by the Help of a Knife and a Gimblet, as I suppose, by the Appearance of it; the Hole was big enough to put an Arm through; the Plate that I lost stood within reach of that Hole, and must be taken out that way: The Prisoner pledged with Mr Kay a Snuff-Box, a Coral, and a Tea Spoon: On Friday September 9. I advertised them; and Mr Kay came to me, and told me, he found by an Advertisement, that I had lost such and such Things; showed them to me, and asked me if they were mine, and I said they were; these are part of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How can you swear to those Things which have no Mark upon them.</p>

            . These Things were brought to me by the Prisoner on the 8th of September, with a Callimanco Petticoat; and I lent her 25 s. upon them all; an Advertisement coming out, I looked over my Day Book, to see if I had taken in such Things, and I found that I had; I went to Mr Barlow, and told him, there was a Woman had brought to my House yesterday a Snuff-Box, a Corral, and a Spoon; says he. There's no particular Mark upon them, but I believe if I was to see them I should know them; I showed them to him, and he said, they were his; and desired me, if the Woman came again to stop her, which I promised I would; I had not been at Home above an Hour and an half before the Woman came again to take these Things out from the Petticoat, but I refused it; and asked her how she came by them; she said she had bought them in the Neighbourhood, and made some little Sort of a Motion to go. I said I would stop the Things and enquire about it; she said I need not go, for she had actually bought them. and that she bought them in Turnmill-street. I said it was very odd that she should buy such Things as these in the Street, (as she deals in old Cloaths she might have bought a Petticoat in the Street,) but she still continued in the Story, that she bought them of a Man in the Street; but she would have gone away, and have left them in my Possession: She said she had them weighed, but could give no Account of the Weight, and that she gave 19 s. for them, which I suppose she thought might be about 5 s. per Ounce. I took her to be a very different Woman from what I find her to be, for I have known her a great many Years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought them very innocently; he looked like a decent creditable looking Man, and said his Wife was dead, and he had a Mind to sell them. I bought them at a fair Market Price; he asked me a Guinea for them, and I gave him nineteen Shillings.</p>

I was going out to washing, and coming along Turnmill-Street, I met the Prisoner, and a Man came up to her and asked her where there was a Pawnbroker's: She said there was one here and one there, and told him, if he had got any thing to sell she would buy them; he asked her 20 s. for the Snuff-Box and Coral, and she bid him 19 s. and she pulled off her Petticoat and pawned it with these Things to raise the Money to pay for them. - I think it was the 8th of this Month, it was the first Day of the Borough Fair; - she knew me an Infant.</p>

            . On the 8th of September, I happened to meet the Prisoner, says she, Sut, will you go to see the Borough Fair? Says I, I will go To-morrow, but I cannot go To-day; we sat down at the Door of a Publick-House, I think it is the Sign of the Trumpet or Horn, and a decent looking Sort of a Man, pretty well dressed, came to her and said, Mistress can you tell me where there is a Pawnbroker's Shop; says she, here's one here, and another there. She said if he had got any thing to sell, she would buy it; so he pulled out a Snuff-Box and a Coral, and said his Wife was dead, and he had a Mind to dispose of them; says she, Sue, here's a Coral it will serve for my Child when I lie in; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120005"/> laughed and said, What are you with Child? She asked him what he would have for them; he said 20 s. and she gave him 19 s. said she, You will stay with the Man while I go and get the Money; and she said she would go and pawn her Petticoat to make up the Money. I saw her loosen her Petticoat, as if she was going to take if off, and she came back in less than a Quarter of an Hour, and brought 20 s. The Man staid by me all the Time she was gone; - he trusted her with the Things while she went and got the Money.</p>

            .

I bid him put him into the Stable among the rest of the Horses; which he did, and he came again the next Morning, and then I cheapned him before Mr Sweeting, at the Red Cow, and some other Persons. I paid the Fellow 50 s.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120006"/> for the Horse, and gave him one Shilling for himself, and told him, if I made 10 s. or more Profit of it.

I delivered him the Horse, and lost my Money and Charges.</p>

            . On the 28th of July last, our House was broke open by the taking up of a Plank which goes down into the Cellar; the Prisoner confessed it was between twelve and two; - I found it out by the Watchman who came and told me that the Cellar was broke open, and that they had taken the Prisoner with some of the Goods which are mentioned in the Indictment. I saw the Cellar fastened, as usual over Night; they got in by slipping back a Plank, so as to put in an Iron Crow to raise it up, - it was 12 o'Clock the Day following before I heard of it, and by the Description which the Prisoner gave the Watchmen of the Place, I thought it must be my House; there were five Pieces of Oznaburgh stole, and two Pieces of Fear Nothings; these three Pieces of Oznaburghs are my Goods, the rest I have not heard of.</p>

            . On Friday the 23d of September. I went out; and when I came Home, about seven o'Clock next Day, I was told, that Lewis had been in the House two or three Times, and had broke open the Door, and my Drawers, and took out a Diaper Table-cloth fringed, which cost me a great deal of Money; I lost that and the other Things.</p>

            's. and I went into the inner Room on the Ground-floor, to hide myself - I did not see him; I was told, he pretended to come with a Constable; and came in a very vile Manner, and swore he would have me; he b roke open the Chamber door on the Ground floor, and then he broke open the Drawers, and took out something - I saw a sringed Table-cloth under his Coat - he did not look for me when he came into the Room, but went directly to the Drawers, and broke them open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he think you were hid in the Drawers?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had looked about the Room might he have found you?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. Yes, he might have found me; I was hid behind the Curtain - I had lived with Mrs Dawson about a Month - when he had got the Table-cloth he went away directly; I did not see him take any thing else.</p>
               <p>Jury. What had he to break open the Drawers with?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. The Drawers were all locked, and the Key was in one of the Drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have opened the Drawers with the Key; did he break them open?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. He broke them open, because the Key was broke.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he break open the Door of the Room?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. Yes - the Door was broke open, for I had locked myself in, but how he did it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come in?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. I did not see him at all - I did not see him that Night.</p>

            . I never saw the Prisoner in my Life before he came into the House that Night, this was about eleven o'Clock, and the second Time of his coming; the first Time he came was about nine o'Clock, he came and asked for the Gentlewoman of the House, Mrs Dawson; he cursed and swore greatly, and bid me get out of the House; he came again in half an Hour's Time, and came in, in the same Manner; he said, there was a young Woman in the House which he had a Warrant for; that he was sure she was in the House, and he swore he would have her out; he said, he was sure she was in that Room, and broke the Door open, and went in there, and then broke open the Drawers.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in the Room with him?</p>
               <p>Williams. No; no-body but the young Woman, who was behind the Curtain; I saw him, as he was going away, with the Fringe of the Tablecloth hanging out of his Pocket - I did not see the Constable near the House; the first Time you came, there was a tall Man in a Snuff coloured Coat with you; but the next Time you had no body at all with you - it was the Friday before Michael mas-Day - I am Mrs Dawson's Servant - I never spoke to you in my Life before that Night; only I have heard the Neighbours say what Sort of a person you are - it was the Chamber-door you broke open - I need not tell you what Time it was, for certainly you must know that.</p>

I heard the Tread of Feet, and thought it was my Husband; and my Spade-Bitch was with me; I found him lying upon the Ground, and he was so suddled, that he could not get up; I saw a Light coming over the Common from the Sign of the Cow and the Two Calves; and when the Man came near me, I asked him if he would be so kind as to help my Husband up, and try to get him Home; with that, the Man with the Light came to help my Husband up; and the Prisoner was with him; they hope my Husband up, as they said; and they said, he could not stand; and I believe he could not; the Man said, If you will not go Home with your Wife, lie there, and be d - d; and the Man went away with the Light, and the Prisoner with him; I went a little Distance from my Husband, and thought he would come after me; I took his Hat and Wig off, thinking he would be cold, and follow me; he not coming, I went back again; but he was not in the Place where I left him; he was moved farther; with that I saw a Light by the Sign of the Cow and the Two Calves; I went thither, and then the Light was out; so I did not knock, but came back again, and was going Home; when I was got about half way over the Common; the Prisoner came up, and laid hold of my Shoulder; with that I was surprized (I had got my great Spade-Bitch with me) says he, Have you found the Man on the Common? Is he gone Home? With that, I said, What makes you ask that Question; said he, By Reason I do ask you the Question; then, said I, If you do ask me the Question, I will not resolve you; with that, he said, I should go no further; said I, Why shall I not go any further? He said, You shall go no further, you shall stop here, for you want a Bed fellow; and I'll be your Bedfellow; I said, I do not want a Bedfellow; yes, you do, said he, and you shall not go any further; he said, if you make any Noise. I will knock you down; said I, but you shall not, Fellow; you had better be quiet, for I know you; though I did not, for I had never seen him before in my Life; with that he got fast hold of me, and said.

With that he strove to get me down, and struck me on the Side of the Head; I got fast hold of his Coat, and his Shirt, with that he shoved me, and did all he could to get me down, and then struck me on the other Side of the Head; I kept hold of him, so that his Shirt and Coat tore with my holding him, with which my Hand gave way; with that he put his Feet some how or other to my Heel, and got me down; then I cried out Murder; he said, it I cried out Murder again, he would cut my Throat; said I For God's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120010"/> Sake, Show Merey on me, and don't kill me; he said, if I spoke one Word more he would; then, I said, to my Spade-Bitch, which I thought would seize any Body, seize him; with that, says he, Do you say seize me, to your Dog; I do not value you nor your Dog; with that I begged of him to let me alone; he said, If you will not let me have my Will of you, I will keep you here till one o'Clock in the Morning, if I do not murder you - he said, I will either keep you here till one o'Clock, or else murder you; then, I said, he should not have his Will; with that he began to use his Violence in his nasty Way; then he asked me whether I would or not; I told him I would not - I am not a young Girl; for I am Mother of twelve Children - then he lay with me.</p>

            . I mean that he had carnal Knowledge of me - he forced me; I held out against him, till I had no Strength in me - he pulled my Legs open with his Hands [there being a little Laugh about the Court, she said] I knew these Things before I came here; I expected to be laughed at, but it is not a laughing Matter - he abused me till I was so saint that I could speak no longer, and then he had his Will of me for a great while; I am sure I thought it so - he had not done with me, in that way, I believe for the Space of half an Hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his private Parts in your's?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes, he had - not for all that Time - he had to do with me twice; I thought he had done with me the first Time, but he had not - I believe it was half an Hour both Times put together - I cried out, and struggled all I could; for I thought, at that Time, of Mr Smith, who was murdered in the Five Fields - it is a large Common that goes into the King's Road near Chelsea Common.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any Houses near the Place where he did this?</p>
               <p>Berry. There's the Cow and the Two Calves.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from that? Is it a hundred Yards?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes, a great deal more than that - I do not think it was above a Quarter of a Mile - as near as I can guess, it was between ten and eleven o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is a very bye Common; there's a Foot Path cross it; but very few People care to go that way.</p>
               <p>Berry. It was as dark a Night, I think, as ever I saw from Heaven.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you part afterwards?</p>
               <p>Berry. I said, you have used me very barbarously; I hope as it is so late you will see me a little Way over the Common; with that he said, I would see you over the Common, if I thought you would not raise any body upon me, or below me; he said it was his Way home; with that I told him I would not; Said he, How shall I take your Word for that; says he, You are going to betray me: I said no, I will not, as you have done such an Action as this, and as I have Children of my own, I would not have the Thing known.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had carnal Knowledge of you, where you sensible of any Thing coming from him?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes, there did. - Moreover, some People said the Prisoner was not a clean Man, - I hope I shall not find it so; we came together over the Common as far as the Fighting Cicks, and there was a Light up Stairs as if they were going to Bed; the Gate was fastened up or else I would have apprehended him there; then I came over by the Chesnut-Tree-Walk, by the White Stiles, and Burton's-Court was locked up; said he, I doubt you are going to have me apprehended; Where do you live? I told him my House was on the far Side of the five Fields, (which is a great Way off my House) then he was very well contented to go along with me. They were all in Bed at the seven Houses: I passed by Mr Desborough's the Constable, and they were in Bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you after he had done what he did to you?</p>
               <p>Berry. After I got off the Bed -</p>
               <p>Q. Off the Bed!</p>
               <p>Berry. Off the Ground; then he said, Now let me see what Money you have got, I told him I had none; said he, Let me feel, with that he did feel in this Pocket I have on now; says he, There is none in this Pocket sure enough; said he, let me feel in the other Pocket, I said, I never wore but one Pocket. (To return to the Story,) After I passed by Mr Desborough's, I turned to my own Door and gave a Rap; my Daughter was in Bed and thought it had been her Father and me, so she came down in her Shift and open'd the Door; when the Door was opened he stepped just within the Threshold; Oh, says he, there's a Spinning-Wheel; I then shut the Door in order to keep him in; there are two Bolts and a Lock to the Door which I fastened, and set my Back against the Door; said he, What am I come here for, I said I will tell you presently what you came here for, and I called out for Mr Tovey, a Man that lives in the House; Mr Tovey put on his Cloaths as fast as he could, and came down; says Tovey, What does this Fillow do here; I told Mr Tovey how he had used me, and desired him to go for Mr Desborough the Constable; Mr Tovey had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120011"/> been down long before my Husband came. I said to the Prisoner, you would not let me go when I was upon the Common, and I will keep you here now, and I made him sit down in the Chair by my Desk; and he told me he would make me sutter for keeping him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you sent for the Constable?</p>
               <p>Berry. I went for the Constable, but he did not come that Night; he was in Bed and said he could not get up, and could not find the Key of the Cage; afterwards Mr Tovey went for the Constable, and left my Husband and I with the Prisoner; - my Daughter was in Bed; and he told Mr Tovey he could not come till Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you made him sit down in the Chair?</p>
               <p>Berry. My Daughter, who is 21 Years of Age, and Mr Tovey: As soon as he saw that we would send for a Constable, he down'd on his Knees over and over, and begg'd us to let him go, and offered to make Satisfaction. I told him before my Husband and Mr Tovey, what he had done; he at first denied it, but he afterwards owned that he had done the Thing. - He owned he had Knowledge of me, that he felt in my Pocket, and that he would have robbed me if I had any Money. - I never saw him before he committed the Fact, and he owned that he never saw me before. I asked him his Name as I was coming Home, and he said his Name was Johnson. He owned before Mr Dunmore the Brewer - or Malster; I cannot tell which he is, he lives hard by Chelsea, and before Mr Gill the Apothecary, that he had done the Thing.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you by when he owned it to Dunmore, and the other?</p>
               <p>Berry. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you ask the Prisoner to go Home with you?</p>
               <p>Berry. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Council. What; did not you say just now that you did?</p>
               <p>Berry. I asked him to go Home in order to get him secured. - I did not ask him before he had done the Thing - I had not been drinking with the Prisoner. - I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Council. You say the Prisoner was apprehensive you were going to apprehend him; how came he to go home with you after he had that Mistrust?</p>
               <p>Berry. Because I desired him to see me Home, and I told him I lived by the five Fields, tho' I did not live there.</p>
               <p>Council. I think you said the Bitch was always ready to assist you if you cried out; how came this Bitch to let this Man do all this to you?</p>
               <p>Berry. She used to assist me, but the Prisoner had worked at one Douse's a Basket-Maker's, and the Dog used to lie at the Door, and I believe she knew the Prisoner's Voice, for we lived that Way about a Quarter of a Year ago; I think he must know the Bitch because she did not fly upon him.</p>
               <p>Council. How long might he be penetrating your Body?</p>
               <p>Berry. Longer than I desired, as I told you before.</p>
               <p>Council. What did he penetrate it with?</p>
               <p>Berry. With what other People do, and with what you do other People with.</p>
               <p>Council. How long was he in you the first Time?</p>
               <p>Berry. I told you half an Hour in all; how long Time would you have had me have said?</p>
               <p>Q. After he had done the first Time; how did he get you down again?</p>
               <p>Berry. I never was up; he would not let me get up; he said he had not done with me.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, how long did he lie with you the first Time, when he first penetrated your Body?</p>
               <p>Berry. I believe about a Quarter of an Hour. - I do not know whether he called to the Bitch or no.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to be a stout strong Woman and kept him for some time in your House by yourself, how long did you keep him there?</p>
               <p>Berry. No longer than the Time that Tovey was putting his Cloths on?</p>
               <p>Q. Was it owing to your Fear or what, that you submitted to him so as to let him be Master of you for half an Hour together?</p>
               <p>Berry. I did not submit at all, for when he pulled me open by Violence, I had not Power to resist. - I do not know where the Prisoner lives any otherwise, than that he is a Basket-Maker, and works with Mr Sadler; Mr Sadler said if I would take Half a Guinea, he would give it me to make it up.</p>

            . As near as I can guess, between twelve and one o'Clock, Mrs Berry's Daughter called me out of my Bed, and said, For God's-Sake come down, for here is a Man threatens to cut my Mother's Throat; when I came down Mrs Berry said, Mr Tovey, this Fellow has abused me very much, and I desire you would lend us your Assistance to keep him till we can charge a Constable with him. Mrs Berry would have gone for a Constable, but I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120012"/> not care to say in the House with the Man by myself; after I had said some Time, I said you had better let the Fellow go about his Business, for it will cost you a great deal of Trouble and some Expence if you swear this Thing against him; she said he should answer for his Offence; then the Prisoner dropped upon his Knees and begged to go home, and said he would make any Satisfaction. Mrs Berry made Answer. No you shall not go as you have threatned to cut my Throat and to rob me: Said she, You never offered to cut my Throat did you? No, said he, You did not search my Pocket neither, did you? Yes, said he, my Hand was in your Pocket, I believe.</p>

            . It is true enough (as my Wife says) that I was suddled; I was so suddled that I could not stand, and my Wife took my Hat and Wig off; the Prisoner and another Man came over the Common, and the Man said, if I would not go home with my Wife I might lie there and be d - n'd; at last I fell asleep, and slept till twelve o'Clock or thereabout, and when I came Home I found the Prisoner and my Wife within my own Door; says she, This Man has forced me against my Will, and has ruin'd me; said I, I am sorry to hear that, I wish I had gone Home at first if that's the Story; - She said he had lain with her twice, till she had hardly any Breath in her Body; said I, are you not a vile Rogue to do so? - He said he could not deny but he did it, and dropped down on his Knees and asked Pardon; I told him, Fellow, you have done enough to bang you, and when you have done that to be betrayed Home by the Woman! you foolish ignorant Blockhead. I said his asking Pardon would not do now, for he should be brought to Justice. - I did tell him he had ruined my Wife; said I, Are you a clean Man; he said he was.</p>

He was then acquainted that he had a Right to insist on half the Jury to be Aliens; he was indifferent as to that as he knew no body, but at last desired it; and accordingly on his Trial, Raptale Jurquet,

            . On the 16th of September I lost six Guineas and an Half, and eight Shillings; the Money was in a Purse; I lodged in Mr Copenal's House in Suffolk Street, and the Prisoner lodged in the same House. - I had no other Reason to suspect the Prisoner than the Money being found in the Bag of his Wig, in his Room, and in my Purse; I had a Piece of Rhubath in my Purse, and I am sensible this is the same Piece which I had in my Purse; here are six Guineas, an Half, and eight Shillings, and a Farthing, which were all in this Purse when I left it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They found in my Room just so much Money as the Gentleman says.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner being asked what he had to say for himself; he said it was Necessity that obliged him to take this Money in order to pay his Landlord that he owed some Money to, for Fear he should not be able to get out of the Country; that he is a Stranger here, and knows no body.</p>
               <p>Mr Copenal. The Prisoner was recommended to me by a Person in Holland for a Lodger. I never heard he had any Business here; he has been with me these eight Weeks all but two Days. I took him for a Gentleman, and he has had his Living with me all the Time.</p>
               <p>- Hughes. I had a Warrant brought me by Mr Fitzgerald to search Mr Copenal's House for some Money that he had lost, and I found this Wig hanging up against the Wall in the Prisoner's Room, and in the Bag of the Wig was this Purse, with six Guineas, and an Half, and eight Shillings in Silver.</p>

               <p>Copenal. I cannot say that I ever saw him wear a Bag-Wig, I have seen this Wig in his Room, to the best of my Knowledge it does not belong to any body else, for no body went into his Room that I know of. <rs id="t17431012-16-verdict70" type="verdictDescription">

            . (Surgeon) I was called before the Bench of Justices at Uxbridge, the Day the Prisoner was before them; and I saw her, with the Child in her Lap; it was a Female Child - it had been dead about a Fortnight; it smelt very strong.</p>

               <p>Mellish. Yes, my Lord, she had gone her full Time.</p>

               <p>'' For the preventing therefore of this great Mischief, Be it Enacted by the Authority of this present '' Parliament, That if any Woman, after one Month next ensuing the End of this Session of Parliament, '' be delivered of any Issue of her Body, Male or Female, which being born alive, should by the Laws '' of this Realm be a Bastard, and that she endeavour privately, either by drowning, or secret burying '' thereof, or any other Way, either by herself, or the procuring of others, so to conceal the Death thereof, '' as that it may not come to light, whether it were born alive, or not, but he concealed: In  '' such Case, the said Mother so offending, shall suffer Death as in the Case of Murder, except such '' Mother can make Proof by one Witness at the least, that the Child, (whose Death was by her so intended '' to be concealed) was born dead.''</p>

            . The Prisoners and I agreed for some hundred Weight of broken Glass Bottles; they came to take them away, and I missed seven Bottles of Cherry-Brandy. - I missed them before the Prisoners went away, and sent for a Marshal's Man to take them up; there were three of them; one of whom made himself an Evidence, but I have not seen him since; they had a Boat which lay at Whitehall-Stairs, which they carried the Glass to; there was eleven or twelve Hundred Weight; but they had not taken it all away, when I missed the Cherry-Brandy. They took it away by a Bag at a Time, of about an Hundred Weight. While they were carrying the Glass away I missed some Bottles of Cherry-Brandy, and I found two in the Boat, and another in the Bag, which they had not taken away.</p>

               <p>Loth Leader.

Owen and his Family are since gone off; he confess'd that he had taken the Brandy and sold it, and that he took the Bottle filled with Brandy four Times, I know the Bottle very well; I catched him on the Wednesday, and the Tuesday following I took him up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was no more than that one Time that my Master catched me, and he sent me about my Business.</p>
               <p>- Hill. On the 14th of Sept. Mr Leader sent for me and told me, I must take up the Prisoner, for he had been a vile Rogue to him. When I took him, I said, Jemmy, how can you be such a Rogue to rob so good a Master as you have; and Mr Leader said to him, how often have you done this, and he said only the Time that you catched me, and afterwards he said he went another Time; Mr Leader said, tell me the Truth, or it shall be the worse for you, and then he said he had filled the Bottle four times and sold it for 2 s. a Bottle. Then he asked him whether he had ever sold any Cags, and he confessed that he had taken twelve two Gallon Cags, and sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to mention this?</p>

               <p>Hamilton. Mr Chetwynd had got some Cake. and Mr Thomas Ricketts desired Mr Chetwynd to give him a Piece of his Cake; Chetwynd denied it him; I asked him for a Piece, and he likewise denied it me.</p>

             came into the Room about that Time. Mr Chetwynd took the Cake, and cut a Piece off, and laid the Piece upon the Bureau, and locked the other up; with that Mr Ricketts came and took the Piece of Cake off the Bureau; Mr Chetwynd asked him for it; and Mr Ricketts laughing, went up to the Maid, and told her, he had taken a Piece of Mr Chetwynd's Cake; with that, Mr Chetwynd came up to him, and demanded it of him again.</p>
               <p>Council. Did Mr Ricketts deliver it to him again?</p>

               <p>Hamilton. Mr Ricketts did not refuse to deliver it.</p>

               <p>Hamilton. He gave him no Answer, but continued laughing.</p>
               <p>Council. You mean he was laughing with you, not laughing at the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor's Council. What happened next after this?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. After Mr Chetwynd demanded the Cake, and Mr Ricketts giving him no Answer, he struck him immediately with the Knife, which he had in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was it back handed?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. It was back-handed.</p>
               <p>Jury. I desire he may speak a little louder; was Ricketts behind him when he struck him with the Knife?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Mr Rickett's Side was to Mr Chetwynd's. - He was standing by his Side.</p>
               <p>Counc. How near were you to them.</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Not very near.</p>

               <p>Hamilton. I stood a little Way before them.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where was this Blow given?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Just here about upon the Side, (pointing to the Right-Side of the Belly).</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you see him pull the Knife out.</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I did not see him pull it out.</p>
               <p>Counc. How do you know it was a Knife that he struck him with?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Because it was the same Knife that he cut the Cake with.</p>
               <p>Counc. What followed upon that?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Mr Ricketts cried out he was afraid he was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did Mr Ricketts fall down?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. No; he laid his Hand upon his Side, and said he was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Counc. What sort of a Room is it?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. It is a pretty large Room.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Part of the Room did the Scrutore stand in?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. It stood in the Corner of the Room by the Window; the Window and the Scrutore were on the same Side.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Kind of a Knife was this?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. It was a Sort of a French Knife.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was it a Penknife? Or what Knife was it?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. It was a pretty large Knife.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was it a Clasp Knife? Hamilton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Chetwynd cut the Piece of Cake? Hamilton. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the Deceased take it away?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Chetwynd see him take it away?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I cannot tell that.</p>

               <p>The Council for the Prosecution having done with this Witness, he was examined on Behalf of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Pris. Council. Mr Hamilton, if I understand you right, the Deceased and you asked Mr Chetwynd for a Piece of Cake, and Chetwynd refused it?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counc. So he was not willing to give either of you any?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Counc. I think you said Mr Chetwynd took the Knife out of his Pocket ?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I said he cut a Piece of Cake; I did not say he took the Knife out of his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Counc. I think it was a Cake that they call a Simnel; was it not?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Counc. I think they are very hard, with a Crust on the outside, and difficult to be cut?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120023"/>Hamilton. It was pretty hard.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then that may possibly require more Strength than he had in one Hand, to cut it; he cut it down did not her</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I did not see him cut it.</p>
               <p>Counc. You said he took his Knife and cut it?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes, he did cut it.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then tell me whether or no, (I am sure I will do fairly, God forbid that I should do otherwise) Mr Chetwynd did not refuse to give any of the Cake to Mr Ricketts?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes, he did use it.</p>
               <p>Counc. Who did he cut the Cake for? Was it not for himself?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then he did not cut it for any body else; I think you told, he laughingly told the Maid he had got it?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counc. And upon that, Mr Chetwynd demanded it from him again, and he laughed, but did not deliver it.</p>
               <p>Hamilton. He made him no Answer, but did not deliver it.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he ask him to give it him again before this unhappy Accident happened?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Counc. Pray tell me whether he did not besides his Laughing, endeavour to keep the Cake from him?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I did not observe that.</p>
               <p>Counc. Please to tell me, whether as you were School fellows together; you were not all good Friends?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Yes, we were.</p>
               <p>Counc. Which of the two was biggest.</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Ricketts was larger than Chetwynd.</p>
               <p>Counc. I am obliged to the Gentlemen on the other Side, for intiating that Mr Chetwynd gave Mr Ricketts a Piece of Cake before, I would ask you whether Mr Chetwynd did not give Mr Ricketts a Piece that Morning?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I heard he did.</p>
               <p>Counc. How long was that before this Thing happened?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I don't know how long it was. This happen'd about One o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Counc. When this unfortunate Thing happened what did Mr Chetwynd say immediately upon it?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Really, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Counc. I think, Sir, you were telling the Court of a French Knife; I own I don't know what they are; but the Question I would ask you, is, whether most of you young Gentlemen do not carry these Knives in your Pockets?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I have heard so; it was a Knife that he always had.</p>
               <p>Counc. And I suppose many of you had such Knives?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I cannot tell, as to that, Sir.</p>
               <p>Counc. I am obliged to you for the Candour you have used in your Evidence I have no more Questions to ask you.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you recollect, how these young Gentlemen lived together, whether there was any Will between them, or whether they lived in friendly Manner?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I think they lived as the other Scholars did.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you apprehend there was any Malice between them?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. I never knew of any Malice between them.</p>
               <p>Court. How did the young Gentleman behave after he had given that Wound?</p>

               <p>Malcher. Mr Ricketts asked Mr Chetwynd for a Piece of his Cake, and Mr Chetwynd gave him a Piece; he asked him for another Piece, and he refused it him.</p>
               <p>Counc. How long was that after he had given him the first Piece?</p>

               <p>Counc. Did he open the Bureau then, or was it open before?</p>

               <p>Malcher. He laid it down upon the Bureau, and Ricketts came and took it - snatched it away.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did Chetwynd see him take it away?</p>
               <p>Malcher. I cannot tell whether he did or no.</p>

               <p>Court. Where did the Cake lie?</p>
               <p>Malcher. The Cake was before Chetwynd, and Ricketts put his Hand beside him, and took it away, and then he went to the Window.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where did he carry it?</p>
               <p>Malcher. He went to the second Window with it.</p>

               <p>Counc. Was you present before Mr Hamilton came up?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Counc. When Mr Ricketts had the Piece of Cake given him, that was before Mr Hamilton came up, was it not?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Mr Hamilton did not see him give it him.</p>
               <p>Counc. They were good Friends before this, were they not?</p>
               <p>Malcher. I think so, they used to be so.</p>
               <p>Counc. When Ricketts asked him for the second Piece of Cake, was not he teazing of him?</p>

               <p>Malcher. No, he teazed him about the first; and then he went out of the Room, and Ricketts followed him.</p>
               <p>Counc. You say, Mr. Chetwynd carried the Cake under his Arm out of the Room, and Ricketts followed him; and then Chetwynd came into the Room again, and Ricketts followed him still, did not he?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then he came to his Bureau, Ricketts following of him still?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes; and then I saw Mr Ricketts take the Piece of Cake up, which Mr Chetwynd had laid upon his Bureau.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then Mr Chetwynd turned about to ask for his Cake again?</p>
               <p>Malcher. I did not hear him ask for it.</p>
               <p>Counc. He went after him, did not he?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was it not for his Cake?</p>
               <p>Malcher. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did Ricketts shove him?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Counc. When Ricketts took the Cake from Chetwynd, had Chetwynd his Back towards him?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did Ricketts reach over his Shoulder, or take it under his Arm?</p>
               <p>Malcher. He went under his Arm, and took the Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he touch him?</p>
               <p>Malcher. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Counc. You say immediately upon that he went to the Window, how far was that from the Bureau?</p>
               <p>Malcher. About a Yard or two.</p>
               <p>Counc. Pray, now, when Chetwynd went to cut the Cake (you were there all the while) did Ricketts offer to assist him in it? Did he offer to lend him a Knife?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes, he did, and had it open.</p>
               <p>Counc. What did Chetwynd say then?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Chetwynd said, he had a Knife of his own.</p>
               <p>Counc. Pray, had Ricketts a Knife in his Hand?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120025"/>Malcher. Yes, he had a Knife, and offered to lend it Mr Chetwynd.</p>
               <p>Pros. Counc. I should be glad to know whether he did not put that Knife into his Pocket again?</p>
               <p>Malcher. I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Counc. Here is a Question misunderstood I believe, did the Knife that you speak of belong to Mr Chetwynd, or to Mr Ricketts?</p>
               <p>Malcher. The Knife belonged to Mr Ricketts.</p>
               <p>Pris. Counc. That's a fair Answer to the Question.</p>
               <p>Court. Ricketts's Knife was opened before Chetwynd's; were both the Knives open at the Time this unhappy Accident happened?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Mr Chetwynd's Knife was not opened when Mr Ricketts offered him his Knife; but he refused it, and said he had one of his own.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Rickett's Knife open then?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they both open when the Accident happend?</p>
               <p>Malcher. No. Ricketts's was clasped, and put into his Pocket, on Mr. Chetwynd's refusing it, and before the Cake was cut and put upon the Bureau.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you saw him clasp his Knife when Chetwynd refused it, and put it into his Pocket?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. And this was before this Wound was given?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prof. Counc. Was it before the Cake was cut and laid upon the Bureau?</p>
               <p>Malcher. Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Counc. Pray give us an Account what you know of this unhappy Affair.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. The young Gentlemen were in the Dining-Room, and I was in the next Room; I heard a Noise, upon which I went into the Dining-Room and asked them what they did there, and what was the Matter they were not in their own Rooms; Mr Ricketts made Answer, that he wanted a Piece of Cake of Mr Chetwynd; I said to Mr. Ricketts, have not you had a Piece; he said No, and smiled. I looked at Mr. Ricketts, and said, I believed he had had some, for he had some Crumbs of Cake upon his Lips; Mr Ricketts smiled again, and said, he wanted another Piece, or a bigger Piece.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where was Mr Chetwynd then?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Mr Chetwynd at that Time was at his own Bureau, cutting his Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. How far was Mr Ricketts off the Bureau?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He was as near as I can guess about two Yards from the Bureau; Mr Ricketts went up to the Bureau to Mr Chetwynd, and Mr Chetwynd lifts up his Arms, and says, Don't Mr Ricketts, and Mr Ricketts then took the Cake.</p>
               <p>Court. Mention in what Manner he took it.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I think, to the best of my Knowledge it was over Mr Chetwynd's Shoulder.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where did you stand at that Time?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I stood at the Corner of the middle Window, and Mr Ricketts almost faced me, not quite, but was a little Sideways of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Had Mr Ricketts the Cake in his Hand?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He had the Cake in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Court. How far were you off the Bureau then?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I was then from the Bureau about three Yards, and Mr Ricketts came up to me, and said, Hannah, I have got some Cake. (I had a Stocking in my Hand which I was darning.) Upon, Mr Ricketts's saying he had got some Cake, Mr Chetwynd came from his Bureau, to my Right-Hand, and in a very short Time Mr. Ricketts said, Hannah, Mr Chetwynd has stabbed me. I looked at him.</p>
               <p>Pros. Counc. Did you see Mr Chetwynd come from the Bureau?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Yes</p>
               <p>Counc. Where did Mr. Ricketts stand?</p>

               <p>Humphreys. Mr Ricketts stood just by me.</p>
               <p>Counc. Now tell us whether you saw this Stab given?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I did not see it given.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you observe that Mr Ricketts had any Thing in his Hand?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He had nothing in his Hand but a Bit of Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you observe that Mr Ricketts had struck Mr Chetwynd?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. No, he had not struck him, and was not seemingly in any Anger.</p>
               <p>Counc. You say that at this Time Mr Chetwynd came up and stabbed Mr Ricketts.</p>
               <p>Pris. Counc. No, that is not right.</p>
               <p>Court. She said Mr. Ricketts told her so.</p>

               <p>Pris. Counc. I don't doubt your Candour, but you are mistaken in the Evidence; repeat it again.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I saw Mr. Ricketts come from the Scrutore, and he said, Mr. Chetwynd has stabbed me. Says I, Mr Ricketts you joke; Mr Ricketts had put his Hand to his Side: I bid him take his Hand away, and then I saw a little Blood; Mr Chetwynd, said I, You have done very well; Mr Chetwynd said, Hannah, if I have hurt him, I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Pros. Counc. Did you observe who were in the Room?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I saw Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Ricketts, and Mr. Chetwynd.</p>

               <p>Humphreys. He went out of the Room.</p>
               <p>Counc. How long did he continue in the House?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He continued in the House till Tuesday Morning.</p>
               <p>Counc. That was the next Morning; did he give any Notice of his going away?</p>

               <p>Counc. Tell us where this Room was, where you heard the Noise before you went to them?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. It was on the same Floor.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you hear any rustling of Feet, or only their Tongues?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. It was only their Tongues; it is my customary Way when I hear any Noise among the young Gentlemen to go to them, in order to persuade them to be quite.</p>
               <p>Counc. Where was Mr Chetwynd when you came into the Room?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Mr Chetwynd was at his Bureau, and Mr Ricketts was standing in the Room, and he said he wanted a Piece of Cake of Mr Chetwynd.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was this Mr Ricketts's Room?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. No, Mr Ricketts had a Room up another Pair of Stairs.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then he was got into Mr Chetwynd's Room, which was the Occasion of your asking him what he did there?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Yes. 'Twas the Room where Mr Chetwynd lay; he had not a Room to himself.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there any Conversation about the Cake, or any asking for Cake before you went into the Room?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I don't know, he only said he wanted another Piece of Mr Chetwynd's Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was Mr Chetwynd's Back toward you?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then consequently it must be so to Mr Ricketts ?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Yes. - Mr Chetwynd put out his Arms a little to keep Ricketts from the Cake. It was but a very little way thus, extending his Arms a little from his Body, and raising them up, and Mr Chetwynd said, Don't Mr Ricketts.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you observe Mr Ricketts then offer to take the Cake, or to touch Mr Chetwynd ?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I only observed him to take the Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. But did you see him touch him?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I did not see him touch him.</p>
               <p>Counc. That is very odd, because putting out his Arm, and saying don't shews as if he had done something?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He might touch his Cloaths, when he took away the Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was not he taller than Mr Chetwynd?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He was a great deal taller than Mr Chetwynd, he might for his Heighth reach over Mr Chetwynd, and take the Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. Could he take it over his Shoulder, or over his Head without touching him?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Over his Shoulder he might do it without touching him.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he take the Cake over his Shoulder or over his Head?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I think it was over his Shoulder.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did not Mr Ricketts laugh when he had got the Cake?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Mr Ricketts came away laughing, and said he had got a Bit more Cake.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there any Motion or Action between them before this Thing happened.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. There was not any Motion or Action at all that I saw before this happened.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you stand facing the Bureau?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. The Bureau was behind my Back, and Mr Ricketts stood facing me, as I stood Side-ways to the Window, with my Work in my Hand, and Mr Chetwynd was by my Right Hand, we all three in a manner touched one another.</p>
               <p>Counc. How could this be done without your seeing it?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I did not see it done.</p>

               <p>Counc. And then the first Thing you heard was, that he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. That was what Mr Ricketts said.</p>
               <p>Counc. And you at that Time did not believe it?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. No, I did not believe it; for when Mr Ricketts said he was stabbed, I lifted my Eyes off my Work, and said, Mr Ricketts, you joke?</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there any Blow given?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I believe there was no Blow; I did not see any; I did not at first believe that there was a Wound.</p>
               <p>Counc. As you did not believe it, it is plain that Mr Chetwynd did not believe it; for, he said, if I have hurt Mr Ricketts, I am sorry for it. Did he look to have Anger in his Countenance?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. No; he looked with Concern; and said, Hannah, If I have hurt Mr Ricketts I am sorry for it.</p>

               <p>Mr Long. I came to Town on Monday Night, the 26th of September, and found a Letter from Mr Clare; wherein he acquainted me, that Mr Ricketts had met with an untoward Accident, and had received a Wound from a young Gentleman in the House, but that he thought there was then no Danger; this Letter having been wrote in the Morning, I enquired if there had been any subsequent Message from Mr Clare; I was told there had not; I did not go to Mr Ricketts that Night, not thinking there was any Occasion for so doing; but, in the Morning, I determin'd to take the Advice of Mr St Hill, who being a Gentleman very emiment in his Profession, we always take his Opinion, when any Accident happens to the young Gentleman under our Care; I wrote a Letter to him, and desired he would meet me at the Academy that Day [that was on Tuesday] which he did; and I found there Mr Shipton and Mr Middleton, who had likewise been called in; these three Gentlemen, with Mr Mccullock, the Surgeon of the House, viewed Mr Ricketts's Wound, and thought him in very great Danger; they continued attending him till Thursday Morning the 29th, when he died.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Account did Mr Ricketts give you of the Occasion of this Accident?</p>
               <p>Mr Long. Mr Ricketts told me, that on the Monday, about Noon, he was sent to call Mr Chetwynd to sence, and found him in the Dining-Room, with a Cake, of which he asked him for a Piece, which he gave him; that he then asked Mr Chetwynd for another Piece, which he refused; and cut a Piece of the Cake, and laid it upon his Bureau, which stood at the End of the Room; Mr Ricketts, to teaze Mr Chetwynd, for having refused him, (but without any Intention of eating or keeping it) took up the Piece of Cake, carried it to the middle Window, and said to a Maid, who stood there, Hannah, I have got a Piece of Cake; and, he said, that Mr Chetwynd followed him, and immediately stabbed him in the Belly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You said, you came to Town that Monday, did you see Mr Ricketts that Day?</p>
               <p>Long. I came to Town that Monday Night, and found a Letter from Mr Clare; I did not see Mr Ricketts that Day; for I did not apprehend there was so much Danger, as I afterwards found there was.</p>
               <p>Counc. How many Surgeons had you?</p>
               <p>Long. There were four Surgeons; three were called in; and there was Mr Mccullock; the Surgeon of the House.</p>
               <p>Counc. I should be glad to know whether Mr Ricketts gave any Account to you of any Passage that happened immediately after the taking of the Cake?</p>
               <p>Long. He said, that after he had taken the Piece of Cake, he carried it to the middle Window, where the Maid stood; and said, Hannah, I have got a Piece of Cake; and that Mr Chetwynd came up to him, and stabbed him without speaking a Word.</p>
               <p>Counc. Without whose speaking a Word?</p>
               <p>Long. Without Mr Chetwynd's speaking a Word.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you ask him in what Manner he had lived with this young Gentleman the Prisoner, whether they did not live in Friendship?</p>
               <p>Long. He said, he never had had any Quarrel with him; and I have Reason to think it to be true, because, Mr Ricketts was a Lad of a remarkably good-natured Disposition.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you ask him any thing farther?</p>
               <p>Long. Mr Ricketts was generally, when I saw him, in such extreme Torment, that I did not care to trouble him with too many Questions.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did not he tell you he forgave him?</p>

               <p>Mr St Hill. It is not easy to know the Depth of a Wound, after it has penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly: But, upon the whole, I think we have given our Opinion, in such a Manner, that nobody will doubt, but that the Wound was the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then you do think that Wound to be the Occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Mr St Hill. I do think it to be the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Counc. In what Part was the Wound given?</p>
               <p>Mr St Hill. It was on the Right side of the Belly, two Inches obliquely below the Navel.</p>
               <p>[ A Piece of the Blade of the Knife was produced, which was about three Inches long, and sharp at the Point. ]</p>
               <p>Council to Humphreys. Did you see the Knife in Mr Chetwynd's Hand?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counc. What kind of a Knife was it?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. It was a Knife with a long Handle.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was it a long Blade?</p>
               <p>Humphreys. It was such a Blade as this; this is but a Piece of it.</p>
               <p>Counc. It is a French Couteau.</p>

               <p>Council. Mr Mccullock, pray, give an Account how you found the Deceased?</p>
               <p>Mr Mccullock. I was called at half an Hour after One, on the Monday, to go to Mr Clare's; when I came there, I asked to see the Knife, and the Knife was produced</p>
               <p>Counc. Was it produced broke?</p>
               <p>Mccullock. Yes, it was produced to me then broke, as it is now, I probed the Wound; but did not find, at that Time, that it had penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly; the Deceased's Pulse were extreamly low, but I thought that was owing to the Fright: I went the next Day; and then upon searching the Wound, I found it had penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly, and found it to be a very bad Case; upon that Mr Middleton was sent for; and after that Mr St Hill, and Mr Shipton.</p>
               <p>THE COUNCIL for the Prisoner called no Witnesses, admitting that the Fact had been fairly laid before the Court by the Evidence, and acknowledged the Candour of the Gentlemen concerned for the Prosecution, in representing it to the Jury without any Aggravation: but insisted, on his Behalf, that however his Hand might have been unhappy his Heart was innocent; that this Fact therefore could not amount to Murther at Common-Law, which the Lord Coke defines to be An unlawful killing another with Malice aforethought, either expressed by the Party or implied by the Law; that, in this Case, there was not the least of that Ingredient, their own Evidence having shewed they were Friends, Friends to the last Hour, Friends to the dying Hour; when the Gentleman said, he forgave him. That it being proved there was a Friendship subsisting, it would be talking against the Sense of Mankind, to say the Law could imply any thing contrary to what is plainly proved. That Deliberation and a Cruelty of Disposition make the Difference between Manslaughter and Murther. For which Purpose Holloway's * Case was cited.</p>
               <p>* Vide Appendix, No 1.</p>
               <p>If A be passing the Street, and B meeting him, takes the Wall of A, and thereupon A kills him, this is Murther; but if B had justled A, this justling had been a Provocation, and would have made it Manslaughter, 1 Hale's Hist. Pl. Cr. 455.</p>
               <p>If I see another's Child beat, or Wife debauch'd, it would be Murther in me to kill the Party, not so in the Parent or Husband.</p>
               <p>A sudden Challenge and fighting immediately, the Challenge is held to be a sufficient Provocation.</p>
               <p>The Law makes a Difference between a Person's killing another, when he is doing a lawful Act, and when he is doing an unlawful Act. If the Master designeth moderate Correction to his Servant and accordingly useth it, and the Servant by some Misfortune dieth thereof, this is not Murther, but per infortunium; because the Law alloweth him to use moderate Correction and therefore the deliborate Purpose thereof is not ex malitia;</p>
               <p>But if the Master design an immoderate or unreasonable Correction, either in respect of the Measure, or Manner, or Instrument thereof, and the Servant die thereof; if it be done Easily, and without De-liberation,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120029"/> this would be Manslaughter; if done with Deliberation and Design it would be

             Hale in his Hist. Pl. Coron. p. 454.</p>
               <p>Shall the young Boy at the Bar, who was doing a lawful Act, be said to be guilty of Murther; he was rescuing what was his own; the Witnesses have told you, that after he had given the poor Boy Ricketts a Piece of Cake, Ricketts went to him for more; he denied it him; he had a Right to keep his Cake, the other had no Right to take it; and he had a Right to retake it.</p>
               <p>There are Cases in the Books which make a Difference between Murther and Manslaughter: If a Man takes * up a Bar of Iron and throws at another it is Murther; and the Difference in the Crime lies between a Person's taking it up, and having it in his Hand; Chetwynd had the Knife in his Hand, and upon that a Provocation ensues, for he did not take the Knife up; if he had, that might have shewn an Intention to do Mischief. It may be doubted, whether or no, when he had this Knife in his Hand for a lawful Purpose, and in an Instant struck the other, whether he considered he had the Knife in his Hand; for if, in his Passion, he intended to strike with his Hand, and struck with the Knife, not thinking it was in his Hand, it is not a striking with the Knife.</p>
               <p>* Vide Appendix, No. VI.</p>
               <p>That in respect to the Statute of the first of James I. + it had always been looked upon as a hard Law, and construed therefore constantly very strictly by all the Judges in favour of the Prisoner. That when the Facts amount only to Manslaughter at Common-Law, it has been the Custom of the Courts ++ to acquit upon this Statute.</p>
               <p>+ Vide Appendix, No. II.</p>
               <p>++ At a Meeting of all the Judges, on Saturday the 28th of April, 1666, at Serjeants-Inn, to consider of such Things as might in Point of Law fall out in the Trial of the Lord Morley, who was on Monday to be tried by his Peers for a Murther; they were all of Opinion, that the Statute of 1 Jac. for stabbing a Man not having first struck, nor having any Weapon drawn, was only a Declaration of the Common-Law, and made to prevent the Inconveniencies of Juries, who were apt to believe that to be a Provocation to extennate a Murther, which in Law was not. Kelyng 55.</p>
               <p>That this Act was made for a particular Purpose ||: On the Union of the two Kingdoms, there were national Factions and Jealousies, when wicked Persons to conceal the Malice lurking in their Hearts, would suddenly stab others, and screen themselves from the Law, by having the Act looked upon as the Result of an immediate Quarrel.</p>
               <p>|| This Statute was enacted in the Time of King James the First, when many Animosities arose between the English and the Scotch, who using Daggers were accustomed to stab many of the English, ex improviso, which could not have been done by a flat Sword, the usual Weapon of the English; therefore this Statute was designed to secure defenceless People from Surprize, supposing that whoever struck would be prepared. Rex v. Keite. Lord Raymond 139.</p>
               <p>That it was to be considered, whether there was not Evidence to except this Case from the Letter of the Law: At the Beginning of the Fray Ricketts had a Knife in his Hand; and it was one continued Act. And another Question was, whether there was not a Struggle; here was the Cake taken, and in endeavouring to get it again this Accident happens; on the first taking of the Cake, it is in Evidence, that Chetwynd was forced to extend his Arms to keep the other off; now there was no Occasion for him to extend his Arms, unless the other was coming to take it from him; and then a Struggle is a Blow. In Reneer's Case, (cited in the King and Keite Cymbal gave no Stroke but in struggling, and yet it was adjudged but Manslaughter in Reneer L. Raymond 143.</p>
               <p>If a Man hath done a Trespass, and is not continuing in it, and he that hath received the Injury shall thereupon beat him to a Degree of killing, this, faith the Lord Chief Justice Holt (Kelyug 132) is Murther: but this Act of the Deceased is a Trespass, and the not restoring what he had taken was a continuing in the Trespass, and is such a Provocation as will make it Manslaughter at Common-Law.</p>
               <p>That this Statute is not to be literally interpreted, for taking up a Candlestick to throw at another has been judged a Weapon drawn ~.</p>
               <p>~ See Page 316. Col. 1 3.</p>
               <p>Meer stabbing is not within the Act; when a Man is taken in Adultery with another Man's Wife, if the Husband shall stab the Adulterer, or knock out his Brains, this is bare Manslaughter. 1 Vent. 158. Raymond 213. Kelyug 137.</p>
               <p>A Man must intend to kill to be within the Statute; and must intend to stab, for throwing a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120030"/> Hammer is not within the Act. Williams's *Case cited in Kelyng 131.</p>
               <p>* Vide Appendix, No. III.</p>
               <p>That some Degree of Malice is + required in this Case, as well as at Common-Law. The Act indeed has taken away the Necessity of the Proof of Malice, and laid the Negative upon the Criminal, and here the Negative is proved. The Intent of the Statute was to take away the Benefit of the Clergy from cruel and bloody minded People; 'tis impossible to conceive, that the Parliament should, at all Events, condemn to Death those who had no preconceived Malice.</p>
               <p>+ Vide p. 316. Col. 2. &amp;. 3.</p>
               <p>But the Case most strongly insisted and relied on in behalf of the Prisoner, was Buckner's ++ Case on the Statute, wherein the Judges all agreed, because there was some Provocation and no preconceived Malice, that he was not within the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>++ Vide Appendix, No. IV.</p>
               <p>THE COUNCIL for the Crown, in Reply to the Arguments and Cases insisted upon on behalf of the Prisoner, submitted to the Court, whether (since the only Points insisted upon by way of Defence for the Prisoner, were Questions of Law, in which the Jury were to be guided by their Opinion) the Facts proved and admitted, did not clearly, in the first Place, amount to Murther at Common-Law; and in the second Place, whether there could he the least Doubt in Point of Law, but that this Case was within the Statute of 1 James 1 8.</p>
               <p>Upon the first it was admitted, that to constitute Murther there must be Malice.</p>
               <p>But it was argued, that Malice was of two Kinds; either express and in fact, or implied by Law</p>
               <p>That when one Person kills another without Provocation it is Murtuer ||, because the Law presumes and implies Malice from the Act done.</p>
               <p>|| He that doth a cruel Act voluntarily, doth it of Malice prepensed, 3. Inst. 62. Some have been led into Mistake, by not well considering what the Passion of Malice is; they have construed it to be a Ranmour of Mind lodged in the Person killing, for some considerable Time before the Commission of the Fact, which is a Mistake arising from the not well distinguishing between Hatred and Malice. Envy, Hatred, and Malice, are three distinct Passions of the Mind. Lord Chief Justice Holt in Mawgridge's Case, Relying 126.</p>
               <p>And therefore, wherever any Person kills another it is Murther, unless some sufficient Provocation appear.</p>
               <p>But that it is not every Provocation which extenuates the killing of a Man from Murther to Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>A slight or trivial Provocation is the same as none, and is not allowed by Law to be any Justification or Excuse for the Death of another.</p>
               <p>And therefore no Words of Reproach or Infamy, whatever provoking Circumstances they may be attended with; no affronting Gestures or deriding Postures, however insolent or malicious, are allowed to be put in the Balance with the Life of a Man, and to extenuate the Offence from Murther to Manslaughter. Kelyng 130. Croke El. 779. ~</p>
               <p>~ See this latter Case at large Appendix, No. V.</p>
               <p>For the same Reason, no sudden Quarrel upon a slight Provocation shall justify such an act of Cruelty as one Man's stabbing another, though it is done immediately in the Heat of Passion. As if two Persons, playing at Tables, fall out in their Game, and the one upon the sudden kills another with a Dagger; this was held to be Murther by Bromley 27 Eliz. at Chester Assizes. Crompton's Justice 23. Kelyng 128.</p>
               <p>In like manner, no Trespass on Lands or Goods shall be allowed by Law to be any Excuse for one Man's attacking another in such a Manner as apparently endangers his Life, and could not be intended merely as a Chastisement for his Offence; because no violent Acts beyond the Proportion of the Provocation receive Countenance from the Law.</p>
               <p>And therefore if a Man beats another that is trespassing upon his Goods or Lands, and does not de, he will be justified by Law; because what he does is only in Defence of his Property, and no more than a Chastisement to an Offender.</p>
               <p>But (says the Lord Chief Justice Holt ) if one Man be trespassing upon another, breaking his Hedges, or the like; and the Owner, or his Servant, shall upon Sight thereof, take up an Hedge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120031"/> Stake, and knock him on the Head, that will be Murther because it is a violent Act, beyond the Proportion of the Provocation. Kelyng 132.</p>
               <p>That applying the Rules of Law to the present Case, it was plain, that the violent Act done, bore no Proportion to the Provocation. All the Provocation given was taking up a Piece of Cake, which is not such an Offence, as can justify the Prisoner's attacking the Person, who took it up, with an Instrument, that apparently endangered his Life, or rather carried certain Death along with it.</p>
               <p>And lastly, that Gray's Case + (Kelyng 64, and 133) was much stronger than the present : Where a Master, who was provoked with the Neglect, Disobedience, and Insolence of his Apprentice, and had therefore a Right by Law to chatlise him; immediately upon receiving the Provocation, took up a Bar of Iron, at which he was then working, and struck his Apprentice, who afterwards died of the Blow. This was by all the Judges held to be Murther, notwithstanding it was done upon a sudden, and notwithstanding the Provocation, and the Right which Grey had as a Master, to correct his Servant. For having exceeded Measure herein, what he did was malicious.</p>
               <p>+ Vide Appendix, No. VI.</p>
               <p>Upon the second Indictment it was said, that the Gentlemen who had argued on behalf of the Prisoner, had, in order to raise a Doubt upon this Point, in Effect contended that the Statute of James I, should never be allowed to comprehend any one Case whatsoever, or extend to any one Offender.</p>
               <p>For if Persons indicted upon that Statute, were to be acquitted wherever the Case would have been Manslaughter at Common-Law, the Statute would be entirely frustrated, and have no Kind of Effect whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Since it was only made in order to exclude such Persons as stabbed others upon the sudden, not upon their Guard, from the Benefit of Clergy; and was intended as a sort of Correction to the Common-Law, by restraining such Offenders, thro' Fear of due Punishment. who were emboldened by presuming on the Benefit of Clergy, allowed by the Common-Law.</p>
               <p>But if it is to exclude none from their Clergy, who at Common-Law would have been entitled to it, it can never have any Effect, and may as well be repealed.</p>
               <p>That whatever the Reasons might be which such gave Rise to this Statute, the Legislature thought it of general publick Benefit, and therefore afterwards continued it by a subsequent Law.</p>
               <p>And, if the Statute is to have any Force or Effect at all, there can't be a Doubt but that is must extend to the present Case.</p>
               <p>It is expressly within the Words; Mr. Ricketts, was stabbed, having then no Weapon drawn in his Hand, and not having before struck the Person who stabbed him.</p>
               <p>It is plainly within the Intention; which is declared in the Preamble to have been in order to punish stabbing, or killing upon the sudden, committed in Rage, or any other Passion of the Mind, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the principal Reasons upon which the Determination in Buckner's Case is founded, conclude strongly against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>For it is there arga'd, that Buckner was not with in the Statute, because it appeared to have be made to prevent sudden killing, the worst of a killing, of a Person not upon his Guard.</p>
               <p>And secondly, because in that Case the Party slain might have foreseen the Danger, and defended himself.</p>
               <p>But the unfortunate Person killed in this Case, had no Opportunity either of foreseeing the Danger, or of avoiding it, or making any Defence but was killed on the sudden, before he could apprehend any Danger.</p>
               <p>And therefore it was submitted to the Court, whether upon the Facts prov'd and not denied, the Consequence of Law was not clear that the Prisoner was guilty within both Indictments.</p>

Upon the Evedence it appeared, That the Prisoner lived in a Chamber by herself, and went to Bed on Thursday Night well, without any Pain, and in the Middle of the Night ked full of Pain, and knocked some body to come to her, and one Woman heard her knock, but came not to her; and the same Night delivered of a Child, and after she put the Child in a Trunk, and did not discover it till Friday Night following. And all this was found specially, to have the of all the Judges, Whether that knocking or Help at the Time of her Travel, (although the conce it after one Day) exampls her from that Statute. For there was no ary Hunt upon the Body of the Child. But thus far it was agreed by us, That if there be an Intent in the Woman to conceal the Chi ld, then it is Murder by that Statue, though Truth the Child was horn: But if there was no Intent to conceal it, or if she confess with Child before hand, and she is surprised and delivered, no body being with her, this is not within the Statute, because there was to conceal it; and therefore in Case, if there be no Sign of Hurt upon the Child, it is no Murder.

When I came back, I to Mrs Webster, I will ask Question, do you go out of the Room, and me more readily; said I, Sweeth if the Child; said I, I hope you have your Child (for I had a that she had put under the Copper) No, Madam, said she, I have not. I asked her, what she had done with it; said I, I hope you have not murdered it; No, Madam, said she; said I, is the Child in the Vault, she said it was; that she had a Desire to go to the Vault, and that it dropped from her when she was there; we got the Vault searched, and as God would have it, the last Child came up first. I said to the Men that was searching the Vault, (after he had taken up one Child,) young Man, there another Child. - Upon my Oath, I said so to him; I said to the Prisoner, are they both together? Did you throw them down? She said, No, indeed, I did not; said I, are there two Children; she said, I can't there was a great deal came from me, and I was in such Extreme of Pain that if I had had ten thousand Worlds, I could not got off the Vault; and I know that when Women are in such Distress of Pain they cannot stir to help themselves. Said I, if you have murdered your Children it is a crying Sin; it is a Sin against the Holy Ghost, and if that is your Case. I should rather die than live. - I have been a Midwife 18 Years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for Women to desire to go to the Necessary House when they draw near their Time?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Yes. - I had a Woman that I attended that stole away from me with that Intent. - I know the first Child had never been handled by any Hand to part them, because we have a particular Method that we know that by, and I believe her Pains were so violent that she could not go from the Place. I know when Women are in the Birth they can neither stand nor go. I asked her why she not call some People; she said she thought Re she should be better.</p>

               <p>Thomas. I cannot say that they were; no Woman in England can swear to a Month in the Birth of a Child; - she declared, before the Justice, that not made any Child-bed Linnen, but that her Sister Orders to make some, and that she there to lie in.</p>

On the 28th of September the Prisoner at the Bar came to my Shop to buy a Gold Ring: She pulled a Ring off her Finger, and said she wanted a larger than that; I showed her one, and then I showed her two more; she had one visible in her Hand, and out of those three she conveyed two away. - When I missed one of the Rings, I put two more upon the Counter, and said I was sure one of them would do; when I put them upon the Counter, I was not sure whether the other was gone or no; I was a little surprized; and I put two more upon the Counter, and said to myself, I will see what will be the Event of this. I took particular Notice of her, and saw her put her Hand up to her Mouth; with that I clapped my Hand upon her Wrist, and said, Child, you have got three of my Rings, and I will have them before you go; my Wife was above Stairs, but hearing a Noise in the Shop she came down Stairs, said I, My dear, do you go on the other Side of the Counter, and take hold of her other Hand; which I bid her do, least the Prisoner should convey them away; said I, They are either in her Mouth, or in her Bosom; then the Prisoner said, If you will not expose me, I will give them to you. I bid my Wife take her backwards and search her; which she did, and found the three Rings upon her; they were concealed in her Bosom. - I am sure they are my Rings; - When I missed the first Ring I was afraid of being mistaken, and was willing to be sure before I challenged her, and that made me lay two Rings upon the Counter.</p>
               <p>Mrs Bennet. Hearing a Noise in the Shop, I came down Stairs, and my Spouse told me the Prisoner had got some of his Rings, and he bid me go on the other Side of the Counter, and take hold of her Hand; I took hold of her Hand, and she seemed to be in a great Surprize, and said she had none of the Rings, said I, You must have them, and it does not signify any Thing your denying it; she seemed to want to go backward, and said, If I would go back with her she would give them to me. She put her Hand into her Bosom and pulled one of the Rings out, and gave it to me; I said she had got more; she put her Hand in again, and said she had got no more: Mr Bennet put his Head into the Entry and said, She has got three; with that I put my Hand into her Bosom and took out two more, and gave them to Mr Dobson.</p>
               <p>Dobson. I am a Hosier and live over-against Mr Bennet's; seeing a Croud about the Door, I went over and asked what was the Matter; says he, There's a Woman has taken three Rings, she is backwards with my Wife; Mrs Bennet had just taken the Rings from the Prisoner, and she delivered them to me.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner about two Years and six Months. On the 26th of last March was Twelve Months, I met him coming out of my Master's Yard, in Petticoat-Lane, with a Basket of Bricks; I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said, What is that to you? I told him my Master knew nothing of it, and I would acquaint him with it; he said, if I did acquaint my Master with it, he would do my Business for me, and that was the Reason I did not inform against him sooner; and I was afraid to go about my Business after I had made a Discovery, till the Bill was found. - I cannot swear to any more than this Basket of Bricks.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Bricks do you think there were?</p>
               <p>Lecroke. I believe there were eighteen or twenty; the Basket was pretty well filled, and it will contain about that Quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you fix the Time to be the 26th of March was twelve Months?</p>
               <p>Lecroke. I remember I had been at work in Love's-Court that Day, and I turned to the Book and found it to be the 26th of March that I was at Work there.</p>

            . The 26th of last March was Twelve-Months, I met the Prisoner carrying a Hod of Bricks out of the Tabernacle-Yard in Petticoat-Lane, belonging to Mr Simpson, after I left Work in the Evening; I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said it was no Business of mine, and that he had as much Business with the Bricks as I or my Master had, and he said if I did trouble myself about it, he would turn me out of my Business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him carry any Bricks out more than once?</p>
               <p>Newton. I saw him carry Bricks out at several Times, I am within Compass in swearing to an hundred of Bricks.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason have you to fix on the 26th of March was twelve Months?</p>
               <p>Newton. I know it by being at work in Love's-Court that Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should you be afraid of being turned out of your Master's Business, for discovering to your Master that he was wronged?</p>
               <p>Newton. I was as much afraid of being abused as I was of any Thing else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cannot help what he swears; I am very ignorant of the Affair.</p>
               <p>W. Green. The Prisoner has worked with me ever since the 26th of December last, and always behaved in a very sober Manner; I never heard any Body say but that he was very honest excepting this Thing.</p>

             said he bore the Character of an honest Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This was never thought of till I sued him for my Wages; I got an Attachment against him in the Court of Conscience, and when I recovered my Money then this Thing was trumped up upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to this? Is it true.</p>
               <p>Simpson. There was an Agreement between the Prisoner and me; and I was to give him a Guinea a Week, if he behaved as he should do; but instead of coming in Time, he used frequently to come at nine or ten o'Clock in the Morning, and I only stopped the Money for lost Time, and he got an Attachment against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an Attachment against you in the Court of Conscience?</p>
               <p>Simpson. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the Money upon it?</p>

               <p>Perkins. Stevens has used the House above a Twelvemonth; they both of them used the House all Hours of the Night, with disorderly Women; there were seven or eight disorderly Women used it; it was sometimes kept open till two or three o'Clock in the Morning; I have been many Times called off my Watch to go there; the very Night that he was taken up, I was called there.</p>
               <p>Q. What Company was in the House?</p>

               <p>Perkins. I was beating the Hour of One, and met the Constable, who was going there; we went into the House, and found-four Women and four Men; we turned the Men about their Business, but took the Women up.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing of?</p>
               <p>Perkins. They were all drinking in the same Room; one of the Men had lost his Handkerchief, and charged them with it; he said, he lost it since he came into the House; he was to have appeared here to Day, but he is not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in Liquor, or were they sober?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask Newbold how he came to have such Company in his House, or how he came to entertain such People at that Time of Night?</p>
               <p>Perkins. I believe we did, but he made no Excuse then.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing of?</p>

               <p>Perkins. I have known them these seven Years; they were common Women of the Town; they had used the House about a Twelve-month; I was called in there one Night; and they asked me if I would see a burning Shame, and one of the Women stuck a lighted Candle -</p>

            . I am a Constable of the Ward of Farringdon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Newbold, and where he lives?</p>
               <p>Welburne. Yes, he lives in Love's-Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of a House does he keep?</p>
               <p>Welburne. He keeps a disorderly House.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of his keeping a disorderly House, between June and September?</p>
               <p>Welburne. I have gone my Rounds that way several Times, between June and September; I have called in between two and three in the Morning, and I never went in, but I found a Company of Women, and sometimes Men with them; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120049"/> have taken them up sometimes, and carried them to the Watch-house, and they have been committed to the Workhouse; I was going by one Day this Month, and there was a Man at the Door, who said, he had been robbed in the Prisoner's House; that he had picked up a Woman of the Town, or the Woman had picked him up, and that he had lost 18 d. and his Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see in the House at that Time?</p>
               <p>Welburne. I did not go into the House then.</p>
               <p>The Court was informed, that the Prisoner was committed the first of August, so that nothing affected the Prisoner, with regard to this Indictment, but what was done, from the 13th of June to the 1st of August.</p>
               <p>Welburne. The Night the Prisoner was taken up, I went into his House between eleven and twelve at Night; and there was a Man in the House, who said, one of the Women had picked his Pocket of a Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Man drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Welburne. He was suddled.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Women were there in the House?</p>
               <p>Welburne. There were four Women, and the Man, who said, his Pocket was picked.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Prisoner doing?</p>
               <p>Welburne. He was swearing and cursing at a very great Rate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after you were in the House, or before?</p>
               <p>Welburne. It was before I went in; I stood a little Time listening before the Door was opened, for I had a Mind to hear how they behaved - It is a little House, of one Room on a Floor, and it is shut up all Day long like a private House.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen these four Women in the House, between the 13th of June and the 31st of July?</p>
               <p>Welburne. Yes, I have seen the same Women there within those Times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said to this young Man, that he speaks of, who was in Liquor, that I would have him go Home.</p>
               <p>Welburne. I heard him say to the young Man, he would have him go out, and not stay there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you went into the House, or after?</p>
               <p>Welburne. It was after I went into the House; I did not hear him say so, while I was at the Door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in Bed, and there were three Constables, and three or four Watchmen.</p>

               <p>Q. What Sort of Company did you find there?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I found very indifferent Guests there, almost naked, and drunk, and several of them lying in Closets and Holes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they Men or Women?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. There were some Men, and some Women; they were very ragged Creatures; and himself was in Bed then, with a black Eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any Noise in the House then?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. Yes, I did, or I had not gone in - they were damning their Eyes and Limbs, and swearing away in that black-guard Manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these Women before?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I never saw them in the Streets, that I know off; they are not fit for the Streets, they are such poor ragged dismal Toads, and drunk; I believe they ply about George-Alley, and by the Ditch Side - I have been there several Times, and the Company used to be much of the same Nature, more or less.</p>

I called my Servant; said I, Dorothy, what Sort of Bread and Butter is this? You have not cut it as it should be; I spoke to her in a mild Manner for she never saw me out of Temper; to this she said it was well enough; I smiled at it, and shewed her the Bread and Butter, said I, is this fit to bring into Company; said she, What is the Matter with it? It is well enough. I went into the Kitchen, and asked her how she could serve me so; said she, Madam, you eat none yourself, and I think it is good enough for your Company. Why, said I, is it good enough? Do you know any Thing of my Company? Yes, said she, I know them better than you do, and knew them before you did; said I, it is very impudent in you to use my Friend in this Manner. When I went into the Parlour again, said Mrs Wingfield, Why do you trouble yourself about the Bread and Butter? I don't matter whether I have any: Said I, Madam, my Maid says she, knew you before I did, and knows you better than I do; said Mrs Wingfield, My Dear, with your Leave, I will go out and speak to her, and ask her how she came to know me, for I do not remember ever to have seen her. Mrs Wingfield went out of the Parlour, and presently I heard somebody cry out, I went to the Kitchen, and found Mrs Wingfield on the Ground, upon her Back, her Head rais'd a little Way off the Ground; said I, Lord, have Mercy upon me, what's the Matter; Mrs Wingfield said, my Maid had beat and abused her in a very gross Manner.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120051"/> Mrs Wingfield was in a very bad Condition, and very much bruised.</p>
               <p>Mrs Wingfield. I went to pay a Visit to Miss Kendall; she ordered the Tea to be brought, and called for a Plate of Bread and Butter. I desired she would order her Maid to put a little more Butter upon the Bread; there was very little Butter upon it, and she brought it in, in a very unhandsome Manner; it seemed as if Children had been biting it. I smiled at the Bread and Butter; Mrs Kendall called her Maid in, and said, What is the Matter that the Bread and Butter is cut in this unseemly Manner? The Maid said, it was well enough; Mrs Kendall ordered her to cut some more, and that was cut much in the same Manner; said she, I'll go out, and speak to her about it; said I, Madam, don't trouble yourself; said Mrs Kendall, I can speak to her without being in a Passion; she went, and when she came in again, she told me, her Maid said, it was good enough for her Company; and that, she said, she knew me before she did, and better than she did; said I, I will go out and speak to her; I went to the Kitchen-Door, said I, pray, young Woman, do you know me? She came flying towards the Kitchen-Door, with a brass Ladle in her Hand, and said, D - n you for a Bitch, I don't know you, and I do not desire to know you; with that she fell upon me, flung me upon the Ground, tore my Cloaths, struck me, and beat me in a violent Manner with the Ladle, and, I believe, kicked me, but I cannot say positively, being in a Fright, whether she did or no; Lord have Mercy upon me; said I, my Sister (

            . I had lived with Mrs Kendall, and was there accidentally; when I came, I heard there had been some disobliging Words; my Mistress called to me to fill the Pot, and bid me cut some Bread and Butter; and by that Time I had cut four Pieces, Mrs Wingfield opened the Door, came into the Kitchen, and said, to the Prisoner, Do you know me? Or, how do you know me? I saw the Maid down in a Chair, and Mrs Wingfield was o'top of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear a Bustle?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. Yes, there was a Sort of a Bustle, and presently Mr Waldo and Mrs Wingfield's Sister came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the End of the Quarrel?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. No, it was at the Beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Mrs Wingfield been in the Kitchen before you saw this?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. I had cut one Piece of Bread and Butter.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were cutting Bread and Butter, how could you see what they did?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. Immediately upon the Lady's coming into the Kitchen, I turned my Face round towards them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Maid doing of?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. She was washing her Dishes - when Mrs Wingfield came in, she was rincing a Plate, and had just sat it down upon the Table; and when Mrs Wingfield asked her, whether she knew her, she said, Get out you Slut.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done next?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. I cannot tell what was done next, for then I turned about to cut another Bit of Bread and Butter.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Maid said, Get out, you Slut, did you turn your Head from them?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this Fray continue?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. It was only while I was cutting a Piece of Bread and Butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear a Crying out?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. I heard no crying out, but only a Bustle.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, tell us what you saw of the Matter?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. I saw this Maid thrown down in the Chair, and Mrs Wingfield upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Chair stand?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. The Chair was quite thrown back. - Mrs Wingfield had hold of her, and Mr Waldo was striving to part them, and I went directly to them, and he said I will undo her Hands, and they rose up; and then there was the Lady's Sister, and an Apprentice came into the Kitchen; - All the Bustle was at once.</p>
               <p>Q. What Part of the Room did you see them in?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. It was all at one Place - just by the Kitchen Door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Defendant, when Mrs Wingfield asked her what she had to say to her?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120052"/>Fewlis. At the Sink.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she went to the other End of the Room to Mrs Wingfield, and bid her go out of the Kitchen, and called her Slut ?</p>
               <p>Fewlis. Yes, she did go to her, to be sure - I did not see any Ladle in her Hand - nor hear any Body cry out - nor see any Body upon the Ground; nor any Blows struck at all - there was no body in the Kitchen, besides me and the Maid, when Mrs Wingfield came in.</p>

               <p>Mr Waldo. I was below in the Shop, and hearing a Noise above Stairs, I went up, and found Mrs Grignion down on the Ground, and the Defendant's Hands in her Hair; and I did, with some Difficulty, get her Hands out of her Hair.</p>

               <p> * The Prisoner had withdrawn her Plea of Not-Guilty, and confessed the Indictment; the Evidence was given in Aggravation: The Court were inclinable to think the Prisoner was disordered in her Senses, or in Liquor; for it did not appear to them, that Mrs Kendal telling Mrs Wingfield, she was about parting with her Maid, Mrs Wingfield was recommending one to her; and the Servant being backward and forward in the Room, heard their Discourse: This however is said to be the Case, and will in some Measure account for this violent Outrage.</p>

               <p>Ford. The Prisoner came to me to the Bench at St Lawrence's Church, and told me he had got a Jobb for me, and I went with him into Maiden-Lane before I knew what he had for me to do; then he ordered me to go to Mr Freeman's, at the Bell in Noble-street, and give him this Letter; says he, Stay till he opens it, and he will give you five Shillings. Just as I was going away, he said, If he should ask you where you come from, tell him you come from Fleet-street; because the Letter is dated from Fleet-street; and when I came back, I gave him the 5 s. and he gave me Three-pence.</p>

               <p>Fletcher I saw him there the Night before the Letter was brought to Mr Freeman; he was sitting holding down his Head. Mrs Freeman and I were talking about Tottenham, and of my Wife's being there; she said, she had a Mind to go, and I told her, I was to go there the next Morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you declare when some People were talking to you about me, that you should not have remembered my being at the House, but by my own Confession?</p>
               <p>Fletcher. I remembered you by your Face, by seeing you there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have another Indictment against me, I desire to know whether I shall make my Defence at one Time, or separately; for I can prove myself at another Place by my Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. You may make your Defence now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I shall beg the Favour of a few Words, and I shall be as short as possible. I have had a large Family, a weak sickly Wife, and eight Children, and that run me behind hand in the World; I found that I was unable to pay my Creditors, and was resolved to go Abroad, and entered on Board the Prince of Orange Man of War, the 30th of June, and carried my Bedding on Board the 6th of July: I had an Acquaintance of mine who was-sat up in Shoe-Lane, and I was to do something there, but I lay in Bed till between nine and ten on the Saturday Morning. I do acknowledge I was at Mr Freeman's, on Friday Night; I called in casually as I may into any other Man's House; no body could say any thing to my Discredit or Discharacter upon it. I changed a Shilling, paid for a Pint of Beer, and went Home; I could not be a Witch or a Devil, to find Mr Fletcher's Christian Name out, if I heard his Sirname mentioned, and as to the Letter I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Ford. Do you remember what Day you carried this Letter on?</p>
               <p>Ford. It was on Saturday the 9th Day of July; you gave it me a Quarter before eight, as near as I could guess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Landlady came up Stairs into my Room, and opened my Door on Saturday Morning, at half an Hour after Nine, and I was asleep. I staid some Time, and then came down Stairs, and laid the Key down upon the Dresser; says she, how came you to lie so long? you will make but a bad Week's Work of it considering it is Saturday; said I, every Night is Saturday Night with me, for what I get in the Day, I receive at Night.</p>

He said, every Day was Saturday with him now; for he received his Money every Night; so he hung up the Key, and went his ways out. - There were more People lay in the Room than him, but the last always brought down the Key.</p>

            . About the 10th of July last, I took Charge of the Prisoner in Well Close-Square; she was charged with stealing a Watch from Mr Puckford; I asked her whether she had the Watch or no; she said she knew nothing of the Watch, nor never saw it; I said, my Dear, I will go with you into the first Publick-House I come to, and if you know any thing of the Watch you had better tell me; I went into a Publick-House with her and searched her, but I found no Watch, only Three-pence Half-penny, which was tied up in the Corner of her Handkerchief. She said she believed Mr Puckford had been in Company with another Woman; I asked her again, whether she knew any thing of it; she said she would say nothing before such a Mob; I went with her into a private Room, and then she told me the Watch was pawned for Half a Guinea; - she said she did not pawn it, but she knew who did, and where; I came to Mr Puckford and told him the Watch was pawned for Half a Guinea, and that he might have it again paying the Half Guinea; he desired I would lend him Half a Guinea; I told him I had no Money about me; but a Friend of mine said, he would lend me a Guinea. Mr Puckford agreed, that I should go with the Prisoner to the Place, which was about two hundred Yards, it was the Sign of the White-Horse, (it is often called the Yorkshire-Gray ) in Rag-Fair, one Mr Smith keeps the House; it is a House where a great many of these People resort. When the Prisoner came into the House, she asked for the Watch; she whispered the People of the House, but I did not hear what she said; she said, if I would give the Money to any of the People there, I should have the Watch; but I would not trust the Money with them, for I did not know but the Money might be gone as well as the Watch; I gave a Guinea to the Daughter of the Man of the House to change, and I got the Watch from this Alehouse, and I paid a Shilling for Interest, besides the Half Guinea.</p>

               <p>Extract from the Account of this Book in the Works of the Learned.</p>
               <p>' The World has long complained of the Want ' of a proper Introduction to Algebrz. Some are ' so very concise, as if they were contriv'd not to ' teach but introduce a Teacher; others again are ' larger, but wrote with so little Condescension to ' the Understandings of such as are altogether unacquainted ' with the Science, that they are of very ' little Use to those who are most inclined to make ' use of them. Whence it comes to pass, that few ' find it practicable to make any Progress in Algebra ' without a Master, tho' certainly-the Science ' in itself is far from surpassing a clear Head, and ' a tolerable Understanding.</p>
               <p>' The Design of this Treatise, which is of a reasonable ' Bulk, and which contains nothing which ' is not solid, and to the Purpose, is to assist such ' as are engaged in teaching Algebra with a regular ' Method, and a large Stock of Examples; to that ' their Scholars may find Employment in their Absence; ' and to enable such as live in Country. ' Places, and must consequently want all other Tutors, ' except Books, to acquire such a Skill in ' this Science, as may enable them to spend a Portion ' of their Time agreeably in the Cultivation of ' their better Parts, and in rendering a natural Method ' of enquiring after Truth habitual.</p>
               <p>' The Treatise begins with a copious Explication ' of the Fundamental Principles of the Art, and of ' the Signs and Method of Notation used therein ' The Author then proceeds to the several Rules, ' explaining them carefully and copiously in all their ' various Cases; so that with a moderate Attention ' it is simply impossible for a Person, who desires to ' be Master of Algebra, to miss of his End.</p>
               <p>' We never find this Writer advancing any thing ' out of its proper Place, or burthening the Mind ' of his Scholar with Rules, before they become necessary: ' He prosesses o have imitated the judicious ' Euclid in this Rebect; and he has done it ' with equal Art and Flicity. By this means he ' has delivered the young Student in Algebra from ' that which is usually be most fatiguing Part of ' the Science, viz. The Doctrine of Surds, in the ' Manner in which it usually taught. By the ' same Means he leads h Reader directly to Equations; ' and, by shewin him the Profit he is to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174310120039"/> ' reap from the Science encourages him to overcome ' all it Difficulties. But ' strong and more ' slowly through the rest of the Work, that whoever ' follow him, may be obliged to become Master ' of every Branch of the Art, so as to be a compleat ' Algebra, before he quits his Book, and ' not a Smatterer</p>

At the of the ' Book, we find abundance of Observations, necessary ' for enlightening such Minds as are willing ' to proceed still farther in analytic Discoveries; ' so that considering the Compass of this Work, ' and that too is very moderate, it is as complete ' as possibly can be expected: And he who is ' thoroughly versed in it. will find no great Difficulties, ' when he proceeds to sublimer Studies. ' The Language is plain and natural. the Book is ' more copious than any other in Examples, and ' the Illustrations of them are so full and clear, ' that is impossible to mistake their Meaning. - </p>
