                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. James William Watts, a gutta percha manufacturer, No. 27, City-road. On the Saturday before the 29th April, I was directed to take some capes to No. 9, Beehive-passage, Leaden-hall-market—I there saw Mr. Smith; I asked for Mr. Gillman, but was not able to see him—I was not able to obtain the money for the capes—in con<lb/>sequence of that I took them back to my master's—a man then came to my master's shop, and I was sent again to Beehive-passage; I took six capes, and I waited there a quarter of an hour—I then saw Newman; he asked if they were the capes that were brought for him to look at—I said, "yes"—he looked at them, and gave me back the highest priced one, and the lowest priced one—we went to the Cape of Good Hope public house, and the other prisoner, Staines, came there, and they looked at the four capes—I then folded them in a separate parcel; I took them with me, and Newman said they were for his brother, and he and I went to lime-street-square—I</p>

On Saturday evening, 13th May, I was on duty near Mr. Sparkhall's, in Cheapside, I saw the prisoners together—I watched them, and saw Lindsey take a pair of trowers from off a bracket at the door, and give them to Jones, who ran down Old Change, and at the corner of Watling-street he stopped till he was overtaken by Lindsey—I took Lindsey, and handed him to another officer, and I ran and pursued Jones, who had run away—I met him being brought back—I had not lost sight of Lindsey from the time I saw the trowsers taken, till I took him into custody—I searched the prisoners; I found on lindsey a dupli<lb/>cate for a pair of boots, and this knife, and this picklock key dropped from.

I had on that farm about 200 ewes—I cannot say to a few, but about that number—the prisoner was my shepherd there to look after them—the ewes were lambing from Lady Day till the latter end of May—I received information, and went to Mr. Lawrence, at Ruislip—I there saw some lambs which appeared to be miner—there was one dead and one alive—they were the same sort as mine—we took the lamb, and put it down, and asked the prisoner if he knew anything about it—at first he hesitated, and then he said he thought he did—Goff then asked him if he had sold any lambs to any one else—he said, yes, he had sold some to Mr. Humphries' son—we went to Mr. Humphries, and found five lambs of the same breed—we took them away, and they were shown to the prisoner—he did not say anything about them—about two months before, he had sold six sheep skins, and I told him never to sell anything of mine, but if anything happened I would sell them myself—he knew that I was at that time riding about the country to get lambs, and offering half a crown a piece for them, to put to those ewes who were in full milk.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Attree, the barrister; I take care of his chambers. On Tuesday, 9th May, the prisoner came to the chambers—Mr. Attree was in the country—the prisoner asked to see Mr. Attree, to see if he could get him a situation—I said I expected than every minute; and he asked to write his name down; he wrote his name at my seat—he asked to wait a few minutes, and he went into my master's office to see if it was high tide—he took both the studs up—he went away, and said he would come</p>

               <p>the next day—I afterwards met him in Elm-court, and he asked me to go with him to buy two penny biscuits—he gave me one, and I ate it—he came back to the chambers, and stayed a few minutes—he went and looked into the cupboard, and two seals were lying there—he went into the bed-room, and he said the things were in a different place—he asked to black his boots—he opened the drawer where the plate was kept, but I did not see him take anything—he said that was where the blacking was—he then got up, and said he would go and see what time it was—he came back, and told me it was 4 o'clock, and he thought I had better go—soon afterwards he went out, and ran away—after he was gone I missed the silver out of the plate drawer—I missed 1 large spoon, some small tea spoons, and other things—I went and told Mr. Dyer, and he came back with me—I then made further search, and missed the gold studs—the seals were missed when my master came home—he returned on the Wednesday—the prisoner was taken on Friday.</p>

On 3rd June., about 9 o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked for two pounds of bacon; I cut it—my mistress who was on the other side of the shop, said aloud in the pri<lb/>soner's hearing, that she did not like the lady's proceedings; she went round, felt down the prisoner's left side and said, "She has got a ham"—the prisoner said, "Oh, you wicked woman" or "bad woman"—I then stepped to the prisoner's side, and saw a ham fall from under her clothes on the left side—I went for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a cheesemonger's shop, at No. 124, Bishops-gate-street. On 3rd June, a little after 9 o'clock in the evening, the pri<lb/>soner came and asked for a piece of bacon—I saw her reaching across and taking a ham out of the window, I went nearly to the bottom of the shop and told my young man that I did not like that woman at the ham—I spoke rather loudly, but I think it is impossible that the prisoner could hear—I went round the counter, and felt a ham on the prisoner's left side—I said, "She has a ham"—she was dressed in black, with a large cloak on—I threw it open, and went to take the ham; she said, "You wicked</p>

               <p>lying woman to say so"—she dropped the ham, and it fell on my foot—I picked it up, and laid it in the window.</p>

I was at the police station, in Bow-street, on the morning of 25th May; I saw some one there, and went to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane—I met Pocock and Thomas on the way—I found the street door of the house open—I went up to the first floor front room; I remained there a few minutes—the room door was opened by some one, and I rushed across the room; the prisoner Jackson seized me by my neck-handkerchief—I got from her, but not in sufficient time to prevent Morris from breaking a mould—I saw him take it from the table, throw it on the ground, and stamp on it—I am quite sure it was a mould, I had seen several before—it was made of plaster of Paris—I seized Morris, gave him to Pocock, and picked up some portions of the mould—these are them—I found no impression on them—I saw an old mould, found in a cupboard—I found this wire on the floor, it is attached to a plate, and two counterfeit sixpences were attached to the wire, and eight more six-pences were on the floor, near the wire—on the mantelpiece I found a num<lb/>ber of base half crowns in a paper box—there were six half crowns and four half crowns separate, all counterfeit, and fourteen shillings; and in a sepa<lb/>rate paper there were six other shillings, all counterfeit—there was a very bright fire, and on the hob was a crucible with some metal in it, which is in it now—it was then in a melted state; the crucible was very hot, I was obliged to get a rag to lay hold of it—I found in a cupboard a battery jar with some liquid in it, which I have got in a bottle—the broken moulds were made of plaster of Paris—there was a slight impression on one of the pieces, I think, of George the Fourth—when I went into the room the prisoner, Riley, made his escape from the table where Morris was at work—Riley got to the door, but was brought back—I prevented Jackson from hitting Pocock on the head with a basin, and she said she would kill any man that took her old man—meaning, I suppose, Morris.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at St. Paul's-row, Camden-town. The prisoner was in my employ about four months—on 26th April I had two sovereigns in my pocket, which I received from my wife that morning—I am positive they were good—I gave the prisoner a sovereign, about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, as he came and said he wanted some bran for the horses—he returned about dusk that evening, and brought a man with him—he said the corn chandler's shop was closed, he could not get the bran; but this man was a coachman, in the neighbourhood, and he would let him have some—he said, "Here is the sovereign back"—I took it, and put it in my left trowsers pocket, where the other was—the next morning, for the first pay<lb/>ment</p>

               <p>I had to make, I tendered the two sovereigns on the table, at a tavern in the City, and the man said one was bad—I looked, and it was bad—it had not been out of my sight—it was given back to me; I took it home, and showed it to my wife—I put it on the chimney piece in the dining room—I should know it again—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to it by a peculiar mark along the edge—on the Sunday following, I discharged the prisoner.</p>

I have been drinking, and am rather nervous"—I did not know his name, and asked him what name I should put upon it—he gave me the name of William Edwards, of the ship <hi rend="italic">Caroline</hi>—I wrote those words on the note—I then took it back to my father, and he gave me five sovereigns—I gave them to the prisoner, and he went away—this is the note he gave me—here is my own handwriting upon it.</p>

On Saturday morning, 6th May, about half past 3 o'clock, I was on duty in George-street, Richmond, and saw the prisoner standing at the top of a paved court, not far from George-street—I went down to know his business there at such an early hour; he appeared very drunk, as if recovering from a drunken sleep—I asked what he had been doing there—he said he had been <hi rend="italic">on the lush</hi> all night; that he met with a woman and went across the water with her, and got drinking along with her; that he had everything that was suitable to his mind, and then he had kicked her, and that she said, "Oh, you have broken my leg"—I asked him why he did so—he said that he was so drunk he could not tell what he did—he then pulled out a purse, and told me he had come from Berkshire the day before, and had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse, and the remaining por<lb/>tion of it was three half crowns, which he showed me—I directed him to a coffee shop, and did not see him again till he was in custody, the same day.</p>

Q.</hi> When did you first go to Mr. Taylor's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 15th May; I obtained the information of the robbery about half past 10 o'clock that evening—I went to the prisoners' house on that same Monday night, with Mr. Taylor—I went again on Tuesday night, with the deaf and dumb lad—I understood from Mr. Bye that he could identify the parties if he saw them—when I got there I saw Platt and another man standing out<lb/>side the house, on the pavement in front of the door—it was about half past 9 o'clock—I thought the deaf and dumb lad did not recognize Platt, and we came away; but when we got a little way, the deaf and dumb lad seemed agitated, and I wrote on a bit of paper, which I have here, "Is that the man?" and he wrote under it, "Yes"—before the boy had written this, I had told Platt he might go to bed very contentedly, for the boy did not identify him; I thought at that time the boy did not recognize him—I went again on the Wednesday morning with Mr. Taylor—I have adopted every means in my power to identify these men—I have tried to take other persons to identify them—there was a milk girl, who thought she could identify them; she was brought to the police court, and could not identify either of them—she did not say they were not the men; she said she did not know any one there—when I took Platt into custody he was not doing anything but standing at his own door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker; the deaf and dumb lad is my apprentice. I was at the police court when Eastcourt was there—the boy took hold of the policeman—I told him that the boy said that Eastcourt was the second party who had run away—Eastcourt must have been very deaf if he did not hear it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Eastcourt's Defence.</hi> About 11 o'clock in the morning, on 17th May, I was at home at work, Mr. Campbell came and told me Mr. Platt was taken into custody on a charge of robbery; my being always at home, I knew Mr. Platt had been at home on Monday; Mrs. Platt wished me to go to state that Mr. Platt was at work; I was rather busy, but I said I did not mind going if I could do the man any good; I went, and was standing out<lb/>side for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; the prosecutor and others were there; I did not know who they were till Mr. Campbell pointed them out to me; after that Mrs. Platt was sitting in the police court, and I was talking to her; the officers came to me and said, "You are one of them; just come here, I will put you on the shelf;" and with that he took me into custody; I could swear that I never spoke to this man above once since I have known him; one night, in the Easter week, we had very warm weather, and Mr. and Mrs. Platt had chairs outside and were sitting, and me and my wife had been out; we came home, and I said, "I shall go to bed, good night;" though I have been six or seven months in the house, I believe no one can say that I went in either of the other rooms; the public houses</p>

Yesterday fortnight, an elderly man came and had a pint of porter; while he was there a young man about the male pri<lb/>soner's size came and talked to him—I cannot say he is the man—there were some pint and quart pots near the fire drying, which had been cleaned just before—some days afterwards I was shown a pint pot by the police; it was mine, and appeared as if it had been recently cleaned, and had not been used since.</p>

I was married to the prisoner on 2nd Jan. last, at All Saints' Church, Mile-end—people said they thought he was a married man at the time, but I thought he was not; he had told me nothing about it—shortly after we were married, I was with him, and my mother met a woman in the street who said that if I was his second wife, she was his first—he then left me, walked away, and said he was not a married man—he stayed away from me after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and live at Harberry-terrace, Ken<lb/>sington. On 8th May, about 11 o'clock at night, I attended Mr. Horrocks, at Notting-dale—I found him bleeding profusely from the nose, with a con<lb/>tused and lacerated wound in the centre of the forehead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had that wound anything to do with the bleeding of the nose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I suppose concussion was the cause of the bleeding—no part of the nose was struck, but the concussion might have caused the bleeding; there might have been some previous defect, I did not trace any<lb/>thing of the sort—he had been bleeding profusely from the nose from the time of receiving the blow—a druggist had been attending him for some hours before I was called in; I stopped the bleeding by plugging the nose; I stopped it almost immediately, after carrying him to bed—I remained with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120040"/>
               <p>him an hour and a half, and then left—I was called to him next morning, about half past 2 o'clock; he was then bleeding again profusely from the nose; I think that was in consequence of neglect—there are some persons who have the disease of bleeding, which is brought on with the slightest touch, and they continue to bleed for a very long time; it is a disease common in some families—a very slight shake will produce bleeding in such persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHARPE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state did you find the deceased the second time you saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost insensible; so much so, that he did not know me; that was from loss of blood—his nose had bled profusely, and was bleeding then—I had given directions that a proper nurse should sit up with him, his wife being eighty-four years of age; and that cold evaporating lotions should be applied to the forehead, and other remedies used; instead of which no nurse was employed, the candle was put out, and his wife went to bed with him—he was seventy-four years of age—on the Wednesday I pronounced him out of danger, I had succeeded in stopping the bleeding, and I thought there was no danger from any other cause—a man of that age does not very readily recover from such a loss of blood, but he had suffi<lb/>ciently recovered to justify me in pronouncing him out of danger—the bone of the forehead was not fractured; it was not at all a serious wound—I was sent for again on Wednesday night, about 10 or 11 o'clock, and then found him in an apoplectic fit—he had quite lost all consciousness and all motion—he died next morning at 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you, with any reasonable certainty, judge what the cause of that apoplectic fit was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not with certainty trace it to any cause; there might be many causes; there was no apparent cause—I opened the head, but found no particular appearances—the functions of the brain may be entirely suspended by causes which do not injure the texture of the brain—there was no appearance on the brain directly connected with the outward wound on the head—I found a very slight softening of the brain opposite the wound, but of a very equivocal nature—there was no effusion of blood on the brain; it was a serous apoplexy, not a sanguineous one—I think it very doubtful whether a blow on the forehead from a stone caused all that I saw.</p>

I was at the London Joint Stock Bank about 4 o'clock, or a little after, on this afternoon—my attention was attracted by hearing some one call out, "Barnett"—my face was towards the clerks, and the other persons were behind me—I heard some one halloo out, "Barnett, he has got your notes"—I looked round, and saw Messrs. Sapte's clerk having hold of the prisoner's left hand, and almost immediately I saw the bundle of notes drop from his right hand cuff—I did not see them go from the one hand to the other, but I saw them drop from his right hand sleeve to the ground, and I saw Mr. Tasker pick them up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, James-street, Bethnal-green. I have lived there about two years—I was married to the prisoner on 28th Sept, 1846, at Hackney Church—I did not know anything about his having a wife, I lived with him a very little time after my marriage; about three months—he deserted me altogether—I have had two children by him—they are dead—though he deserted me, he came backwards and forwards to my father's house—he married me in the name of John Thomas—I never saw Sophia Bayley—the prisoner told me about four years ago, that he was married, when he came to see me with a broad hat band on his hat—he courted me as a single man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am entering clerk to Strut and Sharp, of Wood-street, Cheapside. Firman and Son have an account with my employers—on Saturday, 18th March, some goods were sent to Firman and Son, between 4 and 5 o'clock, and were brought back that night—I had seen them packed up; there were two furniture linings, three pieces of muslin, and something else—on Monday the prisoner called, and said he came from Firman and Son, of the Strand, and he was rather vexed on account of the goods not being sent there on Saturday night—I went to our packer immediately, and asked him, in the prisoner's presence, the reason that the goods were not sent—he said, "I went, and the shutters were down, and I could not get the goods in"—the prisoner said he must take the goods with him, and gave me this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he signed it, and I have another signature, in another book, with reference to these goods—I gave him the goods as per printed order, and he took them with him—it was a portion of what had been ordered—the remainder of the goods were afterwards sent to Messrs. Firman and Son, and a part of them have been sent back, and deducted from the account; all, except those which the prisoner took away—the pri<lb/>soner only took those that are in the written order.</p>

Firman and Son, but do not know on what day—I know the prisoner; I do not know whether he took the parcels or whether he sent for them, as other parcels came for other houses—I know they went from, our house, but do not know where they went to—the prisoner used to call and say, "I shall send you a few parcels;" and he would afterwards call, take the light ones, and say, "I shall call next day:" and if he did not call, I used to send them up by the carts—other parcels were frequently left for Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a button and trimming manufacturer, in the Strand. This signature, "Edward Clay," in this book, is in the pri<lb/>soner's writing—he has been in my service about two years; it was his duty to purchase goods—he had no authority to purchase any goods, which were not required in our establishment—he ought to write orders for goods in a proper order book; this is the order book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I think I engaged him myself—lie ought to sign his name here, under our name, which is printed, and copy the order on the counterparts; the order would then be torn out, leaving the counterparts—there were strict orders given to him—when he had given an order and the goods came in, it was his duty to mark off the invoice, and sign his initials to it as having received them—we did not require any drill on 18th March; I did not give him authority to order any from Hewitson and Co., nor did I see any—if any came I might see it, but I do not say that I should—he did not bring the order book, showing me any such entry—I never saw this invoice for it, until he was in custody—it was his duty to take this other order book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), into the City with him—there is no order in it of any drill having been obtained of Messrs. Hewitson on our behalf—the first intimation I had of it was when the statement came in from Hewitson, about the end of April—that was after the prisoner was discharged—I did not give the prisoner instruc<lb/>tions to order any lawn from Messrs. Crawford and Lindsay, nor did we receive any lawn from them that I am aware of; I have looked through the order book, and do not see their name—no invoice was brought to me by the prisoner respecting it—I did not see the invoice of it, till the pri<lb/>soner was in custody—he had authority to order some goods, but none of these things (<hi rend="italic">The umbrellas and parasol</hi>)—I did not see the invoice of these, till after he was in custody—he had authority to order the shirting, and I had instructed him to get me a pair of curtains, but the other things he had no authority to order—I recollect the curtains being sent, but not the shirting; I do not see any order for them in the order book—he left our</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the wine and spirit trade; I have carried on business under the name of Leman Hart, and Son, in Fenchurch-street, but have moved to Trinity-square, Tower-hill. We had business transactions with the prisoner for two years, up to 1848—on 25th Sept. 1848, he bought five pipes of Port wine of us, at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a pipe, without duty, in bond—it came to 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my clerk sent him the five warrants by post—each warrant repre<lb/>sents a pipe of wine, and passes it from person, to person—on 7th Dec. 1848, he said he had lost one of the warrants marked with a diamond, a "D" and "No. 8" (that warrant came back into my hands in 1850, but I have looked for it, and am not able to find it)—he asked me how he was to get the pipe of wine out of the docks; I told him that the Dock Company would pro<lb/>bably deliver it, having an indemnity from us holding them harmless—he said he was going home, and I requested him to have a good search for it—this indemnity and delivery order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were afterwards sent to him by my orders; I gave them to him, on his declaration that he had lost the warrant for the pipe, No. 8—I should not have done so if I had believed that the warrant was not lost—I afterwards received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it bears the signature which we generally have, and which we have always believed to be Michael Pellett's—I believe it to be his writing, but he and his daughter write so much alike—his daughter managed the business at that time—I received the letter on the following day to that on which it bears date—I heard nothing more of the wine till 1850, when I was called upon by Mr. Watkins to pay the amount, in consequence of my letter of indemnity to the Dock Company—I paid Mr. Watkins the money, and he gave me up the warrant supposed to be lost—I was not aware of this fraud till 1850, and then I was not able to find the prisoner, and I never heard of him till the other day, when we accidentally met him in Mark-lane; he ran away—it was in consequence of the representation he made that we gave him the letter of indemnity—we certainly should not have done so, but for the letter which has been produced—it was the Dock Com<lb/>pany</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Duke of Lancaster's own militia, which is permanently embodied. On 13th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was trying to get into the station at Woolwich—there was a great crowd—it was shortly after the launch of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Albert</hi>—I had a gold watch in my left hand waistcoat pocket, fastened by a bar at the end of a chain to a button hole in my waistcoat—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I felt a pull at the chain, put down my hand, and caught the hand of the prisoner, within two or three inches of my side—I saw his hand doubled, and when I seized it he let go my watch, which dropped into my hand—the chain dropped at my side—it was separated from the watch then, but they had been together—I know the watch was safe the minute before I felt it pulled out of my pocket—I just looked at the watch, and passed it to the inspector—the loop of the watch was broken or cut asunder, so that it quite dropped from the chain—it cost between seventy and ninety guineas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Lucas, of Maize-hill, Greenwich. On Saturday afternoon, 6th May, about 3 o'clock, I was up stairs in one of the rooms in my master's house—I looked out of window, and saw the prisoner Sullivan coming up the pathway to the front door, he was carrying two mats, one before him and one behind him, hung over his shoulder—I know that the street door was open three or four minutes before, when I went up stairs—a coat was hanging in the passage; I can<lb/>not say that I saw it there when I went up stairs, but I saw it in the morn<lb/>ing about 11 o'clock—I did not go down stairs immediately upon seeing Sullivan; as there was somebody down there, I took no notice—I finished what I was doing upstairs, and came down about five minutes afterwards—I saw Mrs. Lucas, and said something to her, she sent me to the front garden for something—I looked round twice and could not see what I was sent for, but looking the third time I saw Sullivan walking down the pathway—he said, "Do you want any mats?" I said, "No"—he was walking down the walk towards the gate, to go out—as I answered him, I at the same time saw the coat under his mats, on his right arm—I took no notice of it to him, but immediately went and told Mrs. Lucas—I came out again with her, and as soon as I got outside the gate I pointed to Sullivan, and said, "That is the man that has taken the coat, but he has passed it to another man who has run away with it"—the prisoner, Savage, was with Sullivan, and an<lb/>other one who is not here, was about a step ahead of Sullivan with the coat under his arm—I saw the coat at that time, the men were going up Maize-hill towards Blackheath—they noticed us, and as soon as they did so, the man with the coat ran in one direction, and Sullivan in another—knowing the man that had the coat was not the one that took it, I took no notice of him, but went after Sullivan, and followed him—the man with the coat turned to the left when he got to the top of Maize-hill, I do not know the name of the place—Sullivan ran towards Vanburgh-fields, Savage was on the hill—I spoke to him, and told him to stop that man for he had stolen a coat, but he took no notice of what I said—the men started off to run when they had got five or six yards from the gate of our house—it was Sullivan who turned round and saw me, and then they ran away—I ran about three miles after Sullivan, I had company part of the way—I missed Sullivan after running about two miles and a half: I lost sight of him—I had no one</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Squire Stephen lucas, of Maize-hill—On Saturday, May 6th, about 3 o'clock, my servant, Louisa Chappel, said something to me, in consecquence of which I went from the side of the house, and followed her outside the gate—I saw three men about six yards from the gate, on the pathway—the prisoners are two of the men, I could swear to them both—Sullivan was carrying two mats, Savage was about three yards behind him, with his hands in his pocket; the third man had a coat—Chappel said, "That is the man who stole the coat, pointing to Sullivan—the prisoners could hear what she said—she then said, "There goes the man with the coat," that man was about six yards in advance of Sul<lb/>livan—I spoke to Savage, and said, "Stop that man, he has stolen a coat;" he made me no answer, I thought he did not hear me—I said again to him, "Pray stop that man, he has stolen a coat;" he then said to Sullivan, "<hi rend="italic">Dick,"</hi> or "<hi rend="italic">Tim</hi>, have you got a coat?" that appeared the signal for Sullivan to run away, which he did directly, and my servant followed him—the man with the coat ran in another direction, I followed him for about 100 yards—a man was passing me at the time in a cart, and I asked him to stop the man—I saw the man drop the coat, I picked it up—the man got away, I could not stop him.</p>

I am servant to Mrs. Hart, of Vanburgh Castle; Maize-hill, it is a school—on Saturday afternoon, May 6th, I was on Maize-hill—I had just let my mistress's carriage out of the gate; it is about twelve yards from Mr. Lucas's house—I saw Sullivan, with two mats on his back, he ran right into my face, and went towards Blackheath; he threw the mats down, and went on the Shooter's-hill road—I heard the servant girl call out, and Mrs. Lucas said, "Will you run and stop that man?" I said I would, and I pursued Sullivan for about four miles, if not more—I kept him in view all the time, except just when he went round the corner, and I was in view of him again in <hi rend="italic">no time</hi>—at the end of the four miles he went into the wood"—I walked up to him, and said, "Get up"—he said, "Oh, yes; let me get my wind first"—I said, "Of course," and then he walked back to Mr. Lucas's house with me—there was no one on the road all the time—the servant girl was a long way behind me; I was by myself, and in the wood by myself.</p>

On Saturday, 13th May, the day of the ship launch, I was on duty at the North Kent Railway Station, about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon—there was a good deal of crowding there, and I saw the prisoner getting behind gentlemen and feeling their coats—I saw him put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and take out this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I seized it in his hand, and spoke to the gentle<lb/>man—he looked at it, and said, "That is my handkerchief, give it to me"—I said, "No, I can do no such thing; I am an officer, and must take him into custody"—he said, "You may do just as you like with him and the</p>

I am stabbed; I am stabbed!"—the prisoner came up to me, pulled the knife out, and said, "Don't say <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, I will give you a shilling"—I fainted away, and was taken to the doctor's, and then to the hospital, where I remained a fortnight.</p>

I am a greengrocer, and live at No. 157, Union-street, in the Borough I was disturbed on the morning of 8th June, some one tapped at my window—I went down stairs, and found the window open which leads into the passage of the public house adjoining—when I went to bed, that window was closed, and a bundle was placed to keep it fast to—I missed the bundle and a tea chest, which was standing on a table close by the window—the bundle contained shirts, stockings, and drawers, and other things—I went into the public house, found the prisoners in custody, and saw my property, which I have described—there are shutters to that window, and they were closed the night previous—they did not fasten; it is a sash window, which opens upwards.</p>

On Tuesday, 9th May, the prisoners came, a little before half past 1 o'clock, they called for two glasses of gin and bitters which I served them with—there are two entrances to our house; it is situated at a corner—one door is in High-street, Peckham, and the other in Red Cow-lane—either of those doors lead to the bar—the bar is an angle—at the corner of the bar there is an entire separation—there is a partition, so that anybody coming in at one door would not be able to get to the persons who came in at the other door—one door would come to the front of the bar, the other to the side of the bar—the partition would prevent one coming in at one door getting to a person coming in at the other—the partition is rather high, no one could look over it, but they might lean over the counter and shake hands—when the prisoners came in, no one else came in, but there was a person in about two or three minutes before, a middling sized man, with fair complexion and light whiskers—he held his head down—I could not see what age he was—he asked for a pint of porter and the newspaper—I gave him the porter and newspaper—when I had served the prisoners, Tookey walked up and took the newspaper from the other party—that was while I was drawing the bitten—I did not hear Tookey ask for the paper, I did not notice him taking it, but he had it when I turned round—Tookey then asked me if I would oblige him with a sovereign for two half sovereigns; I went in the bar parlour, took a sovereign from a purse that was inside the cash box, and gave it him—the bar parlour is just at the back of the bar, facing the door—the cash box stood on a chair just inside the bar parlour—the prisoners were in such a position that they could see all over the bar parlour—the fair man could see the bar parlour through the window—they could all three see the cash box—Tookey then said to White, "Will you have anything else"—White said he would have a glass of cider, for he had tasted our cider before—we keep our cider in a stone lobby at the end of the passage—Tookey said he would have a glass of bitter ale, which we keep in the same lobby as the cider—I took the keys and two glasses, and went out of the bar to call my father—I went towards the lobby, which is a continuation of the place where Tookey and White were standing—I went out of the bar down the lobby—my father was in the kitchen, which is on the right when you get to the end of the lobby; White followed me, and</p>

               <p>Tookey remained at the bar; White stood right in the centre of the pas<lb/>sage—he stood at the doorway leading from the bar to the lobby (we have always kept the cider and bitter ale in that lobby; when any customers have come for them we have always gone there)—I called my father to draw the cider—he asked me to hold one of the glasses, which I did; and I then called the servant, Mary, to come and hold the other glass, for I must go to the bar—when my father drew the first glass of cider, he took it, and I went back to the bar—as I was coming back, Tookey rushed past me—the first person I saw was White, he stood in the doorway, I pushed past him—he was not doing anything, he was standing there, the door was hardly wide enough—he stood right in the middle, I pushed him to get by to the bar—as I came along the lobby I was met by Tookey, he rushed from the bar towards me; he went to the lobby and drank his ale—he did not stop me, I went back to the bar—I stood in the bar about a minute, when my father came in with the money which they had paid him for the ale and cider—the prisoners had not come from the lobby—they then rushed out of the house—that raised my suspicion—they had not got out, when my father called out, "Another halfpenny?" and one of them threw down a halfpenny on the bar, and it fell on the ground; they then went rapidly out of the house—I then went in the bar parlour, and saw the lid of the cash box lying down on the chair which the cash box had stood on—the cash box was then gone—I do not know the amount that was in it—I bad seen two or three notes in it, the rest was in gold and silver—I called out to my father, "The cash box is gone"—he had scarcely got out of the bar from bringing me the money—he was going back to the kitchen—he went out of the door and called out to stop the two prisoners—they were the only persons who were in the house—when I got back to the bar the fair man was gone—I had left him on the other side of the partition at the bar—the prisoners were pursued and brought back—I examined the top of the counter, there was one scratch of their boots as they had jumped over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever seen this fair man before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my recollection—I call him a fair man—he had a very fair complexion, and light whiskers, rather bushy—he was dressed in black, and had a large over coat on his arm; he had a black hatband—he was there more than five minutes before the prisoners came in—he was reading a newspaper—he came in at the side entrance; the jug and bottle entrance—the prisoners came in at the front entrance—you cannot see over the parti<lb/>tion—in the bar parlour, where the cash box was, there is a glass window—the window was filled with glasses—there was a plain net curtain at the window; the curtain is such as you can see through—only I dine in the bar parlour—one end of the window comes about the same distance as the parti<lb/>tion—there is not a door leading into the bar parlour, there is merely an open space; no glass in that—that opening is opposite to where the pri<lb/>soners were standing—it is a very small bar parlour—there are three chairs in it, and a small table—the cash box was standing on a chair, just inside the bar parlour; the chair was facing the doorway, on the right as you went in; about half way up the bar parlour—the three chairs do not stand on that side—I am sure I went to the cash box to get the sovereign; it was in a purse in the cash box—there is no place in the bar where we keep loose gold; we keep money in the till; but when we have a sum in it, it is taken out and put into the desk—the cash box usually stood in the desk, but that morning it was taken out to alter the desk—the desk was taken out, but the cash box was there—we do not keep loose gold and silver in the bar</p>

               <p>parlour—we go every time to the cash box—the key of it was in the desk; it was not locked—the weight of silver and gold in the cash box had forced the lid off—it had been off some length of time; I cannot say how long—the desk was not there that day—it was a common size cash box—I have not the lid here—when I went to call my father I stayed there about a minute—I was about a minute absent from the bar—my father has not been finding fault with me about this matter—he said it was wrong of me to leave the bar—I went before the Magistrate on the same afternoon, and again the next time—my father went with me—my father did not see the fair man—there was no one in the bar but myself—my father had been in the bar half an hour before—there were not any working men about that day—our regular customers had been in—not a great many—I do not know whether there were any that I had not seen before; I did not take parti<lb/>cular notice—I took notice of the fair man, because he was a remarkable man—he had a large coat on his arm, and he had been in previously—he came in about half past 11 o'clock, and had two glasses of porter, and I saw no more of him till about five minutes before the prisoners came in—the first time the fair man came in, he held his head down—he did not ask for the paper then—it was because he held his head down that I noticed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Red Cow, at Peckham, in the parish of Camberwell. On 9th May I remember my daughter coming to the lobby at the end of the passage—I was in the kitchen—my daughter called me to draw a glass of ale and a glass of cider—I had seen the prisoners in the house before, three or four or five times—they just came in for a mere simple thing, a pint of porter between the two, or a glass of gin—I might, have seen them three or four days before 9th May—White followed my daughter—he stood in the doorway—he blocked the door up—he stood some time, and would not decide whether he would have ale or cider—I asked which he would have, and he did not give me a direct answer—he seemed to hesitate; at last he decided that he would have cider—my daughter held the empty glass—I drew the cider, and gave it to White—my daughter went to the door, and I looked and saw Tookey leaning over the bar towards where the cashbox was—my daughter went along the passage towards the bar—White drank what I gave him—I drew the glass of ale, and I heard a noise—I looked, and saw Tookey coming very fast for his glass of ale—he got it, and drank it very quickly—I asked for the money, and White gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was a little way in the passage—as soon as they gave me the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. they were in the act of going out—I said, "Another halfpenny?"—as soon as I had said that they <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the halfpenny down, and went out as fast as they could—my daughter immediately called out that the cash box was gone—I cannot say how much there was in it that morning, whether it</p>

We have not got it"—they said they were innocent; that if there had been a robbery they had not got it, they had got nothing.</p>

I was in my bar; the prisoner came in about half past 3 or a quarter to 4 o'clock—there were three others who came in, and were at the bar—the prisoner went into the parlour, and as he passed he asked for a glass of brandy and water—I took it to him, leaving my sister in the bar parlour—I had a cash box in a drawer in the bar, with from 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—I came back from giving the prisoner the brandy and water, and my sister was there in the bar parlour, and the three men were there at the time—the prisoner then came to the door of the parlour where he sat, and asked for a cigar, which I carried him—I had to leave the bar, and when I left it my sister followed me out, and went to some part of the house—when I left the bar the other three men were there—the prisoner paid me with three penny pieces—when I came back, the three men were still there—the cash box was perhaps two yards and a half from the door—one step and a reach would have reached the small drawer where the cash box was—when I was serving, the drawer was behind me—it was at the back of the bar—when I went with the cigar, one of the three men was standing close to the entrance by which I came out of the bar, and by which I should go in—the beer engine forms the post to the door, and one man stood against the engine—the three men went away in a very short time after I returned—the prisoner went out first, and the other three followed him out, singly—when the prisoner came out of the parlour I noticed him parti<lb/>cularly, because he kept his eyes fixed on me all the way he went—that was</p>

               <p>about two minutes or two minutes and a half after I got back to the bar—I had seen the cashbox and the money in it, about half an hour before the three men came in—I had remained in the bar during the whole of that time, and I can say that no one touched it till I went with the brandy and water—I missed the cashbox in about an hour and a half after the men went away—I had remained in the bar the whole time, and I can undertake to say nobody could have taken it without my being aware of it—there were two or three persons came in, who went in the bagatelle room—they came in for the balls, which were kept in a drawer over the one where the cashbox was—I did not see them take the cashbox.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chimney sweeper, of Brixton. On 7th July, 1852, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the top of Brixton-hill, coming from Streatham towards London with a pony and harness—I took particular notice of him, as I knew it was Mr. Harriss's pony that he was leading, and I am positive he is the man.</p>

On 8th July, 1852, I was near the Salmon and Ball, Bethnal-green, with a friend, we met the prisoner with a pony and harness, my friend asked him if the pony was for sale—he said, "Yes," and that he had a colt at Hackney-marsh, and had been to order some new harness; that he had quite done with the old pony, and if I did not buy it he was going to have it killed—I bought it for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a very old roan gelding pony, and very lame and poor; I sold it next day, or the day following for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Rickman, who was taken up, and taken to the police court—I went as a witness for him, and he was set at liberty—the pony was in the green-yard, and Mr. Harriss paid the expenses and had it-—I have not the least</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I apprehended the prisoners in April, at Barnet; Rainbow was in a gig with a horse in it (the same as has been shown to Welch), and Allen was near the horse and chaise with this basket in his hand, with these chimney ornaments in it—I took them to Barnet police station, and then to Hertford; I drove the chaise with Allen in it, and Rainbow was riding in another vehicle which we hired, with another police<lb/>man</p>

               <p>—Allen was sitting on my left side, and when we were in a bye lane, about seven miles between Barnet and Hertford, he suddenly pushed me out (we were driving at about seven miles an hour); he then got out, struck me about the head, and told me to give up the vehicle to him—I called to the other constable, and when he got up I had let go, and was holding Allen—I had great difficulty in detaining him, from the horse and chaise—I was laid up for some days afterwards, and was considerably injured; this was on 4th April—I took the prisoners to Hertford, and from there they were taken to Hunsdon, and were brought back to Hertford—they were remanded two or three times—as we returned from Hunsdon to Hertford I was riding with Rainbow; and he said, would not it be better for me to take a little money than to separate him from his wife and family.</p>

I do not know Danks's handwriting—this is the docu<lb/>ment that was produced to me; I first received it on 17th March, after I had had the first hearing—I got it from the prisoner's son's house; I do not know whether it was from his son's wife, or who: it was not the prisoner; but I saw him about two minutes afterwards, and said, "Here is a note or paper left for me how is this? I ought to have had it in the morning"—he said he did not know anything about it, it was a mistake, he supposed—I said, "You ought to have gone up with me this morning to the trial"—he said he did not see that—I said, "Yes, you ought; I saw you in the morning, and told you; you said the copy of the document I had was quite sufficient, and you could not spare the time, so I went alone, and so I got beaten; I will put it in force again, and bring you up as a witness"—he said, "Very well, I will go as a witness"—he seemed surprised that I had lost it; he did not suppose I should be beaten—he said, "Well, this document, and the I O U in the book, will beat them the next time, there is no doubt of it"—I showed him the document then, and he said, "That is the document that Danks gave me"—this was on 17th March, after I had had my hearing—I had never seen that document before—I went to him on the evening of 18th April, and told him, "I must have you to-morrow"—he said, "I don't knew that I can go; is the trial to-morrow?—I said, "Yes, I must have you with me"—he said, "Time is time"—I said, "Will you have a glass of something to drink r—he said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, you must give me half a crown</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we lived at No. 17, Brother's-row, Lambeth. On 25th May I went out alone, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning—I came home between 1 and 2 o'clock—I went out again about 2 o'clock, and found my husband at the Windmill public house with two gentlemen, one of whom was Mr. Beldon—I had something to drink, and remained till about 3 o'clock, when I went home and went to bed—I was very tipsy (I left my husband at the public house)—I did not undress; I laid down on the bed, and while I was lying there Mr. Beldon opened my bedroom door, and said something, but I cannot say what he did say—I ordered him out, and he left the room; he had not been a second in the room; he kept the door in his hand—as soon as he went out, I looked the door, and before he was off the stairs my husband came in, and forced the door open with a screwdriver—he entered the room, and I flew to him—I believe he spoke first, and I answered him—I cannot remember the words he said—I sustained my injury from clinging to him; he never hurt me in the least—I cannot say how I sustained it—he had something in his hand—I have no recollection of what he did with his hand, only of my clinging to him on the stairs—I think I cut my head against the door, but am not certain—I have a wound on my head, but it is all healed—(<hi rend="italic">The wit<lb/>ness was cautioned by the Court that unless she spoke the truth she would be committed</hi>)—I cannot speak the truth no farther than I stated before, that, I have no recollection at all of how it came, nor yet what my husband had in his hand—I felt a wound on my head—my husband was then on the stairs—I had hold of him at the time I felt the wound—I cannot say that he had anything in his hand, nor can I say that he had not—I did not see a screwdriver in his hand when he broke open the door, and came into the room—he broke the door open with something—he told me that he broke it open with something; I do not know what it was—I saw nothing in his</p>

On 25th May, I was at the Windmill public house, drinking with the prisoner; his wife came in soon after him, and we had several quarterns of rum, and a glass or two of ale—the prisoner was very bad in liquor, and his wife was very bad, and I was very bad; we were all very bad—I do not remember his wife going away; I do not know which of them went away first; the prisoner was smoking a peculiar sort of pipe; I asked him where he got it from, and he told me he had got several at home, and he would give me one if I required it—I thanked him, and he went out; I thought he had gone home after one—he was gone rather longer than I thought it would take him, and I went after him—I had known him before, and had visited at his house before at his desire—I went to the house and saw Wilkes, I then went up stairs into the bedroom on the first floor—the door was shut; I opened it, and saw Mrs. Copeland there—I asked for her husband; she said he was not at home—I do not think I was a minute in the room—on my leaving I could not swear whether the door was shut after me, for I had my back to it—I reeled against the other stairs, the second flight, and at the same time the pri<lb/>soner rushed up—he said nothing to me—I went down stairs directly and went out, and went back to two of my Mends that I had left at the public house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Wagstaff, a surgeon, of Walcot-place, Lambeth. I was sent for to the station house, in Ken-nington-lane, on 25th May—I got there about half past 4 o'clock—I found Mrs. Copeland there—she had an injury to the scalp, and one on the back of the right hand—the wound on the scalp was an incised wound; it reached the bone; it was about an inch in length; it was not bleeding then—the wound on the right hand was an incised wound, and there was also an incised wound above the left wrist; a screwdriver might inflict such wounds—they were not dangerous—she appeared sober—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood—I do not think that would have sobered her.</p>

I re<lb/>member her being taken ill on 23rd May; I saw the prisoner at the house between 7 and 8 o'clock; I let her in myself and she came into my par<lb/>lour (my mother had let her out twice), she had a bundle—she did not go upstairs that time—I heard her come down stairs, and go out; and I saw her pass my parlour window with a bundle under her visited, it was a con<lb/>siderably larger bundle than the bawl she showed me when she came back.</p>
