I am a milliner, at 252, Regent Street—I have another shop at 210—I also have a shop in the Edgware Road, and two other shops besides, in other parts of London—in February, 1870, the prisoner called on me at 252, Regent Street, and produced this paper—he said he was an agent for the Royal Scottish Plate Glass Insurance Company—I told him I had never heard of the company—he showed me this prospectus, and told me they were doing a large business, their premiums were very moderate, and said he would charge 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the risk if I would insure with him—he said he was only an agent—I asked him if it was a sound affair—he said certainly it was, and that their bankers were the London and Westminster Bank, and that there were substantial directors—he said sufficient to induce me to insure—I told him to look in again, and he came again two days after, and I agreed to insure with him—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me a receipt—I received the policy in a very few days—he brought it one evening—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the signatures to the policy are A. Lumsden, Vicomte De Cissy, and A. M. Walker, secre<lb/>tary—when he brought the policy I did not notice that his own name was written on it as the secretary, although the name on the prospectus is James Anderson—I did not observe that variance—I saw the prisoner several times after that—I insured the shop in the Edgware Road with him about a month after—he said then they were doing a very large business, and were very successful—I then paid him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards insured 252, Regent Street, and paid him the amount on the policy, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I also insured the shop in Shoreditch at Michaelmas, 1870—he then said they were doing very well—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that—this is the policy—it was left with me at Regent Street—the name of the Company in that policy differs from the name on the first policy—he told me they were going to change</p>

               <p>the name of the Company—I did not see any prospectus with reference to that one—I insured 210, Regent Street with him, about the same time—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—all the policies are in the same handwriting—the second policy is signed C. Masterman and A. Lumsden, and A. M. Walker, secretary—the policies, Nos. 3 and 4, are headed "British and Foreign Plate Glass Insurance Company, Limited," and signed A. M. Walker, manager and C. Lain, p.p.—I had occasion to call upon the Company to make good some breakages—I think the first was about May—the skylight was broken at the Edgware Road shop—my clerk communicated with the prisoner, and the breakage was made good—I have no idea what it cost—it was rough plate glass—ground glass—there was a second breakage shortly afterwards, also in the Edgware Road—that was a square of glass in the lobby—it was replaced—the next breakage was about June, in Regent Street—a small fanlight was broken—that was replaced—in putting in the fanlight his people broke another—that was a very large square—I should think it cost 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other three breakages, which were replaced, would cost 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I live at 26, Surrey Road, Blackfriars—last summer, Mr. and Mrs. Burns lodged at my house—at that time Mr. Burns went into Yorkshire, and Mrs. Burns went after him in the autumn—she left twenty seven pawn-tickets with me for articles pledged in our neighbourhood—amongst them was a ticket for a watch and chain, pledged at Mr. Davison's, in the Waterloo Road—I paid the interest for it on 26th November, and got a new ticket—I sent the twenty seven tickets to Mrs. Burns on 22nd December—I wrapped them up in a piece of brown paper, sealed them and tied them round with a small string, half a sheet of paper with writing on it, and three penny postage stamps—I posted it myself at 100, Black<lb/>friars Road, on 22nd, from 5.15 to 5.20 at the latest—in consequence of something that occurred, I made a communication to the Post Office authorities—the letter was addressed to "Mr. Thomas Burns, contractors" office, 114, Hut Terries Tunnel, Ballywife Hole, Ingleton, Yorkshire"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a portion of the paper I sent them in, and this is the letter I wrote, it is dated 22nd December—I had written to Mrs. Burns before, addressed in the same way, and had answers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an overseer of letter carriers at the South Eastern District Office—a letter posted at Blackfriars Road would arrive at the General Post Office and be forwarded in the ordinary course—I see the stamp "Too late" on this brown paper, that would indicate that it arrived too late for the evening mail—if posted after 5.30 it would be too late, and would then go into the "next collection, and be forwarded next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an overseer sorter at the General Post Office—a letter addressed to Ingleton, Yorkshire, would come to our office, and if marked "Too late" would be forwarded at 7 o'clock next morning—the prisoner was employed under me—he came on duty at 4.45 on the evening of 22nd December, and at 4.45 on the morning of the 23rd, and would leave at 8.30—letters addressed to Ingleton, Yorkshire, should go to Lancaster—letters so addressed are frequently mis-sorted—it is a small place, not generally known—if the letter packet was so mis-sorted to the Midland division it would pass through the prisoner's hands, to be re-sorted—if properly sorted it should go to the North Western division, then it would not come to the prisoner—the whole of Yorkshire, with the exception of some few towns is "Midland," but Ingleton is under "Lancaster."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was a sub-sorter in the Midland division—it would be the duty of the midnight sorters to sort letters for the Midland or Lancaster districts; there are a number of them, but this could only fall into the hands of one man out of three—if properly sorted it would not come to the prisoner's district at all, but would go to the North Western division; I don't see any are here from that division—if it was re-sorted again into its right division it would come into other person's hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">He-examined.</hi> The mis-sorted letters go to the general sorting, to be re-sorted to the right division—they are placed on a tray which is pulled up and down with a rope, with a man at each end—the prisoner remained in the service of the Post Office until he was taken into custody during that time he would have access to the Lancaster bag, if so dis<lb/>posed.</p>

I live at 371, City Road—on Saturday night, 4th February, about 1.15 or 1.30, I was returning home from my sister's, where I had been to supper—I was walking with a friend, and when within 100 yards of my own house, all of a sudden three men darted out from some place; I don't know where—one appeared on each side of us, and one behind us—the prisoner, who was one of them, put a piece of fish in my mouth, and said "I want some money; see; I have nothing but this to eat"—I refused to give him anything—he then clapped his hand to my side, where my watch was—I had my coat buttoned up—I pushed him away, and the next moment he struck me between the eyes, and knocked me against the coping of the rails—my head fell back against the coping of the rails—I rose up again, and before I could hardly get my footing, he struck me in the mouth, and knocked my teeth out—I rose again, and one of his companions struck me with a club, or something, at the back of my head, which almost stunned me; it raised up a place as big as a very large egg—the man was striking at me again, but as he was doing it some persons and a policeman came up—my friend, Mr. Moore, had his arms pinioned</p>

I live at 34, Featherstone Building, City Road—I was with Mr. Eschman on the night of 4th February, in the City Road, walking arm in arm; all on a sudden we heard footsteps behind us, and one man came on my side, and one on his, and there was another behind—the one on my side said "Give me some halfpence, master," and the one on Mr. Eschman's side at the same time put a piece of fish round in front of him, using some bad language, and said "This is all I have got to eat, give me some money"—I pushed one away, saying "Get away, I have nothing for you"—at the same time a blow was struck by the prisoner, and Mr. Eschman was swung right away from me—I then made a rush to strike the prisoner with my umbrella, and the other man caught hold of me, and said "Here, you stand back"—another person came up in the mean time, and said "The best thing you can do to help your friend is to get a police<lb/>man"—I immediately rushed up the City Road, and at the corner of Duncan Terrace, I met a policeman, and brought him down, and gave the prisoner into custody as he was about striking Mr. Eschman again.</p>

I received information from White about 9.45, and went into Deacon's coffee-house, kept by Mr. Howell, and there saw the three prisoners and the prosecutor together, with a pot of ale before them—I watched them for more than an hour—when I had watched them about a quarter of an hour Griffiths went out with the prosecutor—they all went out, and I followed them into the "Three Crowns," Dowgate Hill—I went in, and saw them all drinking together there—I called the attention of Newnham, another constable—I saw Griffiths put her arm round the prosecutor's neck, while Cox and Martin covered her, to prevent observation—Griffiths and Cox then left the house with the prosecutor, and Martin remained inside—I afterwards saw Griffiths and Cox leading the prosecutor into Great St. Thomas Apostle—they propped him up against a wall, and left him there—he was very drunk—I asked him if he had lost anything; he told me something, and I took Griffiths and Cox in custody.</p>

I keep a shop in the Latimer Road, and am also managing a building operation at Wimbledon—on the night of the 7th February, I went to bed about 11 or 11.15—the house was then properly secured; I did it myself—about 1.30 in the morning, I heard something moving below—I opened my door and a stream of light came up the stair-case—I ran down and saw three men in the parlour behind the shop—two of them got out of the window and one I secured—I kept him there about half-an-hour, till a constable came—we searched him and took everything he had out of his pockets, and went with him to the station—about 100 yards from the house we took Hasey, and after going along a short distance, Dyke came on the scene—he walked behind me about half-a-dozen yards—I saw a movement with his hands, and I received a blow on the head which knocked me down, and the man I had got away—I missed a quarter of a pound of tea from my room, which I had bought that very day—I believe this to be the tea—I also missed about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one half-sovereign and some silver from a box in the cupboard, and some copper from the till—I am certain the prisoners are two of the men—Dyke was the man who threw the stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not excited at hearing a noise in my house—I was quite cool—there were four men to deal with, three in the house, and one watching outside—I saw three men in the room, and I seized the one that was standing nearest to me; the other two got out of the window—they were not very long about it: they got out as quick as they could—the man that I took in the house escaped on the way to the station—the constable took Hasey on the way to the station—I was not carrying the constable's staff at that time—Hasey did not object to being taken—he did not ask what it was for—he never said a word till we got a little farther on, and then he said he should not go any further—I don't remember the policeman saying "You are an associate, I think you are one of them, I will take you, too"—after Hasey was taken, the policeman gave me his staff, and he said if they were violent I was to strike them with it—Dyke was not taken that night—I was called to the station the next day, and identi<lb/>fied him in a room full of men—they did not tell me Dyke was in custody—they said I was wanted at the station—I went in the room, and they asked me if there was anyone I could recognize as being in my house, and I picked Dyke out—I have no doubt that this tea is my property—it is in a paper—I won't swear to it; but I have no doubt about it—the man who threw the stone at me in the street was five or six yards off—I did not see</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 69). On the night of the 7th of this month, from information I received I went to the prosecutor's house, about 1.30—when I got there I saw him holding a young man of the name of Charles Langley, who has escaped—I had seen him in company with the two prisoners and another man, about 11 o'clock that night—there were four of them altogether—I told Langley I should take him into custody, and we proceeded to the station—when we got about 150 yards from the house I saw the prisoner Hasey, and took him into custody—he said "What do you want me for?"—I said "I will tell you when I get to the station"—we went into the station—I had one in each hand—the prosecutor was following behind—some distance up we saw the prisoner Dyke—Hasey said then, he would not go any further, and I said to the prosecutor "You take my truncheon out, and strike the first prisoner that resists"—at the time we saw Dyke he threw a stone at the prosecutor, which struck him on the head, and knocked him down—he pulled out three stones from his pocket, and threw them at me, one after the other, and Langley got away, leaving his collar and necktie in my hand—I took Hasey to the station—on the following morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I went to Dyke's house, 7, George Street, with Couchman—he was in bed—I told him we should charge him with being concerned, with others, in custody, in committing a burglary in the Latimer Road—he said "I suppose I must go with you"—I searched the room, and found this 1/4lb. of tea on the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at 95, Stainsby Road, Limehouse—on Saturday night, 28th January, I went to the prisoner's house, in Church Row, Limehouse—I there found the deceased, the prisoner's son, John William Robert Bull—he was my brother-in-law—he was there alone—I sat down with him for two hours—the prisoner then came in—he said to his son that he did not wish to see him in his place—the deceased, on that, got up and struck his father, and knocked him out of his chair, on to the floor; that was the first blow that was struck between them—the prisoner tried to get up again on to his seat, and I put the deceased out of the room—in the first scuffle the table was upset, and the lamp thrown down and broken; it was then all in darkness—the deceased rushed in again, and struck his father again, knocking him out of the chair on to the floor—I saw him strike as he came in, and I tried to get between them, and parted them—there was no light but the fire; that was very dull—he got up, and</p>

               <p>his son went towards him again—they closed, and the son turned round and staggered towards the door—I did not see the prisoner strike him—he opened the door and walked down stairs, and when he got to the bottom of the stairs he fell—I went down, hearing him fall, and saw him bleeding from the head, and insensible—I procured a light, and instantly went for the doctor—the deceased was intoxicated, and the prisoner was also under the influence of liquor—I afterwards examined the stairs, and noticed blood on every stair he had come down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner bean the character of a very humane, feeling man—he lived close to the canal, and has saved the lives of three or four persons, who have attempted suicide there—I did not see him use any scissors, or any instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 4, Commercial Terrace, Lime-house—on the night of 28th January, I was fetched to 11, Church Row—I found the deceased there; he was already dead; he was lying on the floor, with his head resting between his father's knees, deluged in a pool of blood—there was a punctured wound on the crown of his head, a wound on the left knee, that had been a punctured wound; but the instrument coming in contact with the bone, had rather jagged it—on the inner part of the right thigh there was a deep punctured wound—there were one or two minor abrasions on the face, of a superficial wound, on the bridge of the nose—I think it very possible that the sharp-pointed blade of these scissors (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would make such wounds as I saw—I made a post-mortem ex<lb/>amination—the cause of death was exhaustion, produced by hemorrhage, the result of the punctured wound in the right thigh—it was about an inch and a half in depth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no sign of blood on the scissors—the wound on the head was a simple punctured wound, near the vertex—I did not attach any importance to that wound in itself—the prisoner appeared to be in a state of excitement and grief at what had happened—I interrogated him if he knew how it occurred, or who was the cause—he said he did not; he did not know how it happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 75, Campbell Road, Bow, and am a floor-cloth manufacturer to a large extent—on 31st January I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the envelope marked "A"—in consequence of that I spoke to the police, and on 3rd February I wrote a reply—on the 8th I received this other letter marked "C"—I wrote another reply to that, and received this marked "E"—I wrote again—this is the letter I then wrote (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was sent to the address mentioned in the letters—I know nothing of the prisoner beyond having seen him at a house of business three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never seen him write—I have a letter in my pocket which purports to be signed by him, written from the prison—when I received the first of these letters, I did think something of it, inasmuch as I had discharged a man some three or four mouths before, and that man told my watchman that he would burn my place down, and when I received this letter I thought very likely it might be connected with him in some way, and I immediately placed it in the hands of the authorities at Arbour Square—I thought that somebody had heard of the workman's threat, and was trying to get money out of it.</p>

"Sir, it is impossible I can explain until I have re<lb/>ceived the reward. I would not incur the loss or injury for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to say the least, if I were you.

I am assistant to Mr. Ryder, who carries on busi<lb/>ness as London and Ryder, at 17, New Bond Street—on 12th January, in consequence of a message, I went to 4, Upper Berkeley Street, about 5.30—I took with me between 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery—the man who had called at our shop, and who gave his name Mark Tyrrell, opened the door—he apologized for his servant's absence, and asked me into a room on the ground floor, where I left my hat, and then I went up into the drawing-room—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of the man who called himself Mark Tyrrell—the prisoner was sitting by the drawing-room fire, and she remained sitting while I took out of my bag the ornaments which the man had seen at our establishment—I put the remainder of the jewellery in the bag, under a small round table—I stood on the nearest side of the table to the door, and Tyrrell and his wife on the other, looking at the jewellery, which was then in cases—I showed a necklace worth 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Tyrrell admired it and said he should like his wife to have that, or one with a diamond pendant which was worth 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of two diamond half-hoop rings—the value of the things I had on the table was 2600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Tyrrell said that he thought his wife's sister had better see the things; he said to the prisoner "Go and call your sister"—she left the room, and I continued standing at the table, with my back to the door—she came back in I think two minutes, and said her sister would be there in a minute or two—I just turned round as the door opened; she came very quickly behind me and placed a handkerchief saturated with something over my face and mouth—there was a smell to it—as she did that the man rushed at me, caught me round the arms in front and clasped me—the handkerchief was still over my face—I struggled to get clear of the man, and also to get the handkerchief from my face—I managed to get it away for half a minute, but the man continued to hold me sometimes by the throat, and sometimes clasping his arms round my chest—the prisoner kept the handkerchief to my face when I allowed her to do so—it was applied to my face again continually—this went on for some minutes, and I was forced backwards on the sofa—I was becoming uncon<lb/>scious at that, time—when I was on the sofa the man held the handkerchief to my face—I became unconscious—I was strapped across my chest, and another strap went two or three times round my legs—I am not certain whether the prisoner was then in the room, but the man stood over me and said "If you move, I will murder you"—that was when I began to struggle to get up, having partially recovered my senses—I asked him to loosen the strap across my chest, and he did so, one hole—I then tried to get into a sitting posture, to look at the table, but he forced me down again and tied a handkerchief over my eyes—I do not think that was the same handker<lb/>chief which he had used before—he said that if I remained quiet, someone would be sent to me in ten minutes—I then heard him say "Quick, Lucy, with my hat"—after that I heard the street door slam—I ultimately got the straps that bound my wrists undone, and then undid that round my chest and legs, and broke the window and called for assistance—I have seen some straps in the custody of the police, those are what were used—I missed the jewels from the table, all except a small gold chain, but the cases were left about—the jewellery in the bag was left—the prisoner was dressed in fashionable style, as you would expect to see a lady—when assistance came, there was nobody in the house—these are two of the articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the fact of the prisoner being indicted, not as a</hi> "femme sole," <hi rend="italic">but as the wife of Torpey, rendered it unnecessary for him to call witnesses to prove her marriage; in addition to which, Mr. Metcalfe, in his opening address, had admitted that she was the wife of Torpey He there<lb/>fore submitted that she was entitled to an acquittal, without the case going to the Jury, even if she had taken a more active part than her husband.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) I have been for four or five months watching Messrs. Defries' premises, in Houndsditch—I know the prisoners—the two Hodges are in partnership in Norfolk Gardens, Shore<lb/>ditch—I have also had those premises under observation—on 28th October I watched Messrs. Defries' premises from 7.45 in the morning, with George Blanchard, up to a little before 9 o'clock—Harvey came there at 8.5 and about 8.58, or 8.59—a truck came out of the import warehouse on the right hand side of Gravel Lane, with two crates of goods and an empty hamper on top of them, in charge of a man in Hodges' employ—I made a memorandum at the time of the marks on the crates; one was "Diamond G 1025"—the other was defaced as if it had been rubbed out—I could not distinguish any letter or number—I followed the truck to Hodges' place, and it was taken into their yard—Blanchard accompanied me as far as we dare go—I communicated with Sutton, a metropolitan policeman, who was on duty, and then returned with Blanchard to Gravel Lane—about 11 o'clock on the same morning I saw the same man with a barrow come to Messrs. Defries' warehouse—he took another crate out marked "Diamond G 1207," and I followed him to Hodges' place, the same as before—just before the barrow came out I saw Harvey standing on the pavement opposite the export warehouse in Gravel Lane—the import warehouse is on one side, and the export on the other—he was near the door at which the truck came out, at the time it came out, but on the opposite side of the way—at about 1.20 we saw Harvey come from "Polly's" public-house, next door to Messrs. Defries—we followed him to Hodges'—he returned from there at 1.50, and got to the prosecutor's about 2 o'clock—at 9 o'clock the same night I saw Mrs. Hodges at the warehouse, and saw Harvey come out of the prosecutor's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187102270047"/>
               <p>warehouse—I followed him to the "George," in Fenchurch Street, where he was met at the bar by the female prisoner—they remained there about ten minutes, and then came out and walked arm in arm up Leadenhall Street, talking—they turned down Bishopsgate Street, and went into the "Black Bull"—I went in at the other side of the bar, to watch them, and saw Mrs. Hodges put something into Harvey's hand—I could not see what it was—I followed her to Shoreditch; she took a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—next day, the 29th, Saturday, I watched Messrs. Defries' promises—Harvey arrived at about 8.5, and about 10.50 I saw a crate come out on a barrow, drawn by the same man—the crate was marked "Diamond G," but the number seemed to be obliterated; all I could see was "539," which did not appear to be the whole number, but we could not get near enough to see what the number was, which was defaced—I followed it to Hodges' place, and it was taken into the yard, where Mrs. Hodges. and her son were—they both helped to it unload—their yard is a very awkward place to see well; but I saw John Hodges take some glass moons out of the crate; he had four in each hand; he followed me up behind, and I went round into Shoreditch—he took them into the "Fountain" public-house—on 31st October I saw Harvey at Hodges' place, about 1.15 p.m.—he was there about twenty minutes, and went into the "Fountain" with John Hodges—on Friday, 4th November, I saw the three prisoners in the "Nag's Head," Houndsditch—John Hodges fetched Harvey from the warehouse, and Mrs. Hodges was there—Harvey went in, and I followed into the private bar, on the other side—Mrs. Hodges had some gin, changed a sovereign, and gave Harvey a half-sovereign, a florin, and a sixpence—Harvey then spoke to her; but I could not catch the words; she then changed another soyereign, and gave some more silver to Harvey, I cannot say how much—Blanchard was in the bar—on Friday evenings Mrs. Hodges used to come at 6.30 or 7 o'clock, and wait till Harvey joined her, and John Hodges used sometimes to be in their company—that went on on Friday evenings, up to 3rd February—on Friday evening, 3rd February, I took Harvey outside the "City Arms," Heneage Lane, and saw the other two prisoners taken at the same time; they were all together—I said to Harvey "I hold a warrant for your apprehension, for conspiring, with other parties, to defraud Messrs. Coleman Defries, and others; the warrant I will read to you at the station"—going along he said "I do not know anything about it; this is done out of spite; <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Lane has <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on us"—I searched him at the station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., among which were three shillings, which I had marked that afternoon, and given to Mr. Norton, at Mr. Defries' house, to be paid to Mrs. Hodges—I afterwards went to 11, Manor Road, South Bermondsey, where Harvey lived, and saw his wife—I searched the premises, and found the articles mentioned in the list "No. 1"—I also went to 4, Boundary Court, Shoreditch, where the Hodges lived, and found the property specified in list No. 2," in John. Hodges' room, and in Mrs. Hodges' room what is in list "No. 3."</p>

I had the prosecutor's premises con<lb/>tinually under my notice for four or five months, always all day, and some<lb/>times all night—the premises are extensive—I never went inside Hodges' gates—I saw the same man take goods to Hodges &amp; Sons on many occasions during the four months; sometimes four or five times a day, and some<lb/>times he did not come at all—the crates are not here—they were about 5 ft. long, 3 ft. deep, and 2 1/2 ft. wide—these moons were taken out of them, and I informed Messrs.

I am a widow, and keep this house, 200, Walworth Road—on 6th February I left Mrs. Soyer in charge of the house, about 7.20—I locked my bedroom, and took the key in my pocket—I returned about 11 o'clock, and found my door open—I cannot tell whether it had been picked; but I can lock it now the same as before.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at Hammer Street, Rother<lb/>hithe—on 29th December I went to the "Ship Tavern," Rotherhithe, about 5 o'clock—the prisoner was there, a man named Aldridge, and Thomas Wallis, who keeps the "Ship"—I am not aware that James Holden was there—I had some beer with Aldridge—the prisoner was in the next com<lb/>partment—he asked me if I was after any cheap beer, and I said "No, what beer I have I can pay for without any grumbling"—ho said "No, you can't, you monkey"—I said "Don't call me a monkey any more, not in here"—he said "Come here," and beckoned to me—I went and asked him what he wanted—he said "Nothing with a thing like you"—I then hit him in the face, and then on the head; two blows—he said "What do you mean by that?"—I said "What you like, go on with it, if you like"—he said "I will go on with it," and he struck me in the belly—the blow hurt me—it cut through my trowsers, and went into my flesh—Wallis said "Stevens, you have stabbed that man"—I then took the prisoner by the nose, and the hair of his head, and pulled him out of the place—I was afterwards taken into another room, and my trowsers were unfastened—I found I was bleeding, and I went out of the room—the wound did not bleed much at first, but I bled wonderfully afterwards—I was in the hospital five weeks, under the care of the surgeon—my shirt was cut as well as my trowsers.</p>

               <p>—I did not hear the beginning of the disturbance, but I heard Pearson say that he would punch the prisoner in the mouth if he said that again—what he said I don't know—the prisoner said "You had better come and do it then, "with that he goes round and opens the door, and gave him a shove, and asked him what he meant, and he said anything he liked, and with that he punched the prisoner in the mouth, and struck him a second blow on the ear—Mr. Wallis, the landlord, said he would not have any bother in his house—the prisoner said he did not want to fight at all, and the prosecutor went up and shoved him in the chest, and said "Alter it, if you like"—the prisoner said "I will alter it, then," and made a plunge at the lower part of the prosecutor's stomach—the landlord said "Jack, you have stabbed that man"—he said "No, I have not"—I saw the prisoner draw back from Pearson, and he drew his hand up his thigh, as if he put something in his pocket—I did not see what he had in his hand at that time, but I had seen a knife in his hand some time before—the prisoner and another workman were <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> together at this door—it was unbolted, and the prisoner said "Stop, I will soon fix him," and he opened a kind of hook at the back of the knife, and tried to slip the bolt, to bolt the door, but he could not—that was about three minutes before the quarrel took place—there was not much blood from the wound at first; there was afterwards—after I saw the wound I went and said to the prisoner "Jack, what have you done that for?"—he said "What have I done?—I said "You have stabbed him"—he said "No, I have not"—I said "Yes, you have"—he said "If I have done any<lb/>thing it was with the hook you saw me trying to slip the bolt with, I never opened either of the blades of the knife"—I took Pearson to the hospital—they were both the worse for drink—the prisoner was worse than Pearson.</p>

I am the landlord of this public-house—on 29th December, about 5 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, the prosecutor, and his mates, came into my house—they had some drink—the prisoner was in one compartment, and the prosecutor in the other—the bolt of the partition of the bar was broken, and the prisoner could not shut it—the knob was off, and it wanted something to shove it forwards—I saw the prosecutor strike the prisoner twice—I did not see what passed before that—the prosecutor asked if he could alter it, and the prisoner said he soon would, and with that he hit him in the stomach, and knocked him up against the partition—I had seen the hook in the prisoner's hand before, and I said "Jack, you have stabbed that man!"—he said "I have not"—he drew his hand up, and put it in his pocket—I never saw the knife—I did not think the man was stabbed; I thought I had spoke out of my turn—the prosecutor seized hold of the prisoner by the nose and hair, and dragged him into the large parti<lb/>tion, and I went round the bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon, at Guy's Hospital—on 29th December, about a quarter past 6 o'clock, Pearson was brought to the hospital—I examined him—I found a clean cut wound in the lower part of his belly, rather on the right-hand side—it entered the cavity of the belly—it was a dangerous wound—he was in the hospital five weeks—he went only fairly, but not rapidly—the wound could not have been caused by the hook which I have heard of, because then there would have been a jagged edge—the trowsers and shirt were cut through—the wound has healed now, but he is still weak.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the hook had been worn down so as to be as narrow and sharp as a knife blade, it might have caused the wound; but not else—it was a clean cut wound, about two-thirds of an inch long, and it entered the belly. <hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Isabella Street, Broadwall, and am a carman—the prisoner and her husband rented a room of me—on 6th February, my wife was out rather late—she came in about 8 o'clock, or 8.30, and I began to blow her up—the prisoner and her mother, of course, took it up—I begged the mother to hold her noise, because she did not hold any occupation in my place—then the prisoner came and struck me with her fist, when I was in my chair—I took her and got her into her own room, and shut the door, and went back to my own kitchen—the prisoner came after me again, I believe with a knife, and cut my lip—I got her into her own room again, and shut the door again, and then I rushed out into the street to get help—my lip has been sewn up—the prisoner's mother hit me with a poker—a hammer was used, but I did not get struck with that—I had not had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

I am an iron-moulder, and lodge in this house—on the night of 6th February, about 8.30, I was with Durling in his room—Mrs. Durling came in, and he began wrangling with her because she had not got his tea ready—I came out, and stood against the door—the prisoner's mother came up, and said if it was her husband she would pull his nose as long as her arm—Durling came out, and said it was nothing to do with her; she did not rent any part of the house, and he wished her not to interfere with him and his wife, and he would turn her out if she was not quiet—the prisoner came out of her room, and let him know that it washer mother that he was going to put out, and with that, she met him, and struck him several times—he pushed her into her own room—he then came to speak to me at the foot of the stairs, and before he could say very many words she came out with something in her hand—I don't know what it was—I saw something shine in her hand, and she made a strike at him as he was going to put the door to—he was coming out again, to go for a constable, and she met him again with a hammer, and struck at him, but I don't think she hit him; it hit the wood—I heard him say "Oh!" when he shut the door—they had a scuffle in the passage—as soon as he came out of his room I saw him saturated with blood—they fell twice—I saw the prisoner's sister pulling Durling's hair, and very fortunately she did, for I think that was the <hi rend="italic">instigation</hi> of the hammer hitting the wall in place of his head—I went up to my own room—I came down again, hearing a knock at the door, and the prisoner said the first b——that came and opened the door she would settle him.</p>
