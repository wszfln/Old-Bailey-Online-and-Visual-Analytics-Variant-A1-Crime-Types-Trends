On the 9th of October three men came to my house, one of the young men had lodged in the house in my husband's time, a twelvemonth before, and the prisoner was another of them; one of them sat down, and said they must have something to drink, but they did not send for any thing; they staid in my house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I was standing with my back towards them at the washing tub. I knew the other two men for two years past; the prisoner I had seen but three times before, one of these men was a sailor, and the other had been a footman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before these men came to your shop had you any watch there - A. Yes; I had a watch hanging at the mantle shelf while they were in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your back towards the mantle-piece, or your face - A. My back. There was nobody in the room but the three men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any silver tea-spoon about the room - A. I had a tea-spoon in the cups and saucers, on the mantle-piece. When the man had been gone out five minutes I missed my watch and spoon, there was a silver sixpence on the blue ribbon of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the watch - A. I cannot say. When I missed my silver watch and spoon I immediately went out, I saw neither of them in the street. From information I went to the Yorkshire Grey public-house and took one of them. About eleven o'clock at night; I gave him in charge of the watchman; the other two I could not find that night. The prisoner was taken up upon another charge. I went to the prisoner and saw him, I just saw one eye and his side face, I could not swear to him then; he was in a sailor's dress when he came to my house, and when I saw him in prison he was differently dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now and tell me whether you can safely say he the man - A. I can take my sacrament oath that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your watch again - A. No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body go into Mrs. Woodgear's room - A. Yes, I saw three men, one in a sailor's dress, another in a groom's dress, and the other in a blue coat and a pair of corderoy breeches; they staid in the house about a quarter of an hour; I saw one come out first, the other two came out in about five minutes, and Mrs. Woodgear came out five minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the hands of the man that came out first - A. The man in the corderoy breeches came out first, and then the sailor and the groom came out; the groom had the watch in his hand, he gave it to the sailor, and they all ran off together; the prisoner was one of these men, he was in a sailor's dress.</p>

The man told me he saw it done, and he would fetch them. In an hour he brought me the stockings, the stockings he brought me were like the stockings I had missed, but I could not swear to them; the mark had been taken off, and the thread that stitched them together; they were separated.</p>

            . I am a journeyman coach-maker,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050004"/>I work for Mr. Mitchell in Tottenham-place. On the 16th of November I was going from Bedford-square to St. Giles's, I was coming down Charlotte-street, I observed the two prisoners at the bar standing against the shop window of Mrs. Clarke in Great Russel street, the boys were in Russel street, against the window I observed that as I came down Charlotte-street; I am sure the prisoners are the boys, I knew Berry before. On my crossing the street, from Charlotte-street to Great Russell-street, I observed Glover making a hole in a pane of glass, I saw an instrument in his hand, I imagined it to be a knife, but was not nigh enough to see what it was, I found this knife on him afterwards; at the time that Glover made a hole in the window, Berry with a piece of wire, drew out this pair of black silk stockings that I have in my hand, Glover took them and put them in his bosom, they walked away together. I was crossing the street at the time this was done, it was done in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day might this be - A. Between eleven and twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning might it be - A. To the best of my knowledge a dullish morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people walking along the street - A. Yes. When they walked away I went and told Mrs. Clarke of the loss, and that I would get an officer to take them as soon as I could; I followed them into George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you went to tell Mrs. Clarke did you lose sight of them - A. They crossed the street and went towards St. Giles's, they went down the lower part of Charlotte-street, and then they went into Dyot-street, it is now called George-street. I kept them in sight the whole time; in going there they met with

me, and two small boxes, and locked me up.</p>


               <p>Tooley's Defence. On this morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was going out to get two pounds of potatoes, I live in a cellar in Buckeridge-street, and just as I came out of this cellar, met a young man, he asked me to pawn these silk stockings, he said he would give me a shilling, I was to pawn them for six shillings, I opened the stockings, I said they would not lend six shillings, he said they would, this gentleman rushed by me and almost knocked me down, I said holloo, cannot you look before you, I took the stockings open in my hand to Mr. Hinckesman, and held my hands on the counter, there were four people in the shop, no one came to serve me; one, this young man came in with this young lad, he had hold of him by the collar, he pulled the stockings out of my hand, and said to Glover, where did you get these stockings? I said, the young man that I had the stockings of is out of door, it is not him; Mr. Hickesman said, take them all together, I followed them up Bow-street, I met Mr. Blackman, they passed me, this young man's sister saw me at Bow-street, she said I had a right to be there to clear him if I could, he said she was his sister. Mr. Blakeman came there and took me to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050005"/>pawnbrokers, I said I was the person that had the stockings from a young man in a blue coat and check pantaloons, and while Mr. Blackman went for the mother of the child I had in my arms, this young man took me into Mr. Britten's and gave me a glass of liquor, he said, if you will tell me who gave you the stockings, he would be a good friend to you, with that they took me off to Bow-street.</p>

She left the duplicate upon the counter, and in half an hour she was to come back to know if I would have it; she did not come, I sent my servant maid for it, as she told me it was a great bargain, she wished me to do so to see what a great bargain it was; I sent a servant with the duplicate, and three pound that it was pawned for, and a shilling to pay the interest.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these rivets - A. On Monday the 5th of November they were taken out of the factory by the prisoner, he had the rivets about him when I saw him; from information I came to the prisoner, I found him laying on his face upon the ground, the constable was sent for, and before the constable arrived the prisoner dropped some rivets from his bosom. When the constable came the prisoner took some more from his bosom, and put them on the ground. The constable took him to his house, and before he came back with the constable he dropped a false key that unlocked our warehouse door.</p>

Yes; the prisoner was the fifth or sixth man that passed; I went into the work shop, and told him I understood he did not come honestly by the brass, that he sold to me half an hour ago; he asked me who said so.

            . I am an officer of Shadwell; on the 10th of November I searched the prisoner's apartment; he was not at home; we found ten pound of metal, and a quantity of leather. In half an hour afterwards I apprehended the prisoner going home; knowing of me he wanted to know what I wanted with him. When we got near the office-door, I told him about some leather; he then put his hand in his side-pocket, and pulled out this piece of leather and throwed it away; I picked up the leather; I searched him at the office, and found another piece of leather; he acknowledged that it was his master's leather, and said he was sorry for it.</p>

About twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050010"/>o'clock we were going by the prosecutor's house to our own houses. I discovered the door of Mr. Ashby's warehouse open. I looked through the key hole of Mr. Ashby's warehouse door. I saw the prisoner Cockshead fill this bag; he tied it up; I did not see House then; I went to Mr. South, told him what I had seen; we agreed to watch. I returned to Mr. Ashby's premises and found the warehouse in darkness; I returned to Mr. South, we separated one above the house and one below the house; I was compelled to take a small circuit to get to the upper part of the house, as soon as I had done that I saw the prisoner, House, cross from Mr. Ashby's house with the bag upon his shoulder; I immediately seized him and called Mr. South, he begged me to let him go, to consider his family and called me by name, I asked him what he had got there, he said, some flour that Mr. Ashby's servant had given him; he still begged me to have mercy on him, to consider his family; I told him he had no consideration for Mr. Ashby's family, neither should I for him. Mr. South and I took him to Mr. Ashby's door with the flour, called Mr. Ashby up, who admitted us, we then sent Mr. Ashby for a constable, Mr. South and I and both the prisoners were in the bakehouse; Cockshead pretended to be asleep. We have since weighed the flour, I am in the business, it is worth twenty three shillings and nine pence.</p>

We took Jones to St. James's watchhouse, before the constable of the night; Jones was charged and put into confinement; he was searched, a seal and six shillings was found upon him. We went on our duty again, we found that Mr. Phillips's was broken open.

We alarmed Mr. Phillips, he came to us; one of the St. Ann's men came up, and said, he had one of the party, that was Prescott; Phillips was by at the time, Phillips and I went with that man, we saw Prescott.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at two o'clock all was safe at Phillips's - A. Before the clock struck two, and after I returned from apprehending Jones, I found it was broken open.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see that - A. No, I saw Ford take the prisoner opposite of my box, I went up to him; we both laid hold of him together; Hopkins dropped the property as soon as we laid hold of him, I took it up and took it to St. James's watchhouse, and left it with the constable of the night, Mr. Scott, and we left Hopkins in his custody.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORD.

               <p>Q. How far is Hopkin's-street from Phillip's house - A. About three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. to M'Carthy. How far is the place where you stopped Hopkins from Phillips's house - A. More than five hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ford. You took Hopkins in custody - A. Yes; and my partner took the things. We delivered them both in custody at the watchhouse.</p>

            . I was a watchman in King-street, St. Ann's. The patroles came and gave me notice, after two o'clock, that there were thieves about; I went down Princess-street, after I had made a report at the watchhouse. Where Phillips lives, not quite opposite to his house, I watched a jeweller's shop in the street, I saw it was secure; these three men came across me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the three men, are you sure they are the three men - A. Yes, I am quite sure of Jones, I knew him to be a bad character, I had seen him in a public-house in Frith-street; I can take upon me to say, that I saw all these three young men, they seemed to be intoxicated in liquor, they were locked armed. Watchman, said they, will you give us something to drink; no, said I, I have got nothing to give you to drink, nor do I know where there is any. They said, if you will come along with us to the watering house, we will give you something to drink; I want none, said I, I have a person to call up that is going in the country, I cannot go with you. I went to the corner of Dean-street, where my stand is.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you see from your stand up Princes-street - A. I could if it was moonlight, it was a moonlight night; so Prescott came up to me alone, he said, watchman, what o'clock is it; I said, almost three; I got up and went towards Upper King-street, he went away down Gerrard-street; I saw him go into another street, and went down George-yard, there are carts there, and a great many premises backwards; out of George-yard he went into Princess-street, where Phillips lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you followed Prescott down into Princes-street - A. Yes; he crossed over the way to Phillips's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You represent Prescott to be alone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came into Princes-street did you see him join any one - A. No, I saw him go up to Phillips's door, and there he appeared to be talking to some people; I could hear them talk, but not distinguish what they said; I heard a wrench of a shutter or a door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at the time tell who they were - A. I could not, I did not go nigh them expecting them to be bad people.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you could hear them wrenching of something - A. Yes, Prescot said, coming across the street, all is well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him cross the street - A. Yes, I was in the yard at the time that he crossed the street, and said this. When he came out and crossed the Dean-street, I followed him and sprang my rattle, and my partner, his name is Daniel, he and I took him and brought him to St. Ann's watchhouse, and there he had no name, nor would he tell where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the talking of people, can you take upon you to say how many people there might be - A. No, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You began to say that you knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050012"/>Jones, he was a bad character, do you know there is a reward for a burglary - A. No, not to my knowledge, I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in London - A. Twenty-six or twenty-seven years, but part of that time I have been abroad, not all that time in London.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that Prescott accosted you, asked you what the hour was, after you had observed what he and the other men were about. You say you retired after you had seen the men to the place where you were accustomed to stand - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you would have us understand, Prescott accosted you, and asked what the hour was - Yes, about six or seven minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you heard a wrenching, you and another watchman were watching, was not there some watchmen in that neighbourhood near you - A. There was one.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you communicated to the officer of the night, that there were some thieves about - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you supposed that these people were about something mischievous and bad - A. I had no suspicion at the time, until after he had passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were behind a cart did not you then suspect that something was going wrong - A. I did not suspect particularly then.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many people going along Princes-street - A. I could hear the noise of more than one or two, the street was very quiet except these people.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Prescott you had never seen before that night - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said it was a dark night - A. It was not a very dark night, nor very moon light.</p>

               <p>Q. It might be moonlight, was it moonlight or not - A. It might be moonlight, and it might be a dark cloudy night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not assign it as a reason that you could not see down the street - A. I could see best part of the street down.</p>
               <p>Q. Your answer to my Lord was, that if it was a moonlight night you could see down the street - A. I was not in the street, I was in the mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Prescott that night was a stranger to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would have us believe that you saw him near Phillips's house - A. I saw him different times.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought these men were doing something that was wrong why did you not take them - A. In the first place they were six in number, we did not like to attack them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that Prescott was one of the men that went to Phillips's house - A. I did not say that.</p>

            . I was constable of the night of the 21st, Hopkins and Jones they were brought before me, they were searched, a seal was found upon Jones, that I returned to him; Ford and M'Carty came together, bringing in Hopkins; they produced a bundle, I have taken care of it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. No implements of any sort were found upon them - A. No one at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The property is mine some are marked and some are not.</p>
               <p>Hopkins' Defence. I was passing from my lodging in Compton-street to go to the Jews Harp, I dle, I saw this bundle, I picked it up; I was stopped by the watchman, he asked me if I had got my master's things; I said it is of no consequence to you; he said, I should go the watchhouse; I said if I am to go to the watchhouse you shall carry the things.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I was taken to the watchhouse before the circumstance happened; the watchman looked at Mr. Phillips's house before he took me, if you observed that.</p>
               <p>Murphy. I apprehended Jones near upon three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prescott's Defence. The night I was taken I had been to the play at Astley's in Wych-street, I happened to stop with some girls, and the time I got home it was half past twelve, I knocked, I could not get in: coming up Macclesfield-street I stopped to make water, he sprang the rattle; I went over to him, he said, keep off; I went over again.</p>
               <p>Scott. My attention was taken to Hopkins's right hand which was bloody, as if it had been cut with glass. There were two gentlemen who followed him into the watchhouse, who directed my attention to his hand, I did not observe it myself.</p>
               <p>Hopkins. I shewed my hand before the magistrate, there was no cut, only a scratch of a pin on my finger, and no mark of any cut at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Scott. What part of his hand was cut - A. At the two extremities, there were more than that.</p>
               <p>Prescott called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jones called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hopkins called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Some of the property you had seen in the house the day before the burglary was committed, had not you - A. Some of it.</p>

            . I am daughter to the last witness. On the 26th of November I shewed the prisoner a bonnet, she said it was not good enough; I shewed her another, she did not like it. I went into the other shop to get her one, and when I came back she said they were too dear, she would call again, and as she went out of the door I looked upon the board, the bonnet was gone; I ran after her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050013"/>there was a coach going by at the time, I called out stop thief, I saw her throw the bonnet down, I picked up the bonnet and looked up the street, I saw her run through the courts; about an hour and a half after that she came down the same street, I went after her, I told her somebody wanted to speak to her; she said nobody wanted to speak to her, she pulled off her pattens and was going to run, I laid hold of her, and brought her down the court; she ran up; a lady going by at the time she helped me to bring her home; when I got her back she said they had no business to keep her, as they had the property back. This is the bonnet, I am sure it is the bonnet that I shew- the prisoner, and that she took and dropped: it is worth five shillings and sixpence.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and the next morning I took her before the magistrate; going to Worship-street I asked her how she came to be guilty of such a thing; she said she was very sorry for it; she knew nothing of the bonnet until the girl stopped her with it, she thought it must have hanged to her side; she should not have done it but she was intoxicated; if the prosecutor would hush it up she would pay him the expence, if there was any damage, if he did not approve of that she would pay him for it, if he would go to her lodgings in Golden-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any considerable sum of money in your house before the 6th of November - A. I had received an hundred pound on the over night of Mr. Buckley one fifty pound, a forty pound, and a ten; I put them in my pocket to the best of my knowledge, and went out that evening to meet a person, I staid till about half past ten o'clock; after I came home I went to bed, and they remained in my pocket till the next morning as usual, since I have been in business; I took the money out of my pocket, and put them in a drawer without looking at them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not look to see whether the forty pound was there - A. No. On the 25th, in consequence of something that I heard, I went to my drawer, I refered to my cash account, I could not find I had paid away a forty pound note to my creditors; then I looked at my drawer, I could not find the forty pound note that I had received on the 5th; I had not taken the number of the forty pound note, nor any particular mark. They were all clean notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mears. You had received exactly as hundred pound - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I think you told us that you went out on that evening - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore as you supposed that you took all this money out you might have dropped the forty pound note for what you know - A. It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to recollect whether you had more forty pound notes than one - A. I do not recollect that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear positively that you had no other forty pound note - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you kept no number nor any particulars of the note - A. No.</p>

When the officer took me I just came out of the water in my half-boots; he asked for the money; I had left, I told him, fifteen pound; he said, deliver up what you have got, there shall be no more of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the mustard directly after he was gone - A. No, I did not. A person sent to me to ask if I had lost any mustard; if I had I was to come up to Mr. Salmon's public-house. I went there, I saw the prisoner sitting in the parlour in custody; the officer took the mustard out of the bundle and shewed it me. I knew my own name and the hand-writing that was on it. This is the mustard, it was in this paper in my shop, and my name on it as it is now. I am sure it was on my counter when he was there, and I knew it the moment I saw it. I saw it on my counter at twelve o'clock when the prisoner first came there, and after he was gone; it was not a quarter of an hour before he came in again and asked for another twopenny loaf; this paper of mustard cost me five shillings.</p>

               <p>ISSAC JOHNS. I am a shopman to Mr. Jolly. On the 8th of June, between the hours of two and four, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to look at some French cambrics. I shewed her the lowest price we had first; it was not fine enough; I continued shewing her cambrics until I think I shewed her the finest. She desired me to cut her one-eighth of a yard, upon which I opened the cambric so to do, and in stooping to pick up the measure I saw and likewise heard a rustling; I immediately rose up, and the prisoner rose up, and she was in the act of taking money out of her purse; I suspected at the time that the prisoner had taken a piece, but could not challenge her. I had suspicion of her from her first coming in the shop, but on account of her appearance and dress I did not challenge her. The prisoner then asked to look at some print; I sold her some print; when the prisoner paid for the half quarter of cambric and the print she went out, the boy was at the door; when she went out I told the boy to follow her and see where she went; in the mean time I examined the cambrics and missed the piece. The boy came back and told me that she went into Mr. Philpot's the corner of Turnstile. I immediately told him to follow her, and not to lose sight of her.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen that piece of cambric yourself that you missed - A. I had shewed it her at the time I was shewing her the cambric. I am perfectly clear that I had that piece of cambric. The boy went after her, and I have seen the cambric since at the pawnbroker's. I knew it to be my master's; this was on the 8th of June; my master was in the city at the time. When he returned I informed him of it. I am sure as to the person of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on the 2nd of August purchase of Mr. Goodwin two pieces of kerseymere - A. I never purchased any; I never was a customer to him, I never gave the prisoner any orders since he was with Mr. Goodwin; I did not give the prisoner orders on the 2nd of August, I never saw the goods till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentleman of the jury, the whole that I can say upon this subject is, that I was employed by Mr. Goodwin, as agent, to act according to the best of my skill and judgement; it was not done with any intention to defraud in the least; Mr. Goodwin in the first place might have prevented that; I was involved in difficulties when I first went there, and a person of the name of Philpot first involved me in it. The goods were in the first place bought, they were then pledged; he led me on from one thing to another, but not of the least advantage to me whatever. I have only further to observe I was never engaged to Mr. Becket, my agreement was with Mr. Goodwin to be agent and traveller to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            ; after having shewn her a few cambrics, I was standing close by, serving another customer, she expressed a wish to look at some others, as what she had seen not suiting; upon that I was casting my eye round, the young man was pulling open the drawer underneath, to look out some more cambrics.</p>
               <p>Q. He was probably stooping. A. Yes, I observed the prisoner tuck to her mantle in an hasty manner, which created a suspicion in my mind that she had got some of my property, or something that she wished to conceal, I stepped up to her, and opened her mantle and discovered this piece of French cambric, it had my mark on it then, and it has now, it has been in my custody ever since. When I took it from her she expressed sorrow and begged forgiveness, she told me she was a person of respectability, and assured me, it was her first offence. This is the piece of cambric, it stands me in about 4 l.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any furniture in the house belonging to you. A. I rent the house furnished of Major Blundell.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon the next morning did you discover that house being robbed. A. Not till ten o'clock the next morning. I repaired to the house, I observed the scutcheon was wrenched off the key-hole of the street door, by which means the lock was picked. There were missing, three feather-beds, eight blankets, two counterpanes, a quilt, three curtains of a four-posts bed, and a Brussells carpet. The drawing room curtain were cut off with a knife, as high as a man could reach, and they were gone. I have seen some of the property since at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did any body sleep in your house two nights before. A. No, not for two nights. I was the last person that slept there. I slept there about two nights before, and I intended to sleep there again.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received from your wife, did you apprehend the prisoner Robinson. - A. Yes, in two nights after I did, in Drury Lane, I told him I apprehended him concerning the bundle he brought into No. 10 Short's Gardens. I took him to St. Giles's watch-house. At Marlborough Street office, the prisoner owned to every thing.</p>

               <p>Q. What are these articles worth. - A. The blankets and two beds are worth at least 10 l. I could not replace them for that. I am certain they are my property.</p>
               <p>Robinson's Defence. I was brought innocently into it, I did not know what was in the bundle. I was having a pint of beer in the night at a public house, a young man came in and said my brother wants to see you, I said, what does he want, he said he did not know, go and see. I went up with him, he said he would make a fire, you sit and bear me company a bit, will you fetch me a pot of beer and two pipes of tobacco. I fetched it, up came his brother between 12 and 1 o'clock, we stopped there till half after four, and then we went out. I said, what are you going upon, he said, no matter to you. I thought if it was no harm I would go. We then went into the Edgware Road, and from there we went into Oxford Street, to a public house. They gave me a pint of purl, in came a man, he gave me the bundle, he did not tell me where to take it to.</p>
               <p>Field's Defence. On the morning of the 8th of November, I was in bed with my husband, I heard some person call my husband, he spoke to him, and when he came in, he asked him to let him leave a bed for a few hours, he said he was seized upon by his landlord. I did not approve of it, my husband and me had a few words, I was angry with him. He went out to find the man that brought the bed, and the watchman came in and found the things.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come down stairs. - A. Yes, she wanted to rush through the passage, to get away from my son, and I called to an old man that lived in the two pair, to come and detain her while my son went for a constable, the old man came down, and then she ran into my parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw her put her right hand into her pocket, she pulled out three keys, and chucked them under the parlour grate. The officer tried one of these keys, it unlocked the room where the prisoner came from, she exclaimed when I took up the keys from under the grate, that she was guilty, and said,</p>
               <p>"pray do not hurt me."</p>
               <p>Q. You had not promised to forgive her, or any thing of that sort. - A. No, I told her I saw her take the keys out of her pocket. The officer brought down the clothes which she had put into the bag. They are here. There was a pair of sheets worth 10 s. three shirts, worth 5 s. three neck handkerchiefs, worth 1 s. a hat 3 s. a pair of boots, half a crown, and a great coat, 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how she got in your house. - A. She came in at the street door, it stands open in day-light. The door up stairs was locked and I had the key.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon her. - A. Nothing, upon her, I found all these things put up in a canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. The things in the canvas bag would not amount to forty shillings. - A. No, when the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, I found ten false keys upon the chair on which she had been sitting, and one of them keys opens the front garret door, out of which I was robbed about ten weeks ago.</p>

The prosecutrix said, that was the person who had robbed her. I searched the prisoner, and found on her a pipe-key; after that, the prosecutrix gave me these three keys, the keys that the prisoner threw away. I took Mrs. Dean's son up with me. I tried this key is the son's room. I found this key exactly fitted the lock; it locked and unlocked it. I went in the room. I observed this bag, with the property stated in the indictment. In

I left it in that room. I had my dinner; and after I had my dinner, I was going to the theatre. A gentleman was with me, his name is Andrew M'Intyne. I went up stairs.

I had four guineas in gold. I put them into a secret drawer of a small dressing case; the thirty-five guineas and four moidores were put in a piece of brown paper, and put in the dressing-case, in another drawer. I locked the dressing-case and put it in the trunk, and locked the trunk likewise; then we went both to the theatre, and we returned the next morning about nine o'clock.</p>

I found that my trunk was broken open. I spoke to nobody of the house. Before I went up, the man of the house came up and told me, that my trunk had been broken open, and the man was taken, and that they had got all the money safe. I did not look into my trunk then.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, are you sure he is the man. - A. Yes, I am, he was then dressed like a gentleman, not as he is now, he had his dinner, he observed to the waiter after he had his dinner he was going to the play, and would be very glad of a bed on his return, he observed also to the waiter, had we any naval officers in the house, he was a naval officer himself. The waiter told him he could have a bed, the waiter said there were two or three naval officers in the house, but they were not within. He asked leave to go and wash his hands prior to his going to the theatre, he was shewn into the same room in which he slept, I think it was then six o'clock, it was before the gentleman were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was shewn into a room, was that near Mr. Maitland's room. - A. The adjoining room to Mr. Maitland's room, the same side of the passage; when he went up stairs he staid up a very little time, he came down and said he was going to the play, he should be home when the play was over, and he went out; he returned about half past nine, observing to the waiter that he did not stay to see the after-piece, it was not worth seeing, or some such expression. He ordered a supper, and after taking the supper he retired to bed, I think about half past ten, the chamber-maid shewed him up to his room, I saw her go up with him; some time after that, the chamber-maid came down and said she thought he had taken Mr. Maitland's trunk out of his room, in consequence of that I went up stairs, I found that Mr. Maitland's trunk was taken out of the room, I heard the prisoner in his room making a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a noise as could be heard down stairs. - A. Oh no, it seemed like the knocking of a hammer, but not very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner had you gone up stairs. - A. I went gently up stairs, I listened at the door, I then asked him whether he was in bed, he said no, I asked him whether he was in the dark, he said yes, I asked him to open the door, I thought there was some of the luggage belonging to another gentleman in that room, he unlocked the door, I went in with one of the waiters, he was then lying in bed with his clothes on, he got up and opened the door, and went and laid himself in bed before I went in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you got in, he was lying in bed with his clothes on. - A. Yes, I saw some things scattered about the room, I thought it was adviseable to have an officer, I took the key from the inside of the door and locked him in until the officer came, I sent for the officer, he came about ten minutes after this happened, I took the officer up stairs, and gave him in charge, he was then lying in bed as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he exhibit to you the appearance of a man in liquor at all. - A. Not the smallest, then on searching the room we found a great many guineas in a drawer, I found the trunk broken open and put under the bed, the lock was forced; we opened a drawer in a chest of drawer in the room, we found some guineas and some linen also, I think there were eighteen. There were two foreign pieces of gold coin under the mattrass, and there were two guineas in a piece of brown paper, and a chissel, nothing else, I took the trunk into the gentleman's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock it. - A. No I could not lock it, I put the things in the trunk, and put them in the gentleman's room. The officer took the eighteen guineas and the two pieces of foreign gold coin.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the apprehending of the prisoner, did he say any think. - A. He denied every thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask him whether my coat and waistcoat were on when I was in bed. - A. The coat was not on, I believe he had his waistcoat and pantaloons on, and his braces.</p>

I do, I remember shewing him up to a room, the first time that I shewed him up to the room was about six o'clock, to wash his hands, and about half past ten when I shewed him to bed, and then I came out and left him, I went into a gentleman's room exactly underneath his, I heard a great noise over my head, I heard a kind of a lumbering, I went up to prepare the room for Mr. Maitland, and missed the trunk, I came down and told my master and mistress, they sent for a constable.</p>

Just the very same, I pulled the trunk out myself, It was seventeen guineas in the drawer, it is a mistake of eighteen, and a smelling bottle was found then I looked about the room, I saw the room all littered with different articles about the floor, I desired the prisoner to get up, I looked about the bed clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. He laid between the sheets as described, did not he. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner did not appear to you to be drunk at all. - A. Not in the least; when he got up, I searched the bed, I found a shirt behind where he laid, a pair of breeches and a waistcoat; in searching further under the mattrass, I found a guinea, two half guineas, and this chissel, I examined the trunk, I found it had been broken open by this chissel, and the dressing case in the trunk appeared to be forced open by this chissel. This was on the Saturday night, on the Sunday I called to have an understanding, what was missed out of the trunk I could not hear; on Monday morning at ten o'clock, I attended to take the prisoner before the magistrate, the seventeen guineas, the guinea, and the two half guineas I have kept ever since, I found two gold moidores, they were along with the seventeen guineas.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 17th of November, between four and five o'clock, Perara, accompanied by another man, came into my father's shop; he asked to see a long jacket; the jacket in question was on the counter. At the time, while I was shewing him a long jacket, the person accompanying Perara left the shop. Perara had looked at the long jacket; and, after bidding me much less than the price I asked, left the shop. On my doubling up the jackets that were on the counter, I missed the jacket in the indictment. I know the prisoner did not take the jacket, but the person accompanying him took the jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that person. - A. That I cannot say. When I missed the jacket, I went to several pawnbrokers, and desired them to stop it. On my return, the prisoner Perara was in the shop with a jacket of the same description that I lost. My father asked me, if that was not the jacket that was stole? I said, I believed it was, but I would fetch the person that made it. I went for the person that made it, and when I returned, Perara had left the shop and took the jacket with him.</p>

             on the 17th of November, about half past ten at night. He asked six shillings on it. I took the jacket up to Mr. Rose. I never saw Perara at all. I have kept the jacket ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my jacket; it was taken away when Perara first came in, and Perara came in with this jacket between eight or nine at night. He asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs, and asked me the price of them. He bid me little more than half, and when he was gone away, he took the jacket up under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the jacket that you missed before. - A. Yes I asked him where he bought the jacket? he said, at Blackwall; he gave sixteen shillings for it. I replied, you have not given any thing for this jacket, it was taken out of my shop this afternoon. He said, you make a thief of me, take care of what you say.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he speak English. - A. Perfectly well; and while I was talking to him, my son came in. He said; he thought it was my jacket; and, to put it beyond all doubt, I sent for the woman that made it. I was behind the counter when my son was gone out. Perara snatched it up, and went away. The jacket is worth eighteen shillings. I swear to the jacket.</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the West London Militia. On the 6th of November last, about half after five in the evening, I was in the act of locking up the premises where I had been at work, in Castle-street; it comes into Saffron-hill. The prisoner came running down Castle-street, ran against me, and asked me to let him in; that he had broken a window upon Saffron-hill, and they were after him. I took hold of him by the collar. A boy, at the time, said, that is him. I led him along to see what the depredation was to the place, where the dray was.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050022"/>The two brewer's servants were looking about for him. The prisoner put his two hands into his pockets, and turned out eighteen shillings and sixpence. He said to them, I will give you all, let me go. I took the prisoner to the office, and delivered him to Cook, the officer.</p>

            . Q. On Sunday the 23d of September last, where did you live. - A. No 7, Harp-court, Fleet-street. On that day, about half past six in the evening, I was in Bartholomew Hospital square. On my passing through the square, I saw the prisoner Trueman, who was tried last sessions. I perceived he was following of me. I saw two more with him. When I got to the steps of the hospital, with intention to go in, he put his hand to my face. I put up my hand to prevent him from striking me. He struck me in the bosom, and took the watch from my side. He ran away, and I called for assistance.

            . Q. On the 23d of September last, were you in Bartholomew Hospital Square. - A. Yes, about half after six, I was going through Bartholomew Hospital, I heard the cry of stop thief. I had just passed the gateway, I saw a man strike Mrs. Jackson. I immediately pursued him, and I was never more than four or five yards behind him, from first to last, I might be more, I cannot say exactly. He attempted to run down Hosier Lane. He saw one or two people coming up Hosier Lane. He threw a something from his hand at the time, and he turned again and ran towards the George Inn, and, opposite of the George, he stopped as though he had been shot. I ran up against him. I collared him immediately, and said, he was the person that robbed the lady. He denied it. In the course of a few minutes, Mrs. Jackson came up, she said,</p>
               <p>"you are the man that robbed me." I took him into the George public-house, and in a few minutes, the lady came in and said,</p>
               <p>"you are the man that robbed me." A gentleman came in in a few minutes, and said,</p>
               <p>"coming up Hosier Lane he picked up the watch," and directly the gentleman came in and gave up the watch, the prisoner and two or three more came up to me and said</p>
               <p>"d - n your bloody eyes let the prisoner go." I am positive to the man, he said,</p>
               <p>"the lady has got her watch, and what does she want more. I told him I would not let him go untill I put the prisoner Trueman into a prison, and the person that had got the watch, said, he would not deliver the watch up untill he delivered it to a magistrate, or to an officer. I then sent for a constable, and for the lady's friend Griffin. The constable came in. About three quarters of an hour after that, Trueman said he would go quietly with Griffin and me. The prisoner was present, and very abusive, because I would not let Trueman go. When we came to the corner of Hosier Lane, I had old of Trueman's right arm in my left, and I had hold of his coat and waistcoat with my right. Trueman said,</p>
               <p>"what do you hold me by the coat and waistcoat for." I said,</p>
               <p>"to make sure of you." I had no sooner spoke the words, than my heels were kicked up, and Trueman fell upon me and Griffin, the constable fell upon Trueman. I was dragged some yards in a few minutes. I kept holding Trueman's legs. I got up and saw several people that came to my assistance. I saw one Huggins. I was no sooner up, but I was knocked down again. They dragged me through the pens, beat me with sticks, and likewise kicked me, and there were a great many knives drawn at the time. After they dragged me through the pens, I got Trueman to Mr. Gent's public-house, Mr. Gent said, he would not let any thief come in there, and shut the door. We were dragged into the pens, and I was knocked down again. While I was standing at Mr. Gent's door, they cut Trueman's coat all round except what I had got hold of, so that he might slip out of his coat. They said,</p>
               <p>"d - n his bloody eyes cut his bloody arm off." I immediately stooped down, let go and got old of his thighs. They dragged me into the pens, and beat me a second time. There were many knives and sticks flying about, and when I got up I saw Trueman wrestling with Griffin to get his staff from him. Trueman and a number of others at the time said,</p>
               <p>"d - n their bloody eyes, hamstring them. I was then got very near the George with Trueman. I was so overpowered at that time, I said if they would let me go, I would let Trueman go, they said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your bloody eyes let him go, we'll let you go." I immediately heard a voice behind say,</p>
               <p>"throw him backwards." I turned round and saw a person at a small folding doors to a large gateway. I then threw Trueman's heels up, threw him in that door, and fell in with him. I took Trueman into the back part of the George public-house. The prisoner at the bar came in at the same time, and Bray, Griffin, and Huggins.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner during the whole of this time. - A. I saw the prisoner when he insisted upon me letting Trueman go in the public-house, before I had not seen him from that time to this. Griffin then got a cord and tied Trueman's hands behind him. I had hold of Trueman, the prisoner came and stood opposite of me. The prisoner called for a pint of ale, he gave Trueman the first glass of ale out of his pint, he said,</p>
               <p>"here my lad, drink." After Trueman drank he said,</p>
               <p>"he wished somebody would go and let his friends know where he was." The landlord of the house said if you will give me proper directions, I will go and let your friends know. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"you have no occasion to give yourself that trouble. Trueman is a stranger to me, I will let them know." After the prisoner had called for a pint of beer and a pipe, I said,</p>
               <p>"as you pretend to be a friend to this man, why do not you go and let his friends know." He said he would stop and see the coach off first. The landlord of the house then shook his head, and seemed to think he was one of the gang. A coach came.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got into the coach. - A. I, Trueman, Griffin, and Bray, I cannot tell exactly how many there might be. And the prisoner followed us out of the house, and after the coach. As soon as we got out of the door they gave a shout. When we got into the middle of Smithfield, the coach door was broken open on the left hand side. I then received four or five blows on my left thigh with a stick. I then looked at the coach door, I saw the prisoner at the coach door with a stick. I then asked some one to lend me their stick to defend myself, but they wanted it back again in a moment, and I delivered it to them. I then put my hand out to hold the door by the tassel, and received a blow on my arm. I got the coach door to, and held it by the tassel and the pocket. We proceeded, the coach was stopped several times before we got to Newgate Street. There were a number of voices at the time cry our,</p>
               <p>"d - n your eyes you bloody b - s, we'll rescue him." I cannot say the prisoner was one, there were so many crying.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I did not understand you that the prisoner struck you. - A. Yes, the prisoner struck me with a stick. We had not got far up Newgate Street, before the traces, and the reins, and the harness were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050024"/>cut. The coachman was obliged to get off his box, to get one of the horses, the reins were cut. He had not gone many yards before the body of the coach fell down between the wheels, the main braces were cut. With that, one or two people in the coach left me, Griffin, and the prisoner in the coach. Bray who had jumped out of the coach, returned in a few minutes and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh Griffin my arm is broke." Griffin immediately jumped out of the coach, left me and Trueman together in the coach. Trueman began to cry at that time, and said,</p>
               <p>"he was a lost man," he was very sorry for what had happened. Just at that moment the prisoner came up to the coach door, he said something, I could not rightly understand what. He had not been at the door above a minute or two before Stanton the officer came up. I heard Stanton say,</p>
               <p>"the first man that came near the coach, he would blow his brains out." He had got a pair of pistols. I then said,</p>
               <p>"blow that man's brains out," which is the prisoner at the bar, or drive him away. With that he put a pistol to his breast, and told him,</p>
               <p>"if he did not go away he would blow his brains out." I told him he was the man that wanted to rescue Trueman. He immediately went away. We got Trueman into a fresh coach, and returned to Giltspur Street Compter. We could not go forward to the Poultry Compter. It might be near ten o'clock when we got to Giltspur Street Compter, and then there was a great shout gave. After we had lodged Trueman in Giltspur Street, I never saw any thing more of the prisoner untill the trial of Trueman came on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the same man. - A. I am positive he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are sure he is the same man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In Newgate Street Bray's expression was, that he had his arm broke. - A. I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. You did not see the state in which Bray was. - A. He was cut across his fingers. When he appeared at Guild-hall on Monday morning, he shewed it to the court. His fingers were cut across on his left hand, and his hand was in a sling.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar in the course of that evening. - A. At the George, I saw him drinking ale with Trueman. I did not see the prisoner any more, not to my knowledge, untill he was taken out of the gallery.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you. - A. At the George, a coach was sent for, I went with them along to the Compter. Trueman was resolute the first time, but the second time he was very quiet, because his hands were tied behind him. The reins were cut, and the traces and the harness of the horses, in Smithfield. The coachman got on one of his horses and rode as postillion, untill we got into <placeName id="t18101205-39-crimeloc239">Newgate Street</placeName>

They cut the braces of the spring, and let the body of the coach down. I jumped out of the coach immediately, and Pike the officer. As we jumped out of the coach, there was a most desperate gang, some with knives, and some with sticks. One of them hit me on my head by the side of my ear, and knocked me down with a large stick. I was fighting at that time for about ten minutes. The other officer ran away and left me at the coach door. I dare say I was knocked down a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there assembled together. - A. I dare say near twenty; some beating me over my legs, and some over my thighs; they were armed with sticks and knives; they said, d - n your b - y eyes, let him go. One of them cut me on the fingers, on this hand, with a knife; another came up and hit me on my arm with a large driver's stick. I called out,</p>
               <p>"Griffin, my arm is cut, and I believe broken," immediately Stanton, the officer, came up with a brace of pistols. Somebody spoke to Stanton, in the coach, and pointed out some man at the coach door; he said, he was trying to rescue Freeman. Stanton put a pistol to his breast, told him, if he did not go away, he would blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was. - A. No; my arm was in so much pain, I could not swear to any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the man before to your knowledge. - A. I saw him in the George, drinking, all with the prisoner Trueman. I cannot positively say it was the same man, it was dark out in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Newgate-street was this. - A. Just by Christ's Hospital gate. I am quite sure I was cut across my hand with a knife.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar. Did you see him there. - A. I saw him after we had taken Trueman back again to the George. I asked Lloyd if he liked to have something to drink? Bray poured two glasses out of two pots. The prisoner said, let Trueman have a glass - that is the first time. I did not see him again until we got into Newgate-street, when the coach was cut, and then I saw him there. The street was lined with people when the coach was cut down. The prisoner came to the coach door. Lloyd was in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came to the coach, did he say any thing. - A. He said nothing. I did not see him do any thing in the least, at that time.

               <p>Q. It was after Bray came out of the coach that the prisoner came to the coach door. - A. Yes; and it was after Bray came out of the coach that Bray got his fingers cut. Lloyd said to Stanton,</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the time the coach went away. - A. I do. I followed Sadler with the coach, when the coach went away. Sadler followed the coach from the George, and about an hundred yards from the George, in Smithfield, I saw the prisoner stop the horses. After having stopped the horses, he went of the near side of the coach, and tried to open the coach door; he could not get it open; then the coachman drove on very hard. He directly ran before the horses again. Just as the coach got opposite of the hospital gates, he 
stopped the horses the second time. After that, the coachman found the reins were cut. He directly hollowed out,</p>


               <p>"his reins were cut." After that, the coachman got into Newgate-street. I heard the prisoner say, to four or five of them,</p>
               <p>"Now, my boys, stick true to me, and we will have them away from the b - rs."</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there following of him. - A. Near upon thirty of them from what I could see in the gang: a great many had sticks and knives.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say you saw the prisoner twice at the horses heads. - A. I did, and likewise in Newgate-street. After he made that expression to four or five of them, he went to the off side of the coach, and directly the coach fell down - it was instantly cut down. After he came up to the coach door, I heard Stanton say,</p>
               <p>"if you do not go away I will blow your brains out." After that I lost sight of him. I heard Bray say he had his arm broke. I did not see him struck. I am quite sure Sadler is the person.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of September, were you in Newgate-street. - A. I had an information at the Compter. I went to Newgate-street. When I got halfway down Newgate-street, I saw a mob. I quickened my pace, and got up to it: it was a great mob, indeed. I tried to go through the mob. Some cried out,</p>
               <p>"do not let him go through." I pulled a pair of pistols out of my pocket, and swore the first person that offered to stop me, I would blow his brains out. They pushed me backwards and forwards. They would not let me go through. When I got to the horses heads, I was tried to be stopped by a man. I did not exactly notice that man. I got to the coach door; there were some trying to open the coach door. I pushed them of one side, and looked in the coach window. I saw Griffin. I said,</p>
               <p>"what is the matter?" he said,</p>
               <p>"for God's sake assist us." I said I would. Lloyd said,</p>
               <p>"Stanton, blow that man's brains out, if he does not go away from the coach." He said, " that man has been following of us all the while." The prisoner is the man, to the best that I can recollect; I have no doubt about it. That is the man that tried to shove me under the coach, when I was endeavouring to get at the coach door. The pistols were locked. I unlocked one, and presented the pistol to him, and told him, if he did not go away, I would blow his brains out. I never saw any more of him, he went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man that attempted to push you under the coach. - A. Yes; I have no doubt at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the man that was pointed out to you. - A. I have no doubt of it. It was very dark. I saw him by the light of the lamps. I got another coach and put Trueman in, and then I saw Bray's hand was cut by something sharp.</p>

               <p>Q. Had your men, on the 3d of November, brought down any barley. - A. Yes, the barge load was very near four hundred and a quarter. I saw the barge when it arrived, the corn was in sacks; some of the sacks were my own, and some Mr. Groves's. On the Sunday morning Mitchener came and told that there was a sack missing. I got a warrant, and searched the prisoner's house. I found a sack marked W. J. G. William and

            , and L. for London. I told the prisoner I had found the sack, and I wished he would shew me the barley. He said he had no barley in the house, but in a jar. He pulled the jar off the shelf and shewed it me. I told him I must search farther. I went in his out house, and went up stairs, there I saw two sacks of barley. One sack appeared never to have been tied; a new sack, no mark, and that answered to my bulk of barley. I found four bushels in the sack, the sack was full; the other sack was tied up, that barley was nothing like mine. I took a sample of that which I supposed to be mine. In consequence of that, he was taken up. This is the sample of the bulk, and this is the sample of the sack. I have no doubt it is part of my barley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the barley at Brentford. That same sack might be left in my house to put potatoes in.</p>

Three shifts, and a number of gloves I left in the house. Two silver tea-spoons and a sugar-tongs belong to myself, they were left in the drawers; the drawers were locked, and I left the keys locked up in town. I returned to town on the 14th of October, and on the next day I went to the drawers with the key, I could not open it.

I sent them to the house to do work in June, they worked there three weeks or more. After Lord Aylesbury came to town, I was applied to on the subject of this robbery.

I was directed by Noys to my house, 158, Bond Street, to a room leading to Noy's bed-chamber Noys went with me and pointed out a drawer, which contained some ladies gloves, and a pinchback locket, of small value. They were given to Mrs. Knapp.</p>

I beg your pardon, Cooper was not with me at that time, Carpenter was there three weeks; and, during that time, these articles might be taken at different times. Carpenter was there at work a day and a half when the boys was not there. I mean this young lad, Noys, he has been with me two years, he deserves a very good character. I was very much astonished that he should have known of it, and not acquainted me of the misconduct of the other.</p>

Probably he might, it was carelessly thrown off the hides, I directed the men to watch at the different windows, I placed myself also in another window.

After he had folded it up smooth, he laid it in the head of the waggon, he covered it with some straw and a Russia mat. This is the tarpaulin, it belongs to the London Dock Company.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again. - A. Yes, at Mr. Cordy's, a pawnbroker. On Sunday evening I found the prisoner at a public-house. His wife came in, and said, he was a rogue, he had taken my watch and pawned it. I sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of the 26th did Jones apply to any of you for some meat for supper - A. Yes, between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jones sober at that time - A. No, a little tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the meat given to Jones - A. Yes, and he began eating it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he cut it - A. He had the meat in his left hand and a knife in his right to cut his meat, he asked for some salt; Langstrom was at that time laying in his hammock with his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased say any thing to the prisoner upon his asking for salt - A. He begged he would make no noise, said he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. The prisoner then took him by the hair of his head and shook him in his hammock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had the prisoner his meat and his knife in his hands - A. He had the meat; I did not see the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him lay it down, I suppose - A. No, upon the prisoner seizing him by the hair of his head, the deceased jumped out of his hammock and struck Jones by the side of his face; the prisoner made a blow at his body at the same time; I did not see the knife, that was directly after the deceased struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the deceased say - A. That moment the blow was given him, he said, Lord have mercy upon me, I am a dead man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the blood flow from the wound directly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say why he had done it or how he came to do it - A. The prisoner said he had done it in a passion.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife was it - A. I do not know what became of the knife, it was a sailor's knife, a clasp knife. The deceased was taken to the hospital, he lived about two days afterwards, I belive.</p>
               <p>MR. BUTLER. Q. You are the house pupil of the London Hospital - A. I am, this man was brought to the Hospital from on board the ship, the wound was in his belly, with the bowels protruding through the wound in the side of the belly; he lived forty-eight hours after he had received the wound; he died of that wound.</p>

I came into the back shop, I put on my coat and hat and took a large stick and went out of my shop on the Snow-hill side and round the corner into Skinner-street, I saw the prisoner with another at my shop window in Skinner-street, I came up between them both, I saw the prisoner's right hand in the pane of glass what he had broken, with a knife in his hand, he drew the knife out, it was such a knife as this; I catched hold of him by the collar and the other person too, I saw the other person receive the knife of the prisoner, I said, you have robbed me long enough, and when I collared him he struck me on my side and kicked me two or three times and plunged and said d - n you, sir, I am not the man, what do you want of me; in so doing he got out of my hand and ran across Fleet-market. I brought the prisoner in and searched him, I found none of my property, I found a clasp knife about him like others I have seen before to cut windows. I lost five knives, this is one I brought to shew you what sort of knives I lost; I am sure I saw him take one and the other received it; before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050030"/>I took him to the compter; he said he would have a pint of beer, Stanton asked him how he came to rob me, d - n him, said he, he would rob me as soon as any other man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, I am a journeyman carpenter, and was going on that day to see my relations with my wife and child, there were several other persons in the waggon all the way from town, and the waggoner's brother rode in the waggon part of the way; my box was only carried. I was so much agitated by the magistrates telling me he would send my wife to prison, and from the terror of that I should have confessed any thing whatever; the magistrate promised to liberate my wife. I am totally innocent, I had no knowledge of the articles being in the box, and have no doubt they were removed by some of the passengers out of mere frolic.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money did he take from you - A. Seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the seven pounds made up - A. In the first place there were sixteen dollars, four half crowns, an old crown piece with some letters on the head of it, twenty-five shillings in silver, and a one pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you receive this money - A. As payment for a load of hay; I received it that same evening, about four o'clock, in London for a load of hay. When they took my money out of my pocket they took me behind the team about two hundred yards, as near as I can tell, back upon the road, the team was going on slowly, they let me go then, and I did not see any more of them, they walked towards town.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were robbing you and taking you two hundred yards back on the road, did you take any notice of their persons - A. I looked at Gill, he was the man that was facing of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at him enough to be able to recollect his countenance afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the other men - A. No, I did not; one stood behind me, and the other on the side of me, I did not observe them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these men, or either of them afterwards - A. I saw them the next day at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is you saw three men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these three men that you saw there, did you recollect any one of them - A. Yes, Gill, the right hand man; I told the officer before I went in I could swear to him, and when I went in I recollected Gill, I said that is the man that presented the pistol to my breast, in his presence, he was by, he could not hear me speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, can you say that man put what you took to be a pistol to your breast - A. Yes, I can safely swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when these men left you what did you do - A. I went into a public house and told the people that I had been robbed, that was before I got up to my team, I went on then after my team; at the public house there were two or three people said they would go after them, I did not see them go.</p>
               <p>Q. You went after your team - A. Yes; I went up to the stable's with the horses; master's house is not where the stables are, I did not go to my master's house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you arrive at the stables - A. About half after eight, as near as I could tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far are the stables from your master's house - A. Above a mile as near as I can tell. I live in the parish of Hendon, about a mile from my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single or a married man - A. A married man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go directly that night - A. I do not know; I did not go there till the next morning, I never go there of a night only once of twice a week to know what I am to do. My master came to me the next morning to the stable about nine o'clock, I told him I had been robbed on the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go and tell your master before nine o'clock, you were up before that time, what time did you get up that morning - A. About six.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master heard of the robbery before he came to you - A. Yes; I told him I had been robbed, and while I told him there was a man came up and told me these men were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence of that I suppose you went up to London did not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were shewn the three young men at the bar were not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have told us one of them you know, which was Gill, and respecting the other men did you take any notice of the height or size of them - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you yourself - A. I am about twenty-seven.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are married, how many children have you - A. One child.</p>
               <p>Gill. I would wish to ask him who told him I was the man that put the pistol to his breast - A. No man told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. I was told that you were in the public-house conversing with some of Mr. Franklin's men, and you were told to say I was the man - A. I never had any conversation with Mr. Franklin's men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did either Mr. Franklin's men, or any men whatever tell you to swear to Gill - A. No, no man whatever.</p>
               <p>Gill. I never had a pair of trowsers on, these are the clothes that I had on when the officer took me; I shewed him my things, they searched my room; I had no trowsers whatever.</p>

When Santo and myself came to the window again Perara asked me if I would shew him one at two pound ten shillings; I shewed him one at two guineas and a half; after some time looking at it he offered me two guineas for it; I told him that was too little; he then endeavoured to secrete it down the sleeve of his coat; I took the watch from him and told him that was not the way to use the watch; I then laid it on the counter, he then offered two pound three shillings for it, and took it up in his hand; I told him that was too little, he then put the watch down on the counter, in about two minutes; he slid out of the shop, I instantly missed one of the four guinea watches, I told

Directly he was gone Santo pointed to one of the bills of the four guinea watches, and said you want for this watch five guineas, I said no, but four; the lad then returned and said he could not see any thing of Perara, the lad coming in at the door prevented Santo from going out, I then jumped over the counter myself, and laid hold of him by the jacket, but before I could speak he said, me no got the watch. I was induced by him to go three or four doors down the street, because I understood the man was gone in the stocking shop; when I came there I found he was not there, I then told him he must go back with me, when I requested him so to do he pushed me off the pavement, I had still got hold of his jacket; I pushed him on the pavement again, but finding I had no one to assist, he pushed me into the road, and there knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050035"/>me down, by the fall I tore his jacket from the top to the bottom, and knocked his her off, and by so doing I lost my hold of him, he then ran away; I instantly got up and called out stop thief, he ran down Goodman's-yard, and ran up a very intricate place; he ran up a corner, I then thought I had got the man again, I went to lay hold of him, he knocked me down again and made a spring from me some few yards, but two persons coming up he was secured and brought back to the shop; I then sent for an officer to search him, he was searched, and there was found upon him five shillings and an halfpenny, and two clasp knives. He was then taken to the watch-house. The watch has been found.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Morris in the Minories. On the 17th of November, a quarter past five, Santo and Perara came into my master's shop, Perara introduced Santo as being a man that wanted to buy a watch, Mr. Blaney asked him the price, he replied four pounds, or four guineas; I saw Mr. Blaney take one from the window first, and then took two more at four guineas each, they were produced on the counter. I saw Santo go down the shop to observe the motion of the watch, then he returned to the counter again; after he returned to the counter he leaned down and obscured the light of the lamp in the window, then he laid down the watch on the counter again. Perara asked Mr. Blaney if he had a watch he could sell him for two pound ten shillings; he shewed him one at two guineas and a half, Perara then bid him two pound, and advanced three shillings; Mr. Blaney told him he could not take that; he observed him using the watch very roughly endeavouring to conceal it up the cuff of his jacket, he laid it down and slid to the door. After he was gone about two minutes or rather better the watch was missed, Mr. Blaney desired me to jump over the counter to go in search of Perara; I jumped over the counter and went to the centre of the window, I could not see Perara; I returned and told Mr. Blaney I could not see any thing of him. When Santo found Perara was gone I saw him take up the four guinea bill of the watch that laid on the counter, he then said that watch was five guineas that was by the side of the bill; Mr. Blaney told him four guineas; he was then walking to the door, making motions that it would not do, my being at the door when Santo attempted to go away, obstructed him in endeavouring to make his escape; Mr. Blaney saw him endeavouring to make his escape, jumped over the counter, and laid hold of Santo's jacket, and before he could say any thing Santo said, me no got the watch; he then said he would shew us where Perara was; I saw them go a door or two distant, and by the motion of Mr. Blaney I saw he wanted to bring him back; I saw Santo push Mr. Blaney off the curb, and in about one minute he made his escape into the middle of the road, I am sure both the prisoners at the bar are the men, I can swear to both of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your warehouse part of your dwelling-house - Yes; they communicate together; I occupy the house myself; I let part of the dwelling-house out in accompting-houses.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it - A. I think on the 21st of November, about noon time in the day, I saw the prisoner at the bar with another <rs id="t18101205-57-deflabel348" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Q. At what o'clock did you shut up your warehouse - A. Usually at dusk in the evening, about five o'clock, or earlier that that, we hardly ever do any thing by candle light, I shut up my warehouse in the usual way, and examined all the locks of different floors in the warehouse, which I found secure. On the following morning, between nine and ten, I found the lock of the two pair of stairs floor which is occupied by Messrs. Lee and Brassey, they rent it of me; I found the padlock taken off, and the screw staple was broken, and the lock laid upon one of the steps of the warehouse stairs, the door was closed to, though the padlock was taken off; I pushed it open; I suspected that the warehouseman of Messrs. Lee and Brassey was in the warehouse. It was after I came out I should have told your lordship that I observed the screw staple was broken off; I called about in the warehouse, I found nobody there. On the evening I secured the outward door with an additional fastening. On the following morning I went to Messrs. Lee and Brassey's accompting house, then followed the information that the warehouse had been broken open, and a bale had been cut open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This dwelling house is part of your warehouse, do you mean to say so, it is divided into separate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050036"/>tenements - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Messrs. Lee and Brassey are yearly tenants - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They hold it now of you until the end of the current year, is it so - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As to your dwelling house you live at Hackney - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there are bills upon your house in town to let it - A. Yes; accompting houses to let, not my dwelling-house. I have another dwelling-house attached under the same roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you sleep in No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 - A. I cannot mean to say that; I cannot divide myself into four or five parts; I have somebody in my dwelling-house until I can return and fill them up myself. They are all under one roof.</p>
               <p>COURT. This warehouse of Lee and Brassey is it under the same roof under which you live - A. It is; it communicates to my dwelling-house, and has done for twenty-four years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The passage to this warehouse is in the street - A. It is not. It is through my house, a communication under the same roof, they do not go into the street, the communication is from my dwelling-house.</p>

            . I know that Messrs. Lee and Brassey had a bale containing camblets and other stuffs. On the evening of the 27th of last month I was informed.</p>
               <p>Q. You are wrong as to your dates - A. I was not informed until a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Lee and Brassey a bale of Norwich camblets - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had they it prior to the robbery - A. This bale of camblets they had in their possession two years. On the 27th I was informed that the warehouse in which the bale was deposited had been broken open, that bale had been cut open, and part of the contents stolen out. On the following morning a person brought to Messrs. Lee and Brassey's accompting house a newspaper, in which were inserted an advertisement, stating that several pieces of Norwich camblets had been stopped upon a person, and were to be seen at the Mansion house; I went to the Mansion house, and upon the five pieces of Norwich camblets shewn to me; I immediately recognized the numbers to be the handwriting of some person in the manufactory at Norwich, from whence Messrs. Lee and Brassey were in the habit of having goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your own mark upon them - A. No, I never saw the pieces untill I went to the Mansion house; I afterwards proceeded to the warehouse and examined the remainder of the bale that had been cut open, and upon comparing them with the pattern book I found six pieces missing, the numbers and colours of the five pieces which were shewn to me at the Mansion house, they corresponded with the number and colour of the five and six pieces that were missing. This is the pattern book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know is, that these camblets they are of the same number, and the same colour and marks - A. Yes, and six pieces were missing out of the bale.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not other persons the same patterns and the same numbers - A. I have no doubt they have the same colour, the numbers I cannot speak to that.</p>

            . I am an officer of the city. On Wednesday the 21st of November, about twenty minutes after six in the evening, in company with Branscomb and Eldridge in Leadenhall-street, I observed the prisoner at the bar with a bag on his back just turning the come of St. Mary Axe, when he turned the corner I observed him to make a kind of a run, I immediately went after him and laid hold of his collar, I asked him what he had got, he told me he did not know; I asked him where he had brought it from, he told me he had picked it up, it had dropped from the tail of a cart, he did not say where; my brother officers then came up, Branscomb took the property in question. In taking him to the compter, nearly opposite of the India house; I observed his left hand down by his side, I desired him to keep his hand up, at that instant he threw something into the middle of the road, I called to Eldridge to pick it up, he did, which proved to be a large rasp with the end broken off; I immediately searched him, by a shop window, found in one pocket two knives and gimblet; we then took him to be the compter. We advertised the goods on the 28th Messrs. Lee and Brassey's people came to the Mansion house and owned them, saying they had been robbed. I went and examined the warehouse, I found a screw staple had been broken open, I examined the bale, and found it was cut, and the marks in the door corresponded with this rasp in two places.</p>

               <p>JURY. The patterns are not cut from the pieces - A. These large patterns were sent by the manufacturer at Norwich. I never saw these pieces till after the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long has this entry been made - A. I suppose two years; this bale was intended for exportation it could not be exported in consequence of the interruption with the communication to the Continent; the value of the pieces are ten pounds.</p>

             the younger came in, I had some bread and cheese and a pint of beer; she said, Welchman, will you let me drink with you; she sat in the box very near the side of me and called for a pipe of tobacco, after that she called for another and shifted and sat on the right side of the box. After I had drank the pint of beer I had a glass of rum and been very much fatigued three days before, I put my head on the box and slept for half an hour to the best of my recollection, the landlord informed me something; when I awoke the prisoner was gone, I afterwards made an application to a constable there, he refused to give me assistance, he is a baker at Crayford; this was on the Saturday, I came to London on the Monday morning, I gave some information at Bow-street.</p>

I had three hundred and twelve pound in my breeches pocket, they consisted of Bank notes, Canterbury and Dartford notes, they were in brown paper - I had four twentys, more than five or six tens, and a good many fives, and from seven to ten ones; I have seen some of the notes since in the possession of Gillmore the officer. The money was all taken out of my pocket when I was asleep, and when I awoke the girl was gone.</p>

On the 22d of October the elder Shadwell came to my house about eight o'clock in the morning, the younger one came in about half past eleven, before she came in the elder woman offered me a country note for ten pound, I told the old woman I did not change country notes; she offered after another country note of ten pound. When the young Shadwell came in my servant called me into the bar, I looked at a tray in the cupboard, I saw many notes, my servant said they were Mrs. Shadwell's; she sells apples in the street, my servant said I was to give them directions where to get them changed. I took them in the parlour and sorted them, there were fifty pound in country notes on Masterman and co. on Williams and Griffiths two five pound notes, five ten pound notes of Dartford, and six one pound Bank of England notes, in all, country notes one hundred and ten pound and six one pound Bank of England.

             pursued the prisoners into the city by the direction of Mr. Jones expecting to see them at the banker's; when I came into St. Paul's Church-yard I met an hackney coach with the two prisoners in it and four other persons, it was about one o'clock, they went to Ludgate-hill and were coming towards Westminster; I ordered the coachman to stop and immediately jumped into the coach and said which of you ladies have got any thing for me, they said they did not know what I meant; I ordered the coachman to drive to Queen-square; going along I said which of you ladies have got bank notes, I asked them frequenly, at last one of them cried and pointed to the old woman said that is the woman that has got what you want; I said no one should put their hands into their pockets untill I had searched them; going along the Strand the elder prisoner said, now shall I speak? I told her she might do as she liked about that; she put her hand in her pocket and gave me a parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. What relations are the prisoners - A. The elder one is mother-in-law; she conveyed to me fifty new one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050038"/>pound Bank notes, the elder one cried and said, Oh! Mary if you have any more give them to Mr. Gillmore, addressing herself to the younger prisoner I wish you had broke your neck before you had brought your father and me into this trouble. Mary pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket which contained some silver; I afterwards found two guineas, she gave me that and said that was all she had got of the money left, adding, you know, mother, I gave it all to you. When we came to the office the elder Shadwell gave me some more notes at the public house where we searched them, which made up in total one hundred and fifteen pound, I asked the old woman how she came by the fifty new notes; the young one was present, she said she had just received them at the banker's in change of five ten pound notes; I then asked the young one how she came possessed of all this money she told me that coming from Maidstone Fair she met with a Welchman who gave her the notes to take care of; I then called the mother of one side and told her that I heard that she had something more at home, I would wish to search her lodgings; I left the other prisoner in the care of my brother officer and went and searched the elder prisoner's lodgings at St. Hermit's-hill, I there found a quantity of new linen drapery goods, I asked her where she purchased them, she told me at Mr. Barrett's in the Broad-way, that she had left a twenty pound and a five pound for Mr. Barrett to change, that she had received no other change for the twenty-five pound than the goods that lay there, these are the new goods which I have here, and the notes, a twenty pound and a five pound they are both Rochester and Chatham Bank; I then traced a ten pound note in the hands of Mr. Cadmore a publican, making about one hundred and sixty pound; the elder prisoner told me there was fifty-five pound more in the hands of Mr. Battin a publican in Westminster, he denies all knowledge of it. When we went to Crayford I found a bundle which the younger prisoner claims, that is in court; she says she left it behind her at the Swan; I went there to fetch the landlord up, he has left the house.</p>

               <p>Q. You say there was a pane of glass broken, do you think a person putting their hand in might pull out that gimblet - A. Yes, I think I could have done it very well myself. As I was going out of the house I saw Mr. Green, a neighbour, he was talking to the prisoner, Cranston; I smiled and told Mr. Green I was going to take a pleasant walk, the afternoon being fine, meaning the contrary; I told him I was going to Bayswater, he said not back to night, I said yes, I had done it frequently after this time, I then walked on to Bayswater, I met my husband there about half past six o'clock, we both returned home about a quarter before ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband - A. A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know Cranston before, did you - A. Yes, he lives very near to us. When we came to the top of the Green there is the City Arms where we have our beer, I gave my husband the key, he went home and I followed with my son and the pot of porter in my hand; when I came to my own door my husband met me and said, we are robbed; I went in and found the kitchen window open, that window I had fastened with the gimblet; I missed three candlesticks off the mantle-shelf, a shirt from the chair back; we then went up stairs I missed a bolster, two pillows with their cases, a pair of sheets, a gown, a one pound Bank note, fifteen shillings in silver, and two table-cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these things again - A. I have seen some of the things again but I cannot say whether they are my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me caution you, you must speak the truth - A. On the second week there were some things brought up to the office.</p>

               <p>Q. You were coming home from Bayswater - A. Yes, a quarter before ten; I was the first person that came home, I was the proper person to be the prosecutor, not my wife. I unlocked my door, I saw the window open,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050039"/>there had been a pane broken out some time, I thought my wife very careful to fasten all the doors and leave the window open, I gave her a good lecture when she came home, I went to get a candlestick to light a candle, I missed the candlestick. About six weeks ago I saw a person look over my pales in my yard at one o'clock in the morning, I really believe it was Cranston, I spoke to him, I said, what are you looking after here, my friend? he said, he was taking a view of the rooms to see whether they were bigger than the rooms in his house; I asked him who he was, he said, a neighbour over the way, the hair-dresser. Cranston used to shave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now after this conversation with him, that he was your neighbour, the hair-dresser, had you any doubt about his being your neighbour - A. No, not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct Cranston to be taken up - A. My wife applied at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your things brought before the magistrate - A. Yes; they were not a bit like mine; I could not speak to any of them.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended Cranston on the 5th of November, the sister of Cranston applied to Mrs. Dadd, the sister and Mrs. Dadd came to my house together and offered five pound, a gentleman of the name of Holder offered ten pound to Mrs. Dadd, they asked me what I could do in it, I told them I could not do any thing untill I apprehended the other prisoners. There is another besides these, I apprehended Clare on the 21st of November, it was through a letter being sent to our magistrate; I went on board the Dorset East Indiaman laying off Gravesend; before I apprehended Clare Cranson offered to me if I would admit him to be an evidence he would tell where the property was.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you this conversation with Cranston - A. On the 29th he told me proviso I would admit him to be an evidence he would tell me where the things were; he had pledged the things on the 5th at Mr. Crouch's, Paul-street, Finsbury-square, they were all pledged in his own name and they had burned the duplicates; I went to the pawnbrokers and found it to be true. Clare said to me, coming up from Gravesend, he wished he had never seen the family, it was well known Cranston was a thief and had been sent away before for stealing spoons; he was innocent of the charge. Cranston told me he was the first person that entered the house, Clare followed him, and Clare's brother, a butcher, stood outside; he has been out of the way ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. I was standing near to Mrs. Dadd's door, Mrs. Dadd came out and told me that she was going to Bayswater; Cranston was standing near me, he asked me how far it was to Bayswater, I said about five or six miles, he said it must be late before they get home I said it must be nine or ten o'clock before they came home if they made haste.</p>

            . On the 4th of November, about half past seven, or between that and eight, I went out to see if the beer was coming. As I went up to Elbow Place near the prosecutor's house, it joins Howard's Green, I saw a man stand in Elbow Place in a blue jacket. I turned my head to look at him in the face; he then turned his head round to hide his face. As I was returning on Howard's Green, I saw the prisoner Cranston coming along with a large bag. I have been to his shop to be shaved, they make bags. I am confident it was the prisoner Cranston, and the man that I saw in Elbow Place was not Clare, it was a stouter man.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dark - A. No. I returned home about six, it was then dark; I unlocked the door, I found the woman in the apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house - A. Yes; the moment I unlocked the door; she bolted out, I ran after her and caught her, I left her in charge of a neighbour. I went into the house and found all the things in the indictment moved from off a chair behind the door to the window. I shut the window down when I went out, and it was open when I came back; the window was not fastened, any person might get in at the window from the street.</p>

I went immediately to the place, I put my hand in there, found a bladder containing three pints of foreign brandy; I asked him what he thought of himself, and what he knew of it, he looked confused and made no answer; I took off his hat, there I found another bladder, containing three pints more of brandy, he begged I would forgive him. I took him in custody. These four bottles contain all the brandy I found in the two bladders.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. Yes, when I first saw them, they catched hold of me by the arm, one by one arm, and the other the other, they asked me where I was going to, I told them home. I went a little way down Skinner Street, each of them holding my arm. I did not wish to walk with them, they went with me, they asked me to go with them. They asked me if I meant to give them any thing, I asked them what they wanted, they wanted two shillings of me.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they asked for two shillings, for the purpose as the women of the town do. - A. Yes, they proposed that I should go to their house, they said it was in Skinner Street, but not where justly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an umbrella with you at this time. - A. Yes, in my hand. They then asked for something to drink, I told them I would not, and they struck me on the head with the patten.

             struck me first, they both struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced them to strike you with the patten. - A. Because I would not give them any thing to drink. I said nothing to provoke them, they beat my hat off, and struck me three or four times after my hat was off. They cut my head in three or four places.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you said nothing to provoke them. - A. No I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call them bad women, or any thing of that sort. - A. No, I made away from them, and got to the public-house door, put my hand with my hat in there. I held the umbrella with the other hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the public-house door open. - A. It was put to, but I pushed it open with my hand. I put my hand inside of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them attempted to take away your hat. - A. Yes, they attempted to take my hat away, after they struck it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you put it inside of the public-house door to secure it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had put the hat within side of the door, and you were holding the umbrella in the other hand, what did they do then. - A. They beat me with the pattens, and laid on so, I was obliged to let go the umbrella. I was not able to hold the umbrella any longer. They had hold of the umbrella all the time, trying to pull it from me. They got it from me by main force.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think you were able to resist before they got it from you by main force. - A. I suppose five minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that disabled you from keeping hold of the umbrella. - A. The blows disabled me from keeping my hold, and they got it out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of your umbrella. - A. I valued it at two shillings. When they got the umbrella, they made the best of their way off. They run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come out of the public-house to your assistance. - A. Yes, Charles Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out while they were beating of you. - A. Yes, but nobody came then. After that, me and the witness, Wright, went to the surgeon's to get something to put to my head. I bled so much, I was not able to stand. I went with Wright with his assistance. I was stunned with the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off did the surgeon live, that you went to. - A. In Bishopgate Street. I went to Mr. Fox, the surgeon, he was not at home. When I was coming back, I saw

               <p>Q. Was this near the watchbox where this happened. - A. No, I saw the other the next night after. I sent for Mr. Sheppard, the officer, and described her to him. He went and took her the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not with him when he took her. - A. No, he took them both.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw them after Sheppard took them. - A. I saw one the next night, and the other I saw on the Monday following. I saw Taylor on the next night, and Stevens I saw on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure there are the two women who had beat you in this way, and ran away with the umbrella. - A. Yes, I have no doubt of either of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your umbrella again. - A. Yes, Mr. Sheppard shewed it me, I know it to be mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he much cut? did you examine it. - A. Yes, I took him in the house, got a candle, and looked at his head. I saw the wounds were dangerous. I took him to Mr. Fox, a surgeon. I opened the door; they said Mr. Fox was out. I went to another docter, at the corner of Spital-square. I could get no assistance. I brought him to the door from whence I had taken him, to the public-house. We bathed the wound with brandy, endeavouring to stop the blood. The blood was stopped, in a measure, by that means. Previous to our taking him into the house, the prisoner Stevens, was passing the door, Adams said,</p>
               <p>"Wright, that is one of them." I turned round to him, and requested him to get a watchman. He said,</p>

            . I am a constable. On Wednesday the 21st of November, Mr. Aams applied to me. He told me had been robbed of an umbrella, and very ill-treated.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the appearance of any violence about his person. - A. Very much so then: about the head he had three wounds, and about the breast, upon the back of the head, and the arm. He described the persons, as women who attacked him in this way; he described their appearance and persons. In consequence of his information I apprehended the prisoner Taylor, on Wednesday night, at her lodgings in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street. I told her I took her for robbing a man of an umbrella, and ill-treating of him. She said, she knew nothing about it. I took her on the ground floor of the house, she was in bed at the time; it was about twelve o'clock at night when I searching her lodgings. I found this umbrella under the further side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any woman with her. - A. No, I asked her how she came by that umbrella? She said, she found it. I then secured her, and took the prosecutor to look at her, to see if he knew her, the same evening. When the prosecutor saw her, he said, that was one of the women, in her hearing. She said she was not. I secured her, and then she was taken to the Poultry Compter. And on the Thursday night I apprehended another woman on suspicion. I took her in Bishopsgate-street. I applied to the prosecutor; he was so ill for three days he could not attend the Magistrate. On the Sunday I went to the prosecutor. I shewed him the woman that I had taken up. Him, and Wright, they said, that was not the woman. She was discharged on the Monday. I apprehended Stevens on the Sunday night, from a further description of Adams and Wright. I found her at her lodgings in Petticoat-lane. I took her in bed: there was another woman in bed. It being dark I enquired. The other woman said, she was not at home: she denied her several times. I enquired for her by the name of Bonner; that is her right name. The woman said that Nance was not at home. She goes by the name of Nance. I found the prisoner Stevens at the bottom of the bed, after I went down and got a light.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she was acquainted with your person and voice. - A. I do not know that she knew my voice: she knowed my person very well. I have spoken to her many times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had taken her from the bed-clothes, did you tell her what you had against her. - A. Yes, she said she knew nothing of him. I charged her with robbing a man, and beating him with the pattens. I asked for the pattens. I could not find any; she said she never wore any.</p>
               <p>Q. This was Sunday night; how long was it after that the prosecutor saw her. - A. On the Monday morning. I took both Wright and him up to the Compter. I took them in one at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women were there in the room. - A. They only came to the gate, and looked through. I suppose there were about five in the whole, that I took notice of. I think it was Wright. I took first Wright; pointed out Stevens. I called the prosecutrix to look; he pointed out Stevens also, without any thing being said to him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Look at that umbrella. - A. This is the umbrella that was taken from me that evening; there is the name on it of the person that I had it of. I had it of Mrs. Monday. It was torn in taking it from me. It is worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence That umbrella I found when I was coming home on Tuesday night going down Skinner-street. I stumbled over something. I stooped and picked it up; it was an umbrella, all over mud and dirt. The prosecutor I never saw in my life, until I was taken on the Wednesday night to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Stevens Defence. I knew nothing of this young lady before I was taken in custody, nor of the gentleman. I was taken out of my bed, and I did not know what for.</p>

On the 21st of November, I saw Williams on Bear-quay, in the act of taking some rags that had been just landed from a vessel. The rags were in a bag when landed on their quay. They are responsible to the owners for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him there in the course of the day before. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a person employed on the quays. - A. It is very rarely that we can get him to work; he is generally idle. I ran immediately when I saw him take it from the bag. On seeing me, he immediately ran away. It was the top bag of the pile, the package was cut. It contained rags. At Wiggins's quay, I saw the prisoner getting under a waggon. I searched him, and found a large bag upon him, it would hold thirty pound, it was a large bag that he had round his neck. I compared the rags in the bag that I found with him, it was the same quality as the rags were in the bag that had been cut across, and there was a vacancy in the bag, and the rags found on him would make up the deficiency. He confessed having taken the rags, and said if I would let him go, I never should see him on the quay any more. These are the rags, they are worth a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along the quays. I picked them up. I was never nigh the bag within three or four yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a portmanteau left in your care, the property of your master. - A. Mr. Johnson left a portmanteau in my care until he returned. I received a letter from Mr. Johnson a week preceding the 5th of November, desiring me to send him down a black coat and waistcoat, a curricle coat, and a portmanteau, desiring that I would enclose the coat and waistcoat within the portmanteau. That I did, with intent to send them down to Mr. Johnson. The portmanteau I enclosed within the box-coat, and then enclosed that within brown paper. I gave it to our porter; it was to be taken to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn. Robert, our porter, left the house with it on the 5th of of November. The portmanteau was worth ten shillings, the great coat ten shillings, the black coat about ten shillings, and the waistcoat two shillings and sixpence.</p>

            , to take to the Stamford coach, at the George and Blue Boar, Holborn. When the parcel was given to me, we were a porter short. I hired the prisoner Oxley. I delivered to him the parcel that Crofts delivered to me, at five o'clock in the afternoon. I told him to take it to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn, to go by the Stamford coach. I gave him this book, and sixpence to pay for the booking. He was to return to me the next morning, deliver me the book, and I would satisfy him. In consequence of his not coming, I had suspicion I waited till ten o'clock the next morning. I went to the George and Blue Boar, made enquiry, they told me the parcel had not been delivered. I looked after the prisoner. I found him at the Ship, in Lime-street. I took him to the George and Blue Boar. I asked the bookkeeper whether the said parcel had been delivered there for the Stanford coach, in the name of Johnson? He said, no such parcel had been delivered. The prisoner had delivered to me the book, there was no entery of the parcel. He said he had delivered the parcel to another man to carry. The prisoner took me to different houses, at different parts of the town, under pretence of finding this man; no such man was to be found as he described. In consequence of that, I went for a constable.</p>

From information, when she went out of the shop, I followed her, and overtook her about forty yards from the shop; I laid hold of her, and brought her back. She delivered up the piece of ribbon to me, and wished me to let her go. I took her back to the shop. Mr. Sapwell, the officer, searched her. He found four pieces of ribbon in her boson, three were ours. I knew them to be my master's. I measured the four pieces of ribbon, they contained sixty-six yards and a half. They were worth 1 l. 5 s.</p>

            . Q. Did you see this young woman in the shop. - A. Yes, I served her, she asked for three quarters of a yard of ribbon. I took out a drawer of ribbons, and produced them to her, she bought three quarters of a yard, it came to three pence. I did not know any thing untill Hall brought her back. The account that Hall has given, is correct and true.</p>

            . I am a constable, I searched the prisoner. I found four rolls of ribbon down her bosom, there were three of them claimed by Mr. Bruton. When these were found, she fell on her knees and begged for mercy. I have got five pieces, I did not find an owner for one piece.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the city. On Thursday the 6th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner with the property in his possession, near Tower-hill. He was alone. Being dark, I stopped him. I asked him what he had got there? he told me, bed-furniture. It turned out to be correct. I asked him where he was going to take it to? he told me, to sell it. He could not rightly tell the place. I put him into Aldgate watch-house. I told him then, I suspected it was stolen. He told me he had brought it from home, it was his own furniture. I asked him where he lived? he directed me to 13, Dagger-court, Moorfields; his father-in-law kept the house, and they all lived in one family. I search him; I found two large keys upon him. He said they belonged to the doors of his rooms. I told him I thought they were stable keys. He then said he found them. I then put him in an hackney-coach, and took him to the Compter. I asked him if he had any master? he said no, he jobbed about any where. In going to the Compter, he said, he did not live where he told me, he lived in North-street. He told me a lie. After I had put him in the Compter, I went to Dagger-court, to his first directions; they there informed me that he worked for Mr. Mullett. I gave the information, and Mr. Mullett came to the Mansion-house. I searched his lodgings, in North-street, he lived there. I found the keys belonging to his master's stables, in Moor-lane. I understand he had the looking after the horses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my bed-furniture; it was taken out of my warehouse without my knowledge. I am positive I had not sold the furniture to any body: the prisoner had been my servant for two years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I found these curtains in my master's stables. The man was very ill that used to take care of the horses. I went up to the stable one week, and found it. I know no more than I found these things. My master trusted me with all that he had almost. There was a man that lived there before, that robbed him, and the porters all would hang me now, if they could.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Shoreditch. On the 25th of November, about five minutes before two, I saw the two prisoners in Kingsland-road, one of them had a bulk upon his shoulder. I got out of my box, followed them, and passed them. I turned back and stopped both of them. Jones had a cask upon his shoulder. I asked them what they had got? they said,</p>
               <p>"nothing." I told them I should take them to the watch-house. Cooper said,</p>
               <p>"do not, here is two shillings for you." I said,</p>
               <p>"that would not do, I would not take a farthing." Then Jones said, I should carry the cask. He threw it down, and the bung flew out, and the beer ran about the street. I tasted it, it was ale. I called for assistance; my partner came and took Jones, and I took Cooper. We took them to the watch-house, and they said they did not know each other.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were these things then. - A. They were in the manger, in the first stall in the stable, I lay in the next stable, they could not see me, After doing up my horses, I put my fork and broom in the first empty stall, and when I caught hold of Marshall, the fork and broom fell towards me, and the other woman darkened the door. I called our ostler instantly, he was in the office. I never found my property, the other woman got off, the other woman must have taken my bundle. I never found the other woman, or any bundle again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband is in the stable, the same as that young man is, I missed him that evening, I went to the stable and called Ned, there was a woman there, he charged me with taking the bundle.</p>

               <p>- JOHNSON. I am a shoemaker. On the 7th of November, the prisoner stood at the step of my door, attempting to reach a pair of boots, he saw me come into the shop, he ran away, I pursued him. He went to the prosecutor's shop. I saw him take something out, and put it into the left hand pocket. I laid hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he had taken out of that shop.

The prisoner lodged with me, he offered to go to the pawnbroker's with me, to find out the property. He and I went to a great number of Pawnbroker's, the last we went to, we found the carpet. The prisoner enquired for the carpet, the pawnbroker said, there was a carpet brought on the Saturday night, and he was the man that brought it. This was on Monday when we found the carpet.</p>

The prisoner came in for a two-penny loaf, he made a bother about it, he pointed out which he would have, I gave him that which he pointed to. When I went in doors, my mother came out, she asked me where the cheese was gone, there was nobody in the shop but the prisoner. I did not see him take the cheese. The cheese was there when he came in, and when he was gone, the cheese was gone. I am sure he is the person.</p>

Mr. Hutt stopped me, he asked me what I had got, I told him it was mine, I picked it up.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was the 6th. - A. Last Thursday, he was to go and live with Lord Burleigh, as groom, I gave him a character last Sunday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a good character with him. - A. Yes, very good. He took his box away early on Wednesday morning last, before I was up, when he returned I asked him where he had been, he said, he had been taking his box away. I had given him orders the night before to go to the carpenter, I told him, it was very improper going upon his own business: it past off till the next morning. On the Thursday morning, one of my shopmen informed me, that, he had lost shirts and neckcloths out of his bed-room, dirty linnen. I called up the prisoner some time after, and asked him about it, I told him I must have it cleared up before he went. I had given him a good character, and I wished to know the rights of it. I desired him to go with the shopman, to shew him the box that he had taken away. They went out, and in a short time, they both returned. The box was to be in the coachman's apartment, he was to live in the coachman's apartment, over the stables, when he returned he said, the coachman and his wife were out of town. I requested one of the shopmen to go to his Lordship's taylor, where the prisoner's clothes were making, to enquire if the family were out of town, the prisoner said he would go with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050047"/>him I had some suspicion that he would get away from him. I immediately desired another shopman to follow him, and in a short time after they both brought him back again. He attempted to make his escape from them. I sent for a constable; he took him to Marybone watch-house. From there he was taken to Marlborough-street Office. I went there, and swore to the property, a piece of Irish of twenty-six yards, and about five yards of plain British muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed out of your shop any thing of that sort. - A. No, it is impossible from our large concern to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been your porter. - A. About five months.</p>

            . Q. You are shopman to Mr. Evans and Savage, are not you. - A. I am. On Tuesday evening last I missed part of my linen. I suspected the prisoner from his being the only man that had access to my room, except the other young men. I mentioned it to Mr. Evans. I went to Lord Burleigh's stables, where he took me to a wrong door. He knocked at the wrong door, and could receive no answer. He said, the coachman had left town on Tuesday morning. This was on the Thursday morning the prisoner and me returned to Mr. Evans. I went to enquire at the taylor's. Before I got there, the prisoner and another young man was out, and I met them at the taylor's in Maddox street. The prisoner went from there into Bond-street, on business for himself. The prisoner then said he would give us a chance: he ran down Grosvenor-street. We ran after him, caught him, and took him into a public-house. After some time he promised to walk quietly home, if we would let him go. The moment he got out of the door he ran from home. We could not catch him. In Berkley-square he was catched by a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out after him. - A. I did, and he was taken by a man in Berkley-square; the man let him go on our coming up. We told the man we suspected him of having stolen goods. The same man followed him again, and found him concealed in a stable. I was present at the time. I followed the man in, and found the prisoner secreted under the manger in the stable. The man took him out of where he was, and gave him into our custody. We took him to Mr. Evans's house. We went for a constable, who took him to the watch-house. We took the constable up to Lord Burleigh's stable. Me, Bevan, and Pearson, the constable, went to the apartment occupied by the coachman, and found the box of the prisoner, which he had taken away. I knew the box, I had seen it on the morning before on the counter in the shop. I asked him if it was his box? he answered,</p>
               <p>"Yes." We brought the box to the watch-house where the prisoner was. It was opened in the prisoner's presence. He gave the constable the key. We found a piece of Irish linen and a quantity of British muslin, and two half handkerchiefs belonging to

            . Q. You were in company with the last witness, when you went after the prisoner. - A. I was; I went with the prisoner the second time, when he was pursued up Grosvenor-street; he was pursued and taken. The stranger ran after him again.</p>
               <p>Q. And you followed after the stranger. - A. I did. The prisoner took to a stable. The prisoner was taken and brought to our house. What Winter has stated is correct and true I went with Winter for the box. I knew it was the prisoner's box. I had seen it a few days before. I saw the box opened. The prisoner gave 
               <persName id="t18101205-81-person825">Pearson</persName>
             the key. The prisoner said, some time before in our shop, that he had lost the key Upon this occasion he produced it, and the things were taken out by Mr. Pearson, a piece of Irish linen and a piece of British muslin.</p>
               <p>- PEARSON. I am a constable of Marybone.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sent for to take up the prisoner, was not you. - A. Yes; I apprehended him on Thursday last, the 6th. I found the box in the apartment near the stable. I brought the box to the watch-house where the prisoner was. I asked the prisoner for the key, he gave it me. I opened the box with the key. I found in it this Irish linen, and the British muslin. opened it before the prisoner's face.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Evans by. - A. No, only me, the two shopmen, and the prisoner. I have had the things ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Winter. Have you seen the Irish linen, and the British muslin, in Mr. Evans's shop. - A. I certainly have - they have his private mark. I cannot state what particular time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This Irish linen, it is my property, and marked in my own hand writing. It is the joint property of me and Mr. Savage. The British muslin has my own mark, likewise the Irish linen. I have valued at 4 l. it is a fine one. I think it is a low value, indeed - the value of the British muslin is fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You say you know these are your goods because they are marked with your writing. - A. They are the goods of myself and partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you rub that mark out when you sell them. - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is possible that you may have sold it. - A. It is possible. This was taken out of the prisoner's box. We cannot take out that mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Savage live. - A. He resides in Holley-street. Me and my family sleep at where my business is carried on, in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I observed the prisoner Williams, and two others, forcing that copper into the street-door. It is a large copper. It was too wide. When they got the copper in, I ran over the way directly. I got into the house, and seized Williams standing by the copper, and Molloy standing by him. Mrs. Etherington was standing with the candle in her hand, by the side of the counter. They seemed alarmed at my coming in so sudden upon them. Mrs. Etherington turned herself round, and went into the parlour. I secured the two prisoners. I told Mr. Barnley, a constable, to go in the passage. It is a double house. They are two houses joined together; and as they got the copper in, the two men went in the passage into the other house - they made their escape. I secured these two men. Williams face was all over black. I took them to the office, and left Mrs. Etherington in the care of Barnley. I came back from the office, and then took Mrs. Etherington in custody. When I got her to the door, she put a dollar in my hand. She said,</p>
               <p>"let me go, and be as easy as you can." I told her I could not do any such thing, and returned the money back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The moment you saw these persons go into the house, you directly went into the house, how many were they. - A. There were three, Sir. I went in directly after the copper.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of November, Mr. Hutt called and asked me to point out Etherington's house to him. We went and looked in the window, then crossed the way and stopped there. We saw either three or four men come with something along. I saw them put it down at Mrs. Etherington's door, and they tried to get it in one way; they could not; they turned it, at last they got it in; the door goes with a pulley; it went to. Hutt ran over. I said,</p>
               <p>"stop, let them buy it first." Hutt was in a hurry, he ran over. When I got in, Hutt had got hold of these men. He said,</p>
               <p>"Go on, there is some more gone up the passage." Mrs. Etherington was there, and I think, with the keys of the warehouse in her hand, but that I do not swear to. Her houses are No. 10 and 11. I questioned Molloy and Williams, where they got the copper from? they gave no satisfactory account at all.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prisoner asked me to let him go home with me. I told him no. He took me up Fox-court.

On the 15th of November, the two prisoners came into my shop to look at some silk handkerchiefs, I shewed them a number, they did not approve of any. I took them away, and brought a drawer full, the handkerchiefs were covered over, I set it on the counter before them, and left it covered over, then stepped about ten yards to a door, to call my young man, a number of other customers coming in just at that time. When I came back, the man prisoner had taken the paper off the the drawer, and was looking at them, the woman stood by him, and appeared to be putting something into her pocket. I still opened the handkerchiefs for them to look at, to endeavour to sell them one, and while I was doing this,

She had a man with her. She asked me to go home with her. I went with her into a public-house in New Gravel Lane. She said she had not got the money, the man was to pay for them. The man went out, and then she went out to look after him. She came in again, she said, she could not find him. She took two shawls out with her to go and look after the man; I did not see her take them out, I missed them after she was gone. I waited some time in the public-house, to see if she came back, and then went home.

               <p>"they were a complete set of swindlers, they had got two handkerchiefs. I went with the lad to the public-house, and there I saw the prisoner and the sailor that came with her. She swore that she knew nothing of the shawls. the sailor appeared to be drunk. I sent the boy to Shadwell office. The officer came and took her in custody; she said then,</p>
               <p>"let me go, I will find the shawls," she went into Mrs. Collins's, and got the two shawls. These are the shawls, they have our private mark, they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these things delivered to you to wash. - A. Yes. I was answerable for the property. I lost the articles on the 18th of October. I hanged the clothes out to dry in the garden. The things were there at five o'clock in the afternoon. Between six and seven I went to take them in; they were gone. My garden joins a cotton manufactory, and is separated by a wall. I suppose seven or eight feet high. I knew the things when I saw them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 17th or 18th of October, I went to the house of the green-grocer. George Boulton came by, told me he was going to his club in Bishopsgate-street. He asked me if I would take the bundle, which I agree. He also took off his waistcoat, and asked me to pawn it, which I did. On that evening I was taken up for assaulting a man, for which I was confined in prison sixteen days, and when I came out I was accused of robbing a laundress. The laundress desired my mother to go to Long-alley, and bring the articles. My mother went and found that the green-grocer had delivered the articles to the officer in Worship-street.</p>
