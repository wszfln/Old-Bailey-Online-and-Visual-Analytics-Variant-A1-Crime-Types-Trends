I am clerk to Arthur Charles Bouner, the trustee in the prisoner's bankruptcy—the liabilities are returned by the debtor at £4,842, of which £4,614 10s. 1d. is described as in respect of unsecured creditors—he describes his net assets as £2,240 10s. 6d., being a deficiency of £2,601 15s. 11d—of these assets I have realised only £149—£633 of the assets are described as good book debts, but I have only recovered some<lb/>thing under £2 in respect of those—with regard to the five pianos and organ mentioned in his assets, I went to his place of business at 22, Commercial Road, and on demanding them I was informed that they were included in the sale of his business—in his preliminary examination he stated that one Gaverin held a share in his business at 22, Commercial Street for a consideration including bills for £350—I did not get those—I got £115 from Gaverin in discharge of those bills—that was part of the £149 which I recovered.</p>

The vendor shall sell, and the purchaser shall purchase for the sum of £550 all the timber and other stock in trade of and belonging to the vendor, in connection with his business as a timber merchant, as the same is now carried on by him at 18a, Spital Street, aforesaid"—that agreement was executed by both parties in my presence—I also prepared an assignment of the lease on the same day—the purchase money was £600, £550 for the business, and £50 for the lease was paid at my office—I saw the money pass, and endorsed the receipt on the back of the agreement—I noticed that there was a bankruptcy clause in the lease, and pointed it out to both parties, and I asked the defendant if there was—any likelihood of his becoming a bankrupt, and he shrugged his shoulders, as if it was too ridiculous to mention.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Thornlands, Netley Marsh, Hamp<lb/>shire—in January last I received this circular from the "Whitehall Ex<lb/>change," 31, Charing Cross (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 32<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), signed"J. Walters, Secretary," recommending cheap priced shares in the Klerksdorp, Transvaal, and South African Exploring and Cold Storage Companies—I replied that I would purchase shares on the condition that I was liable for the sum in<lb/>vested and no more, and that the profit would accrue in a few days—I enclosed a cheque for £30, which was paid by my bank in due course—I afterwards received Exhibits 85 and 86, offering more shares at 5s. 6d. to 6s. a share, and signed"J. Walters, Secretary," and enclosing sold notes for £32 with commissions—at the bottom of the notes was printed, "It is distinctly understood that you incur no further liability beyond the amount of cover"—I sent £32 for investment and £2 14s. charges, by this cheque to J. Walters, crossed The Royal British Bank, my bankers being the London and Provincial Bank at Liss, and received acknowledg<lb/>ment, Exhibit 91, signed J. Walters, also Exhibit 92, dated February 14th, for more shares at 12s.—I sent a wire, and afterwards a letter, enclosing a cheque for £30—I afterwards received the circular as to 150 Niekirk shares at 14s. 10 1/2d., £112 10s., and 4s. cover—I did not know what cover meant—I received the contract note—the cheque was paid by my bank—the correspondence produced ensued, in which I expressed disappointment, and in which Walters states on February 28th that "owing to the weak Bull Account" there had been delay, that the average would be £21 17s. 6d., and that there would be a "carrying over"—I did not know what the terms meant-in reply to Walters' advice in Exhibits 105 and 106 I sent my cheque for £21 17s. 6d. for the purchase of the four different kinds of South African shares named—I did not know what they were—I had seen the terms "Charters" and "Rhodesians" in the papers—the writing on several of the circulars and letters sent to me was in the same hand, including the letter signed "M. Walters," which states that Walters was seriously ill, that even his life was despaired of, and said, "I cannot give information respecting his business," and those promising settlement, one "as soon as possible"—one letter states that to ask for money on a post<lb/>card was an indictable offence, but I did not write such a postcard—in Exhibit 122 he asked me to accept this bill of exchange, which I accepted, believing it was a promise to pay me money which I was going to accept—[<hi rend="italic">This was on the London and Provincial Bank for</hi> £35, <hi rend="italic">and dated London, June</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1902, <hi rend="italic">at three months, and signed "Geo. Slingsby," which was obliterated, and the three months was altered to six weeks; it was endorsed, but the name appeared to be scratched through.</hi>]—I had no recollection what name was on it—These directions came with the bill: "Accepted, payable it [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] Bank, I. T. Frere,' write across, putting in name of your bank"—I received Exhibit 123<hi rend="italic">a</hi> from the Whitehall Exchange, offering 150 hares—I replied and stated that in my letter of the 18th I had made the alteration to six weeks, as I considered the three months that had already assed might have been enough—I wanted the money at once—I do not know what I meant, but I used a word not applicable—I altered the bill of six weeks because I wanted my money sooner, but something I remember</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190211170017"/>
               <p>writing has not been read—I also received Exhibit 125, offering shares in the "Toilette Requisites Company," and this second Bill of Exchange and the other correspondence produced followed in Exhibits 126 to 130, making excuses for delay, and asking me not to send postcards—I received Exhibit 131, signed Clement G. Scott—I had seen the prisoner Scott while staying in London—[<hi rend="italic">This was headed"Clement Scott and Co., Outfitters, 101, Brixton Road," and offered large interest on money invested.</hi>]—I answered that, and received a letter enclosing a reference to Dr. Ullathorne, 63, Queen Victoria Street, to whom I wrote, and got a reply—I received Exhibit 135 from Clement G. Scott, stating, "I have just had an offer of goods for the spring trade," and asking for £25—I sent this cheque for £26 10s., which has been paid by my bankers, and is endorsed"Clement Scott"—Exhibit 137 is the receipt—I saw Scott by appointment in the Brixton Road, for him to take my measure—I was thinking of employing him as a dress tailor—at the time I parted with my cheques to the Whitehall Exchange Company I believed they were carrying on a genuine business as stock brokers, and that the shares referred to had been bought and sold to me.</p>

I have sent another man named Scott some money to invest in the City—I have never seen him—he paid me with a good profit for what I first sent him, the second transaction is still pending—I believed Scott to be an honest man—I employed his wife to do some millinery for me—I never gave Scott the order for the costume; he simply took my measure, as I do not live in London, and I said, "If you will come and see me where I am staying I shall be glad for you to take my measure so that you may have it at a future date if I should want a costume"—that was several weeks before I advanced him the money—that was not the consideration for the money—I understand "carrying over" to mean in<lb/>stead of paying as promised, say, in the middle of April you pay at the end of it—I have not now nor since this case been instructing brokers; I thought this was enough for the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Walters.</hi> This was not my first transaction—I did not expect the shares to be delivered to me—I expected the profits to be sent to me and my money returned intact—you said in your letter that you were going to settle, and then in another sentence asked me to accept a bill for £35—I thought that was part of what you owed me—I knew the shares were valueless, and that if I did not get money I should not get anything—I refused to accept them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective.</hi>) I have kept observation on 31, Charing Cross since about August 31st—at first I saw Walters and Slingsby frequently at that address—"The Whitehall Tailoring Company" was up at first—I next saw Scott there about two months after the others, and then O'Falvey about five or six months later—they used to go there and stay sometimes an hour or two, then go to the neighbouring public-houses, leaving a paper on the door saying, "Return in ten minutes."—latterly the office was not kept open at all—it was visited by Scott for letters—he was there for about two minutes in the morning and then went away again—on July 3rd I went to the office—I saw Slingsby and Walters there—I was with Baxter—I said to Slingsby, "You know us, don't you"—he said "Yes,"—I said, "We have called about a commission obtained from a man by an swering an advertisement in the Whitehall Exchange"—he said, "Oh yes, the firm have received a letter from Mr. Dounie; the matter is all right, and the letter has been answered; I deny any responsibility; a Mr. Wright and I, met a man named Snell in the Clarence; Wright gave an order, I have seen the <hi rend="italic">advert</hi> in the paper; I have never caused any <hi rend="italic">advert.</hi> to be inserted in respect to any business or property; the <hi rend="italic">adverts.</hi> Kent, Scott, and Son, and Madam Elsey, 67, Brixton Road, are not mine; I have nothing to do with the business, and know nothing of the <hi rend="italic">advert</hi> you speak about"—he then pointed to Walters at the end of the room—I went to him and he said, "I repudiate all knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">advert.</hi>"—A copy of the <hi rend="italic">International Courier</hi> was there—he picked it up and showed me an advertisement of the Whitehall Exchange, and said, "You do not think I should accept this; 'Whitehall' is spelt without the 'h'"—I saw Scott there, I said to him, "I want to speak to you Mr. Mackenzie," because I thought his name was Mackenzie—he said, "I deny I am Mac<lb/>kenzie; you know better than that, Madam Elsey is my wife; I take all responsibility for her and myself; she is not living with me now; it is only a debt, let them sue me in the County Court; I have nothing to do with the people here, you know, the Whitehall Exchange"—on August 26th, at 7.30 p.m., I arrested Slingsby at 101, Brixton Road; he was ill and I did not take him into custody; I read the warrant to him—he said, "We have had no money from the man Rimbod"—he was kept under observation at his house, and was also under the care of the divisional surgeon for about</p>

O'Falvey went to the Whitehall Ex<lb/>change Offices about six months after they were opened—he went there about June, 1901—I did not know that his name was Mackenzie, the difficulty was to find out who Mackenzie was—I never saw O'Falvey at the offices when I called there, but I have seen him when he was coming out with the others, and I have seen them divide money about 10 p.m., all pretty well drunk and rowing with each other about money—I know now that Mackenzie and O'Falvey are the same person—I saw O'Falvey use this office before Mackenzie was put on the door.</p>

               <p>This Frere's business, the cheques were sent for cover on Stock Exchange dealings. I did not act as a broker, but dealt in stocks and shares as a principal. At Easter Miss Frere's cover had run off There was, however, an amount of £30 which had been guaranteed by myself that she should be repaid whether the stocks went against her or not. As a matter of fact the stocks she dealt in were all South African, and no person could guarantee how the market would go. I intended to pay her the £30, and for that reason, I suppose, that bid for £35 was drawn that she should have the 150 West African shares, West African Corporation, which had stood at 14s. each and as high as 18s., and I should have sent them on to her but she refused to receive any shares.

"It is for an assault"—I said, "It might be through that affair on Friday night"—I saw him on October 17th at about 11.30; he seemed very much upset and was crying bitterly—he said, "I have lived with you over eleven years; you think you know Emily but you don't; she is a false cat; she has de<lb/>ceived me from top to bottom"—I said, "Emily is old enough to take care of herself, and you must try and get some work and do the best you can"—he paid me 3s. rent on that day; Emily had always paid it before—she worked very hard and the prisoner very little—he said he would sell off the home and go into the workhouse—I saw him again that night at 8 o'clock—I did not see him again until he was in custody—I heard him go out the next morning at 6.50; I heard him say"Good morning "to my daughter.</p>

I am police surgeon of division—I examined the body of the deceased with the last witness—I have heard his evidence—in all essential particulars I agree with it—after the injury to the chest, in my opinion, it would have been possible for the woman to have run across the road—the knife was handed to me by the police; it had been newly sharpened and was covered with oil—there was a moist, red stain upon, it having the appearance of blood; on testing it I found it to be so—the knife fitted the wounds and corresponded to the incisions; in the body.</p>

I am one of the firm of Field and Co.—last Friday I was in my office about 6 p.m.—I heard a crashing of glass—I went into our warehouse and called one of the men back whom I saw between the office and the lavatory in the basement—I asked Foster to go on the roof with another lad, and went to the back, as the only way of escape for anyone to drop off there—I noticed that a man had dropped from the fence—I chased him as far as from this Court to St. Paul's, and into an empty building—he fell on his back and started kicking—I called to a young man to give me a hand—Tomlins is the man—I never lost sight of him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Chief Detective-Inspector, Great Northern Railway</hi>). On October 9th, I was with other officers in the neighbourhood of Royal Mint Street Depot at 4.40 a.m. in consequence of information I had received—I entered truck 8784 which had arrived from Grimsby during the night—it is described as a box truck, because it is closed in, and has a door—I and the other officers rushed to it—the door was open—the prisoners were in the truck—Nicholls was taking fish from the top of one kit and throwing it into another kit, which we afterwards seized—Garrett stood with a wooden hoop in his hand the hoop is placed over the canvas to secure it—I noticed a plaice on the floor of the truck along<lb/>side the kit—I said to the prisoners, "What are you doing here?"—Nicholls said, "There is one loose"—Garrett said, "Nicholls asked me to help him"—I told them that I should detain them for stealing a quantity of fish from various consignments, the property of the Great Northern Railway Company—they came out of the truck then—Nicholls said, "This kit is unentered," referring to the kit we had seized, and into which he had thrown the fish—it had a label addressed to G. W. Hooker, Fish<lb/>monger, St. Luke's, E.C., Mint Street Station—I told him that it could not be unentered, because three kits were consigned to Hooker there—I sent for the waybills—I examined the kits in truck 8784—under the address on the label was "From G. E. Pegg, fish and ice merchant, Grimsby"—the kit would go back there in ordinary course—that kit was dry—on the top was plaice—it was weighed by another officer in my presence—there were 189 lbs. of haddocks and 27 lbs. of plaice—I examined the other kits in truck No. 8784—I found nineteen of the kits consigned to Hitchcock—two of them had the canvas cut, two were loose or slack, that is not full, apparently some had been taken out and the canvas replaced—haddock had been taken out—fish coming to the Mint Street Depot is the property of the Great Northern Railway until it is delivered to the proper consignee.</p>

The truck was the last but one at the arches end of the platform, and the third from the office end—I began to watch about 4 a.m.—the trucks were then in position—I did not see Nicholls till we rushed into the truck—there are three checkers, Nicholls, Garrett, and How—they come on duty for a month at a time—they have other duties in connection with this particular fish—we were watching out<lb/>side the station opposite the bank—there is a policeman's box in the station at the entrance gate and about 30 yards from the public way—there is always someone on duty there, and at different parts of the station—the checker goes into the truck with a light hand-lamp, and sorts the packages</p>

               <p>to the different consignees, but that is not difficult, they are generally packed together, and he has another man in the truck, to put them on a barrow—there is a man in charge of the truck, and he has what men he wants—30 or 40 men may pass by the trucks—the delivery of the fish is hurried as much as the men can—the fish trains are late sometimes—the checker's duty at Grimsby is to shut the truck, and anybody going in would probably be caught—I know that all Hitchcock's fish were haddocks, but there was plaice in the truck—I only saw that one plaice and that was put there almost instantaneously—the checker moves the fish if he cannot get help, but the kits move easily on their heads and do not want pulling—hoops and canvases come off: it is the checker's duty then to replace the fish and to secure the kit—I swear it was a plaice and not canvas in Nicholl's hand—there were plaice that morning con<lb/>signed to Samuel Isaacs in boxes which could be easily prized open.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Leycester.

It is all right since the King is crowned"—I thought it was one of the new coins—at Shepherd's Bush he disappeared—I showed the sovereign to two people at Shepherd's Bush and to a policeman, and was told that it was not a sovereign—I have not got it now, I have lost it—I next saw the prisoner in October outside the Bank—he came up to me and asked me how I was, and if I was living close by—I saw a policeman on the opposite side, and made an excuse that I was going by one of the omnibuses across the way—he asked if he might come with me—I consented, and when I got to the opposite side I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 66, Rattery Road, Brixton—I have no occupation—under my mother's will I succeeded to a life interest of £100 per annum—the corpus was £3,000—I had a power of appointment by will, of my share—previous to my mother's death I was short of money and went to Hall to obtain a loan, but did not succeed—about a month after her death I obtained a loan of £60 from a Mr. Collyer—I have known Morley about twelve years—I told him I had a life interest of £100 a year under my mother's will—on January 24th, 1901, I received a letter from him, asking me to call upon him in Gray's Inn Passage—I called the next day, and he asked me to lend him £250 on some spirit warrants, and then proposed that I should invest £500 in a business called Mason's Stores, and I agreed—the office of Mason's Stores is in Gray's-Inn Passage—I saw Hall at the office, and he drew up a charge for £500 and a bill for £400, both of which I signed and left with Hall at Morley's suggestion—I was going to borrow money from Hall to lend to Morley—with the bill I was to lend Morley £250, pay off £60 which I owed to Mr. Collyer, and the balance I was to invest in Mason's Stores—later on I found out that the spirit warrants were not worth £250, and I wrote to Hall for the return of the bill and the charge—the next day I was in Morley's office when Hall brought the two documents in—he put them down upon the table for me to take up, but Morley took them up instead—I asked him for them, but he would not give me them—I told him I would consult a solicitor about it, and I consulted Messrs. Finny, Thomas and Co. of Chancery Lane, but a few days after, at Mr. Morley's suggestion, I wrote to them instructing them to take no further proceedings—on February 5th, 1901, I wrote to Mr. Hall, asking him to obtain an advance for me, and later on I executed a mortgage to a Miss Payne for £150—out of the money I paid Mr. Morley £61 3s. 1d. on account of Mason'—I got £10 and the dock warrants out of the</p>

               <p>transaction—the dock warrants were afterwards mortgaged to Mr. Barron—Hall rendered me an account showing how the money had been disposed of—in March, 1901. I executed a mortgage for £350 to a Mrs. Close, out of which £69 4s. 5d. was paid to Morley on account of Mason's Stores—I saw it handed to Morley—out of Mrs. Close's mortgage Miss Payne's mortgage was paid off—on March 9th, 1901. I executed another mortgage to Miss Payne for £150, out of which £99 (5s. 1d. was paid to Morley on account of Mason's Stores—in the same month I executed a mortgage for £600 to James Mason Stores, Limited, which was afterwards charged to Mr. Barron to go into the Stores—Mason's Stores at Gray's Inn Passage was a bottle business—they had a grocery branch at Bromley—about March I became a Director of the Company—very little business was done at Gray's Inn Passage—in June, 1901, Mr. Morley told me that a Mr. Doig owed Mrs. Morley £686, and he asked me to take over the debt and execute a charge on my life interest for £586 in favour of her—I was to make £100 out of the transaction—I executed the charge, Exhibit 9, in Mr. Hall's office—he put it into his safe and said he would fill in the date and get it stamped—on July 15th, 1901, I executed a mortgage for £300 to Mrs. Charlotte Elizabeth Denning—that was given by me to Mrs. Denning as a security for a debt due from Mason's Stores—in August I executed another mortgage for £20 to Miss Payne—she was trying to sell my life interest, and I gave her that to stop her—Mr. Morley was to pay the interest on the original mortgage to Miss Payne, but it was not paid, and that is the reason she was trying to sell my life interest—it was eventually sold—in September, 1901, there was a mortgage for £160 to the Legal General Investment Company, Limited—Mr. Hall was acting as my solicitor in respect of all these transactions—proceedings have been taken against me in respect of some of the bills I signed with regard to Mason's Stores.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. The only complaint I made at Bow Street was that I was induced to execute a mortgage for £586 on my life interest on the understanding that Mr. Doig owed £686 to Mrs. Morley—that is the only charge I make now—I make no complaint with regard to any of the other mortgages I executed; they are all in order—I should not have taken any action at all only I was frightened into it—my mother died in December, 1901—I was in debt at the time—as soon as she died I set to work to raise money on my life interest—I was under the impression that I should be able to get the corpus, £3,000, and not merely the income—I took legal advice on the subject of Mr. Priest, and he said he would take Counsel's opinion—later he told me that, in Counsel's opinion, I should succeed in getting the £3,000 distributed to me—an application was made to the Court, but was refused, because there were some infants interested with regard to the mortgage of June, 1901, Mr. Morley told me that Mr. Doig owed the £686 in connection with the Tivoli Music Hall, Bristol; Mr. Doig had entered into a contract to purchase the music hall, and that Mrs. Morley had advanced him £500 to pay the deposit—it was in cones<lb/>quence of Mr. Doig's statement that he did not owe the money that I made if this charge—I do not know that Mr. Doig in December, 1897, had com<lb/>menced</p>

               <p>an action to recover that money which had been paid on his behalf—I was shown the counterfoils of two cheques, one for £100 and one for £400, with which the deposit had been paid—I was told that the balance between the £500 and the £686 was made up of costs and other expenses which Airs. Morley had paid—I do not remember the dates of the cheques—the cheques produced correspond with the counterfoils that were shown tome—they are drawn in the name of a business which Mrs. Morley was the proprietor of about that time—I have known Mr. Morley twelve years, but I have not known Mrs. Morley all that time—I have occasionally visited at their house in Brompton Square—I was told that Mrs. Morley had advanced the money to Mr. Doig out of her own separate property—if Mr. Doig had owed her £5001 should have nothing to complain of.</p>

I was not first of all introduced to Mr. Hall by Mr. Morley—I had been to Mr. Hall before with a view to his obtaining a loan for me on my life interest, but he did not do so, and I went to Mr. Collyer—he got me a loan of £50—Mr. Hall had nothing to do with that transaction—the next time I saw Mr. Hall was on January 25th, when I was taken to him by Mr. Morley—I had the conversation with Mr. Morley about the spirit warrants before going to Mr. Hall—I had not got the £250 to lend to Mr. Morley, and he suggested that I should give a charge on my life interest, and suggested going to Mr. Hall to put the document into proper legal form—Mr. Morley explained to Mr. Hall in my presence what he had agreed with me, and asked him to draw up the necessary document, and then it "was that Mr. Hall wrote out the promissory note for £400 and the charge on my life interest to secure it—I gave the charge in order that £250 might be borrowed upon it from somebody—Mr. Hall was to get the money; if he got £250 he was to pay to Mr. Morley what remained after paying the debts that had been pre<lb/>viously incurred, and this was done—he rendered me an account of how the money had been disposed of—I had nothing to complain of—the 63 3s. 1d. was paid to Mr. Morley on my instructions—the money was handed to Mr. Morley by Mr. Hall in the presence of Mr. Hayworth and myself—as only £61 3s. 1d. had been paid to Mr. Morley, I suggested to Mr. Hall that he should try and get some more money advanced, and he discovered Messrs, Bloomer—before they would agree to lend any money they wanted a written undertaking from me to pay them twenty guineas, their costs—I gave it, and they advanced £350—out of that Messrs. Collyer and Miss Payne were paid off; Messrs. Bloomer and Mr. Hall were paid their costs, and the balance of £69 4s. 5d. was paid to Mr. Morley—Mr. Hall rendered me an account of that transaction, Exhibit 33—that transaction was perfectly regular, and I understood it—the same day, March 6th, I wrote a letter to Mr. Hall asking him to get me some more money from Miss Payne—he did so—it was in respect of that £150 that I ultimately sold my life interest—that was a second charge; she came in after Mrs. lose—the other mortgage for £20 that she had was given to her to stop her selling my life interest—that was executed while the proceedings in Chancery were taking place—that transaction was carried out by Mr. Hall—it was a proper thing to do in my interest—Mr. Morley suggested</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 9, Ironmonger Lane, E.C.—I know Abraham Robinson; he has occasionally introduced business to me—I remember him bringing Mr. Morley to me on August 2nd, 1901—he said, "I have a gentleman here who wants to borrow some money," I think he said £300,. "upon some property, he has the deed with him; I had better leave him to give you the information about it or tell you what he wants"—Morley then produced a mortgage deed; he said his wife had advanced Mr. Joyce £586 upon his share in his mother's estate; that the parties had agreed to make an application to the Court to have the estate divided at once; that Counsel's opinion had been obtained that that could be done; that the trustee was willing, but wished to be protected by the Court; that his wife had expected the application to be made before the Long Vacation, but that it could not come on; that she was a lady of property; that she had two mortgages of £3,000 each, but that she could not get the money in at once as it was all locked up; that she had bought a provision business and paid a deposit, and had to complete the purchase in a few days, and that she wanted to borrow £300 on the security to enable her to complete; he said that if she did not complete it then she would lose her deposit and also the business, which was a valuable one; that Mr. Hall, of Warwick Court, knew all about the matter; that he had prepared the deed, and if I saw him he would explain the whole matter to me and give me any information I required—I told him I could probably get the money at the beginning of the following week, it was Bank Holiday week, and I would see Mr. Hall and make the necessary inquiries and let him know if I could do it—he then said that his wife was an invalid, and that he held her power of attorney and he could do the whole business—I said I should not allow any client of mine to advance money unless I had the deed executed by the party herself—he said she suffered from her heart or something of that kind, but if that was so he would get her to come down to my office—he then produced a bill for £25 and asked me to discount it—I refused, and told him that was not my business,' and that I was not in the "habit of discounting bills—he pressed me to do so and</p>

               <p>offered me a guinea for my trouble, and said that it could be taken as part of the £300, and left the mortgage with me as security—I then gave him a cheque for £23 19s.—that is all that passed at that interview—the same afternoon I went to see Mr. Hall—I produced to him the mortgage and told him that Mr. Morley had been to me to obtain an advance upon it, and that he had referred me to him for the necessary information—he gave me the information I required—I asked him if the £586 had been advanced all right, and he said yes—the next day I went to Somerset House to see the will—on August 6th, Mr. Morley and his wife called again—Mr. Robinson was present then—Mrs. Morley produced eight bonds of £25 each in Mason's Stores, Limited, and said, "I have to settle my purchase to-day; I have brought these debentures, they are good, they pay 6 per cent. I will leave them with you as well as the mortgage if you will let me have £200 pending the completion of the mortgage for £300"—she pressed me to do it, and I, having enquired into the matter, gave her an open cheque for £200, payable to Mrs. J. Morley—it is endorsed J. Morley—the next day, August 7th, I went to see the solicitor to the first mort<lb/>gage and got particulars of the different charges—on the 8th I went to see the solicitors to the trustee, and discovered that there was another charge of which I knew nothing—the same day Mr. Morley called upon me; I said, "I find from the trustee that Mrs. Denning has given notice of a charge"; he said, "She has a security, and my wife will no doubt leave her security with you as an additional security"—I was satisfied with that—the next day he called again with Mrs. Morley, and the mortgage was executed in my presence, and I gave Mrs. Morley a cheque for £54, being the balance of the £300 less twenty guineas my costs—I gave notice of the mortgage to Mr. Joyce and to the solicitors for the prior mortgagees, and the trustee—about the end of September or the beginning of October, 1901,1 searched the file at Somerset House in reference to Mason's Stores and on December 20th I issued a writ against Mrs. Morley for the principal and interest—I could not serve the writ, and applied for substituted service, but could not get the order, consequently that action never came to any<lb/>thing—on February 6th, 1902, I wrote to Mr. Hall, Exhibit 15, and got a reply on the 7th—on the same day, the 6th, I wrote to Mr. Morley and got a reply on the 9th—on February 20th I again wrote to Mr. Hall, and to that I got a reply on the 21st—I never succeeded in getting any of the money back.</p>

I live at 5, Grove Road, Tottenham—on October 1st, between 3 and 3.30, I was at home at work, and saw a cart driven by I believe Brandon—Dewey was by his side, hitting the horse with a whip or a stick—they were going as fast as the horse could gallop—I first saw them between the church and the recreation ground—I saw them before they came to cross Norman Street—it appeared to me that they were racing another cart which was going along Ironmonger Row, because they were halloaing out—they seemed to try to turn into Norman Street, but could not do so, because the horse was going at such a pace—they had to pass another van almost opposite No 45, on the near side—they passed the cart, and went to the end of the turning and turned to the right—the road bends there, and they came to the back of the houses, and then back to Norman Street—I saw the child just after the wheel passed over it—that was long before they got to Norman Street—I saw the wheel leave the child's body—I went over, and ran after the cart a quarter of a mile—Dewey was in it, but Brandon had left the cart.</p>

I was in doors about twenty minutes, and then went out."—I asked him where he went to?—he said, "I went to Mr. Worral's, the Alexandra Arms, and had a half of ale"—I said, "What time would that be?"—he said, "About ten minutes past twelve; some workmen were there having their dinner"—I then told him I should take him in custody on suspicion of firing the two ricks—he said, "That is a bit more of it"—I took him to the station—the Flag Staff is on the freehold, about five minutes' walk from the prisoner's house—the villas where Mr. Page lives are in the City Road, and Mr. Worrall's is about three minutes' walk from him in Pembroke Road—if he was going from home or from the Alexandra Arms his nearest way would be to pass the Bald Faced Stag.</p>

"I saw the landlord's son; if you go and see Mr. Press, his married daughter came into the bar when I left"—I do not know her, or whether she is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 105, Collingwood Street—I was present at the birth of Mrs. Brown's baby, which died on September 5th—it was a nice healthy child, a nine-months child—I was there three weeks—I was there one fortnight, and I went there for another fortnight to do the washing—I did not see it again till after it was taken to the Bethnal Green police station in November—I was taken there by the police, and the father wanted me to take it and bring it up because she was about the streets, and it had very little clothing, only a bed-gown—it was very dirty, and it was so at the station—I did not call every day after the first fortnight, but I saw it in the street twice or three times—I remonstrated with the mother for not keeping it clean, and she called me a dirty owl and a dirty woman and said that I took her big child home—this was in October and in November I saw it at the station—I was sent for in February—Mrs. Brown came and asked me to come round, as the baby was dying—I went there and saw it, it was very dirty—I told her what a state it was in, and she said that she could not wash it, it was so thin—I told her I would come and wash it myself, and I did so for a fortnight—it was not too thin to be washed—I washed it morning and night for a fortnight, and also gave it medicine and milk and made her have a-doctor to the-child Dr. Brown of</p>

               <p>Brady Street, who prescribed medicine for it, and I gave it some of it, I cannot say what became of the rest; I gave it because I said to her, "You are not giving the baby the medicine"; she said, "Yes, I am"—while I was there the child looked better and cleaner, but it did not get fatter—I attended her in May in a miscarriage, the child was then very dirty and much thinner—during those days I fed it from the bottle, and it kept the food down—I did not attend there at all till the day of the child's death on October 15th—it was dead when I went, and I washed the corpse—one part of the buttocks was very black and one part was all wounds—I believe the eldest child, Alice, is eight and another is three—I have known the man thirty years, he is a respectable, hardworking man—neither of them drank.</p>

It never occurred to me that the father or mother were wilfully starving the child or I should have informed the authorities—I believe the father did everything he could for it—I am not a regular nurse, I go when they cannot afford to have anybody else—young babies are sometimes thin and sometimes they die—they sometimes suffer in this way, probably because they cannot digest their food—the father slept upstairs in the same room when he was at home—there were three children there, not four—the baby slept in the kitchen—the mother was very dirty at times, but not the other children—they could wash themselves, but the little child, not the baby, was always dirty—Dr. Brown is not here—they made no difficulty about sending for Dr. Graham—he said that the baby was very ill—it was ill in February, and it remained ill till October, when it died.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the National Society for the Pre<lb/>vention of Cruelty to Children—on October 19th at 9 p.m. I went to the prisoners' house with the coroner's officer and saw the dead body of a child on the table—it had been washed and the room partially cleaned—the parents pointed out the cradle—I examined it, the only covering was a flannelette overall and a small petticoat, which were wet with urine and covered with filth, and there was a small frock and a pinafore all wet with urine—the small sheet was partially wet—the bed was a rough sack filled with straw, which was partially wet and smelt like urine—there were no bed clothes except the flannelette—the man said, "I am the husband of Alice Elizabeth Brown, and have for thirteen months lived with her; I rent a three-roomed cottage at 6s. a week. I work for a baker of 9, Cam<lb/>bridge Road; I have been four years there. My wages are 26s. a week, a loaf of bread a day, and half a quartern of flour. I allow my wife 24s. a week.' We have three children living, Alice aged eleven, Edwin eight, and Alfred three. The child now dead is Florence Rosetta, thirteen months old; three others have died. There have been no inquests before. I cannot remember dates, but I know my wife has been put away four times because of her head. When her first child was born her father got her into Dartford and afterwards in Hoxton House. She was on another occasion in the Infirmary in Bancroft Road, and transferred from there</p>

               <p>to Colney Hatch. About November, 1901, she was for a month in Bethnal Green Infirmary, having been found in the street by the police; the baby was with her, it was then about two months old. I let the baby go to the infirmary with her. About a month or so after she came out, on two days before December: about a month or two after I went to the relieving officer, and he told me I had better get Dr. Graham, of Brady Street, to see the child."—the wife then said: "He came there and saw It three times."—the man agreed, and said: "It was also taken to the London Hospital."—the wife said: "It was just after the June Corona<lb/>tion holidays"—the man agreed, and went on, "I did not see anything specially wrong. The child cried sometimes. I am out from midnight to 2 p.m. The child was insured in the Prudential. After it came out of the infirmary, about the end of February. I told the gentleman I was poor, and asked him to make the amount 2d. instead of 1d., as it would come in handy if the child died. The other children I insured for 1d. The child ate ravenously; my wife told me the other three died from consumptive bowels, and I thought she said that Dr. Graham said this child had the same. I know it had three tins of Nestle's milk a week—sometimes large tins"—the man continued: "I do not know if my wife left the child down stairs all night, I thought she took it up stairs. I know it died in a cradle, I generally saw it there. My wife always seemed upset. I have done my best."—on October 23rd he told me: "I am not to blame for this. When I cleaned the cradle out about three weeks ago I advised my wife to take the child to the doctor; I said she would get us into trouble. There were maggots and dirt in the cradle."—on October 15th the female prisoner said: "Dr. Graham told me he thought the child had consump<lb/>tive bowels. The child usually sleeps alone downstairs because my hus<lb/>hand objects to its wetting the bed upstairs. I got 24s. a week from my husband, one loaf a day, and half a quartern of flour. I pay 6s. a week. At midnight before it died I gave the child some Nestle's milk and left it in the cradle; at 11.30 I went upstairs to bed.; when I came down at 7 a.m. this morning I found the baby was dead. I sent for Mrs. Woods to call in Dr. Bate. The child never had diarrhoea."</p>

I am a physician and surgeon of 6, Victoria Park Square—on October 15th at 10.30 a.m. I was called to see the dead body of this child—the room was very filthy, it nearly made me sick, and I had to go out of doors—the child had been dead over three hours; it was lying on a canvas sack stuffed with straw in a very filthy condition—the child was very dirty—I should say that it had not been washed for a week—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination the next day, externally there were no marks of violence, but the buttocks and the private parts were red, swollen, and raw, excoriated by want of cleanliness—that is not a common thing to that degree, it is an extreme case—the child weighed 7 lbs. 2 1/2 ozs.—in the right lung there was a patch of pneumonia, all the organs were very pale and in an anamic condition—that might be induced—the whole intestine</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior examiner of the Official Receiver in Bankruptcy, under whose directions I have investigated the affairs of all the defendants in bankruptcy—I was assisted by Mr. Moore, a clerk to Mr. Child, a chartered accountant, Mr. Moore being the trustee of the estates of Rogers Brothers and of S. and E. Ransome and Co.—this state<lb/>ment of affairs of Rogers Brothers is signed by both the defendants Rogers, and sworn to as correct—I know their writing—the date of their bankruptcy and adjudication is November 21st, 1901—the gross liabilities are £186,630 18s., their net liabilities £73,94015s. 9d., net assets £9,293 4s, 10d., showing a deficiency of £64,647 10s. lid.—those are their figures after taking as credit their balance sheet of December 31st, 1899. in accounting for their deficiency—the summary of Edward Rogers' separate estate shows gross liabilities £21,518 11s. 1d., net liabilities £19,329 7s. 2d., assets £1,600, deficiency £17,632 18s.—in Norman Rogers' separate estate it is gross liabilities £17,040 14s. 9d., net £14.456 15s. 11d., net assets £627 12s. 10d., and deficiency £13,829 3s. 1d.—those are sworn to be correct—this balance sheet of Mr. Price shows a credit balance of Rogers Brothers of £42 in June, 1891—I examined that with a list of creditors and debtors, and from the explanation the Rogers gave me I came to the conclusion that the firm was insolvent in June, 1890—they admitted some, and the debtors' accounts were their own under other names, and represented losses on speculations in goods—I took the preliminary ex<lb/>amination of the debtors, which is Exhibit 381—among the debtors to the firm I find A. Hows for £667 16s. 10d.; H. Jackson £936; T. Thorne, £510 9s. 7d.—the debtors said they held stock against some of the debtors to them, and that the balance partly represented stock in hand; as to others they were losses which they shared equally or in varying proportions—I have been through the firm's books and prepared a balance sheet (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 383) to December 31st, 199, which was checked by Mr. Moore and another clerk, and which shows a deficiency of £30,844 14s. 10d. as against a surplus balance in Exhibit 3 of £31,574 12s. 1d., or a difference of £63,000—I showed that balance sheet to the defendants Rogers after I had prepared it in January or February—they said they had no doubt the books showed those figures, but that the books were wrong—they challenged the absence of stock—they pointed out that in Exhibit 3 there was a considerable item for stock, but none in Exhibit 383—that stock the property of Rogers Brothers was represented by Jackson's debt, and that they estimated that at £3,000—subsequently I found a list of stock, and that was substituted to the value of £5.000—I had given them full credit for stock—I found very little trade between Rogers Brothers and Wallis, Sons and Co. of late years—the accommodation bills in 1900-1 averaged £18,000 to 20,000 a year—at the date of the Receiving Order the balance on loan was £10,600—I do not know of any trade bills—there was no trade between Rogers Brothers and Ransome and Co in</p>

               <p>1900-1, but there were £50.000 to £60,000 a year of bills, and there was current at the date of the Receiving Order £13,000—the trade between Rogers Brothers and Thomas and Short in 1900-1 was about £11,000—the exchange cheque account showed about £161,000 including accommo<lb/>dation bills in the two years—the trade between Rogers Brothers and Newton between 1897 and 1901 was about £16,000 to a considerable extent done by trade bills, but there was in addition about £15,000 in accommodation bills from October, 1897, to March, 1901—between April, 1899, and September, 1901, there was about £50,000 in exchange cheques—both the Rogers initialed their answers on each page and signed Exhibit 381 at the end as being correct—(<hi rend="italic">Passages from this Exhibit were then read.</hi>)—I also produce a statement of the affairs of Wallis, Sons and Co.—the Receiving Order is dated October 11th, 1901—all the bankruptcies were within four or five months of each other except that of Ransome Wallis—Algernon Wallis' own statement, he then being a member of Wallis, Sons and Co., shows gross liabilities £153,885 9s. 84, net £14,977 8s. 2d., and deficiency £62,726 4s. 4d.—the Receiving Order of Ransome Wallis was on March 4th, and the adjudication March 11th, 1902—his statement shows gross liabilities £34,578 3s. 10d., net £23,925 3s. 104, net assets £307 18s. 44, and-deficiency £23,617 5s. 6d—there was very little trade between Wallis, Sons and Co. and Ransome and Co., and in 1900-1 practically none; but there were accommodation bills to about £30,000—at the date of the Receiving Order on October 11th the accommodation bills outstanding amounted to £2,792—between Wallis, Sons and Co. and Newton during 1900—1 there were a few trans<lb/>actions in bristles in March, 1901—there were accommodation bills—there was no trade between Wallis, Sons and Short during those two years—there were accommodation bills—preliminary examination of Algernon. Wallis is Exhibit 444 in Vol. III. of the Exhibits—that was taken by me and signed by him as correct—(<hi rend="italic">The relevant passages were then read.</hi>)—referring to the statement of S. and E.

Ransome, which are returned at £158—the statement of Arthur, Ransome shows net liabilities £1,000, and assets £132 10s.—the trade between Newton and Short in 1901—I was about £2,000—Short's pre<lb/>liminary examination was taken at Manchester—I produce it—it was signed by him and each page is initialled—on the first page he describes himself as a bristle, horse hair and carpet merchant—(<hi rend="italic">The relevant passages were then read from Vol. III., p.</hi> 614, <hi rend="italic">of the Exhibits.</hi>)—one "bill described as a trade bill is that of Atkins, dated June 17th, 1901, for £669 9s. 84, drawn by Thomas and Short upon Rogers Brothers—the others are described as accommodation bills in the statement of affairs—they were all dishonoured and are in the schedule—from the books I find that the exchange cheques current in September, 1901, between Rogers and Wallis amount to £95,025 8s. 84, and between Rogers and Newton to about £50,000—the total exchange cheques between the defendants, including bills, amount to £161,866 2s. 1d.—</p>

Exhibit 38.3, in January because I could not understand the other one—I was concerned with Rogers Bros.' condition in 1889, because the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 directs investigation of the bankrupt's affairs—it was not done with the express intention of a prosecution—the recommendation of these proceedings did not lie with me alone—the debtors make out that they are entitled to a credit of £31,000 in December, 1899—my balance-sheet of December, 1899, shows a debt of £60,000—the balance of the alleged loss from over-valuation was £55,000—the amount of loss according to the statement of affairs was £85,000—I under<lb/>stand that £45,000 is the amount alleged to have been obtained by over<lb/>valuations from the London and Westminster Bank, and that the goods realised £14,000—cheques were obtained in favour of Rogers Bros, from the London and County Bank of £4,244, from Lloyd's £7,474, from the London and Westminster £1,633 and £2,393 in further bills—the £4,786 is Wallis—£6,200 was Glyn Mills, and £669 Atkins—the Palatine Bank £1,900, and the Mercantile Bank £1,300—the total is £73,000 since Decem<lb/>ber, 1899—£64,000 was deposited by Rogers Brothers to December, 1901—between the balance-sheet of December, 1899, and September, 1901, there must have been £34,000 deposited to make up the £64,000—the £12,000 from the Norwich Union and the £2,000 from the Yorkshire Insurance Company appear in all the accounts whether separate or joint—if one of them paid them off those debts would disappear, subject to the right of contribution, but to multiply the accounts, by the eight defendants is an exaggerated view—there were a good many cheque transactions between Rogers and Newton; all of them were met, also the bills with Thomas, and Short—those cheques and bills amount to about £60,000—Rogers accounts with the City and Midland Bank have been closed—I understood so from Edward Rogers—Rogers Brothers adopted the names of Howes, John Dent, and F.

Brothers and Newton amounted to £50,000—some had been met at the date of the Receiving Order—he called a meeting of his creditors and signed his petition on November 23rd—the cheques for £2,610 between them were an exchange transaction—all the transactions referred to here were posted in the books.</p>

               <p>show that, which were not produced—that was the object of the investi<lb/>gation in bankruptcy, and not with a view to a prosecution—the firm's liabilities and those of their separate estates were not repeated—the total credit, starting with the balance on February 20th, and including all sums paid in between that date and February 27th, was £15,218—that included £10,000 from the Norwich Union, but not the £500—the bills outstanding could not have been met but for the £10,000—those were allocated and paid out of the London and Westminster firm's account—I traced the allocation in Wallis and Sons, and Rogers Brothers' books—in Wallis and Sons' books it appears by red ink figures—they are arbitrary figures—about the same time there was a fresh batch of bills—from 1894 to 1896 Wallis and Sons lost £14,000—their turnover was large—if there was a profit the larger the turnover the larger the profit, if a loss the larger the loss—I ascertained from Algernon that the warrants for the bristles were produced the same day as the letter from the London and Westminster Bank was written, to satisfy the Bank that Newton's bills were secured—I asked the defendants about the transaction with Hodson, and they all know of Hodson's letter of April 30th, 1901, which discusses what is to be done with regard to his liabilities—many bills of Ransomes' with the London and Westminster Bank, run off before September, 1901—that Bank declined to discount any more of them after March, 1900—Ransomes received the proceeds of the bills afterwards, to the extent of about £1,000; the actual figures are in the statement—Ransomes' capital decreased during the last three years—during that period they received £500 to £600 commission on bills—their gross income from all sources was £2,200 and net £800, apart from commissions—these trade reports refer to "Rogers Brothers and—others"—I did not know of three Rogers carrying on business together, only the two—both Edward and Norman told me they were the only partners—with regard to Wallis, Sons and Co., the trade reports extend from 1894 to 1901—the Wallises are cousins of the Ransomes—the cover by warrants of Ransomes from Rogers Brothers ceased within twelve months of the bankruptcy; they could not get any warrants for twelve months, and as they say in their examination, they ceased to apply for them—(<hi rend="italic">The correspondence between Newton, and Rogers Brothers in Exhibits</hi> 406 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 418 <hi rend="italic">was then read.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> I am a chartered accountant and clerk to Mr. Child, the trustee in bankruptcy of the defendants Rogers Brothers, and with regard to their separate estates; also of the firm of S. and E. Ransome and their separate estates—I have examined the books with the witness Mr. Broughton Knight—I was present at the preliminary examination of the bankrupts—I assisted Mr. Knight in preparing the balance sheet, Exhibit 383, which shows the state of Rogers Brothers' affairs to December 31st, 1899—it is correct according to their books—the defendants Rogers. Brothers have had copies supplied to them and have criticised the figures—they accepted the amounts as correct, but said the books were incorrect—the separate estates have been realised, but the joint estate has not—the joint estate up to the present time realised £1,115, and there are a few warrants which may realise another £2,000—</p>

               <p>the separate estate of E. Rogers realised £1,769, and that of N. Rogers £682—the whole assets total £5,560—the liabilities proved are £79,936, and there is a further £35,000 outstanding, making an approximate total of £115,000 for the joint estate—the separate estates include debts to the Norwich Union and the Yorkshire Insurance Co. of £14,000—the total against E. Rogers is £23,800, and against N. Rogers £15,600—the total liabilities are £139,000 as against £5,560 assets—Ransome and Co.'s assets are £1,868 and a possible £500 to come; S. Ransome's assets £197, and Ransome's assets £174, the three estates totalling £2,739 of assets—the liabilities of Ransome's firm are £25,339, and a further £3,000 outstanding, which makes an approximate total of £28,500 against the joint estate—on the separate estates the £14,000 comes in twice—eliminating that I make the proofs £14,000 against the separate estate of S. Ransome, and against Ransome £15,119—that makes the joint and separate liabilities of the Ransomes £43,000 odd against total assets of £2,739—I heard a portion of Mr. Knight's evidence coming in and out of Court, and agree with it.</p>

Rogers' statement shows that he is debited with £12,147 to the Norwich Union and £2,000 to the Yorkshire Insurance Co.—the figures are duplicated in the statement of affairs—the Pallatine Bank £1,000 is not scheduled—in the statement of affairs the money receipts are not accurate—his account is charged with £5,000 to the Commercial Union—that is £19,000 excluding the Pallatine—his own statement is £31,000, net, £19,300—the claim against Kevorkian is scheduled as £6,800—that may rank as assets if the claim is good.</p>

               <p>same day—in the exchange cheque account of Thomas and Short it is entered as an accommodation transaction—the entry in Rogers Bros.' books shows by deduction that it is accommodation—other entries treat it as the proceeds of the sale of goods—it is entered after October 3rd, but bears date July 8th—first at page 631 is a credit, Thomas and Short's account, £669 9s. 8d., June 22nd, by acceptance Atkins £669 9s. 8d., and then June 17th, folio 624, same account, by cheque £669 9s. 8d. crediting Thomas and Short—in Thomas and Short's books it is carried to goods account—there are four or five of those transactions—the first entry is McCall, exchange cheque account, which is the account through which accommodation bills exchange cheques were passed, he credits the account with the net proceeds of the bill, and debits it with payments to both of the Rogers—it is set out in the exchange account at folio 388, in the green or sold ledger—the dates run June 22nd, then June 21st, it is balanced on June 30th, then the account goes to July 20th, and on July 31st the account is credited "Discount in error £645 6s. 6d."—that is inter<lb/>lineated in small figures as there is no room for it—it has not been written in since the total £9,802 1s. 5d., which is cast correctly—the next is a journal entry at page 73, carried through to the exchange goods account, and there is the double transfer of the net proceeds, and the discount charges, making up the gross amount of the bill, and debiting Rogers Brothers in the goods account under an entry of July 31st of 11s. in the name of Myer from the sold ledger after August 30th, therefore the transfer to Rogers Brothers' account must also have been made after that date—there invariably is a space at the end of the month in the journal—it also shows that the next entry on the same date was made after October 8th, 1901, although it appears at the date of July 31st; I find that by reference to the sold ledger of October 8th—therefore, assuming all the entries of July 31st were made at the same time they were made after October 8th, when this book transfer to Rogers was made, and certainly after August 30th—the practical stoppage of payment was on September 26th—I can refer to other entries if necessary—I traced the principal items to Thomas and Short's stock book on June 30th—I found a press copy of Exhibit 18 gummed in the press copy account sales book of Rogers Brothers—it is not indexed, but the sheets before and after it are indexed—it is indistinct and blurred, and written in to make it clear by indelible pencil, in Howard Short's writing—the tissue paper has been folded up in folds to put into an envelope—[<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum as to a four months' acceptance, dated</hi>" 20/10/01" <hi rend="italic">for</hi> £076 7s. 2d.]—I cannot explain the items £615s. 2d. £1 17s. 6d. brokerage, and 2s. 4d., and lot money at 9d. a lot—it is in the invoice book as an invoice of goods—the number on the sheet has been torn off one sheet—the invoice purports to be a sale to H.

Short delivered up his books and papers, and answered the questions in his examination—he read from this pocket book, and I asked him to hand it to me—it refers to bristles—I am satisfied that the eighteen cases of Calcutta bristles existed at the time they were pledged to the London and Westminster Bank—there were various pledgings of those bristles—I put 8,000 or 9,000 questions to the defendants, and cannot remember particular ones—what was present to my mind was that these goods which had never been delivered, had been sold by the mortgagee—it is for the purchaser to take delivery, but goods are sold over and over again by brokers without being delivered—Short was dealing with Rogers Brothers—the purchaser would be liable for the wharf charges while he owned the goods or the warrants—the wharfinger looks for his charges to the person who deposits the goods, because he knows nobody else—Short did not clear the goods—they remained with Frith, Sands and Co. till they sold them after the bankruptcy—the contract between Frith, Sands and Short was valid on June 17th—there was a loss on the goods—they were sold to the mortgagee—I have produced the note showing the amounts were handed to Rogers Brothers—the account rendered to Rogers Brothers was headed "Exchange account," and the transaction was carried through the Exchange cheque account—that is accommodation—there would be adjustments between the firms—the exchange cheques run all through the accounts—the books give no details, but merely say "To cheque," then "cheque," and then there is a long string of items—the £2,000 is entered on the credit side at the date of January 21st, 1901, "By account A. L. and Co."—that shows that on January 21st Short received from Arbuthnot, Latham and Co. £2,000 on loan—on the face of them, none of the entries appear to be of exchange cheques—you never find items corresponding in amount—without a knowledge of the accounts you could not say this was an accommodation</p>

I have known Newton quite twenty<lb/>five years—he had banked with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Bank—his dealings were satisfactory, all of them were what I considered business transactions—I knew him as a bristle and horsehair merchant in Man<lb/>chester—I casually said to him when he came in 1899 about the account that the bills,"I suppose they are something like the bills we used formerly to discount?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Palatine Bank of Man<lb/>chester—on June 21st, 1900, Newton called to open an account or facilities for discounting—he gave me the list of customers on Exhibit 22, which includes the names and extent of discounts of Rogers Brothers, £1,500; Ransome, £750; Thomas and Short, £750; Camm and Co., £500—I did not then know that Camm and Co. was connected with Newton—I drew Newton's attention to the fact that some of the names were not in the same trade as himself—I mentioned Ransome, and Wallis, Sons and Co. particularly afterwards, as we discounted bills on Wallis—he said that these bills came from Rogers Brothers, who guaranteed them, that they were continually doing business with him, and that the bills were to satisfy their indebted<lb/>ness to him—Rogers Brothers were produce brokers—two or three weeks later he said that Rogers Brothers would guarantee a proportion of bills up to £1,000—I asked him what inducement they had to do so—he said, "Oh, they always have goods to greater value of mine than the amount of the guarantee, and I make up my mind to assist them in order that I may do more with them—I discounted Rogers' Brothers bills, and afterwards those of Wallis, Sons and Co.—between, August, 1900, and July, 1901. I discounted acceptances of Wallis, Sons and Co. amounting in round figures to £2,300, of S. and E. Ransome £2,000, of Thomas and Short between August, 1900, and May, 1901, £1,500, and of Camm and Co., between June, 1900, and September, 1901, £1,900—in June, 1901, I noticed that the number of bills was high and increasing and spoke to him about it—he said his position was good, his capital was £7,000, of which £3,000 or</p>

               <p>£4,000 was in J.

(I make it £2,200 in round figures), of which S. and E. Ransome. Wallis, Sons, and Co., the Welch Grape Juice Company, and John Camm and Co. are the acceptors—they were drawn for odd amounts, such as £394 0s. 4d. and £297 13s. 5d.—I inferred from that they were the amounts on the invoices of goods supplied and were trade bills—if I had known that they were accommodation bills I would not have discounted them—I discounted one bill after my interview with him—that was on July 15th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Mincing Lane Branch of the London and Westminster Bank—I know Edward and Norman Rogers, who carried on business as Rogers Brothers, 21, Mincing Lane, as Colonial brokers—they have been customers of ours since March 28th, 1898, when they opened an account with the bank, in the course of which acceptances would be discounted and advances made on the production of warrants—the limit of the discounts was fixed at £10,000—they mentioned their own bankers, the City Bank, but they wanted further facilities as they had reached the limit of the City Bank, which was £40.000, and I was referred by them to the City Bank—the result of our inquiries was perfectly satis<lb/>factory—I agreed to open an account and took their signatures—I also went to their office in Mincing Lane and saw both partners there—I asked hem to give me a balance sheet—they demurred to my request, but ulti<lb/>mately put it into the hands of an accountant named Thompson, who drew out a rough balance sheet showing their capital at about £30,000—it was made out in my presence from books and accounts—after he had drawn it out it was seen by the partners, who saw she result of what he had done—we were altogether—the balance sheet satisfied me that they had money in their business, coupled with their exceptionally good refer<lb/>ences, and I agreed to give them discount facilities to a limit of £10.000—the account remained open until their failure on November 21st, 1901—in that period we discounted acceptances of S. and E. Ransome, Thomas and Short, Richard Newton, and John Camm and Co., A. and E. Richardson, Kevorkian, Taylor and Co., the Welch Grape Juice Company, A. J. Hadler and Co., W. Hodson, and others—Exhibit 33 is a summary of the bills discounted by my bank on Rogers Brothers account up to November,</p>

Ransome from April, 1898, to Novem<lb/>ber, 1900," for £31,651; Newton, from April 28th to March, 1901, £10,645 18s. 1d., and Camm and Co., £320 7s. 6d.; Thomas and Short from April, 1898, to March, 1900, £3,057, and A. and E. Richardson, from May to September, 1901, £2,098; a total of £49,441—almost all of them were for odd amounts, from which I took them to be ordinary trade bills—I believed they were trade bills—if I had known that they were accom<lb/>modation bills I would not have taken them—from time to time I com<lb/>municated with the head office, where S. and E. Ransome had an account—I learned from the head office that Ransomes were drawing bills with a Mr. Hodson, and that Mr. Hodson was drawing on them, in consequence of which in November, 1900,1 went to Rogers Brothers' office—I saw one of them and referred to the bills drawn by them upon Ransomes—he told me they were trade bills on both sides, that they sold goods for Ransomes as brokers, and to Ransomes as merchants, and there was business done on both sides—I suggested that bills might be drawn for the balance—h said that would be inconvenient, and that the whole business was quite convenient—as from November, 1900, I discounted no more bills drawn by Rogers on Ransomes—I refused to do so on instructions from my head office—I had several conversations with Rogers Brothers' about Newton's acceptances—in consequence of a conversation with them I ceased to do Newton's bills in March, 1901—I asked Rogers Brothers what the bills were for—they told me Newton was doing a large business with them—the amount of bills was increasing beyond the reference which I had got from the bankers, and I inquired more about Newton from Rogers Brothers; I did not want to go so far as they wanted to—after the conversation I discounted some of Newton's bills, but not all—Rogers Brothers complained to me about my restricting their business and said the business was all good business, but I said I could not go beyond the banker's reference—I had Rogers Brothers assurance that Thomas and Short's bills were really trade bills—later on I heard unfavourable reports and communicated with Rogers Brothers—I told them what I had heard—they said the reports were not true—I thought they were sufficiently authentic for me not to do business—I did not discount any more bills—in March, 1901, I heard adverse rumours with regard to Newton—I asked one of Rogers Brothers how Newton was going on, as we had several bills running—he told me he was doing very well, and he had a very good busi<lb/>ness, that the rumours were incorrect, and that they were themselves protected by some deeds which they had in their possession covering the bills; that they had collected security on the bills which were drawn for goods—I said, if they would lodge the collateral security with me, I would take bills to a larger amount, considering they were trade bills—they said they had agreed not to part with the deeds—they did not give them to me—the total amount I discounted was £10,645—towards the middle of 1900 I received instructions from my directors, in consequence of which I called upon Rogers Brothers—I saw Mr. Edward, and subsequently both—I asked them for a balance sheet, as we had made such large advances we should like to know how much of their own capital they had in the busi<lb/>ness</p>

               <p>ness—they said it was a very good business, and they prepared a balance sheet—Mr. Edward gave me Exhibit 3, which is a balance-sheet, which shows a surplus of assets £31,574 12s. 1d. on December 31st, 1899—for the preceding half year beginning in June—I was satisfied, and continued to discount acceptances for them, and to grant loans—in the course of the account, I had the acceptances of A. and E. Richardson for discounting—they were first brought by Mr. Terry, a clerk of Rogers Brothers—he gene rally came with the bills, unless they came themselves—Thompson was away ill—seeing that Richardsons were new people, I asked, "What are these people? Are the bills all right?"—he said they were good bills, I could refer to bankers, and that Richardsons were in a good way of business—the name of the bank was on the back of the bills—I made enquiries—then I discounted several acceptances of A. and E. Richardson—they were all for odd amounts—I looked up directories, and found that Richardsons were stick people—I believed the bills were trade acceptances by Richard<lb/>sons, drawn by Rogers Brothers—four were left on our hands at the date of the failure—the total amount of the four bills left is £1,633 0s. 9d.—the total is £2,398, as shown in Exhibit 33—the bill for £457 2s. 2d. has written upon it "against canes," which is a clear indication that it is a trade bill—amongst other customers at our bank were Wallis and Sons, consisting of Ransome and Algernon Wallis, at the Mincing Lane Branch—that account was opened in June, 1899—they were described as whole-sale provision merchants of 5, Tooley Street—both the Wallises came—they said they had banked at Martin's Bank, to whom they referred us—they said they had reached their limit at that bank, and that they wanted further discount facilities—I agreed to open the account, subject to the reference being satisfactory—I received a satisfactory report, and cones<lb/>quently opened the account—in June, 1901, I received an intimation that the partnership was dissolved, and that Ransome Wallis had retired from the business—the account remained open till October 4th, 1901, the firm remaining the same—during the currency of that account, I discounted acceptances of Rogers Brothers, William Hodson, Thomas and Short, S. and E. Ransome, Taylor and Weaver—the amounts and particulars are in Exhibit 34—the total is £54,240—those of Rogers Brothers were £44,385, Hodson £4315, Thomas and Short £1,819, Taylor and Weaver £1,347, S. and E. Ransome £2,372—the total of the bills discounted amounted to £227,991, from June, 1899, to October, 1901—the majority were for odd amounts—I believed they were trade acceptances—I inquired particu<lb/>larly of Wallises as to Rogers Brothers, because I did not see the connection between the two firms—Ransome Wallis told me they were all cheese warrants, lodged with Rogers Brothers for sale, and he offered, if I did not like the bills, to have securities which were with Rogers Brothers placed in our hands against the loan—when L heard that Newton was drawing on Wallis, Sons and Co., I saw Algernon Wallis, who told me he would refer to his books and Jet me know—I received this letter of August 30th, 1900. signed Wallis, Sons and Co., that the bills drawn by R. Newton amounting to £1,251 7s. were "against goods which we hold as security"—the Exhibit shows ten bills discounted from June 25th to August 27th, accepted by</p>

               <p>Rogers Brothers in nine cases, and by Taylor and Weaver in the tenth for £250 14s. 2d.—they were all dishonoured—the figure £3,296 14s. 10d. represents the loss on those bills which our bank suffered—at the time we made the advances, I believed they were trade acceptances.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR. JOSEPH LEESE</hi>. Rogers Brothers referred me to the City Bank—the result of my inquiry was satisfactory—they wanted a larger loan limit—I did not look upon Rogers Brothers' demurring to produce a balance-sheet as a serious matter, but rather as if they suggested that "Why should you suspect us?"—probably you are right that Rogers Brothers.' turnover was £128,000—at the time of the failure there was a net balance of £2,100 to their credit on current account—the account was profitable—the interest was over £6,000—I put the figure at a third—Edward Rogers showed me some deeds with regard to Newton, which I did not go into—I said if he lodged them with me, I might do something more in the way of bills—he told me he could not part with them, as he held them as cover for Newton's liability to him—Newton's, Thomas and Short's and Camm's bills had been met at maturity—in June, 1900 he brought me the balance-sheet to December 31st, 1899—I do not know Abberfield's writing, but I take it he was a clerk of Rogers Brothers—I discounted bills of Kevorkian—there was one at the time of the failure, which has been paid since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Tower Bridge branch of the London and County Bank—on April 1st Algernon Wallis came to open an account in the name of Wallis, Sons and Co.—he asked me and I agreed to give him discount accommodation to the extent of £5,000—he said he had been banking at Martin's Bank, and referred me to them—he told me they had been having bills discounted by Morton Dyer, a bill broker, who had introduced him to the London and Westminster Bank—I asked him upon what firms he was going to draw upon—he gave me the list No. 5, on which are the names of Rogers Brothers and Thomas and Short—the limits, of these firms are £2,000 and £1,500—the names include people in the provision trade, some in the immediate neighbourhood—I made inquiry at Martin's Bank, and on April 2nd opened the account—a day or two later Ransome Wallis called and signed the book, and I had a long conversation with him with reference to the account—he said they were general produce importers and merchants—in the course of the account we discounted bills to the amount of £27,000—some were accepted by Rogers Brothers—I noticed those bills were increasing, and I told Algernon that the amount was getting larger than the figures he had given me, £2,000, and I wanted an explanation—he said they were doing a larger business with Rogers Brothers, that they were trade bills, I need have no fear of the account, and that Rogers Brothers were making a very large profit in their business, £30,000 a year—I believed his statements—amongst the bills some were accepted by Ransomes—those exceeded the amount he gave me in the list of £1,000—"he told me they were ordinary trade bills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190211170108"/>
               <p>—during the currency of the account I discounted acceptances amounting to, Rogers £6,470, S. and E. Ransome £4,300, and Thomas and Short £4,034—the bills in this schedule are not met-the total is £5,700 in round figures—a number of cheques were paid into the account drawn by Rogers Brothers—some by Thomas and Short, and some by the Ransomes—Wallis's cheques were drawn to numbers—in September, 1901, I noticed that Messrs. Wallis were paving in day by day cheques drawn by Rogers Brothers in small amounts at first, reaching about £2,000, then it increased to £6,000, £7,000, and then £8,000—Wallis, Sons and Co. drew cheques against them almost as soon as they were paid in, still to numbers—the cheques drawn by Rogers Brothers were bearer cheques—in the names of different firms of wharfingers and so on—up to September 24th, 1901, the credit balance of Wallis, Sons and Co.'s account was £4,019 13s. 3d.—on that day cheques drawn by Rogers Brothers were paid in amounting to £3,314 14s. 2d.—in all cheques were paid in amounting to £6,928 18s. 5d., including a number of Rogers Brothers' cheques—the same day cheques were presented for payment drawn by Wallis, Sons and Co. to the total amount of £6,795 1s. 1d., or £2.775 2s. 8d. more than stood to their credit—similar things had occurred several times, and in consequence I sent for Algernon on September 20th—I told him that I could not take up Rogers Brothers' uncleared cheques unless Wallis, Sons and Co. gave me security—I asked for an explanation why they were receiving so many cheques from Rogers Brothers—he said that large quantities of foreign provisions were coming in, and documents presented to them for which they had to give their cheques to meet the sudden demands, and that the cheques were drawn in favour of the persons where the goods were originally lodged at the different wharves, and that Rogers Brothers were the payees, because the documents were received from the different wharfingers, and that they made the cheques payable to them, because the goods were originally lodged there—I believed his explanation and went on paying the cheques for a few days—looking at Schedule 29 I find a list of cheques drawn by Rogers Brothers with the names of different wharfingers in the neighbourhood as-payees, and all drawn to bearer—the total of the cheques paid on September 24th and 25th was £4,244 14s. 2d.—they were not met—I saw both Rogerses and Algernon Wallis the same day, November 26th or 27th—I asked for the money for the cheques and when they were going to meet them—Edward Rogers said the cheques were only given for Wallis's accommodation, and they could not meet them—I said they would have to do so—he said that Wallis, Sons and Co. would have to provide for them—Algernon Wallis shrugged his shoulders—I placed the matter in the hands of our solicitors, Messrs. Bayley, Adams, Hawkes, and Noble I should say the next morning—after that the two Rogers called and made various propositions to me—one was that if we would allow time they would deposit dock warrants to cover the amount of the cheques—I referred them to our solicitors—those documents were never lodged with us, nor any other security—we took proceedings and recovered judgment—by that time the firm had stopped payment—on September 26th we stopped payment of Wallis, Sons and Co.'s cheque—at that time there was a</p>

               <p>balance to their credit of £1,687 14s. 3d.—against that was the £4,244 14s. 2d. which had been credited to them on cheques of Rogers Brothers, but which turned out to be worthless, leaving a debit of £4,250 in round figures—another cheque drawn by Hadler for £485 6s. 4d. was dishonoured subsequently—£3,043 was the loss to the Bank on cheques—I should not have paid the cheques had I known they were accommoda<lb/>tion—Wallis told me they were given for value received—I believed him—the bills were for odd amounts from which I inferred that they were trade bills, and in that belief I allowed them to be discounted.—[<hi rend="italic">Mr. Muir put in a medical certificate that Rogers Brothers' clerk, Thompson, was too ill to attend.</hi>]</p>

The cross-cheque transactions began about the beginning of September, 1901—a marked cheque is a cheque payable to some account sent to the bank upon which it is drawn, and marked by that bank, when it becomes a first charge on the credit balance at that bank—I took that precaution on several occasions, by sending cheques by a messenger to the London and Westminster with cheques which were marked—I do not think any were marked at Lloyds—I sent on one occasion, when the messenger was told by a clerk that the manager was out, that the cheque would be all right, there was plenty of money to meet it, but they could not mark it—we do not keep a record of cheques we pay to other banks.</p>

Ransome and Co. and their predecessors have had an account at our bank fifty years—from July, 1897, to the beginning of 1900 we discounted for Ransomes' bills accepted by William Hodson, Wallis, Sons, and Co., Thomas and Short, and Richard Newton—Exhibit 379 is a schedule stating the amounts and the dates on which they were accepted, for three years—the bills accepted by William Hodson discounted for Ransomes represented £13,800, on Wallis, Sons, and Co. £17,905, Thomas and Short £743, and Richard Newton £1,056—shortly before March 29th, 1900, I had a conversation with Arthur Wallis with regard to bills accepted by Hodson—I thought the amount was running up too rapidly, and questioned him—he admitted that they were not all for goods—I said I should take no more of them, and the account must be closed so far as Hodson's bills were concerned, and that I did not car about taking Wallis's name, and that I did not like cross drawings between Wallis and Ransome—the next day I wrote Exhibit 507, giving Wallis, Sons, and Co. notice to discontinue' the facilities—I received Exhibit 506 from S. and E.

Rogers on October 14th at his office—I do not think he had publicly failed—we had a long conversation about the state of his firm, and he seemed very confident that they would be able to tide over any difficulties they were in—I asked him whether the values of the goods were correct—I had been to Mr. Brett at the London and West<lb/>minster Bank, who had an appointment with Rogers, and he told me that he believed we should find the valuation of Rogers Brothers substantially correct—Rogers said the valuations were perfectly correct, subject to the market laws and nothing more, and he asked me whether I should be prepared to extend the date of the new bills running, and see them all right—I told him it depended upon the value of the goods how far we should be able to help him, and that we could not extend the credit five or six months till we knew the value of the goods was correct, and that we could get the money for them—he objected to Eastwood as the valuer, and suggested Barbers—I told him that Barbers was the firm I proposed to go to; then Barbers gave the carpets to Eastwoods to value, as—they considered they knew most about them—Edward said his brother Norman was responsible for their own valuations, that he himself did the finance part of the business and his brother the valuation of goods—two or three days after<lb/>wards I saw Edward Rogers as to the sable robes which were valued at £65 each—Messrs. Barber valued them at £19 each, and they were inde<lb/>pendently valued by Thorpe and Co. at within £2 or £3 of £19 each—they sold at £19 and were valued at £23—I picked that out as an instance which appeared to me very flagrant—Edward Rogers said he considered they were worth £90, and that a lot had been sold as high as £90, and that they had been put up at a public auction twice before, when £22 and £23 had been bid for them—in Exhibit 176, 166 lamb skin crosses are put into the</p>

               <p>contract as being worth £1,155—they were sold for £139—he allowed that that was an over-valuation, but said that his brother Norman Rogers did not value them himself, that he was out of England when the robes came—he admitted that the goods pledged with Rogers Brothers by Short were Rogers Brothers' goods—he gave as a reason that they wanted further credit, and that Mr. Short was more likely to get it on his separate account—I saw Short at his office on October 20th—I asked him about the state of his firm and for information about values—he said he was entirely dependent upon whether Rogers Brothers failed or not, that whether he met the bills or not depended entirely upon the solvency of Rogers Brothers—I think it was the following Monday when I asked him about his capital—he admitted that his capital was nil—he had represented it as £5,000—I remarked that I supposed he knew what it meant, or what the cones<lb/>quence was of getting money by false pretences—he said, "I know what you mean"—I either said "money" or "credit"—in parting with the advances to both Rogers Brothers and to Thomas and Short I believed they had stated the true market value of the goods, and that the goods were in the warehouses which were named in the warrants—I also distinctly believed that Short was dealing on his own account, and that he had a capital of £5,000.</p>

               <p>Of Messrs. Baring Brothers, merchant bankers—about May 10, 1901, I received a call from somebody representing Rogers Brothers, and after<lb/>wards got a letter, No. 49, in respect of a loan of £5,000 by acceptances against dock warrants representing China produce up to 80 per cent, of their value—I replied by letter No. 50, agreeing to loans up to 70 per cent of the value—Exhibit No. 51 represents the issue of the credit—from that time we made advances to Rogers Brothers on various contracts contained in Exhibits Nos. 52 to 58, 58 being dated October 4th, 1901—each contract has a schedule attached of the goods for which warrant would be deposited with us and the values—in addition we had Messrs. Ransomes' valuation, and on No. 52 there is, "We have inspected these goods and confirm the values, S. and E. Ransome"—that is written longways on the margin of several of the valuations—believing those valuations we made the advances shown in Exhibit 59—the amount of £9,850 was outstanding at the failure—the valuation of those goods cer<lb/>tified by Ransomes was £14,079—the margin was 30 per cent, when the failure came—the goods were sold and realised £4,137 6s. 3d., which left a difference of £9,941—£6,712 is the actual loss—we employed Messrs Barbers, the brokers, to value the goods prior to sale—they put the value as £4,106—a further advance of £5,000 was requested by letter, Exhibit 60, of August 8th, 1901—we also received letter, Exhibit 62, of September 3rd, 1901, from Rogers Brothers, asking for an advance against bristles—we did not agree to give further credit—Exhibit 58 is a contract of October 4th, 1901, by which the balance of £1,240 was available for Messrs. Short to draw upon us for—on that day that document, together with the warrants for the goods mentioned in the schedule to it, was lodged with us and further credit was given—by Exhibit 58<hi rend="italic">a</hi> Messrs. Ransome certify the prices—the goods referred to are 1,670 monflon skins, valued at £1,419—they were subsequently sold for £213—the next is 200 lambs' skin crosses valued at £350—those were subsequently sold for £97—I implicitly believed when the particulars were handed to me that the values were the true market values, and that the certificate of Ransomes was a true certificate of the market values of the goods they purported to certify.</p>

Ransome and Go in respect of warrants deposited by Rogers Brothers was £7,067, and in respect of Ransomes £6,999—our loss was £2,966—our valuations were £3,159—the amount realised was £3,862, or less than half the amount of their valuation—at the time I accepted the drafts I believed the values in the schedules of the loan contracts were the real market values of the goods—looking at Exhibit 88 I find goods valued by Thomas and Short were re-valued by Ransomes—some of the goods were pledged again.</p>

Baring's, Exhibit 58, were removed on August 30th on a deposit of £80—in each case we were handed cheques—there are other instances.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a director of the Norwich Union Insurance Society, also a member of the Finance Committee of that corpora<lb/>tion—the loan of £12,000 to Edward Beauchamp Rogers came before me in both capacities; also the reports the result of inquiries of various bankers of the borrower and his sureties—having seen those the other members of the Committee, the directors and myself, discussed the matter, and agreed to make the loan—I was one of the directors who signed the cheque by means of which the sum was advanced—the result of the inquiries appeared to be that the borrower and his sureties were solvent persons and able to meet the requirements.</p>

The results were shown to me in Norwich by the general manager of the Society—most of the reports were in writing—inquiries were made through the defendants' friends, the banks, inquiry offices, and trade protection associations—Stubbs were also employed—that was quite independent of any reference by the principal and his sureties—if those independent inquiries had not been satisfactory we should not have entered into the business.</p>

               <p>son Charles Edward, aged 24—we discussed the matter—then I received this letter, Exhibit 372, proposing to insure the son's life for £3,000 and to take a loan of £2,000 guaranteed by four persons. Norman Rogers, formerly partner in the firm of Rogers Brothers, banking at the London and Western Bank and Lloyds Bank; Algernon Wallis, banking at the London and South Western Bank, and for thirty years at Lloyds Bank, and proprietor of Wallis, Sons and Co.; Sheppard Ransome, banking at the London and County Bank, and senior partner of S. and E. Ransome, South American merchants; and Ransome Wallis, banking at the London and Westminster Bank; and Barnard Wallis, salaried representative of Wallis, Sons and Co., banking at the London and Provincial Bank, Sideup, and giving references, including Thomas and Short, Crosby Square, Great St. Helen's—I wrote to the references and made personal inquiries, which were satisfactory—I conversed with Short as to Algernon Wallis—his opinion was perfectly favourable; there was not a discordant note in his remarks—he spoke well of the Wallises, and Algernon in particular—m question was, "Do you believe Messrs. Wallis are thoroughly sound men who will carry out their engagements," and his remark was, as far as I an remember, to this effect, "You may be sure anything that they under<lb/>take they see their way to carry through"—I also read letter, Exhibit 374, signed Thomas Short and A. Howard Short, of July 8th, addressed to the Company to the effect that while they had no special knowledge of their financial standing, Wallis and Co. had met their obligations promptly—the loan was to be £2,000—our Company required that the firms and not merely the individual members should be responsible—I receives the proposal form, Exhibit 375, and dated August 25th, in which the references to the defendants Rogers Brothers, Wallis, Sons and Co., the two Ran<lb/>somes individually and as firms as sureties, and their bankers are given—that is signed by Ransome Wallis—after the receipt of Exhibit 377 from Wallis, Sons and Co. asking for the cheque, I reported the result of the inquiries to my head office.</p>

Dear Sir.—It is—with much regret that I beg to inform you that I have a good opportunity of bettering myself. I therefore beg to give you notice that I wish to resign my position at the above address on October 4th. 1902"—after, that I examined my books, and interviewed the witnesses Bendon, Holmes, and Starr, as the result of which I consulted my solicitors and took these proceedings—in the ledger George Bindon is debited with £10 as an advance which had been made to him, and I received from the prisoner this pro<lb/>missory note (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>) dated September 10th, 1902, purporting to be signed by George Bindon—on the credit side Bindon is credited with having paid one instalment of 6s. on account of that loan—I also find a debit account of £10 against Alfred Holmes, of 4, Jesmond Street, Wal<lb/>worth, dated August 12th, 1902, and I received this promissory note.

Whiting, of 4, Heaver Road, East Dul<lb/>wich, for £8 8s. on August 8th; he is credited with 5s. on August 19th, 10s. on September 5th, and 15s. on September 22nd—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>) is a promissory note I received from the prisoner, accompanied by a balance sheet, purporting to be signed by Wm.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The promissory note of Starr is in Ingram's writing—I do not know the signature—I do not know the writing in the application form—Mr. Starr said that the signature was not his, and the signature en the back which I asked him to write has no resemblance to it—I do not know the writing in Holmes' bill—the balance sheet relating to it shows that the prisoner had a balance at the bank of £16 2s. 7d., and cash in hand £1 16s. 9£d.—the body of Bindon's bill is in Ingram's writing—I do not know the signature—the address "Fishmonger's shop" in the application form is in the prisoner's writing, the balance sheet in Bindon's case shows that the prisoner had a balance at the bank of £8, and in hand 12 12s. 1 1/2 d., due from him to me—the account at the bank was kept in the name of B. J. Cohen—the body of Phillip's bill is in Ingram's writing—I do not know the signature—I do not know the writing in the application form—the body of Whiting's bill is in the prisoner's writing—I do not know the signature—the balance at the bank in that case was £28, and in hand £2 14s. 0 1/2d.—the promissory note is in Ingram's writing; I do not know the signature; I do not know the writing in the application form—I cannot say in whose writing the appli<lb/>cation forms are: they appear to be in one and the same writing, except the words "Fishmonger's shop" in Bindon's case, and that is in the prisoner's writing—I do not know a man named Faulkner nor his writing—I had heard that Chadd had been an engine driver and was a man of no education and a very bad writer—he was engaged by Mr. Cohen on my behalf—I had never seen him until after he had begun his work—all cheques for the business were drawn by Mr. Cohen—Chadd gave notice to Cohen—the business was not Cohen's, it was mine—Cohen merely advanced me the money to carry it on, he took none of the profits—the prisoner sent me a balance sheet every week and from that I knew what was in the bank and what was in hand—the office was taken in the joint names of Cohen and myself, and the rent was paid by Cohen's cheques in our two names—I never told Chadd that he must not be too particular in making inquiries about would-be borrowers, or he would drive business</p>

               <p>away—the business had certainly increased during the latter part of the time Chadd was with us—he never told me that he had not time to make all the necessary inquiries—I suggested to him that he should have assistance—that was some considerable time before he left—the interest was never over 50 per cent.—it was not the method to ascertain the identity of a would-be borrower, to send a letter to his address and ask him to bring it with him; if Chadd did that, it was wrong—Chadd had to call on applicants to inspect their rent books and see that the landlord had not any right to seize their furniture—I made a mistake at the police court in saying I had had no communication with Chadd after September 29th—I had letter from him on October 4th—Mr. Cohen and I asked him to stay on, and he said he was going to start with a new man in a new money-lending business at New Cross—we never offered to increase his salary if he would stay on—Chadd paid Ingram himself—I live at 43, Grand Parade, Brighton—my office is at Camberwell Green—the bills are made payable at 42, Bedford Hill, Balham, because I wanted to use the Wandsworth County Court for actions—Camberwell Green would be in the Lambeth County Court District—my brother-in-law, Percy Cohen, carries on a money-lending business at 42, Bedford Hill—he is about sixteen or seventeen years old—Judge Emden of the Lambeth County Court would make orders in my favour, but they were for only a penny a month, which was ridiculous.</p>

I went to the Wandsworth County Court because I liked the sort of justice administered there, better than that administered at Lambeth—both Judges would give mea-judgment if the case was proved, but all that remained was the question of payment by large or small instalments—I am not aware that I am committing an offence against the Money lender's Act in making the' bills payable at Bedford Hill instead of at Camberwell Green—there is a plate fixed with my name on it at Bedford Hill, but I have never seen it—the debtors were always told to pay their instalments at Camberwell Green—I have been a builder—I did not describe myself to the Magistrate as a builder—I registered myself as a money-lender, but as having been a builder—I ceased to be a builder twelve months ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Judge Emden made orders for small instalments to all other money-lenders besides myself—the balance sheets ought all to corre<lb/>spond with the books—they would be made up from the journal and the cash book—the instalments which were paid by the six different people from time to time ceased when Chadd left—the profits of the business went back into the business, but there has been a defalcation of about £400—Ingram was engaged and paid by Chadd—when Chadd left, Ingram left, and I have not been able to find him.</p>

I knew his voice; I said, "Mrs. Young"—I heard the prisoner say to the deceased, "You are wanted"—she said, "There is no b—body wants to see me to-night"—I came away from the door and went to where Mrs. Whelan was standing—I did not see any more of the Browns that night—I know Cox; I saw him after I came from the Brown's door with some other boys, but they all ran away—there is a back way out of the prisoner's house—I then went into No. 3—I went home after 11 p.m.—I did not notice anything at the prisoner's house, but there was a light in the window—I next saw the prisoner on Sunday morning at my back door at 8.50—he said, "Annie,—I want to speak to you"—I went with him to his house, and he said, "Annie, I think she is dead"—I said, "Good God, who?"—he said, "Bess," that is his wife—he went into the house; I followed him—I saw the deceased lying on the stairs leading up to the bedroom—I screamed out twice; I fell against the door, and when I came to I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> my husband there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner asked my husband to fetch a constable—the prisoner seemed surprised that the deceased was dead—there is nothing between the deceased's kitchen and my house except a wall—if I was in my place I should hear any screams in the deceased's kitchen—I heard no cries during the Saturday night—when I went and spoke to the prisoner through the door the voices which answered me were quite natural—I did not think a murderous assault had been committed—I stood outside my daughter-in-law's house—I heard no cries at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner of 66, Sheen Lane, Mortlake—I was called to the prisoner's house on November 2nd, about 9.15 a.m.—I saw the body of the deceased—she had been dead for any time from five hours upwards—the body was quite cold and stiff—I cannot say the exact number of hours, but in my opinion at least five—Dr. Crookshank was not there then—I found the body lying on its face over the lower three or four steps of the stairs—there was a very damp place on the front of the jacket, apparently vomited matter, which had fallen on it—the body was only partly dressed—she had on a short brown jacket, a cream-coloured flannel petticoat, and a linen chemise, but no dress—I did not notice any signs of water having been thrown about—I struck a match and looked at her face without moving the body, and I saw there were no marks or scratches on her face—a little vomited matter was coming from her nose and mouth and a little blood with it—I made a more careful examination when the body was brought to the mortuary—on the head I found a contusion with a certain amount of laceration over the left ear,—another contusion with a laceration on the outer side of the left eye, and an extensive bruise over the right side of the head above the temple—there was a very large tear on the inside of the lower lip—there was an abrasion on the nose and one on the chin, and bruises all over the body which all seemed to be recent, except four on the right thigh, which seemed to be perhaps a couple of days old—on the 3rd I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> by myself and discovered serious injuries, and on the 4th Dr. Crookshank and I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> together—on opening the body I found nine ribs broken on the right side, and five on the left-some of those on the right were broken in two places—the breast bone was broken in two places—under the breast bone there was an extravasation of blood, evidently the result of the bruising of the tissues from the broken breast bone—I found no other injuries except those to the ribs, and bruises—there was a large bruise on the head, and on opening the head I found a large extravasation of blood corresponding with the bruise outside—that is what I should expect to find—my opinion is that death was due to shock from injuries received, particularly those to the breast bone and ribs—there is a possi<lb/>bility that asphyxia may have been present also, but I should not like to say definitely from what I saw; I mean the vomit may have been taken down into the lungs and asphyxiated her—in my opinion the injuries Were of such a character as to cause death—I did not notice any sign which suggested that there had been any concussion at all, but it is quite possible from the large bruise on the right side of the head and the quantity of blood beneath it, which showed that the bruise was severe—there was rather a severe bruise on the left side of the perineum—the breaking of the bones on the left side were most likely caused by pressure above—the lower four</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190211170153"/>
               <p>ribs that were broken on the left side corresponded with a very bad bruise on the skin just over the four ribs, and in my opinion the breaking of those four ribs were caused by that bruise—a kick would be the most probable cause of that bruise,—this hammer might perhaps have caused it—the injuries to the head were evidently occasioned by some hard instru<lb/>ment, but not by the fist, possibly by a kick or a hammer—if the injuries were inflicted on her away from the house it would have been impossible for her to have got up and walked into the house—she might have crawled a few yards perhaps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not suggest that the injury to the perineum was one which would have contributed by itself to the deceased's death; there was injury to the tissues which shows the wounds were caused before death—the body had not begun to decompose when I opened it—I know it was the opinion of Dr. Crookshank that death was due to some vomited matter getting into the windpipe and causing asphyxiation; that is quite possible; in different cases of asphyxia the appearences are not always the same—I think most of the bruises were too severe to have been caused, by falling down stairs—they might have been caused by some weight falling or being struck down on her—there are twenty-four ribes in a body; some of them are called true and some false ribs; some are flying ribs which do not join the sternum, and they come forward and end in soft tissues—the ribs are connected by a kind of elastic substance to enable the ribs to go up and down with breathing—broken ribs are one of the commonest things I have to deal with next to broken arms and legs—we often have broken ribs to deal with in drunken people—ribs might be broken by the body falling on some projecting substance—I do not know that I have ever heard of them being broken by simple muscular con<lb/>traction even in cases of powerful expiratory efforts—I do not say it is impossible, but it is not likely—a broken sternum is sometimes associated with the breaking of ribs, towards the bottom it gets more fragile—it is fair to say that it is caused sometimes by direct blows or compression by heavy weights, but more frequently by indirect violence, such as falling across a projecting body—in this case the sternum could not have been broken by falling on a projecting body—there was no bruise, and it was broken by the pressure of some soft substance—the deceased was a lightly-built woman—she weighed about 8 st. 7 lbs.—I did not weigh her, but that is my impression—she was not stout, she was thin—in cases of thin people the tissues are generally very much stronger, and the bones are harder than in stout people—I have never heard of the sternum being fractured by an effort to prevent a fall backwards—it might be possible to break the sternum in one place in that way—the deceased had a very small heart and something wrong with her lungs, but very little wrong—I was Told she was about forty years old.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. My theory is that the ribs and the sternum were both broken by the same violence—there were no outward signs of bleeding—the pressure of a knee would fracture the sternum.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190211170154"/>
               <p>agree generally with his evidence—I think the immediate cause of death was the drawing in of vomited matter into her air passages—the vomiting was probably the result of the injuries to the head and the general shock, more probably the injuries to the head—I think I attach a little more importance to the injuries to the head than Dr. Bell does, but speaking generally I think death would result from the shock caused by the injuries—I agree generally with Dr. Bell as to how the injuries were caused.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If I am right in supposing that the vomiting was the result of injury to the head, the vomiting would have occurred whether the deceased had been drinking or not—it would be unlikely for persons to be suffocated by vomit if they were conscious; they would cough and reject it—there are cases where the coughing is not successful when solid matter is drawn into the lungs, but not often when liquid matter is drawn into the lungs.</p>

               <p>wife there; my wife said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Pat</hi>, he has told me all about it"—the prisoner said, "Yes old girl, I have told you all about it, I murdered her, and I will go up there to-morrow and tell them all about it, and they can do as they like with me; where she was found I sat in the chair and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> her crawl there; then I got sorry and thought she was in a fit; I got—some water and threw over her; I attempted it six times, and the Lord have mercy on her soul."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not hear the prisoner say anything before what I have stated—my wife could have heard all I have said—I cannot say why the prisoner should have made this confession—I did not know that my wife had been accusing him every day since the murder—she had never told me before that it was her belief that the prisoner was the man who had done it.</p>

I have known the prisoner and his wife for about twenty years—about two years ago I spoke to-the deceased in Richmond Road—there is no lane there—the prisoner came by while I was speaking to her—that is all that happened on that occasion—there has never been any impropriety between me and the deceased as far as I know.</p>
