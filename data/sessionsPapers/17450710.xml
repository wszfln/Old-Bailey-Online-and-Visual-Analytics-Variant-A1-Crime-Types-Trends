               <p>Butcher. Her hand was in the chest, but her back being towards me, I did not see her take anything out. She said, uncle, why do you leave the key in your chest? and then she locked the chest, and he put the key in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you mistrust her taking the money?</p>
               <p>Butcher. Because she paid her creditors in moidores that afternoon, and she had but one half peny in her pocket when she went on board - I did not see her pay any.</p>

               <p>Woodroffe. We dined on board about one o'clock, and they went away directly after dinner.</p>

               <p>Woodroffe. I have once or twice when I have been late in town - I lay there the Sunday before she robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you mistrust the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Woodroffe. Because Mrs. Butcher came on board that afternoon, and acquainted me with her having some moidores; then I looked for mine, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give her the money upon the account of an injury that her daughter had received from you?</p>
               <p>Woodroffe. No, I never gave her a moidore, I lent her a guinea some time ago to pay the King's tax.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was in bed with me. He had like to have undone my child, and he fell down upon his knees, and asked my pardon, and gave me seven moidores to hold my tongue and not to expose him, and he said he would be a friend to me, and keep my child all her life.</p>

            . I am the Prisoner's sister; I live in New Gravel Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the Prosecutor been at your sister's house 3 or 4 days together?</p>
               <p>Boyd. Will you please to hear me, and I will tell you the truth. I saw Mr. Woodroffe in bed with my sister, and he gave her seven moidores; I have swore to it - it is now about 8 days ago - I cannot tell what day of the week it was - it was one day about a week ago - my sister sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your sister send for you for?</p>
               <p>Boyd. To ask me if she owed me any money, and I said she did for lodging. I shall speak what I am ashamed to speak *. He came to her to smother the injury he had done to the child; a child about 7 years of age; and I saw my sister and him in bed together, and he gave her 7 moidores.</p>
               <p>* She deposed that the child had been very much injured in her private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation passed between them?</p>
               <p>Boyd. He said he loved her very dearly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174507100005"/>Q. I ask you what they said that is material to the present matter?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I do not know what they did, but they were in bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. You was speaking of moidores, what did you see about them?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I saw the money given out of his hand into hers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he money, or what was it in?</p>
               <p>Boyd. He had it in a purse, he took it out of his pocket and gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give it her for?</p>
               <p>Boyd. He said he gave it her [here she paused a considerable time] I can't say what he gave it her for; but my sister's child was used in a very base manner. He gave me half a guinea to hold my tongue, but I would not, for my sister's child was used in a base manner; but I am no base woman.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the child used?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I can't explain it if I was to lose my life - my dear sister's child was in a bleeding capacity in the private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had done any thing to the child?</p>
               <p>Boyd. No, he denied it, but we found him with the child in the garret, and no body else could do it; and my sister was in liquor, poor thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed about this?</p>
               <p>Boyd. Lord bless me, I can't tell, we were all in a passion and threatened to prosecute him, and so he has brought this indictment against my sister.</p>

There was a hole cut in the kitchen window shutter, and the bolt unbolted, and a hole cut through the door, and the plate mentioned in the indictment was taken away. A sew days after Mr. White stopped the Prisoner with the snuff pan, which I knew by the coat of arms - the candlesticks are worth about nine guineas, and the tea pot about 14 or 15 pounds.</p>

Then he took a piece of silver [the snuff pan] I asked him if it was his own, he said, yes; I shewed it my partner, for it was doubled up in a very strange manner. I asked him again if it was his, then he said it was his friend's. My partner and I did not like it; and I told him I would stop the silver and him too. As soon as I had spoke the words he opened the door, and run down Noble street (I cried out stop thief, and alarmed the neighbourhood, and pursued him) then he turned down Oat lane, and into Staining lane, and my partner caught hold of him at the end of Lillipot lane, and brought him back, and then he said he had a partner, and that he run out to call him. In the hurly burly, Mr. Hague came over, told him he was a rogue, and accused him with stealing them, and fetched over a tea pot he had bought of the Prisoner. There was an advertisement published by this lady with a reward, upon which we acquainted her with it, and she came and owned them by the coat of arms. I had opened the snuffer pan, and then the coat of arms appeared.</p>

            . [Mr. White's partner] On the 30th of May the person at the bar came to Mr. White's house, and asked him if he would buy any old silver; he asked him what he had to sell, and he pulled out part of a snuffer pan rolled up together; he first said it was his own, and then that it was a friend's of his. I said, Mr. White, let me look at it, and said, I fancy it is stole, stop him and the silver too; Mr. White said he would, and then he opened the door and run away, and we took him in Lillipot lane. I asked him what he was, he said, he was a dealer in silver, and travelled the country. I asked him how old sterling went now, he said, he did not know the worth of it. I asked him how new sterling went, and he said he could not tell. I asked him what he gave an ounce for it, he said he did not know but he might give about 4 s. 3 d. Then he said he bought it by the lump, as they do butter. Said I, I fancy you stole it; he said, he bought it in the country, then he said he bought a parcel of silver in Mary le Bone fields, and gave four pounds, odd money for it. When Mrs. Leprimandy came to see it, I put it into the vice and opened it, and it had her arms upon it.</p>

            . On the 29th of May, the Prisoner at the bar came into my shop, and asked if I bought old silver, I told him, yes; I asked him what he he had got to sell, he put his hand into his pocket, and brought out a lump of silver lace burnt, about an ounce and a half, and I gave him 5 s. 6 d. an ounce. He had a lump of melted silver, and asked what I would give an ounce for it; I said I could not tell till I had made an essay. He left it with me to have the essay made, and that took off all suspicion of its being stole, and I bought it of him; there were 11 ounces and odd peny weights. I bought a tea pot of him, which was bent together, but as he said he travelled the country, I did not suspect it to be stolen on that account, for people do that to old silver, either for lightness of carriage or ease in packing, and I gave him 5 s. 4 d. an ounce for it. I saw him go into Mr. White's, and I desired a neighbour to go in after him, and if he was selling any plate to desire Mr. White to stop him, and presently there was a hue and cry. After he was taken, I went into Mr. White's, and said to the Prisoner, you are a villain, and I verily believe the plate is stolen; and he said he bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174507100007"/> it of a man at Mary le Bone. I carried the tea-pot over to Mr. White's, and got one of the warnings from Goldsmith's Hall. I was three quarters of an hour in getting the pot open, for fear of spoiling the coat of arms, to see whether it agreed with the advertisement, and it did. I asked him if there was any body concerned with him in it, and if there was I desired him to make himself an evidence: he said there was nobody concerned but himself, and he could impeach nobody.</p>

            . I live with Deputy Bailey in Forster Lane. The Prisoner brought some silver unburnt, and desired me to burn it; and while I was burning it, he asked me whether he could not melt silver in a kitchen grate; I told him the best way was to build a forge. He pulled out a piece of a pair of snuffers out of his pocket, and I bought that of him at 4 s. 6 d. an ounce: there was no mark or coat of arms upon it; that and the burnt silver came to 13 s. 6 d.</p>

About the latter end of May, on a Saturday in the afternoon, I met the Prisoner in Portland Street, and he desired me to go and drink a part of a tankard of beer, and there was a sailor along with him, and the sailor pulled some silver out of his pocket: there was a silver tea pot, a silver snuffer pan, and some silver in a lump; the silver was tied up in an old handkerchief: the Prisoner asked him how he came by it; he said he found it on board a French ship they had taken, and put it into his trowzers, and he gave him four guineas in gold and three shillings in silver for it - the tea-pot was rolled up, but I could discern that it was a tea-pot.</p>

            . On the fourth of June in the afternoon I took out my horse for a ride, and about the middle of Deptford town I saw two fellows at an alehouse door with some fowls, and hearing Mr. Johnson had lost some the day before, I asked them what they had got there; they said fowls, but their master was not there, and they could not sell them; they were to carry them to the Boot and Crown at Deptford, and he was to come there to them. I went there and enquired for a constable, but there was none to be had there, so we got one at Greenwich. I told the men I believed their master had stole the fowls: at last the Prisoner came, and I took care they should not give him any item to get away. The Prisoner came into the house very boldly, and I asked him if he had any thing to sell; he said, yes, he had got some fowls. I asked him if they were his fowls; he said, yes. I had not patience to stand talking with him much, and I said if he did not give a good account how he came by them, I would charge a constable with him, which I did. There were six dozen and two of the fowls left, and I desired the constable to take care of the Prisoner and them till I rode to London. I went to Mr. Johnson's, and acquainted him with it; and when he came to Deptford I shewed him the prisoner, and he said that was the man; and Mr. Johnson hired a landau, and brought him to London. <rs id="t17450710-14-verdict80" type="verdictDescription">

A quarter before 12 at night Prisoner's daughter came into the house in her and said her father was her mother to pieces. I run out of the house and met the Prisoner at the bar, about 40 rob from his house; he had his coat over his arm, and nothing on but his shirt, and his shoes buckled, without stockings or breeches; and his shut sleeves were all over blood. I asked him what he had been about; he said he had killed his wife. I laid hold of his arm, and said he must go along with me, and he did not refuse going with me. I took him to the sign of the Vine, and as he was going along he threw his knife into a pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him throw it into the pond?</p>
               <p>Price. I saw him throw something, I asked him what it was, and he said it was his knife. A constable was sent for, and he was secured. He had locked the door, and had the key in his pocket, and I took it out. About a quarter of an hour afterwards several of us went to his own house and went into a lower room, where he and his wife used to lie, and her body lay upon the bed, partly naked, without any bed clothes over her, and a chamber pot standing upon a chair, as I suppose, for her to bleed in; though her head did not be directly over it, for she bled on one side of it. Her throat was cut, and her belly ript up, and she had a place cut in her cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the body was warm?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes; it was warm and her throat and belly were bleeding. In the morning we carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174507100010"/> him before Justice Moore, and he asked him whether he was guilty of the murder, and he said, yes, he did murder her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't say any thing against what he says. I was out of my senses, I did not know what I did. Something disturbed us so for several nights, that neither of us could rest or sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be fuddled?</p>
               <p>Price. He appeared sober enough for any thing that I could observe.</p>

            . Mr. Price and I went out of the Vine together upon the alarm of the girl, and the sleeves of his shirt were as bloody as if they had been dipped in blood, and the some part of it was bloody. He had only his shoes and his shirt on; and as he was coming along he threw his knife into a pond; I saw where it went, and I went the next morning and took it out [it was a small knife with a round pointed blade.] He said he had murdered his wife, I asked him what made him do it, and he said he had been at work for the Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he crazy sometimes?</p>
               <p>Wright. He was a little crazy sometimes - He was a labouring man, I have worked with him sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his wife?</p>
               <p>Wright. Not till the next day. I had only a glimpse of her. I did not care to see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit up with him all night?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be disordered in liquor?</p>
               <p>Wright. He was very sober all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he talk sensibly?</p>
               <p>Wright. He said but little; but what he said he talked sensibly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wife and he agree, or did they disagree?</p>
               <p>Wright. They used to disagree sometimes - I don't know that he ever offered any violence to her before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not know that I should do it till just that I went about it, for I was out of my senses, I was half mad. My wife said the devil was coming, and that frightened me, and so we went to fighting. I asked her for a halfpeny for a halfpeny candle, and she would not give it me, so I was in the dark, or else we used to have a light; I did it innocently. <rs id="t17450710-16-verdict93" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>White. I had been drinking in Shoreditch with one Mr. Hope a brewer. The Prisoner and another woman hussled me, and took me hold by the middle, or much about that part. I had a handkerchief in my pocket, which I missed; missing my handkerchief I thought this woman had robbed me. I followed them into Bell Alley, [ Petticoat Lane] I think it is Bell Alley, it is by Whitechapel. Said I to this woman, when she was housed, mistress, pray give me my handkerchief, for I believe you have it, and I'll give you more than it is worth, because I would have it again. I offered them two shillings for it several times, and they denied the taking it. I asked them for it abundance of times, and thought they would have taken the money for the handkerchief, because it is not worth more. I came out and went into the house two or three times; I thought I would go into the house once more, so went in and asked them for it again: they said they could not do any thing till they had something to drink, so I put my hand in my pocket and gave them six pence to drink, thinking I should have got my handkerchief afterwards: then I offered them three shillings, and that would not do. I had three parcels of money in my pocket, and pulled out one parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. In what pocket was it?</p>
               <p>White. In my coat pocket. I pulled out a bag in which was 8 l. 10 s. all in silver, which I had taken that day.</p>

            . The prisoner and I met Mr. White in Gracechurch Street; they talked together a little, and then she asked him if he would not go home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give his consent to go home with her?</p>
               <p>Cutherson. I did not hear him say any thing, but they went along, and I went on too, sometimes before, and sometimes behind. As he was going along he complained that he had lost his handkerchief, and said, he loved justice and honesty. Then he went home with her into Bell Alley in Petticoat Lane; when he came into the house, he asked her for his handkerchief, and said, he hoped there was justice there; and that he missed his handkerchief in Gracechurch Street, and she said she knew nothing of his handkerchief, as she hoped to be saved: then he pulled a couple of shillings out of his pocket, and offered her for it, but she said she knew nothing of it. He went out at the door and came in again, and desired to have it, and said he would search us. I offered several times to be searched; then he said he would give three shillings for it, he valued it so much. He said he had twenty pound about him, and that he would as leave have lost that as the handkerchief: then he pulled out a bag of money, and said, here's a bag of money, and I have more in my breeches pockets both gold and silver; and he put the money into his pocket again; then the Prisoner went to the door and pushed it to, and asked him if he would give her something to drink; he said, yes, if she would let him have his handkerchief; but however, he would give her something to drink, and threw down six pence, and we had some gin and small beer, but he said he did not like any such liquor: then she locked the door, and he said he would not be locked in. I saw the bag in her hand, and I asked him if he had not lost something; he said he had lost his bag; he took hold of her hand, and took the bag out of her hand: I said you brazen face, how could you take the man's money out of his pocket?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it out of his pocket?</p>
               <p>Cutherson. I did not see her take it, she said she would tell it for him; he said, you brazen face do you want to rob me again: then he pulled out his money again, and laid it upon the table to tell it, and she scrambled, and said, she had not seen so much money upon her table a great while; then she scrambled again, and scrambled some away from him, and he went to the alehouse and told the money over, and said he had lost 8 s. 6 d. and the Prisoner said, if she had known he had had that money he should never have brought it home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who had you your handkerchief from?</p>
               <p>White. I had it from you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Good Lord forgive me, I never had it; I never saw it till he put his money in it, and she was sitting in his lap. Sure he will not offer to swear any such thing.</p>
               <p>Cutherson. I never sat in his lap, and the man never offered to touch me; if I had thought she would have robbed him, I would have gone out of the house, and not have staid there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took his money out of his pocket, and laid it upon the table, and sat upon my table an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was White there?</p>
               <p>Cutherson. I believe what with going backwards and forwards, and disputing, it was a couple of hours.</p>

On the 15th of May, I saw my boy under some concern, and he intimated that there was a watch taken out of the shop with a shagreen case, and a gold dial plate. I asked him who took it, he said there was a middle sized man, pitted with the small pox, came in to the shop, and he imagined he took it. I lodged an advertisement, which came out the 16th of May with a description of the watch and the person. I had given over all thoughts of it, and I think last Monday was 3 weeks a person sent for me to go into Bride lane, and asked me if I had not advertised a watch, and said that it was stopped, and the person with it. I went to a coffee house there, and saw the Prisoner in the coffee room up one pair of stairs; they asked me if I knew the watch, I said, that was my watch.</p>

               <p>Lambert. I could not say I never saw the Prisoner. He was carried to the Counter that night. When I was in the coach with him, he turned his face to me, and said, it lyes in your power to do me a great deal of service, and desired me to make it up, and he would have made it up at any rate, for he said his reputation would be spoilt. A gentleman intimated to him that his reputation would not be worth much long; meaning that he would not live long, that he would be hanged. I desired he would give me an account how he came by it, and he said, God knows, he could not do that. He said at first his name was

               <p>Q. What have you to say as to the Prisoner's taking a watch away?</p>
               <p>Berry. I am certain, that on Wednesday the 15th of May, there was a person came into the shop very much like the Prisoner at the bar; but I cannot say the Prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he came into the shop?</p>
               <p>Berry. He asked me several questions; he asked me whether his watch was done, I told him I did not know we had any of his. He said it was an old one that he left with my master about a fortnight ago. I said if he left it, I was not at home, for I knew nothing of the matter. He said he would call again when my master was at home, and went away directly. After he was gone, I looked upon the place where the watch lay, and it was gone. There was another watch lay by it, but I missed that watch which is in court. I saw it there when he was in the shop, and knowing of no body else could come in but him, I went out to look after him, but I could not directly see which way the person went. I came in again directly, and then I was in a great concern, that the watch which was brought in when my master was out should be taken away. I acquainted my master with it, and described the person to him, as dressed in blue grey, turned up with yellow plush, and yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any other description of him?</p>
               <p>Berry. Yes; that he had his own hair, was middle sized, and pitted with the small-pox.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner, can you or can you not take upon you to say the Prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Berry. I cannot take upon me to say he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be the man?</p>
               <p>Berry. There are circumstances which make me think so.</p>

               <p>Berry. Yes.</p>

            , came to my house, being recommended by a neighbour to borrow 10 l. I desired to see the security, and he shewed me this watch, and said it cost him 15 guineas. I said, Sir, this will not do for this money, for it is not all gold. There was a young man who waits on me was by me, he saw the name of the maker, and looks upon the register. I keep a register where I enter all the stolen watches in, every day from the advertiser. I saw that the case was not gold, though to some eyes it may appear to be gold. I asked him, is this gold? he said it was. I asked him where he bought it, he said, I bought it of a person who comes to our house. Where do you live, said I? With my Lord Portmore, he said. I said, I think it is very odd your ambition should induce you to wear a gold watch? and asked him what he was, but he did not care to satisfy me in that particular; so I did not press him. He was actually very genteely dressed, as any man could well be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a livery ?</p>
               <p>Piercy. No, he was in the same dress he is now, as far as I could see: he might be my Lord Portmore himself, for I don't know his Lordship. I told him it was not gold, he rapped out an oath, and said, then I am deceived. My young man having looked upon the register, gave me a nod to go backwards. I looked at the advertisement, and found it agreed, so I put the watch in my pocket after this manner as I do now. He cursed me, and said, G - d - your blood, what do you mean by putting my watch into your pocket? I told him I would shew him by what authority, so I shewed him the advertisement to read; he started up and said he would soon bring the owner of it, who would release him and the watch, and make me suffer for what I had done. So as he passed out of the shop I followed him, b staying to speak to a neighbour, I lost fight of the gentleman. I went after him and met him crossing from Salisbury court to Shoe lane. I said, Sir, I want to speak with you; you must go back to my house? he said he was going to seek the person he had the watch of. I had him by the coat, and he desired me to let him go. I still insisted that he should go back with me, but when entreaties were to no purpose, I was resolved to have him back by main force, and in struggling he crossed the way, being stronger than I. Then, my Lord, he up's with a stick to strike at me, and some how or other I struck it out of his hand, and told him if he would not go decently I would cane him as he would have done me; then I suppose he thought it was the best way to go quietly, which he did. I did not think proper to carry him to my own house, so I carried him to a house shown by the name of Anderson coffee house, and sent for a constable. I asked him what the watch cost him; he said it cost 50 s. then he said he bought it at the two chairmen. I sent for Mr. Lambert, and when he came, I asked him what sort of a watch he had lost, he said it was a watch with a shagreen case, the inside metal gilt, and gilt on the edges. I asked him the number of it, and he said he believed it was from 422 to 427, [It was one of those numbers.] The next morning I went with Mr. Lambert and carried him before Alderman Gibbon, and he was committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think about six weeks ago I happened to go into Bloomsbury square, I met a man about my size, and he asked me to buy a silver watch, I went with him into the two chairmen, he asked me 10 l. 10 s. for it, and at last came down to 50 s. and I gave it him.</p>

            . About six weeks ago I went into the two chairmen - in King's street, by Bloomsbury, and I saw the Prisoner and another man in a blue grey coat, and he in the blue grey was bargaining to sell a watch, and asked the Prisoner 3 guineas for it, the Prisoner said he would not give so much, he would give him 50 s. and he would give no more; and in a little time the Prisoner gave him the money.</p>

               <p>Jones. It looked like black leather. - I was sitting with a young woman who was waiting for somebody, and lives in the neighbourhood; and I said there were just now two men bargaining about a watch, and now they are gone: when I saw her again, she said you told me there were two men bargaining for a watch at the two Chairmen; one of those men is taken up for stealing a watch; I said I would go and see whether it was the same person.</p>

            . On the 16th of June my wife and I went out for a day's pleasure; I was informed my house was broke open, and my drawers stripped: when I heard of it, I said the prisoner was the person that did it, for she was standing at the door when I went out at five o'clock in the morning. I got a warrant, and had her taken up at her lodgings in Newtoner's Lane: there were several of the things found upon her. She owned she broke open the house, and in what manner she did it: she said she attempted to take down a shutter, but she could not, so she took out the pannel of the door with a casement hook.</p>

            . On Thursday the 23d of May, I supped with some West India merchants at the King's Arms Tavern, in Lombard street. About eleven o'clock we paid the bill, and ordered the waiter to get a Coach. We waited the return of the porter, but no coach could be got. Between 11 and 12 it being a fine star-light night, I put my sword and cane under my arm and walked. When I had just got beyond Somerset house, I saw Kelly and St. Legar behind me; and there was a drunken soldier before me, who staggered so, that he hindered my passing; when I found I could not easily get by, I whipped into the street in order to pass by him; then Kelly and St. Legar followed me; when I came to one of the dark passages in the Strand, I stopped to let them pass me, for I thought they wanted to walk faster than I; and when I stopped, they stopped. I thought it was done out of complaisance. When I came to <placeName id="t17450710-27-crimeloc163">Buckingham street in the Strand</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17450710-27-crimeloc163" type="placeName"

I said don't use me ill, it is not in my power to resist you, gentlemen, I see what you are about, and I cannot hinder you.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were then present?</p>
               <p>Piggott. They were all three present, and Kelly said, D - n you, you son of a b - h, do you speak, by G - d if you do, I'll murder you; upon that I was quite silent, and made no reply. He still kept hold of me by the collar; then he took hold of my watch string, he could not easily get the watch out, so he tore open my breeches, and took the watch out and put it into his pocket. Then he put his hand into my right hand pocket, and took out all my silver and brass, I believe about 10 s. He searched with his hand on the side of my breeches, till he felt the purse; by his hurry I thought he would have torn the purse out. I said you may take it, he said, D - n you, you son of a b - h, you shall give it me, and I gave him the purse with 40 odd guineas; I think there were 44 guineas and a half in it. As soon as he had got that, he put his right hand upon my shoulder and turned my face down towards Buckingham street, and he swore by his Maker if I made a noise or offered to follow him, he would murder me, and bid me go down that street. Just as I turned the corner I received a stroke on the left side of my neck with some weapon, which I suppose was done with a design to knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had St. Legar any weapon ?</p>
               <p>Piggott. While Kelly was robbing me, St. Legar stood just before me with a drawn sword, and held the pint of it close to my breast, and Cave stood on the left hand with a drawn hanger over my head. I did intend to purse them, and I should certainly have overtaken them before they came to the watch, but my breeches being unbuttoned hindered me. I called to the watch, and said I was robbed by three men, and the watchman said they were just run by him; he asked me if I thought I should know them again, I said, yes; he said go home and change your clothes and follow them, but I thought they would certainly be housed before I could do that. I acquainted Mr. Bowley, the watchmaker in Lombard street with the robbery, and concluded to advertise my watch, with ten guineas reward; he advised me not to advertise it as stole, but as lost, and then I might possibly have it again. I advertised it on Saturday the 25th of May. Mr. Hall seeing the advertisement that morning, went to Mr. Bowley, and told him that such a watch had been offered to him to be pawned to him for three guineas, and he refused to take it in. Mr. Hail's boy found out where the woman lived who pawned it, in <placeName id="t17450710-27-crimeloc164">Scroop's court against St. Andrew's church in Holborn</placeName>

I told her if she did not let me have the watch I would send for a constable, and send her to Bridewell. Then she said she had it of one St. Legar. I found by examining her, that Kelly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174507100018"/> and St. Legar lodged at Cave's house; I sent for a case of pistols, and waited a whole day over against the house, but none of them came. A woman gave intimation to Cave's wife, that Kelly was in trouble about a watch; I had information of a place of resort, and went with a woman to one Raddy's, in Catharine street in the Strand, in order to find out Kelly's wife, for Hall's boy followed the boy Wood *, who came for Kelly's wife. But when they found they were watched, Wood run away, and Kelly's wife was housed at Raddy's. As I was talking, I discovered Wood, and told him I believed he was an accomplice, and if he would not make a discovery, I would take him up.</p>
               <p>* This Wood was in custody upon this account.</p>
               <p>He said, did I rob you, what business have you to take me up? I sent Kelly's wife to the Counter that night, and went to Raddy's again to look after these fellows; and Raddy told me, if you get your watch again, and some part of the money, I believe you will be easy: I said I should be glad to have my watch again, but as to my money I did not expect. I told him by what he had said about the watch, I knew him to be an ill man, and I would take care to get him punished; and he said, master, if I am rightly informed, every part of the money is in Kelly's wife's drawers: I said I would not go about it at that time o'night for fear of being knocked on the head; and I said, if you don't assist me in taking these fellows, and shew some degree of honesty, you shall be punished. He afterwards informed me, that the boy I had taken up [Wood] had the watch. I went to the boy to the Counter, and he told me he had lain upon the ground all night, and I gave him two shillings for his lodging: then he told me the watch was at one

            . I live with Mr. Beasley, in St. Martin's lane. On the 27th of June the Prisoner brought this cream pot to me, and wanted 15 s. upon it. I asked her whose it was, she said it was her own. I told her I did not believe it was her own. Then said she give it me again; No, I said I would not. Then to tell, you the truth, it is my mitress's; I asked who her mistress was, she said, she was a pretty lady, and kept by some Lord. I said I would go and speak to her mistress. No, she said, I should not, she would not disturb the Lord, for she should lose her place if she did. I followed her to a Lord's in St. James's square, where her husband lives, and acquainted him with it; he said she was his wife, but he had no such pot. I took her up, and then she pretended she bought it at the shop of one Mr. Caprio, a silver smith in St. Martin's lane. I went to him, and he said some time ago he sold her a milk pot, but he could not tell whether this was it or not. Sir Thomas would not discharge the warrant, but directed us to advertise it. I advertised it, and Mr. Kahagan came to our house to enquire after it; he said if it was his it had a K upon each foot, ther care three K's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the pot?</p>
               <p>Kahagan. My wife, I believe, bought it. I am not positive whether she did or not; but the pot has been mine these three years.</p>
