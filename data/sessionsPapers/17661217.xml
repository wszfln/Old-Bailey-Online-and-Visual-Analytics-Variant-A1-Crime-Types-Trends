I came through bridge on the first of this instant, about half an hour after ten at night, with a lighter to Paul's-wharf; after I had moored her, coming on shore about eleven o'clock, over Mr. Cousins's craft, I thought I saw something move; I called, who is there; no body answered; coming a little farther, I saw the prisoner in his boat, which lay along-side the craft, and a sack of oats standing on the gunnel of the barge: I said to the prisoner, what are you going to do with this sack of corn; he said, nothing at all, he was only going to get into his boat; at that time his feet were in his boat, and his backside on the side of the barge; I put the sack of corn in its place, and went on shore to a public-house, and staid about ten minutes; Samuel Robinson, was along with me when we were going to go home to Horsleydown. When we were on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170003"/> top of the stair-head, I saw the prisoner pulling the sack, and heard it fall into his boat; then I jumped down, and took hold of the head of his boat, and sent Robinson to call Mr. Cousins's man; then the prisoner said, lend me a hand to chuck the sack in again, there is no harm done as long as the sack is in again; he said he never did such a thing before in his life. Robinson and Mr. Cousins's man came, then we took him in custody; there were four bushels of oats in the sack.</p>

The prosecutor swore to them all; he described the man, but I cannot meet with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Who lived in the house between you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cobb. One Mr. Stevens; a little before Michaelmas, about four months before, I was just come off a journey; my warehouse lies backwards, I was pretty busy, my window looks into the prisoner's garden; I heard a melancholy cry of a child; I looked out at the window, and saw a fellow in a red coat upon a large mulberry-tree in the prisoner's garden, and the deceased girl, about ten years old, standing upon two arms that branch out of the tree, crying; the deceased was in size according to her age, a little girl. I saw the man fastening a cord; I was surprized, seeing the fellow above her. I said, good God! what are you going to murder her; he said no, and came out of the tree; the prisoner was at the foot of the tree, and they all three went into the house; I went into her house, and said, Mrs. Collins, what in the name of God have you been at; I desire you will let me know what the child has done; she said, she is a naughty wicked hussey, she had robbed me; I said, what has she robbed you of; she said, of a handkerchief and a knife; that she went into Whitechapel, and sold them for twopence, and they had brought the girl and things back again; I said, there are other ways of punishing a child than to go to hang her.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Cobb. I believe about three or four in the afternoon; about six or seven weeks ago, my man was opening the shop-window; I came down stairs, and into the street, and saw the child standing at my door, this was a little after six o'clock; she had a bit of bread in her hand.</p>

               <p>P. Stevens. I believe from the beginning of last summer; I have frequently heard cruel blows struck as if it was with sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who gave them, and upon whom?</p>
               <p>P. Stevens. I judge by the prisoner, and upon the child. On last Saturday was a fortnight, between eleven and twelve, my husband called me out into the wash-house, there is a thin partition; I could look through a wicket into her wash-house; the child was under the pump, over a tub of water; (the pump serves us both, it is between us) she struck the child several blows, with either a mop stick or a broom-stick, three or four blows; I saw her do it, seeming to me upon her shoulders; she took the child into the yard, then I could not see, only hear it; we heard blows; my husband and I drummed against the partition as loud as we could; some man said, leave off beating the girl; it is late, correct her to-morrow; you will kill the girl; she kept beating the girl. The prisoner said, d - n her, a b - h, I design it. To the best of my knowledge, I never saw the child but once after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you and your husband call to her?</p>
               <p>P. Stevens. No, we did not, because we would not get abused: the child was never free from bruises.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she when you saw her after that?</p>
               <p>P. Stevens. Her eyes were black.</p>

            . I am one of the searchers belonging to Christ Church, Spitalfields. On Tuesday was se'nnight the 9th of December, Mrs. Collins came to my house, and I was not at home; she left word for me to come and search the child; I went between six and seven o'clock; when I came there, Mrs. Collins was not at home; I could not see the corpse, so I went on the Wednesday, a little after nine in the morning; Mrs. Collins was coming out of the room where the child lay; she said, pray walk this way; the room was very dark, I said, push the shutter open; her son opened it a little; he held the lid of the coffin a little way off the face; I took off the face cloth, I saw no marks on the face; I called for more light, then they opened the shutter a little more; then I stripped the shroud off to the hip bone; it looked very mottled, as is usual in convulsions; upon the two legs were scratches, three upon each leg, about an inch long; I asked Mrs. Collins what it was, she said she supposed she had scratched her legs on her sitting by the fire; I saw nothing more that night. On the lie of the coffin was

            , aged ten years. Mrs. Collins, her son, and I, went into the back room, and brought me a half guinea, and wanted 6 d. out of it to pay for the ground 10 s. she said she would have it buried on the Wednesday night if she could, if not, Thursday night would do. About three hours after that I was sent again, and told the child was murdered; my partner and I went together; the child was taken out of the coffin, and laid on a bed quite naked; Mr. Cobb was there; on the left cheek and eye-brow were black and blue, and the right arm was all raw, as if a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170006"/> blister I'll been upon it; from the elbow to the wrist, it was very black; the carcase was in a very poor condition to be sure. I examined it all ever.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you observed any marks on the shoulder?</p>
               <p>E. Cotton. On the left side the shoulder were two strokes, as if it had been struck with something; it seemed red on the left shoulder like a pair of horns; the bowels over the belly was very green, as is common with convulsions; the back seemed mottled as if the blood had settled, but not like any marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q Did she appear to be in any particular haste to have the body buried?</p>
               <p>E. Cotton. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not it common to have the check black and blue in convulsions.</p>
               <p>E. Cotton. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edington. I am a surgeon; I was called in to examine the body on the Thursday, about nine in the morning; I found on each arm a little erasement on the skin on the left arm, which I imagine of no consequence; the right arm from the elbow to the fingers was in a state of mortification; there were marks of violence upon the elbow, which seemed to be bruises, which I imagine was the occasion of the mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there one or two bruises?</p>
               <p>Edington. Only one bruise; the skin was broke, there was no swelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not open the part?</p>
               <p>Edington. No, I did not; as it was mortified, I apprehend it would have made no discovery; from the appearance, it is my opinion that bruise was the occasion of the mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that have been before it produced a mortification?</p>
               <p>Edington. That is impossible to tell; the shortest time is in 48 hours; that depends upon the habit of the body of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the mortification be longer in coming on a strong healthy person, than a poor weak person?</p>

               <p>Edington. I imagine it would; the skin was off on the upper part of the nose, which was the cause of the blackness of the left eye; there was a little scratch upon the left side, and black and blue spots on the legs, which had the appearance as if they had been blows given by a stick, or something of that kind. I opened the body, and found the internal parts in a fair natural state; the stomach and bowels seemed particularly empty, more so than I had observed any before. I am of opinion, that the mortification was the immediate cause of her death; it seemed to me she might have recovered of the injuries she received, if the mortification had not taken place. I could perceive no bruises to occasion a mortification, except that on her elbow, and that might be by a fall or a blow; I am of opinion it was occasioned by some injury it had received, for where they come by blows or falls, there is an inflammation attends it. Mortifications generally come on by blisters; it had the same appearance as a blister.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing from a bad habit of body, if there is any sore, their handling it, will not the repetition create an inflammation?</p>
               <p>Edington. It may bring on a slight inflammation.</p>
               <p>Alice Stemson. I lodged in Mrs. Collin's house, I came there the last time, on the Thursday before the child died; when I came in on the Thursday night, the child was very much altered; I went out on the Friday to my work, and came home about seven o'clock; Mrs. Collins called me down; the child was washing in the kitchen; she said she had a heavy hand with the child, it had fouled itself; I said to the child, are you in your right senses, how came you to do so; it made no answer. I saw the right-hand had a swelling; I asked it how it came by that; she made no answer. Mrs. Collins said she fell betwixt the two beds over the hair-broom; she said to the child, did you or did you not: the child said, yes. On the Saturday night when I came home, Mrs. Collins came up betwixt six and seven o'clock, and asked a man there to fetch a pennyworth of syrup of saffron; I added, and treacle-water; she said, no: I went for the syrup and brought it to Mrs. Collins; she said it was for the child; the child had been in bed all day; I said I should like to see the child before I went to bed; she said it was in a breathing sweat, and did not care to have it disturbed, so I did not see it, and never heard no more about it till I heard it was dead, which was on the Wednesday; I heard it at Rag fair, before I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask how the child did before the time you heard she was dead?</p>
               <p>A. Stinson. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination she said the child was a weak sickly child, that the child had owned to her she had stole a ribbon; that the prisoner used to strike her with a small cane only; and that she never saw her use the child with any violence; and that by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170007"/> words between the two beds, she meant the two bedsteads.</p>

            . I am a gangsman on Bear-key. On the 10th of Dec. we had some skins at that key; they were opened; I saw the prisoner on the key at that time, he was afterwards stopt about 20 yards from the key, with this wolf's skin; (produced in court) when he was brought to me, I asked him how he came by it; he said a man dropped it and he took it up; I said that was not true; then he went down on his knees and cried, and said, if I would forgive him he would never do so any more; there were such sort of skins as these opened, lying on the wharf.</p>

               <p>I was coming along the key and picked the skin up, and a gentleman that was coming by took and brought me to Mr. Austin.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Islington; I met these four prisoners betwixt three or four in the morning on the 26th of October; I asked them what they were upon. They desired to know whether I chose to have my head knocked about or not; when I had cried the the other end of my walk he turned again within about a hundred yard of Mrs. Lucas's, Hindes had got three bars; I asked him what he had got there; he said he had got nothing, and threw them on the ground, and made off; I took them up; then one of the other said, the watchman has got them let us go back and knock him on the head, and take them from him; with all my heart, said the other, but he has got a good stick in his hand; then they walked off; I went to the other watchman, we went to see for them, but did not see them, till I got in at the Blakeney's-head; there they all four sat; Farrell looked at me and said, have you a mind to have your ears pulled; I said, what do you mean by that; I went out and sent for a constable: Dyer followed me directly; I took hold of him, and said he should not go yet: I took him in and set him down, and said, the first man that stirred I'd knock him down; the constable came; we took them all to Bridewell; then the woman said, let me go back, and I'll shew you where there are three more bars, under a cart or a waggon by a public-house; we secured them, and according to her directions found the other 3 bars. Dyer said, going along, some shall answer for this if I get my liberty; the woman said to Dyer, swear the young man that assisted me was a confederate with us: we carried the bars to Mrs. Lucas's house; there every bar fitted the place they were taken from, (the bars produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Reed. No, I never saw either of them before the prisoner said he had six or seven guineas, and if you can raise any, Gawler can make it up; I went to fetch mine from my lodgings, and Gawler went with me; I produced 31 l. 15 s. 6 d. there was a 36 s. piece, 2 moidores, 21 guineas, 8 half guineas, 2 quarter guineas, and a crown piece; after it was told upon the table, the prisoner said, that is enough, he will yield the wager lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner or Gawler produce any money?</p>
               <p>Reed. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Reed. This was about two in the afternoon; while my money was on the table, I went out to make water, and when I came in again, my money and they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay abroad?</p>
               <p>Reed. I did not stay out above three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>

I met him in Cheapside, on the 20th of October, about ten in the morning; he knew me, and endeavoured to shun me; I ran after him from Cheapside to St. Martin's le grand; there I took him myself, and got him to a constable; the prisoner asked me what I wanted; I said, you are one of the men that robbed me of so much money: there were some linen drapers asked me what money I had lost; I told them as I have here; I described the crown piece, by being bent a little on the edge on one side; the prisoner pulled out seven guineas, one 27 s. piece, and a crown piece, such a one as I described; I knew it to be my property; it had been my mother's, and I had carried it in my pocket ten years; (the money produced in court.) This crown piece is my property; at that time the prisoner said he never was in my company, but before Sir

               <p>Casson. He never varied in that; he said he put it down on the table, and went out for about three or four minutes, and when he came in, the men were all gone, and his money too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my council.</p>
               <p>Court. Your council cannot speak for you; you must do that yourself, if you have any thing to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all of the money, not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Turner. My husband keeps the White Hart and Shoulder of Mutton alehouse, in Brooks-market; there were four men came into our house; I really cannot say the day, it might be some time in October; they went out, I thought they all went away together; one of them came in, and said, he had lost his money; at first he said he had lost upwards of 40 l. then 35 l. then 25 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>E. Turner. He was in liquor; he said he had laid it down on the table, and the other men had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. What room were they in?</p>
               <p>E. Turner. They were in a little room by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the Justice, what did he say he lost there?</p>
               <p>E. Turner. I was; there he said he lost upwards of 30 l. 15 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner, do you know him?</p>
               <p>E. Turner. I do not recollect him; they were all strangers to me.</p>

               <p>E. Turner. They had had a shilling's worth of brandy and water; they paid me as they went out.</p>
               <p>- Beckley. One day in October, about three in the afternoon, I was at work in my stall, and heard a young woman say to the prosecutor, who do you want; he said, I came out of the house, and I cannot find my way in again; she directed him; presently I heard a woman say, a man had lost his money; he came out and said to me, the men had ran away with his money; so I took him into my stall, and there he slept; I believe the first time he came out was to make water.</p>

On the 23d of October, between seven and night in the morning, the boy at the bar came and took a loaf out of the window (I am servant to the prosecutor) and set it on a basket; then he came to me for the ash-tub; he took the tub and loaf, and away he went; I told my master of it, and he followed him immediately.</p>

               <p>The young man brought me a loaf, and desired to leave it with me till he called again; he did not call for several days; at last he called, and asked me if I wanted a loaf, and said, I should have it for a groat, which I gave him; three or four days after he brought another, and left it, which I gave him the same price for; that I think was on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170016"/> Tuesday, and I think on the Friday following his master followed him; I did not handle it; he asked where the loaf was; the boy turned, and gave him it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brady.

I said, Thompson, you are an honest fellow; have you any credit; he said, no; I told him, he should go to my draper, and I would give him 10 l. credit; I look upon him to be as honest a creature as can be.</p>

I got a search warrant, and went to his lodgings in Cow-cross, at the house of one Kelley.

I told Mrs. Kelley she must go along with us; I took her to Sir John Fielding's office, and she and Coleman were committed to New-Prison; when we were in the coach I said to Coleman, you had better tell where the rest of the things are; he said, two coats and a waistcoat were pawned near Ludgate-hill, in Black-friars, and another coat at the bottom of Leather-lane<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170017"/> I found the coat; and in Black-friars I found the two coats and one waistcoat; the prisoner owned he took the things a little after four in the morning.</p>

On the Monday the pawnbroker and soldier were before Justice Kelynge, and the things were all there; he was asked what he had to say for himself; he said, nothing at all.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner six years; he lodged at my house about five days and a half; he lay in a house of mine, within two doors of the house where I live; he came to my house on the Friday about twelve at noon; he said, I want the key of my room where I lie; my wife was not at home; he went out and came in again; then he brought the things found in my room, (mentioning them) and said, Landlord, I give you these things to your charge, when I call for them I shall expect to have them of you; I said, very well, you shall have them when you call for them, I laid them on the bed where my children lie; they lay there about 29 or 30 hours; I never spoke a word to my wife or any body else about them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he came by them?</p>
               <p>Kelly. He said he bought them in rag-fair for 12 s.</p>

               <p>Kelly. I desire to ask your Lordship or the Jury, whether I knew any thing of these cloaths coming into my house or no; I do a great many things to get a bit of bread; I sell things and carry a chair.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way was you going?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. I was going towards Pancras; I perceived them when we were within about 20 yards of each other; Walker took a pistol from under his jacket; they came up to me together; Walker said, Sir, your money; gentlemen, said I, I have very little money, I hope you will not take what I have from me; Walker said, Sir, your life; I said, that will do you no service; then he said, your money or life directly; I said, gentlemen, if that is your resolution, I will give it you, and put my hand in my pocket, and gave him 5 s. it was 3 shillings and 4 sixpences; in my delivering it, there was a sixpence dropped on the ground; he seemed to show it to Johnson in his hand; then he put it into his pocket; I still stood in the same position, and so did they both, side by side; seeing me, he presented his pistol to me again, and said, Sir, your watch; I said, gentlemen, I hope you will not take my watch, I have had it a good many years; Sir, said Walker, your life then; I said as before, that will be of no service to you; then he said, your watch or life directly; then I took and gave it him; when so done, he pointed the pistol, and said go that way, that was to proceed the way I was going.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Johnson do?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. Johnson never said a word during the whole; he only stood by the other; I believe I went on about 30 yards towards London; then I began to consider what to do; I looked either way, and saw no body coming; then I turned back after them; then I began to think they might have laid themselves in ambush at the bridge for some body else; I went on, and saw nobody there; then I met the old gentleman that I had met before, with a little bundle under his arm; I told him I had been robbed, since I met him, by 2 men; said he, they just passed me; I said, will you assist me; he seemed not to be willing; then I went on, till I came to the Black Horse, and asked if any body had come there; they said no; then I went to the next public-house, and there enquired, and found no body; I proceeded down the town as fast as I could; I met a man, and said, have you met two men, I had been robbed by two men; then a young man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170019"/> near us said, Sir, I saw two men just now, they had like to have run against a ladder which I had; then we agreed to see if we could find them, and in our hurry we had overshot the Angler; another man seeing me going in, he pushed and went in with me; the prisoner Walker had just had a dram at the bar; the other was going to have one; Walker pushed towards the door; I had a pretty large stick in my hand; I struck at him, but missed him; I took hold of him, and said, if you stir you are dead, as you said to me just now, and challenged him with being the person that had just robbed me; he said, Sir, I acknowledge it, I am the person, and I will not resist in the least; I will surrender myself, and I crave your mercy; at that very instant Johnson was ready to come out; he was rather behind the door; Mr. Hale took hold of him; I said, down with him, knock him down, this is one, and he is the other; upon that Mr Hale kicked his heels up, and threw him against a settle; he was obstreperous, but in a minute's time the other two men came in and assisted Mr. Hale; we searched them; Johnson had the pistol upon him; it was taken from him in the house with some difficulty; he had hold of it at the time; Mr Hale took it from him; it was loaded two fingers deep; they had 4 s. and 6 d. upon them, which they said was all they had; the next morning a sixpence was found sticking in the ground edge-ways, where they robbed me; the watch and money were found upon Walker (the money, three shillings and three sixpences, and a pistol, produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. When you first met them, did you see their persons, so as to be able to know them again, if nothing had happened?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. Yes, I believe I could have known Walker again, Johnson rather held his head down; I knew them again when I found them at the alehouse; I am certain they are the two men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Johnson say after he was taken?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. He said very little, and cried; when we were in the coach, going to prison, Johnson desired he might be run through; he said we must both die, meaning Walker and himself.</p>
               <p>Q. fro m Johnson. Whether I was not a-head of Walker, when you met Walker?</p>
               <p>Jarvis. Johnson was rather first, but they stood a-breast, facing me, during the whole time.</p>

I went to enquire his character, but could not find any such person that he recommended me to. The next morning Mr. Wood missed his things; I went up into the room, and looked about for the prisoner's bundle, and I found a bundle of hay-bands put behind a hamper; I saw no more of him till I saw him in Wood-street Compter on the 5th of November; I asked him if he knew me; he said he knew nothing of me; I said I knew him very well, he was the person that I wanted; I said, look at me again; do you not know Mrs. Hickman, where you left the hay-bands; he said again he knew nothing of me; here are the hay-bands; (producing a large quantity in a handkerchief) he had a great coat on, what he carried out must be under that.</p>

               <p>Lane. (He takes it in his hand, and compares them together;) the words sterling are remarkably alike; to be sure, the writing is very much alike; I firmly believe this bill to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Merrick. I know Capt. Johnson of the 24th regiment, I have been many years acquainted with him, I have seen him write.</p>

I am servant to Mrs. Bird, I saw the prisoner and two other women come in; they asked for a pint of purl, I went and draw'd it; the prisoner looked in my face, and said there is no uproar yet, there is nothing missed; I said, what should be missed; she said there are many things lost that are not missed; this was about a quarter of an hour after they had been in for the drams; I saw them come in for the drams, and saw my mistress tie up her purse, and put it into her pocket as she went along; I saw the prisoner push White against her, and push her against a man (a stranger;) as my mistress was falling, the prisoner stepped towards her, and the man catched my mistress in his arms.</p>

I had brushed the shirt-buckles and things in a drawer that stood just by the broken pane, but the morning before: I missed out of that drawer, to the best of my knowledge, either fourteen or fifteen shirt-buckles; I am clear to six gold ones, and about nine silver ones, and two silver stock-buckles; we found a piece of the broken glass close by the drawer; that drawer was always uncovered; Mr. Dealtry made a hook of wire, and I saw him try through the broken glass, and he easily could come at the things in the drawer.

               <p>Mr. Barnes. I live in Duck-lane, I am a watchmaker, and keep a silversmith's shop; on Friday the 28th of November I was at work at my window; I saw the two prisoners come up to it between two and three in the afternoon; soon after that I observed two more; the prisoners came up towards that part where I was at work; the other two kept their heads close to the shew-glasses; I had some suspicion of them; I sent my daughter out to see if the glasses were safe; she came and said one was broke, and some things taken out; Miller stared me full in the face; I went over the counter; Doyle went off; I took Miller at the end of the lane; he was walking fast, but did not run; as soon as I got him to the door, Doyle came again, and said, Lord! what is the matter; I knowing him, said, you are the other; and I took hold of him, and pushed him into the shop, and sent for a constable; when he came, Miller took out his handkerchief, and laid it on the ground, and said, that is my handkerchief and gloves, there can be nothing in that; now search me, and welcome. The constable searched one of his pockets, and found nothing in it. Miller took his handkerchief from the ground, and put it into his left-hand coat-pocket; there was a woman in the shop; she said, she heard something rattle in his handkerchief, search the handkerchief; upon that, he took his handkerchief by one corner, and strove to take it out of his pocket; the constable took hold of it; I saw this shagreen case here produced; I said, how came you by this case; said he, I bought it; I said, what trade are you; he said, a blacksmith; I said, blacksmiths do not buy such things as these by the dozen; I gave them into the care of the constable. Upon searching Doyle, there were two pair of buckles found upon him, one silver, the other iron plated; by enquiring among the shops, I was informed, Mr. Dealtry had lost some buckles; I went to him; he said, his wife could describe them, she having the care of that part of his business; he sent her; she described the buckles before she saw them, that we had in the shagreen case, and said, she had lost more; before the Lord-Mayor Miller said, he found the case and buckles behind a gutter in Cornhill, when he went to make water.</p>

            , Esq; On the 4th of November I went to the Bedford Arms, about six in the afternoon, and between seven and eight I left it; the man that keeps the house took the number of the prisoners chair, (they are <rs id="t17661217-36-deflabel195" type="occupation">chairmen</rs>

               <p>Q. Where did you direct them to carry you?</p>
               <p>Scott. I cannot say to where, but I believe it was to go to Mr. Couts's, in the Strand; they carried me to one Dugens's, a grand punch-house, a notorious house, and a robbing house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober enough to know where you was?</p>
               <p>Scott. I was fuddled, but I know I was sober enough to know where they carried me; when I got into the house, they had punch there, and I drank some of it, and I suppose I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room with you?</p>
               <p>Scott. The prisoners were, and no body else; one of them sat close by me; I have swore three times to the men, and I know them.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at them again. (He looks at them.)</p>
               <p>Scott. Upon my conscience I cannot recollect that fellow in the red waistcoat (the man in the red waistcoat was Broaders) as one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Scott. I will not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Scott. I suppose I staid there an hour, or an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your getting into the chair to go away, or how did you go away?</p>
               <p>Scott. I do not know how I went away from that house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find yourself after that?</p>
               <p>Scott. I did not find myself at all, the watchman found me in a gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. What company had you been in at the Bedford Arms?</p>
               <p>Scott. There were not above three.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bowls had you?</p>
               <p>Scott. That does not matter; I had in my pocket ten guineas, or ten guineas and a half in gold, in a green common purse, and some silver in my pocket, and a gold watch; they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss them?</p>
               <p>Scott. When I got to my lodgings, about one o'clock at night; the watchman called a chair, and they carried me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the chair?</p>
               <p>Scott. I did not; I had lost every thing, I could not; I lost a handkerchief also; it was a remarkable one; (producing one) it was the fellow to this. I went to Sir

               <p>Scott. I was about half seas over.</p>

               <p>Scott. Very like so.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the place you was carried to?</p>
               <p>Scott. I cannot say a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect how you came out of that dreadful house you talk of?</p>
               <p>Scott. Upon my honour I do not recollect; I think they would not leave me there without carrying me somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Council. People, when they are in liquor, are sometimes very obstinate.</p>
               <p>Scott. I was robbed I am sure, but do not know where.</p>

I went out, and in at the Red Lion, and had a pint of beer; before I had drank it, my partner called me; Mr. Scott was in the chair again; I asked him where he was to go to; he said, to Malby's bagnio; we carried him there; I rang at the bell; he went in for about eight or ten minutes; the waiter said, they would not take him in; so he came out again, and went into the chair. I asked him where I was to carry him then; he said, carry me to a girl's lodging in Charles-street; we carried him there, and rang the bell; he came out of the chair, and went into the passage: a girl came and said, her mistress was not at home; he broke one of my glasses when he came out; he then asked me if I knew of any girls; I said, no; he walked away; I asked him to pay me; he said he would not; I walked after him, and pulled off my hat; he said he would give me something to drink; this was in Russel-street, at the end of a court; there were four or five girls; I asked him again to pay me, and said, I wanted to go; I said, there is never a public-house here; we went into a public-house in King's-court; the first bowl that came he spilt; then he called for another shilling's worth; he paid for them, and came out with us. I asked him to have the chair to go to Mr. Stacey's house again, or go home to his lodgings; he said, no, I will not; go along, you are paid. I asked him again; he said, go about your business; I came away, and put my chair to rights, and carried a fare from the play to the Cave bagnio; then my partner and I went in at the Red Lion, and staid till between eleven and twelve o'clock; then we went out, and my partner, in examining the chair, found this handkerchief in it, and he put it in his pocket.</p>

I said, Sir, you are in liquor, you had better go home; I carried him to one or two places more; they would not take him in; then I said, I will carry you back to the Round-house again; accordingly I did; then the constable desired me to carry him to Mr. Couts's, the banker; I carried him there, and knocked at the door; the man came, and desired him to give his name; he said his name was Scott; he opened the door.

            . On Monday the 24th of November, about half an hour after six in the evening, I was going home from Stratford in a postchaise, and before I came to the two mile stone, the prisoner at the bar came up on the left side of me on horseback, and bid my man stop; it was dark, we had no light but what came from the lamps on the road; my man paid no regard to him, but drove on; in about an hundred yards. he came up with the man again, and presented a pistol, and bid him stop; I saw his hand in that direction, but did not see the pistol; I saw his face by the light of the lamp, we were on that side which the lamps were; the second time he bid the man stop, there appeared two men on the left side, on the bank, whether they belonged to him I do not know; then I let down one of the windows, and called to the man to stop, and called to the prisoner, and said, what do you want my friend; he answered, your money and your watch. I bid him come round to the side window, and I let down that also; he came; I said, what do you say friend; your life or your money, said he; he came close, and said, don't detain me, don't keep me here, make haste. I had an intention of taking him myself, but seeing the two men, I put my hand in my pocket and dropped some of my money, and as I thought kept some halfpence in my hand, and the dollar which I gave him; his right-hand was leaning over the neck of his horse, with the pistol in it. Whether he looked at the money or how, I cannot tell, but he said, this is not enough, give me some more; I told him I had no more, but I had a watch if he chose it; he refused it; then he bid me a good night, and went away: he was pursued by a person that was on horseback behind the chaise; he turned back, and alarmed the watch at the turnpike, at Mile-end: I heard of him in about an hour after I got home; I did not go to him that night, but did the next morning; he was in the watch-house at Mile-end; I swore to his person, and am very positive that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be by the side of the coach?</p>
               <p>Cope. About five minutes, or not quite so much; I could see his face very plain by the lamp; I could not speak to the colour of his cloaths, I thought he had something white before him.</p>

            . On the 24th of November I was going to Stratford, betwixt six and seven o'clock in the evening; I came up to the chaise, but did not know that Mr. Cope was in it. I rode behind it; it was a very dark night; I saw the prisoner at the bar pass me two or three times, while I was riding after the chaise; I took him to be a little boy; (note, the prisoner was a very small deformed person) I saw he had something buckled before him, which proved afterwards to be a great coat; I saw him go up to Mr. Cope's man, and bid him stop; he not complying directly, went up to him again, and said, stop, or I will blow your brains out; I did not see the pistol at first; immediately I thought it the best I could do to return back. I met a watchman conducting a gentleman along; I said, a gentleman had been robbed just before; then he said he would go back with me; before we got quite up to the chaise, we met the prisoner, he came close by me; I knew him again, he was upon a low horse, and sat very comically on the horse; I am sure it was the same person; I said to the gentleman, that was the same man: accordingly the watchman alarmed with his rattle, and frightned my horse; I desired him to stop the rattle, which he did. The watchman asked the turnpike man whether such a man had gone through; he said, no. While we were talking, in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came riding through; I said, that was he, so they stopped him: he was searched, and a pistol found upon him: I was near the lamp when I saw him first, and was within two or three yards of him; I could swear to him by his face, as well as by his appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. What money was found upon him?</p>
               <p>Sangunetty. There were some halfpence and a shilling found upon him, but no dollar; the pistol was loaded, and there was a charge of powder, and two or three balls.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170033"/>Q. Did you know him to be the same person you had been shewn before?</p>
               <p>Manley. I believe he was the same, but I cannot swear to his face, but as to his appearance it was the same. He had a shilling in his pocket; Mr. Sangunetty said he had pistols, and bid me take care, so I quitted my own horse and took him to the turnpike-house; I found a pistol loaded with powder and ball, and three more balls and powder, and one flint, and 1 s. 4 d. in halfp ence found upon him; there was no dollar.</p>

            . I am one of the collectors of the turnpike. Mr. Sangunetty came up to the gate, and said there as a highwayman on the road; while we were talking, a person said this is he, and he was soon takes; I went to see who it was; I clapped my hand to his pocket and took out this pistol; (a pocket pistol produced in court) the prisoner said, take care of it, it is loaded; I endeavoured to snap it, but it would not go off; he was charged with the fact by Mr. Sangunetty, the next morning we had him before the bench of Justices.</p>

I took them both before my Lord-Mayor, who sent them to Newgate. They both denied it; they pulled me about ten yards from the place where my handkerchief was taken away, and a gentlewoman took that up and gave it to me. When I charged them, they asked me to go to a tavern and drink a pint of wine, and said it was the first time they had been accused of any thing of that sort.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they appear to be new or decayed old boards?</p>
               <p>Saunders. They appeared to be decayed old boards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilmot. Dennet was made grave-digger, and after that steeple-keeper: I believe he had the care of all the keys of the church.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he key of the vault?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. He had. I received a letter on the 1st of this instant, from an unknown hand; I thought it my duty to acquaint the church-wardens with the contents of it, that they might take such measures as they thought proper. One Mr. Tapper, an undertakes and carpenter, and I, went with the two church-wardens; we waited in the church while Mr. Tapper went down in the vault with the prisoner Dennet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the vault that was lately on fire?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. It was on fire the Saturday morning following.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had no other persons the key to that vault but Dennet?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. I do not know that any body had besides him.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not other people go down in it?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. I make no doubt but that other people might; but I cannot charge my memory that that vault was made use of to inter any body in my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a poor grave-digger was digging a grave in a church-yard, should you have thought the old nails in old bits of coffin boards were the perquisites of the man, or should you have called him to an account for it?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. I should never have called him to an account for that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Dennet lived in the parish?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. I believe he has been the chief part of his life in our parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any charge of this nature of him before?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the key of the church plate?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. I never knew to the contrary but that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. What has his character been since you have known him?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. I never heard any thing against his character, as to his dishonesty; I have heard of his negligence touching his business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Newcomb?</p>
               <p>Wilmot. I have known him two years.</p>

            . I went and searched into this vault, I believe on the 4th of this inst. Dennet and I went into it together; I was ordered by the church-wardens to see if any coffin was deficient; I found one lying at the farther end, appeared very fresh; I looked upon the plate, and found it was buried in August 1766; I said, I never saw a coffin finished so oddly in my life. I looked a little closely on the top of it, and said, surely, Charles, here has been some nails taken out of this coffin; he said, he believed not: I found there were nails gone out of the edge of the lid; I said to him, you see the print of every nail head where they have been taken out, as regular as they were knocked in, and I saw the inside row on the top was taken out; there were three rows in all taken out. Dennet said, I hope, master, you will not take any notice of this, for it will hurt me; coming out of the vault, there were three or four coffins higher up; I shewed him them and said, you see here has been the same work here; that was one that died in the year 1765, there were a great many nails taken out of the edge of that: he desired me to report favourable, that the vault was in tolerable good order. These were brass nails that were missing.</p>

               <p>Tapper. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the Jury all he said when he desired you to report favourable; did he tell you how it would hurt him?</p>
               <p>Tapper. No, he did not tell me how it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had taken them himself?</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not say there were other vaults to be searched, and desire you to look into them?</p>
               <p>Tapper. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Tapper. I am an undertaker.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know the nails had been taken out?</p>

I was sent for on the 29th of October, by Justice Durden; the messenger told me there was some lead stolen, which was supposed to be mine; I looked about my house, not having missed any, and found there was a piece of the bottom of a leaden pipe taken away; I went to the Justice's, and there I found a piece of a pipe that I believe to be mine; it was like the other pipes belonging to the house, there was something particular in the shape of it; the prisoner was there; he said he found it.</p>

            . On the 26th or 28th of October I was drinking with the prisoner till about five or six in the evening, at the Cow and Calf on Chelsea Common; he went out from me; after that I went to his lodgings; his wife told me he was not come home; coming back I met him with this lead on his shoulder, about 100 or 150 yards from his lodging; I asked him to go back to the Cow and Calf; he said, let me throw this away, and I'll go with you; the man along with me took it, and carried it into the house; I saw it was a pipe of lead; when we got in at the Cow and Calf, I challenged him with stealing it from Mrs. Mitchell, where he worked; he denied it at first, and said they gave it him instead of his money for his work; then he took it to his lodgings, and I went and acquainted a person with it, and he sent for the lead, and the prisoner to be brought to him; after that he was taken before the Justice, and committed; the next morning Mrs. Mitchell came before the Justice and owned the lead, (produced in court) there is four feet all but three inches of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. This was about two in the afternoon or a quarter after; he asked me if I knew one Whitaker a Marshalsea court officer; he asked me to sit down by him, which I did; I told him I had known Mr. Whitaker some years, but I had not seen him for about six months; he said, does he belong to the Marshalsea court now or not; I said I do not know, he has been gone out of this neighbourhood 5 or 6 years; he said he believed he could hear of him at Longbottom's in Great Russel-street, Seven Dials; he staid about a quarter of an hour, and kept me in talk; after he was gone, I had some business up stairs; I asked my wife for the key of the room, when I came to open the door the lock was unlocked, it was only upon the spring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the house?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. I did; my tap-room goes into a passage that communicates to the street, and the stairs that go up into my room, the passage goes out into another court; the passage has no communication with the tap-room at all, the stairs go up on the same side of the passage as the tap-room door does, more towards the back court; that is the only stair-case belonging to my house, the passage is always open except at night, when I shut it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door at the bottom of the stairs?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. There is, but that door was not shut I believe at that time; my wife told me she had double lock'd the door but a little before; when I came to open the drawers, I found there was five of them open, and the locks were all spoiled; every farthing of my money was gone, 20 l. and upwards, boxes and all; one that I kept my silver in, and the other my gold; as near as I can recollect there was 12 guineas, 4 half guineas, one 9 s. piece, one 6 s. and 9 d. piece, a 5 s. and 3 d. and 5 l. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the money last?</p>
               <p>Lathaby. I had seen it in the boxes not an hour and a half before, there was my watch, table spoons, punch ladle, and other things of value, but nothing of that were meddled with; then I went up to Sir

His house is upon Maze-pond, Southwark; he desired me to set my hand to this paper; he said, it was a thing of no consequence, only a form; he said, any indifferent person might do it, and as I was a neighbour, he called me in; upon that, I witnessed it, and delivered it to Mr. Orton in his counting house.</p>

               <p>Q. to Duck. Take the letter of attorney in your hand; can you take upon you to say, that is the very paper that Mr. Orton produced to you to sign?</p>
               <p>Duck. This is my hand-writing I know; this is the paper that Mr. Orton gave me, and I wrote my name there, that I am sure of.</p>

               <p>Duck. He called me in from my work; when I came into the counting-house, he said, Mr. Duck, I have got a letter of attorney here to sign; it is a thing of no consequence, any indifferent person may do it, thereupon I wrote my name, and left the paper on his desk in his counting-house, and went away to work.</p>


               <p>Q. Was the sheet open or doubled up?</p>

               <p>Duck. No, I did not; he said, it was a letter of attorney for him to collect rents, and I understood myself only as a witness to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any seal upon it?</p>
               <p>Duck. I did not, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a name underneath when you wrote your's?</p>

He came to me in the dusk of the evening, on the 13th of November, and said, dame Duck, come and go to my wife, for I think she is fetching her last breath; I went with him; I asked him what she ailed; he said she had an ague and fever; after that I asked him again, and he said, indeed it is a miscarriage; I said, where have you been all day; he said, at home; I said, why did you not come to me sooner, and I would have fetched three or four, or half a dozen women; he said, she would not let him come for any body; this was as we went along; he went in, and up stairs, and I followed him; he held his face cross his wife's face, and said, Lord have mercy on me, my wife is dead!</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the house beside you and he?</p>
               <p>M. Duck. There were only he and I, and his five children. I took hold of her hand, it was very cold.</p>

I said, give me a handkerchief and I'll tie up her jaw; I did: I turned myself round, and saw a half butter firkin set under the bed; I pulled it out; there I saw a child, which frighted me very much; I then went and fetched some other women, and four of us laid her out; after that I took the child out of the tub, and laid it on a blanket and cleaned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at that time?</p>
               <p>M. Duck. He was below stairs; I took a chamber-pot full of water out of the tub, and I believe there was about half another in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you first took notice of the child?</p>
               <p>M. Duck. He was gone down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him when you went to fetch the other women?</p>
               <p>M. Duck. No, I did not say a word to him; we neither of us asked him any questions about it; we examined the child, it was a girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it full grown?</p>
               <p>M. Duck. I think it was, it had nails and hair; there were no marks of violence upon it; the child was parted the same as if a midwife had parted it, and all were in the tub together; then we went down stairs and left the man below, and said nothing to him; after we were out at the door he desired me to go and send one George, a cobler; I went, he not being at home, I went and got a woman to be with him; I went with the woman; he said, that will be of no service at all to be here to night; then we went away, and left him and the five children in the house; he came and fetched the woman in the morning: I went there about ten or eleven in the morning, to help the woman to wash the linen; I had laid the child by the woman, and there I found it; he was then gone to church to get leave of the parish to bury them. On the Saturday or Sunday, as he sat in my house, I asked him if the child was born alive; he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they buried?</p>
               <p>M. Duck. The child and woman were both buried on the Sunday; the woman was a stranger; I never saw her but once before, and never spoke to her in my life.</p>

            . I have no more to say than what has been said; I never spoke to the prisoner, or was in the house afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roberts. I am a surgeon. On the 25th of November I was sent for by the officers of the parish, and the coroner, to meet him at Mims; there were various reports that the woman and child were murdered; I believe this was seven or eight days after the woman and child had been buried; they had taken the woman and child up; the child was laid under the bellfry, I believe the name of the place they call the bone-house: I examined it; all the jury were with me; I opened the chest, and separated the lungs from the other part, and suspended them in water; it is generally imagined, that in case they sink, they have been no ways inflated, or received the air; they swam upon the surface of the water, but I believe they barely had received air they were so triflingly inflated; I blowed into them afterwards, to convince the jury of what a deal of difference there was, when they had received a due portion, and when they had received little or none.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion about this experiment?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I am not always quite satisfied as to that; from my own knowledge and experience I cannot positively declare, that the child was born alive; as Mrs. Duck mentioned at that time, that every thing was done as if by a midwife, I expected to see every thing was so done; but when I came to inspect that, there were four or five hand breadths of the navel-string left; an effusion of blood might happen from that, which might destroy the child; the end of it seemed to me to be rather torn than cut: that is a circumstance that should be paid due regard to, in every child that is born.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence upon it?</p>
               <p>Roberts. No, there were not. I was desired likewise to inspect the body of the woman; there were no marks of violence on the body, nor no bad appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a sufficient quantity of water as has been mentioned here to drown a child?</p>

               <p>I was bad 3 weeks, and my wife was bad a fortnight, with the fever and ague; we nursed one another as well as we could; she was worse that day, being the Thursday, than any day; I had had a pair of shoes of a shoemaker, and a bottle of stuff, which he sells for a pain in the side; I took 30, 40, 45 drops at a time; he said it would do my wife good; it had done me good; I gave her a few drops of it in a little tea; she thought herself better, after that she thought herself worse; then she desired me to make her a little gin hot; I got some, and gave her a dram of cold gin; she was very bad; I said, shall I fetch any body; no, she said, she was a stranger in the place: I asked her again; she would not have any body sent for; she grew worse and worse. In about an hour after she drank the gin she miscarried; I said, dear heart, what is the reason you did not tell me of all this; why did you not tell me you was in labour; said she, I shall be very well, hold your tongue, I am as well as if I had 20 women here, I have done all the work myself; the chamber-pot was full by the bed-side; I was not in the room at the time of her labour; I was with the children below; she desired me to bring up something to empty the pot in, and I carried up a half butter firkin which she used to wash in; if there was any water in it, it was but a trifle: she grew so ill that I could not understand what she said; then I went for Mrs. Duck; I came from the same parish to that house, but I am quite a stranger there; that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170047"/> place is five miles distance from where I came from.</p>

               <p>Q. to Duck. How did the prisoner's children appear?</p>
               <p>Duck. They were very well, hearty and clean, for a poor man's children; they looked as if they had been taken care of; the prisoner behaved well when he was a boy; I knew him a child, but I had not seen him for 26 years, till he came to that place.</p>

I asked him what he sold it for; he said for half a guinea; (it cost us a guinea) we got a search-warrant, and went to Mr. Faulkner's on the Tuesday morning; he keeps a little shop; there appeared to be several bags of cotton or wool, I cannot tell properly what shop to call it; it is in Black-Swan-alley, at the bottom of Garlick-hill; we met with Mr. Faulkner; I told him I was informed, he had bought a piece of hessian, that was stolen from us the Saturday night before; he said there was a piece brought to him on the Saturday night, but he did not buy it; he only advanced 14 s. upon it; I asked him to let me see the piece; he stepped backwards and brought it; I looked at it, and saw it was marked with the same mark, as other hessians are that we had by us, the maker's mark; ( a piece produced in court) I believe this to be ours, but I cannot positively swear to it; then I ordered the constable to serve the warrant upon him, and he was taken before the Alderman at Guildhall; then he said he advanced 14 s. upon it; the other prisoner declared he sold it him for 14 s. before Mr. Faulkner's face; Faulkner said he knew Atchinson was our servant, and that he had sold him ropes for our use; we make use of ropes in putting them round cases and bails.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Atchinson lived with you?</p>
               <p>Alderson He lived with us four or five years, and I looked upon him as to be as honest a man as any in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see ropes in Faulkner's shop?</p>
               <p>Alderson. I did not see a rope there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he immediately produce the piece upon your asking him to see it?</p>
               <p>Alderson. He did; but stopped a few paces back, and took it out of a place, which I thought was a place of concealment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bagley. I served the warrant on the 28th of October. Mr. Alderson and his man went with me; Mr. Alderson asked Mr. Faulkner, if he had not bought a piece of hessian-cloth on the Saturday night; he answered, no, he had not bought it, but your man brought a piece here, and told me he bought it for his own family's use, and desired me to lend him so much money upon it, which he said he did, I think it was 14 s. he said this is the piece, and took it from off a half sack of cotton, and laid it before him, and said, I expected him here before now, to come to fetch it away; Mr. Alderson looked at the piece, and desired I would serve the warrant; I told Mr. Faulkner he was my prisoner; he said he would find bail: Mr. Alderson went away; then we went to Guildhall and had a hearing; but I was on the outside the door, and did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What does Mr. Faulkner deal in?</p>
               <p>Bagley. He deals in cottons, and has it spun in the country; he serves tallow-chandlers and lamp-lighters with cotton-yarn.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of credit?</p>
               <p>Bagley. I am pretty sure he is trusted with thousands, and tens of thousands of pounds worth of goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words Mr. Alderson made use of?</p>

When I looked into the body of the warrant at the alehouse, I said, God bless me, I have known the man 12 years; well, said he, if he is an honest man, he will give us the piece without making us search for it, and he gave us the piece without any hesitation.</p>

I said, what security can I have for it; said he, if you are afraid of your money I'll leave this piece; I put my hand in my pocket, and had no more than 14 s. which I very readily gave him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Walford. I have known Faulkner between eight and nine years, I live in the same parish that he lives in; he bears a very good character. It never was impeached, and the general opinion of him in the neighbourhood now is, that he is an honest man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Greenwood. I have known him about five years, he has a very good character; I never heard the least imputation on his character, he has goods to the amount of several hundred pounds; I believe two thousand pounds at this time, belonging to me; was it ten I should not be in the least doubt about it; he is a very honest, sober, industrious man, a person one can conside in.</p>

The prosecutor is an acquaintance of mine; he told me what had happened; I went with him to the room where he said he had lost his money, there he found the girl; I asked her why she did not deliver the money back; she said, what she got was her own, if there had been ten times more: I said, you had better return it, or I will have you before your betters; she said, I don't care for that, you may do your best and your worst. We went down to Justice Welch, and left a man in care of the door, and when we came back, she was gone; we were after her all that day, and could not find her; this passed on for two months; after that, an acquaintance of mine told me where she was; we went and took her in St. Giles's; then I asked her, if she would make the affair up; she said she would not; then said I, you must go to some other place; I said to the constable, take her to the round-house; she lay there all night, and the next morning Mr. Welch committed her to Bridewell; before the Justice she said she had the 5 s. 3 d. but that the young fellow gave it her, and that he gave her 4 s. in silver besides; he owned there he gave her the 4 s. but not the 5 s. 3 d. piece; she said the other girl had the half guinea.</p>

I went to the pastry-cook's, and got a giblet-pye and a neat's-tongue, and we had our supper, and three or four pots of half-and-half, and four or five half pints of gin; then he would have another pot of twopenny hot; the old man was waiting in the public-house; when I came there, he asked me how the young man behaved; I told him he gave me a 5 s. 3 d. piece; he asked me to give him something to drink; so I carried the half-and-half home; the other girl told me he gave her half a guinea while I was gone, and she was to return him some change out of it, but she would not return any; he came in the morning, and knocked at the door; I let him in, and sent for half a pint of gin; then he drank it; he wanted something out of the 5 s. 3 d. I said I had not much left, and I would keep what I had; he said, if you will not give me something out of it, I will go and fetch some body that shall make you; he went and fetched that man; then they asked me for the whole money again, and I would not give it them.</p>

I am a waterman; I was looking out for a fare about nine or ten months ago, about twelve at night; the prisoner and Buckey went into my boat; I went into her to stop them; they took my boat by force, and threatened to throw me overboard if I attempted to stop them; then they rowed over, and up the shore on the other side the water, between Horsleydown and Pickleberring; they went into a long-boat, and took me away with the boat, and threatened to drown me if I resisted; they lifted up the tarpaulin, and took out a sack, and put it in my boat, and brought it on shore at St. Catharine's; as they were carrying it up from the boat, some how or other it spilt; there came an officer, and said there had been some roguery, by seeing oats lying about; they were almost all shot out; I do not know what they did with the oats that were not scattered; we were all suffered to go away that night.</p>

            . I was a servant to Mr. Fox on the 3d of October; after master and mistress were gone to bed, at about eleven, the maid and the boy and I were up; there was company up stairs; after they had paid their recconing and were gone, I went to go to bed, and left the prisoner below stairs, that was about one o'clock; the boy told me, he saw the prisoner trying to open the till; I not hearing her come up, I leaned over the ballusters; I saw her go into the bar, and presently heard the till creak, and in about a minuet the till fell down; it made a great noise of halfpence falling about.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is the till from the ground?</p>
               <p>Salmon. It was about breast high.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see her when she was in the bar?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No, I could not; there was then no foul below stairs but herself; presently we saw her come out of the bar, she went down into the cellar, and brought some beer up in a mug; then she opened the door, and after that came to the door again; then she went into the kitchen, and took some bread and butter, and went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Salmon. This was about half an hour after one;</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the usual time of the maid's being up?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No, it is not; I never knew her to be up after twelve; after she came from the door, she went to the bar again; this was her third time of going to the bar; we listened a little, and heard no more, and then we went to bed; then the watchman was going two; the boy and I came down first in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When the till fell, why did you not go down stairs?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I said to the boy I'll go down; the boy said no, do not, she will say it is you; in the morning we found the till about half way open; my master came down in about ten minutes after us, the lock was almost wrenched off; I told my master of what had passed; he taxed her as soon as she came down; she said she did not know what he meant; I found some halfpence in a drain in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170054"/> the back room in the yard, and some on the ledge among some feathers, about a fortnight after this.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you find?</p>
               <p>Salmon. There was about two or three and twenty-pence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master get a warrant for her?</p>
               <p>Salmon. He did, I went with him to get it; I think it was on the 13th of October; ( produced, dated the 12th of October) this is it; it was delivered to the constable; the constable came to our house several times after; I heard my master desire him to seek for her; he said he could not find her.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner and you often quarrelled?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No, not often.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a quarrel with her that night?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I did not pass two words with her that night; she wanted to know what was her share; I said I should not give it her then, having no change; this was in the kitchen; I saw she wanted to quarrel, and I made no words with her, so I and the boy went up to bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know whether Mrs. Fox has had any suspicion of this boy?</p>
               <p>Salmon. She has missed halfpence sometimes I believe, but I was but new come then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any silver being missing?</p>
               <p>Salmon. There was a six-pence lost I believe, from off the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took it?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I cannot tell who did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not upon some occasion search the boy's pockets for a six-pence that he had taken?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time does your water come in?</p>
               <p>Salmon. That comes in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this on a Friday night that you talk of, that your water should have come in?</p>
               <p>Salmon. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not save some water that night?</p>
               <p>Salmon. I don't know that she did; there was not always water saved on Fridays.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner discharged?</p>
               <p>Salmon. On the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come to your house again?</p>
               <p>Salmon. She came again that morning, for some cloaths to put on.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come the next time?</p>
               <p>Salmon. That was the week following, then she took one box away; I believe that was on the Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come after that?</p>
               <p>Salmon. She did one night, about nine or ten o'clock, I believe that was the same week; she wanted her other box; master said she might come again in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q Did she come again after that?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No, she never came again at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the warrant taken out when she was at your house?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any talk when she came, of charging a constable with her?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she taken?</p>
               <p>Salmon. She was taken in our tap-room on a Saturday night; she came in with another woman; the other woman called for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say she came to surrender?</p>
               <p>Salmon. No, I heard it said she was come to surrender to the warrant.</p>

            . I keep the Hercules Pillars: on the 3d of October I went to bed about half an hour after eleven; I always order that the maid should go to bed at eleven, sometimes to stay a little longer up on a Saturday night; but there was nothing to cause her to stay up longer than usual on the 3d of October; after I was gone to bed, I heard some company go down; after that I went to sleep, and afterwards I heard a noise; in the morning, when I came down, my man came to me, and said, Sir, we have had thieves in the house, Nanny has broke the till in the bar; he said the boy and he watched her; I said, why did you not come and call me, I don't recollect his answer; he said, when they got into the room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170055"/> the boy said, he went down stairs, and saw Nanny trying to open the till with the instrument we mark casks with; then he went, and from the ballusters of the two pair of stairs he sooped down, and saw her come out of the bar; there was a few halfpence and farthings in the till, which was open; part of the wood was wrenched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in that condition when you had seen it before?</p>
               <p>Fox. No, it was not; the maid came down a little before eight; I followed her into the kitchen, and desired her to give me the money she had taken; she said she did not know what meant; then I desired her to go about her business; she went away; she came again the same day for some of her things; and the after, on either Monday or Tuesday she came again; after that some of the neighbours talked to me a good deal for turning her away, and not prosecuting her, saying, it might bring me into a good deal of trouble; I took out a warrant on the 12th of October; this is it here produced; I sent it up to Mr. M'Ginnis, a constable; he not being at home, came to me; then I desired him to make it his business to and the prisoner; I heard she lodged at a hatter's, in Leather-lane; about three weeks after this, I was served with a copy of a writ, the copy dated the third of November (produced in court) I was served with it the same day. On the Monday or Tues day, when she came for her things, she went backwards in which room there is a drain which she used to clean: she staid there some time, and that day fortnight as she went away, I sent a man to clean that drain; I went with a candle, there I saw some halfpence; I took them up; there were 19 l d. among the dirt, and 61/2 d. lay by the side of the drain.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How often might she have been at your house after you turned her away?</p>
               <p>Fox. I believe three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any talk with her at any of these times about charging the constable with her?</p>
               <p>Fox. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she taken up?</p>
               <p>Fox. She was taken up in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard of her coming before she did come?</p>
               <p>Fox. I heard she was to come on the Thursday; I was told that was to indict me, if I did not take hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you she was come to surrender to the warrant?</p>
               <p>Fox. No, she did not; I gave the constable charge of her.</p>

This Friday night I sat up while two o'clock almost to save water, which we usually do; as to the ti: I never touched it, or was near it; as to the halfpence, I know no more of them than the child unborn; when I came down stairs, my master was there and the boy; I came into the kitchen, in order to go about my work; there was a woman came to scour the pots in the morning; I said to her, have you had your dram; I went to the bar for the bottle of gin; master came and said, Nanny, What do you want there; I said, I am going to give the woman a dram; master said, serve her Jack (meaning the boy) I set the bottle down on the floor, and came into the kitchen; I thought that was very odd; in about a quarter of an hour after, master came into the kitchen, then the woman went out; master said, Nanny, if you please, give me the halfpence you took out of the bar last night; I said I never touched any; he said, the till then; there are two people saw you; I said, Sir, you are joking; I thought this boy who had pilfered and robbed him several times, I thought he spoke of him; he stood peeping in the kitchen. When mistress came down, she began upon me much the same, and bid me go and fetch the halfpence, and said, there were people that could swear it; she desired me to go up and fetch them; I said I would not go up without she would go up with me; master and she went up with me; I pulled my drawers out, and opened my boxes; I opened my least box, but could not find the key of my large one; I desired them to break it open; he desired I would go and get a key, in order to open it; I went to Mr. Pitt's, but could get none; I came back again; master and mistress were still in the room, and in taking some caps out of a small drawer, I found my key underneath them; then I opened the large box, and there was only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170056"/> a black petticoat in it; mistress said, Hussey, you have stole these halfpence, and have conveyed them away, you are a thief. I said, Madam, I shall make you prove your words, if you say any such thing; she said she could do it; master said, let her go about her business; I said, what, without my cloaths and wages; I went away, and came back in about an hour, having only my old cloaths on; when I went in, mistress came to me, and called me names, and said I had better own it, I was heard to do it; Mr. Fox said, with an oath, do not say heard, she was seen to do it; I desired she would not call me thief; she said, if you speak so, I'll send for a constable; after some time, she bid me go about my business; I went away, and on the Saturday night I went again, and demanded my little box, and on the Monday I was hired to a place; the gentleman went for my character, and they gave me the character, that I was a great thief and a drunkard, as ever came into a house; the same day, in the evening, I went to the house again, and Mr. Candy along with me; he went into the tap-room, and called for something to drink; I went to the bar, in order to ask for my cloaths and wages. Master told me, I should have nothing there that night, and bid me get out of the house, or he would kick me out, or to that purpose; I went to Mr. Candy in the tap-room, and sat about half an hour, then we went away; I went again, October the 8th, and asked after my large box, which was up three pair of stairs when I left it; that I desired Mr. Salmon to fetch down into the dining-room, and said, I would send for it in about an hour; he did; I went up into the room to him: Mrs. Fox came up to me, and asked me how I came to send for my character; I told her, I had a just right to send for it, and a character I would insist upon from her; she said, you are a thief; I said, do not call me thief; you have thieves among yourselves, and want to lay it to me; she said she would send for a constable; I said, I wish you would, rather than let me lie under this scandal; she bid me go about my business; I said, I would not go without my wages; she said, you have paid yourself, I think. Master said, let her come down to me, and I'll talk to her about wages; I went down stairs to him; he said, what wages is due to you, Madam; I said, you know; he said, get about your business, for you shall not have cloaths or wages here; then I said I must get it by force; I did not know where to go.

Mr. Fox gave this answer to the person that went for my character, that he had no character with me, nor none he would give me.

               <p>Q. What had you done to the women or prisoner to occasion this?</p>
               <p>Dale. I had done nothing at all; I almost lost my senses; I recovered my senses, and heard somebody speak; somebody came up that knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you?</p>
               <p>Dale. I never heard him speak a word, neither did the women speak to me at all; the woman that stood by him was picking my pocket; I desired the people to take notice of the woman and the prisoner; he went away, and I came home to my master's house, and three days after he was taken up by a warrant; I attended at Sir John Fielding's office; there he said he was at Chelsea at the time I was knocked down; my sight is quite lost of one eye; I had a surgeon attended me about six weeks, but he could not recover my sight.</p>
