Duerdon, of 33, Sunnyside, Ealing, payable four shillings a month, and signed "E. F. Foreman"—I believed the order to be a genuine one, and paid the prisoner 7s. 6d. commission upon it—not receiving any instalment I made three written applications for payment, and eventually called on Miss Duerdon, and in consequence of what I ascertained from her these proceedings were instituted—the watch and chain have never been returned to me.</p>

Then we all ran away into Lordship Lane. Harry Deane ran across Andrew's field, and some men who I do not know ran after him, and we did not see him again. We others ran up Lordship Lane to Wood Green Fire Station. We knocked at the door, but could make no one hear. Edward Baldwin, Edward Cooper and George Baldwin went to Finsbury Park; Daniel Deane and I came back down Lordship Lane to the fire. We then ran across the fields and a policeman ran after us, and he and Alfred Curtis caught us, and then I told the policeman who set both places on fire.—<hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK MARDELL</hi>"—other statements were made by the lads, but their evidence was not taken at the Police-court—after the charge was taken Deane said, "I set fire to the stable and Mardell set fire to the stack"—the prisoner said, "No, I did not; you set fire to both"—the amount of damage is £150.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the works department of the stores of the London County Council, who are carrying out a scheme for housing the working classes at Shoreditch—at the end of last year I took on from 80 to 100 workmen, and the two prisoners were among them—Merritt was timekeeper, and Blunt a labourer and handy man—Blunt had access to the office where Merritt was employed—Merritt kept a time-book like this, in which he entered the number of hours each man worked, and the rate of wages he was entitled to, at the end of the week—it was his duty on Friday to make out the pay-sheet, which would be sent up to the office, and on Saturday a clerk came down to pay the wages—if a man cannot draw his wages there are printed forms kept for the purpose, and on one being presented to the pay clerk on Saturday he would pay—if the man did not present his authority, the wages would be returned to the head office, and he would have to apply on a special form which he would get from the foreman, authorising him to go to the head office and take his pay—each man when he comes to work has a metal ticket given him with a number—the men are employed by number, and the numbers are entered in the time-book and in the pay-sheet—in this pay sheet, made out by Merritt for 28th December, here is an entry of "Williams: No. 122</p>

               <p>21 1/2 hours at 6 1/2 d.,"making a total of 11s. 8d., and in Merritt's time-book for the same week he has written: "Williams, 122, 21 1/2 hours"—that is put down on three different days—two Williamses are entered for the same week, and are entered Nos. 138 and 113—I know from the foreman that two Williams's were employed on the job that week—Williams No. 138 was paid 4s. 8d., and Williams 113 is marked "Not paid," as being absent—Williams No. 15 is on the pay-sheet, but not in the time-book—he is entitled on the pay-sheet to 19 1/2 hours, 10s. 7d.—two time-books, A and B, were kept this week, and he is in the second book—there are four Williams's entered in the time-book and time-sheet for that week—Williams No.115 appears to have been paid that week, but not the other three—at the end of pay-sheet B for the following week, 4th January, the names of the three Williams's 113, 122, and 138, who have not drawn their pay, are entered—No.113 was paid 11s. 8d. for the week ending 31st December; No.122, 11s. 8d. for the week ending 28th December; and No. 138, 4s. 8d. for the same week—in the time-book for the week ending 8th February, 1895, the name of Palmer, No.15, is entered 22 1/2 hours, and Sutton, No. 31, 23 1/2 hours—they were not working that week, but I find them both entered in the pay-sheet in Merritt's writing—they appear to have been paid, by the pay-sheet—in consequence of something which came to my knowledge, on 21st February I sent for the two prisoners to my office, and asked Merritt to explain how Palmer was paid for the week ending February 8th when he was not at work—he said that the original Palmer had left, and another man of the same name had been put on in his place—if a man leaves, the foreman has the engaging of a fresh man—I said, "That is rather peculiar," and asked him the same question with regard to Sutton—he made the same reply, that Sutton had left, and another man bearing the same name was taken on, and he gave him the same number—I said to Blunt, "Had you any authority to take Sutton's money?"—he said that he had, and that he took it and gave it to Sutton just outside the hoarding—I showed him ticket D, signed "J. Sutton," and asked him if that was Sutton's signature—he said, "Yes."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUTTON</hi>. When a man is engaged he receives a metal ticket—his name is given, but I do not know many of their names personally—I can only tell by the books how many Palmers, Suttons, or Williams there were—when a man comes in the morning he drops his ticket into a box; and when they go to breakfast they take the tickets off the board, and when they come back they return them—if. a man did not receive the money he could get a special form from the foreman—he can get it at once; he would not have to go on the Saturday—when he gets the authority anybody he appoints could get the money any day of the week—the authority, when obtained, is equivalent to a bank-note, or cheque—when he has entered the time in the book he has to make up the pay-sheet—the ganger allowed the foreman to engage men at the beginning, but that has been stopped—the men change numbers; a man may be 13 at one part of the job, and 120 at another—he bears an excellent character—I engaged him—I made no inquiries at all—he had been with us fifteen or eighteen months before; and until this day in February, when I called him up, no complaint had been made against him—I do not know his father, but I know they are respectable people—he was always</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROOTH</hi>. The person is identified both by his number and his name—he is paid on the badge and the name too—Merritt enters it in the book and the timekeeper would know—two Williams's are correct—I do not know either of them personally—I only went there about once a week and had no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the names and faces of the workmen—all documents go up to the chief clerk—if a person is unwell he can leave and come back a week afterwards when he recovers, and during the time he is away he would have the metal badge with him—we had a man named Bowdell working there—I am prepared to swear that two men named Palmer were not working there on February 8th—if a man wants to get his money in that week he can get it from the foreman; a good many workmen have been paid in that way—Blunt was not suggested by my foreman as being a likely and proper person to whom workmen should go if they wanted substituted pay—I never heard a word against Blunt—he told me he could not read—Williams 113 is not a fictitious person—he was absent from work for a whole week—he has given the information himself that he was away—Merritt had been timekeeper previously elsewhere—you may call the signature to this form J., or S., or T. Sutton—it is not Albert Reuben sutton; he is the man we are going to call to-day.</p>

Some of the men who are absent are filled in as if they were there—the foreman signs the pay-sheet on Saturday after the men have been paid—it would be impossible for the foreman to check the number of men at work during the day, but every precaution is taken—I trusted entirely to Merritt—I have had experience in the largest works in London—we get reports from the timekeeper from day to day, and if there is reason to doubt it is compared with the timekeeper's book—there is a double return, and it is the duty of somebody in the central office to compare the two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the pay clerks of the London County Council, Belvedere Road—Merritt was the timekeeper and Blunt a labourer and handy man—the wages are made out on pay-sheets on Fridays, and on Saturdays the wages are paid by clerks who come down—this sheet A was made out by Merritt; there are three Williams's on it Nos. 15, 38, and 122; Williams 15 has 25 1/2 hours, 11s. 8d.; he was not paid that day, nor was Williams No. 38—sheet E, for December 31st, is in Merritt's writing—Williams's Nos. 15, 38, and 122 appear on it—No. 113 was not paid that week, the other two were—according to this sheet there are no back payments due to No. 113—on the sheet of December 28th back payments are due to Williams 38, 8 hours, 4s. 7d., and Williams 122, 23 1/2 hours, 11s. 8d.—sheet B, for the week ending January 4th, is in Merritt's writing; there are five Williams's in it; No. 15, 43 1/2 hours, 14s. 6 1/2 d.—No. 38 is for the week only—Williams No. 113 was due on December 21st, and, Williams 122, December 28th, 11s. 8d.—I paid them all five together on January 5th—this is the receipt of Williams 113, and this of Williams 38—I took no receipt of Williams No. 15—I paid him on his metal ticket—I do not take a receipt if it is for the current week, if it is for a back week I do—on 28th</p>

               <p>December I paid Blunt for Williams 122, on his own responsibility, and got this receipt from Blunt for 11s.8d.—the body of it is Merritt's writing—if the man was absent there would be no irregularity in Merritt filling it up, but it would not be usual—a good many of these men are exca<lb/>vators and very illiterate—in sheet 3, for February 8th, here is "Palmer No. 15, 23 1/2 hours, at 6 1/2 d., 12s. 9d."—I paid that to the man who pro<lb/>duced the ticket, it is for the current week on the metal ticket and no name—I should not know the man at all—document I is signed by Palmer as paid by me on February 9th—this is the ticket; it is authority to Bowdell to receive the money—I only take a receipt when the money is for the previous week—this says, "I authorise you to pay the amount due to me on the pay list to Bowdell.—<hi rend="smallCaps">F. BLUNT</hi>"—where it is for the current week the man acting as attorney does not sign, but for the past week he does—on the same pay-sheet for February 8th here is "Sutton 31, 23 hours, 12s. 9d."—I paid that on the authority of this document D for the current week, I do not know to whom; the body of it is Merritt's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the works going on in Boun dary Street, Shoreditch—it is my duty to engage the men—I do not know all the men who are employed—I keep a check on the timekeeper as far as I can, by going round occasionally and counting the men at work—I occasionally look at his book, but cannot always find them there if a man is away ill or taken off his work—ninety men are employed daily on an average—if a man has to receive another man's wages, the usual course is for him to go to the timekeeper and fill up the form, and the timekeeper would acquaint me of it; sometimes on Saturday they do not apply for their money, and it is taken back to the head office—if a man was ill and did not receive his money, we should receive a notice from him authorising another person to receive it on his behalf, and the same sort of ticket would be filled up mentioning the name of the person who was to draw it—as far as I know three Williams's were engaged on the job—two of them, Benjamin and William, are in Court; their numbers are 113 and 38; 15 is absent—I cannot identify any other Williams as employed in the week ending 28th December, but there are no others booked—apart from Merritt's time-book I know nothing of Williams 122, but there may have been one, the books say that he was there—two Williams's are put down on the same date, I knew Sutton, employed on the job—I do not know from my personal knowledge that he was not employed on the job in the week ending 8th February, but I know it from the books—he is here as a witness, and I recognise him—Palmer I know as employed on the job, but only since this case—my business is to engage the men, and sometimes I depute it to the under foreman—about eight or nine fresh hands were engaged from 28th December to 8th</p>

               <p>February, and some were engaged by Bailey, the foreman of the excavators, by my authority—I saw some of them engaged, and gave him instructions how many to engage—after December 28th, Bailey said "We will have a few more on to-morrow"—he sometimes set on more than I thought was necessary, and I told him not to set on any more without consulting me, and he stopped it—eight or nine men were, I think, taken on; he would take them into the office and get their names taken by the timekeeper, who would put them in his time-book—there is no separate record; if the last number was 90, he would make the next 91, or if he was a timber-man he would take up the running number of the timber-men—I was a good many years in the trade before I was connected with the London County Council—there is not a ganger over every four, only over every dozen—it is not the practice in all cases to check the time through the gangers, but that is the usual practice—I have been on a job before where there is absolutely no check on the timekeeper—in the entry of Palmer's name in the time-book the figures do not look like the same ink in the entry of Sutton's name; the ink looks different to the figures of the number of hours Sutton is supposed to have worked—I do not see a line drawn as if it had been blank that week—I saw Blunt receive the 11s. 8d. for Williams, and sign for it in our office.</p>

When men are engaged there is no separate register of their names—I said, from memory, at the Police-court, that no fresh men were taken on from December 28th to February 8th; but I have refreshed my memory from what you may call a fair copy of Merritt's book—I am no more responsible than you may be—Mr. Holloway is in authority under me—the work is not done by contract—gangers used to set on without my seeing the men, or knowing their names.</p>

If you keep one hundred men there it is impossible to know who or what they are—if they were divided into five, six, or seven, and a ganger over each, it might be an efficient check on the timekeeper; but the London County Council might, perhaps, consider the cost—on one occasion I suggested that Blunt was a proper person to be substituted to receive payment—the men's wages are 6 1/2 d. per hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of Lothar Lehnart, at 46, Queen Victoria Street—on 24th October I purchased this copy of <hi rend="italic">The Kohnische Volkszeitung</hi> of 18th October, at Segel's library, at Lime Street, in the City—the London office of that paper is 142, Clerkenwell Road—I was present at the Guildhall when Emile Hesse was prosecuted on account of this libel—the prisoner then went into the witness box on his behalf—I heard him say that he was responsible for the publication of this libel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been employed by Lehnart for about three years—Emile Hesse was first charged with being the author of this article—Reuschel was away from England at the time of the first hearing—he returned, hearing that Hesse was charged, and came to the Police-court, and took upon himself the full responsibility for writing and pub<lb/>lishing the libel—Lehnart's office consists of three rooms on the fourth floor at 46, Queen Victoria Street—there are two entrances to that house, one in Queen Victoria Street and one in Queen's Buildings, Pan<lb/>cras Lane—outside and on the doors of the offices are the names, L. Lehnart, Limited, and Liman and Co.—Lehnart was registered as a com<lb/>pany on 6th March this year, these proceedings having been instituted in October or November, 1894—I have been not quite three years at 46, Queen Victoria Street—there used to be up there the name of L. Lehnart—"Liman and Company" was up at that entrance; I never saw it at the Pancras Lane entrance—I never saw any names there—I go in by the Queen Victoria Street entrance, and sometimes by the other entrance—Opitz was with Lehnart about six months before I went there, three years ago in June—about five years ago I was introduced to Opitz in the German Club—I understood from Lehnart that Opitz was his manager, and he acted as his manager—people coming and inquiring for Lehnart would, if Lehnart was out, be shown in to Opitz, and would say, "Mr. Lehnart"—previously you went first into the clerks' room, the large office—there used to be five or six clerks—there are not so many now—anyone calling would go through the clerks' room into Opitz's room, and from that into Lehnart's room—there was a separate entrance into Lehnart's room, but the door was locked, and the only practical entrance was through Opitz's room—that arrangement is changed; you enter now the small room that used to be Opitz's, and there the clerk and myself are seated, and what used to be Lehnart's room is now Opitz's, and the larger room, which used to be for the clerks, is now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Lehnart—she has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189503250025"/>
               <p>been a clerk there for about three or four months—Opitz was manager, and we had to obey his orders—I never heard Opitz say that he was Lehnart's partner—I have been told that Liman and Co. belonged to Lehnart, but I did not know who Liman was—as far as I know the business was Lehnart's—I believe that Lehnart was a director, and Opitz the secretary of Lehnart and Co.—there was one other director, Mr. Picker or Mr. Pickert; I am not quite clear about him—I cannot mention anyone beyond those who formed Liman and Co.—I heard that Mr. Weiss was a shareholder in Lehnart and Co.—before 1892 I saw Lehnart and Opitz in the German Club together just to say good day to; they were at a separate table—they knew each other; I cannot say if they were as intimate then as they were afterwards—I could not say if I ever heard other people describe Opitz as Lehnart's partner; I was always under the impression that he was his manager—I don't remember that people said in my hearing that Opitz was Lehnart's partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have never known Opitz in any other capacity than that of manager—I think Lehnart came to 46, Queen Victoria Street in the spring of 1892, and he has continued there to the present time—I am a clerk and an inquiry officer—the business is to provide agents, and collect debts, to which Mr. Opitz attends—he has nothing to do with the inquiry business; that is only done by Lehnart and myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreign and commercial inquiry agent, of 46, Queen Victoria Street—I have read these libels on myself; there is not a word of truth in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have three small rooms on the fourth floor at 46, Queen Victoria Street—on the doors are the names of L. Lehnart, Limited, and Liman and Co.—Liman and Co. is a Berlin firm established in 1879 or 1880, and I hold their agency for London, from February, 1886, until to-day—the Berlin firm has sold its business to someone else; I made an agreement with Messrs. Liman to still keep on the name of the firm—I have that agreement—I produce different papers relating to it—the agreement was that I paid them a certain consideration, and here is the bill drawn on me—we exchanged letters about it, and I paid them this bill—I have not got the agreement or the letters here, but I have the different forms, and all that relates to Liman and Co.; the letters are in Cologne, where I have another lawsuit; there was a long corre<lb/>spondence</p>

               <p>about it in 1887 and 1888—the name of Liman and Co., from 1889 to 1895, continued to be outside my office—I have been three years at Queen Victoria Street—before that I was at 14, Trinity Square, as the accredited agent of Jhanke and Falksch, a Hamburg firm—I lost that agency through these libels, on 23rd October, 1894—no one but myself in England represents, or is known as, Liman and Co.—Lehnart has been Lehnart and Co. since 6th March, 1895—I am the director—Gustav Opitz is the secretary—his Christian names are Bernhard Gustav, as far as I know, at all times—I have the greatest possible confidence in him; he is honest and respectable—he was formerly my manager, and is now the secretary of the company of which I am director—Lehnart was turned into a company in order to get more money, through the sale, to fight these frivolous law suits; there is this and others connected with it—the memorandum of association is dated 6th March—the secretary is here; it is his duty to give information about the number of shareholders—Opitz was my manager—I have known him about twelve years—I cannot say I knew him intimately, but I knew him in a general way for twelve years past—it is my business to inform myself with regard to people and their characters—when people called and asked for me, Opitz has said he was Lehnart; he was engaged chiefly to receive nine<lb/>tenths of all the visitors, because I could not see them all—people coming say, "Is Mr. Lehnart in?" and he would say, "Yes," and would talk to them, but there would be no misrepresentation about it—I occupied three rooms; the first was the clerks', the second Optiz's, and the third mine—in the old days they had to come through Opitz's room to get to mine—my room was not large enough for my purpose, so I have since taken the other one—the change of rooms was made in December last—Opitz had clerks to write the letters; he dictates the correspondence, and has shorthand clerks and so on—before the publication of the libel I had nine people; now I have only five; the libel has had great effect—Opitz signed "Lehnart" with my authority, because I could not always sign fifty or sixty letters—I was out a good deal—he might have had time to put "pp.," but he did not do it—I heard Opitz examined and cross-examined at the Clerkenwell Police-court—that did not shake my confidence in him—nothing was proved against him—I believe he said that in 1885 he knew Sugar—I cannot tell you if he said that he would call Sugar a swindler, and that he was one in 1885—it has perhaps slipped from my memory—I did not hear him say that he had traded as Martin, Cohen and Co, of Bombay—I swear he did not say, "I traded as Martin, Cohen and Co."—he said he was the London partner in the firm of Martin, Cohen and Co.—I only knew he was interested in that firm; whether he was a partner or not I cannot say—the date of that may or may not have been 1885 or 1886—I cannot tell you if he said that simultaneously he was interested in the firm of John Mowatt and Co., of 17, Great St. Helen's—he said Mowatt was a gentleman of China and Japan; it was a different firm—I heard Opitz say he had opened a banking account about 6th September, 1886, in his own name of Gustav Opitz, at the London and North-Western Distinct Bank, and that I gave him the reference—I heard him say that on 9th October he had opened an account at the London and North-Western District Bank for Walter Arnold and Co., the Australian people—I did not know that there had been a bankruptcy notice against him in June, 1885; I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189503250027"/>
               <p>nothing to do with his private affairs; I should not inquire into them till I was asked—he was not my confidential employe till lately—I was his reference to the bank in 1886—I did not know that a third bankruptcy notice was presented against him in December, 1886—I heard him say something to the effect that he opened, in the name of Louis Lancaster Clarke and Co., a third banking account on 30th December, 1886, with the London Trading Bank—I did not know that his wife's maiden name was Louise Lancaster Clarke; I cannot say whether he said it was—I don't think I heard him give as a reason that his wife's maiden name was Louise Lancaster Clarke—I only knew when I saw it in the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette.</hi> that there was a petition in bankruptcy against Opitz in January, 1887—a receiving order was made against him on 28th January, 1887—I cannot say if there were produced to him at the Police-court a number of cheques, drawn by him before and after the receiving order had been presented, in the name of L. L. Clarke and Co.—I still believe in Opitz's honesty, or he would not be with me—I know nothing of false names—I know Opitz's writing very well—this signature "G. Opitz" is his to the best of my belief; I have not seen this document before—I see at the back of the document, as references, Mr. Hume and Mr. Lehnart, of 14, Trinity Square—I described Opitz as a respectable man, and so on; that was my honest opinion at the time—the signature, "Walter Arnold," on this document may be in his writing, or it may not—I am not an expert in handwriting, and I will not take the responsibility of saying—the signature, "Louis L. Clarke," is not in his writing; it does not look like his; I am not an expert—I cannot remember exactly whether I heard Opita admit before the Magistrate that it was in his writing—he failed for some<lb/>thing over £6,000—very likely I heard him say at the Police-court that that was so—I knew nearly nothing about the bankruptcy—I saw the alleged debtors of Opitz in the lists; even I had to make a claim against him, not myself, but for a customer—I could not tell you if alleged debtors against the estate were Morris, Brandt and Co. or Messrs. Bernard and Co.—it might be that according to the statement he failed for some<lb/>thing over £2,000 for debts contracted in the name of Gustav Opitz, and that the balance of £4,000, according to the statement he made, was a balance which he had been made responsible for, because he was a partner in the firms of Martin, Cohen and Co., of Bombay, and John Mowatt and Co., of London—I heard that Opitz left England at the end of 1885 in a coal ship going to Bombay from Cardiff—I heard him say he attended a lot of meetings of his creditors—I know he only attended the first meeting for himself, but I heard him say that he attended a lot of meetings; perhaps they were not all his own affairs—he had to go on urgent business to Bombay—he went in the coal ship to Bombay in 1885, and he returned in the early part of 1886—I heard him say that in March, 1887, a situa<lb/>tion was offered him in Bombay by a firm of merchants, which he accepted, as he could not get a situation in London, and he stayed there several years—he was not in the names of John Mowatt or Walter Arnold—he was always trying to earn an honest living; am I not allowed to engage man of ability who has failed once?—is he the only man in London who has failed?—since Opitz's examination at the Police-court he has been promoted from being manager of my business to being the secretary</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter, dated</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1893, <hi rend="italic">stated that Van Raalte had had an action brought against him by a manufacturer at Chemnitz, but that as the manufacturer had not given security for costs he had lost the case, and was indebted to Van Raalte in nearly</hi> £90 <hi rend="italic">; that as Van Raalte would like to get the money he would put Vonleschik forward to give an order to the manufacturer at Chem<lb/>nitz,</hi>

William Schmeisser are inquiry agents in Berlin—we had a lot of transactions with them—they corresponded with us, and took information from me for some years—in 1892 that connection closed—that was not in consequence of what they alleged to be a trick that I had played upon them, that I know of—6,000 or 7,000 letters have been ex<lb/>changed between us—I thought that these were confidential reports—I replied to the confidential inquiry from Messrs. William Schmeisser by this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he could obtain information as to firms in the East within two or three days; that lie sent a report as to how the business was transacted; that his reporter had spent the last twenty years in the East, and was now with his family on a recreation tour in England, and that he should advise that the reporter be directly communicated with.</hi>)—I enclosed in my letter this document purporting to be the statement of my reporter, and signed by G.

               <p>I did not know it myself, and I had to make inquiries from someone—Opitz was the reporter referred to in my letter—I wrote, "My reporter has spent the last twenty years in the East"; that was true—he went out to the East as far back as 1869 or 1870; he was a good deal in India, China, and Japan—he had been residing for a few years in England before he left Cardiff in the coal ship—in 1890 he was here getting together twelve manufacturers to travel for them in India and sell their goods—my letter also states, "He is now with his family on a recreation tour in England"—he was here; he wanted to go back again—his family lived in Bombay, and they came over from there and went back again—the letter was in my own writing—there is nothing untrue in those state<lb/>ments; Opitz had been for the last twenty years in the East—he tried to go back to India; he came in 1887—Opitz sent me the report which I forwarded to Messrs. William Schmeisser. (<hi rend="italic">This report gave details of the business he could do, and of the manner in which it would be done; and stated that he was about to start on his fourth voyage round the world, and had arranged with six English firms of the first rank for a year, at</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">expenses each firm and three per cent, commission, and he would be glad to learn of others who would like to participate, as he intended to take ten agencies at</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">each.</hi>)—Opitz intended to fulfil what he told me there; he told me so—I knew he had three or four English firms already—I inquired of one firm, Barclay, not of the others—I knew when I wrote the letter that Opitz was an undischarged bankrupt; I believe there were a lot of assets—he did not want credit; he wanted money for his travelling expenses, and I did not recommend him for credit—I cannot give you very much informa<lb/>tion about that particular bankruptcy—the signature, "Bernhard Opitz," looks like his. Q. Would not you ask him why he had been Gustav up to this time and Bernhard Opitz now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not answerable for the actions of others—I never saw this before—the object of my letter to Messrs. William Schmeisser was to get employment for Opitz—I got to know later on that he entered into communication with the company at Liege for the purpose of getting an agency—I first knew that when I had the matter in hand to get back the samples and settle with them; that was some time in 1891—on or about 2nd April, 1890, I got this letter from Messrs. William Schmeisser—there is something altered in a different ink—at the bottom of it is "Please write an answer at the other side of this leaf, in strict confidence"—the inquiry is for the agency of a "Belgian Ammunition Factory"—the answer on the other side was written by one of my inquiry officers—you should ask the inquiry officer who gave the report why the name Bernhard Opitz was given—I did not write the answer—it is from my office. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that the person inquired after had field a position in Japan, and had visited the ports of Japan and China repeatedly; that he was now for a short time in London, preparing to start in a short time on a travelling tour in the East, for a number of first-class English firms, such as Lion, Lion and Son, Barclay and Sons, Limited, Welsh, Marget on and Co., Perkin, Son and Rayment, receiving</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">for expenses, and commission from each; that, according to information given him by the firms named, the man was clever, experienced in business, and enjoyed their fullest confidence; and that he believed he could be trusted with samples to the value of</hi> 1,500 <hi rend="italic">francs.</hi>)—I</p>

               <p>inquired of Barclay, or Burge and Son—if I remember we inquired of all the four firms; Mr. Sternberg, my inquiry officer, went himself, and I believe some of the inquiries were in writing—very likely I can produce them, but I am not prepared for all these questions—Opitz, I know, paid back the money he received from those English houses—I believe he re<lb/>ceived £20, £30, or £40 on account of the journeys—Messrs. William Schmeisser asked, "Is he experienced and clever? How is his past?"—you should ask Sternberg about it; I am not doing every bit of work myself—Messrs. William Schmeisser were paying me 1s. for information, and they got their shillingsworth—I know now that Opitz got money from the Liege Company; I did not know it at the time—I did not speak to Opitz about that agency—very likely I overlooked it, or did not think of it at the time—he was not in my employment at the time—we were not enemies, but we were not so intimate as to discuss every bit of business—my inquiry officer went to those four firms; we got information from Perkin, Son and Rayment—this letter is in G. Opitz's writing; it is addressed to Perkin, Son and Rayment—I have not seen this letter before—I gave no information to Perkin, Son and Rayment; they never applied for any, according to the best of my belief—even if Opitz was giving me as a reference to the English firms, I giving him a good character to those English firms, is there any<lb/>thing wrong in it? I did not do it—the English firms did not apply to me, if they had done so I should have told them my honest opinion, and given Opitz an excellent character—G. or B. Opitz is his name—I did not know at the time that Opitz received in June, 1890, about £50 from the Liege Company—I first knew that he had received £50 from that company for his travelling expenses to India, in 1891—so far as I know Opitz did not leave England in 1890—he made no false representations—from what Opitz explained to me in 1891, he wanted twelve manu<lb/>facturers; he only got five, and so he had not enough money to go abroad—I saw him several times in 1890—I had nothing to do with his going abroad—I asked him in 1890, "Have not you gone?"—he always said, "I have not enough firms;" he represented, "I want some more"—I knew he got samples from the Liege firm, besides the £50—those he returned—I cannot tell you whether I made any communication to Messrs. William Schmeisser as to Opitz not proceeding to the East; I do not remember it—I think Opitz went away in 1890—I am not sure whether Opitz was in England between February, 1890, and January, 1892—I might have told you an untruth—I am not accountable for him—I received this letter, of April 9th, from Messrs. William Schmeisser and Co. (<hi rend="italic">This asked for information as to Mr. Bernhard Opitz.</hi>)—this is my reply, in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had obtained information that Bernhard. Opitz had gone in July</hi>, 1890, <hi rend="italic">by steamer from London to Colombo, and that it was said that he had resigned the representations which he had accepted, in order to be able to devote himself exclusively to representing an English firm, who guaranteed the whole of his travelling expenses of</hi> £1,000; <hi rend="italic">that it was said he was seized with fever in Burmah and left directly for Australia; that it was pretended his samples were deposited with a firm at Colombo, and that Opitz intended to bring them back on his return from Australia; that his relations were not possessed of more detailed news, as his last letter arrived a few months back, and it was</hi>

I did not know he did not—I did not see him sometimes; did not I protect the people abroad, did not I recover these arms, and did not he pay back the money he got?—it is true that he resigned the representations he got in order to devote himself exclusively to represent a Manchester firm for whom he had to conclude contracts for spinning mill fittings in the Colonies, and who guaranteed him the whole of his travelling expenses of £1,000—I don't know exactly Opitz's arrangements; I only know what he told me—he could not get the money, and he went for one firm; he was in negotiation with Mr. Hume to transfer this agency to him—what was in my letter was correct at the time, only I cannot say four years afterwards how it arose at the time—Captain Bateman told me Opitz was seized with fever—Opitz had relations; he was staying with them—I never entered the Eastern Exchange in my life; it is three or four minutes' walk from Queen Vic<lb/>toria Street, but he was not always there; he was travelling for the Eastern Exchange—he was seized with fever and left directly for Aus<lb/>tralia—I do not know that his samples were not deposited with a firm at Colombo, that is what was told me—Mr. Bateman told me Opitz intended to bring them back with him on his return from Australia, and that it was thought they were possibly already on their way back from Colombo—I did not ask Opitz, because he was not in London at the time; I did not see him myself—I cannot swear that in April, 1891, when I wrote this letter, Opitz was not in London—I believe he was not in London, but travelling, and this information was given by Captain Bateman, who staysor lives with him—I will not swear one way or the other whether Opitz was in London—I do not say that the information I gave to the people abroad was false; it was what I found out at the time and reported—after writing the letter very likely I saw Opitz, or I saw someone at the house—I am not prepared for all these questions; it is four or five years back, I cannot remember all these facts—Opitz, recommended through me to Schmeisser, had not got goods on credit from the Liege Company; he had got goods valued at £16—the Liege Company, through Schmeisser, asked for information about him, and I gave it—at the time I wrote, "In June or July, 1890, he is said to have been in Colombo," it was April, 1891—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time were you not in communication with that very man in London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot remember the dates—I saw him very likely shortly after<lb/>wards, when I got back the samples and the money—I cannot tell you if I saw him shortly before I wrote that letter; I cannot remember—I think he was not in London at the time; I cannot say as to the dates—I asked there for a power of attorney—very likely I got the power of attorney, and then I went or sent someone about the samples—his relations were living in Brixton at that time, at</p>

               <p>Spinham Road, very likely—I did not go myself to see him—his uncle, Mr. Bateman, gave me the information: "His relations were not possessed of any more detailed news, judging from his last letter"—it was not a tissue of lies about the samples being thought to be on their way back from Colombo, you misrepresent his report—I reported what I found out—the report is correctly translated—it is what I was informed at the time—I did not verify it—the price, 1s., was not so low that the information must be false; it is quite correct—I remember some<lb/>thing in the libel to that effect—I never gave false information in my life, this was reported to me—1s. is the charge of all the offices—when I said, "That is really a cheap way to make a tour round the world; what clever ideas some people have!" I should have liked to make the journey myself and represent the manufacturers, not in the same way, or on the same terms; but I am very fond of travelling—I did not mean, "What a rascal this Opitz is!"</p>

I am an artificial florist, trading as Charles and Company, at 120, Fore Street, where I have two rooms on the first floor—I have been fifteen years in the trade; six years on my own account—on the morning of 6th February I found my premises had been broken into, and missed artificial flowers value £37 10s. and seven boxes of black ostrich feathers, worth £5 10s., five pounds of boa feathers, value £15, and about four pounds of black-dyed ostrich feathers, worth £12—I afterwards missed some birds and some samples of fancy feathers—I have since seen the property, and I have identified it as my goods—the flowers ure new French goods just from France—it would be impossible for any<lb/>one who knew the trade to think they were worth £4—these feathers produced by Lewis are my property, and also these found at Hoare's and at Le Maistre's.</p>

He said they were broken up; he asked me £4 for them. I gave him £3 and told him to come next day, when I gave him £1 and sent them home by my brother."</p>

I live at 7, Elizabeth Place, Whitecross Street—until September last I had been in Pickford and Co.'s employ for twenty-one years, but I was invalided—on a Wednesday, between half-past eleven and twelve, I was in Whitecross Street, at Hoare's stall, when a man came up on the off-side of the barrow, and he said to the prisoner Hoare, "I have a job lot," or "a job line of flowers that I can sell you cheap"—he had either three or two boxes strapped in front, and three or two behind, over his right shoulder—Hoare went round to him, and the man opened one of the boxes and showed Hoare the goods—I did not look at them—the colour of the man's hands was as if he was in the flower line, or something of that sort—after Hoare had viewed the goods, the man strapped the goods up, and they went down the street in the direction of a public-house, and out of my view.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had some silver in his right hand, going over Holborn Viaduct—the prisoner came forward when the policeman was called and when the omnibus was at a standstill—he could see by my placing the lady on the step that something was the matter; every<lb/>body was looking—I called the policemen by the corner after passing Snow Hill Station, about one hundred yards on—after going that hundred yards I called the policemen and said, "This lady has lost her purse, and this man has got it"—had the prisoner got out of his place before then I should have stopped him—he came out and was on the step soon after the lady got off—he had not much chance to get away.</p>

On 6th March I was a passenger on this omnibus in plain clothes—I heard the police called, and I rushed down the steps, and the conductor said to me, "This lady has lost there purse, and this man has got it"—the prisoner said, "There is the lady's purse on the seat"—I looked inside and saw it—I told the prisoner I should charge him—he said nothing—he gave his name as Harry Cooper, 14, Ben Jonson Road, Stepney—the name was not correct; the address was—I took him to the station—he had 17s. 9d. in silver, half-a-sovereign gold, and 3d. coppers on him.</p>

               <p>before he was charged—the constable said to me, "This lady has lost her purse," and after the prisoner was charged he said it—he said nothing else, I am sure—he said, I believe, "I am a gentleman, and an innocent man"—I had forgotten that—his father lives at the address he gave, and is a respectable tradesman, so far as I know—he keeps a shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am office boy to Thomas James Lipton and Co., tea merchants, of Bath Street, St. Luke's, who advertise very largely—on 22nd February, about 11.45, I was in Peerless Street, City Road, with this bag containing £5 worth of coppers—I was attacked from behind by some men; a hand was put over my mouth and an arm round my neck, and the bag was wrenched from my grasp—the hand over my mouth prevented me from shouting out—the handle of the bag was broken and left in the hands of those who attempted to get it from me—there was more than one person—I was knocked down, and when I got up I saw several men run<lb/>ning away, and the prisoner was among them; he was carrying the bag—I was prevented from running for a policeman by the crowd—after some little time I fetched a policeman from the City Road—I next saw the prisoner at Worship Street on March 13th, in a yard, with nine or ten others—I picked him out without any hesitation—I saw him clearly as I got up, he was about ten yards off, carrying the bag under his arm.</p>

I went to Miles Lane about 5 30 a.m., and saw Massey with Charlton in custody—I sent Charlton to the station—I examined the premises and found an entrance had been gained through an open window of the warehouse at No. 10—from there they got to the roof of Megarson's—the marks of corduroy and marks were on the white frost on the roof, and they had broken a window there—I followed the tracks to 8A, Cuddiford's, where a skylight had been forced, and a desk was broken open—they then went to No. 9, occupied by the same people, Cuddiford's, where the trap-door on the roof had been opened—from the top floor they got to the first floor, and into the office, where they had forced open several drawers, a desk, and cupboard, in which were several boxes of cigars corresponding with those found on Charlton, and these two empty boxes had been forced by this champagne opener—I found on the table only empty boxes—there were several marks on the desk corresponding to a jemmy belonging to the occupiers, which came</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I drew back and let the others in—I was struck between them; a stranger would not come in and do it—I was kicked on the knee—there was violence—I went to the London Hospital six or seven weeks—all three were in front of me—I saw the men's face—it was light—I had not seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—I knew none of the men—I do not know how the prisoner was dressed—there were not two or three old men for me to identify from—no one was with me when I picked die prisoner out—I did not see the prisoner in charge when I got to the station—I was told to come inside, and the sergeant said he would call me when I was wanted—he came in and said, "There you are, have a good look"—the men were in a circle, and I went and looked at this one and that one, and, I think, the prisoner was the fourth—I put ray hand on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt the prisoner was the man who attacked me—I cannot tell you whether the inspector was present; he might hare been; I only saw the inspector or sergeant at the station; he took me there, and I did not know I had picked the right man out.</p>

I am a gasfitter, of 25, Scudamore Street—on October 29th, about 4.15 p.m., I saw Woodley going into St. Mary's railway station at Whitechapel—the three men and others were going into the station—when Woodley got to the door of the urinal the prisoner pinned him by the back of the neck on the pavement outside—I stood against the door and saw it all—the urinal door was never shut—another man snatched the chain, and the men ran off—I went for assistance and ran after the men—I went back—I have seen the prisoner four times since, walking about the road with others—I picked him out at Leman Street from nine or ten men on Sunday night, March 3rd.</p>

               <p>High Holborn—in December, 1893, I advanced to Barnard £60 on a bill of sale on furniture at 1, Beulah Villas, Walthamstow—the money was to be repaid by monthly instalments—the instalments fell into arrear, and I went to look after the furniture, but I did not find it at Beulah Villas—in August last I found him at No. 4, Oak Villas, Brentwood—the prisoner opened the door to me—when I went there early in August my conversation with Barnard was in his presence—I said we had traced the goods after their being surreptitiously removed to Brentwood, and I had gone down to take possession of them—I left a man in possession—it was arranged that Barnard should come up to see us the next morning—within a short time all the furniture mentioned in the bill was brought to our premises in Holborn with the exception of one or two articles that were burned—at the time I went down in August to trace the goods they had had a fire there—they had only just moved in, and the larger part of the goods were on the first floor—I went through the inventory as far as I could—at our valuation not more than £10 or £15, or at the outside £20 worth, I should think, was burned—I knew nothing then of any claim Barnard was making on the insurance company—with the exception of the £15 or £20 worth, the furniture was all taken back to Holborn, and there it remained until the 4th September, when Barnard came and handed me this cheque to pay off the sum owing on the bill of sale—I passed the cheque through my bankers, and retained what was owing to me, and handed him the balance—from that time the furniture was free and stood to Barnard's order—it remained with us till the 3rd October, when Bar<lb/>nard called and wrote an authority, which he left with my brother and myself—on the 4th October the prisoner came with a carman from Allen and, under the authority which Barnard had left, the furniture was handed over to the carman and the prisoner, and they took it away, giving me a receipt for the furniture—Barnard was an exceptionally fair man with pale blue eyes, and he wore gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

I am a clerk in the Loss Department of the Manchester Insurance Company, 96, Cheapside—on the 12th July a policy was issued by us to the prisoner on his household effects at 3, Camden Villas, Romford—just after the 4th of September a claim was made by the prisoner for £12 3s. 3d. in respect of a fire at 3, Camden Villas—the cause of the fire he stated to be "clothes airing"—that was settled by a payment of £7 10s. on the 28th of September, for which this is the receipt—on the 25th September I received a telegram, followed by a claim of £14 6s. for a second fire on the same premises—the cause is stated to be "clothes airing"—that was settled by a payment of £12 10s. on the 28th of September, the policy to be cancelled and surrendered—within a day or two of the 25th Septem<lb/>ber the prisoner called at the Cheapside office and saw me, following up this telegram advising the second fire, and he complained that we had put him on the "black list" of the salvage corps—he seemed to know all about it—he told me it was done by sending out a card with a black edge containing either the name of the salvage corps or its chief officer, and on the back of the card was just written the name and address of the person the office wished to warn other offices against insuring—that card was sent round to. each of the offices, and it was understood that it was an insurance which was not desirable—the prisoner appeared to be annoyed at what was done—he stated that he got his information from friends in the salvage corps—his information was correct—he was" black-listed" a day or two before—when once a prisoner is "black-listed" it is only with very great difficulty that he is able to effect an insurance with a respectable office, and after considerable inquiry.</p>

I am a builder and house-agent at 303, West Green Road, South Tottenham—I am an agent for the Guardian Life and Fire Assurance Company—on the 13th October I had a house of my own, No. 4, Abbotsford Avenue, Tottenham, to let—on that day the prisoner called on me—someone was with him—he asked me what houses I had to let, and I mentioned one or two, and he eventually agreed to take No. 4, Abbotsford Avenue, at a yearly tenancy of £32—an agreement was signed on that day—I spoke to him about references—he said he had lately sold his house in the north of London, and he was unable to give me a landlord's reference which I asked for—he said his furniture was warehoused—he also mentioned that it was insured in the Westminster Fire Insurance Company's Office—he asked me if it was necessary to give notice to the company of a change of address, and I said it would be, but that, if he wished, a new policy could be taken out in another office, and that I was agent for the Guardian Fire Office—he said he would</p>

               <p>consider the matter, and let me know, when he was moving in, whether he would give notice to the Westminster Company for a transfer, or take out a new policy—I afterwards found out that his friend, who was present at this interview, was named Barnard—Barnard gave me a deposit of £1 when the house was taken—on 23rd October, between 4.30 and five p.m., the prisoner came and said, "I have considered the matter over which you spoke to me about, and I have decided to take out a new policy in the Guardian Fire Assurance Company for £700"—he threw down a sovereign, and asked me for the usual cover receipt—I said, "I shall not require so much; half a sovereign will be sufficient," and I gave him ten shillings back, with the receipt—I said I thought £700 was a large sum, and he said, "I have a lot of furniture, and instruments too; a piano"—I think he said he had two pianos—this is the receipt I gave the prisoner for the ten shillings; the counterfoil is in my book, which I produce—I left my office about 5.30 that afternoon, and passed the end of Abbotsford Avenue, and I saw a couple of large vans outside No. 4, and furniture being moved into the house—next day, 24th October, about six p.m., in consequence of information, I went to 4, Abbotsford Avenue, which was on fire at the time—flames were all through the house—the house is one of a row; No. 6 on one side, and No. 2 on the other, were both occupied at the time—the road was full of people—about eight o'clock the same evening I saw the prisoner—I saw him several times about Tottenham up to the end of last year—Barnard was usually with him when I saw him up to the end of the year—I have not seen Barnard since the beginning of this year—this is a ground-floor plan of No. 4, Abbotsford Avenue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Tottenham Fire Brigade—at 6.51 p.m. on 24th October I received a call for Abbotsford Avenue—when I arrived there No. 4 was well alight—the fire was coming out of the front room bay windows and the top floor back window—it had not actually got to the roof, but the whole place was alight from top to bottom—having got the hydrant to work I took Perkins into the passage—a lot of fire was raging in the front room, and there was fire in the back room; I had to get the second delivery to work before I went in—the passage leading from the front was well alight—we washed that out as we went in—I and Perkins went together into the front room, and worked on the fire there with partial effect—in certain parts of both front and back rooms the water took effect, and in certain parts it did not; practically it took no effect on the main body of the fire—I had a man working at the back of the house at that time, and I went round to see what he was doing—we had a steamer's branch on at the back, and there were three deliveries altogether—when I got to the back, fire was breaking out and taking No. 6; just the outside of the bays was on fire—we stopped it there; it had just caught—I took considerable notice of the effect the water had; it had absolutely no effect on the main body of the furniture stacked up between the two rooms; it was in a very peculiar position—it appeared piled up between the back and front rooms, which communi<lb/>cated by folding doors—I could not say whether the doors were standing then or not, but there was fire between the two rooms—I went to work on the bay windows of the front room—it was a small fire there, and I ordered Perkins to get the fire out behind me, because I did not want it to cut me off after I got inside—he got to work, but it took no effect—I said, "It won't put the fire out"—when I looked next morning there was nothing, but the fire went down when you put the water there, but it came back again, and the water seemed to have no effect at all—I have had twelve years' experience of fires—these flames were not, in my opinion, such as would be caused by burning wood or ordinary furniture; they were an oil fire, most distinctly—I said so as soon as ever we pulled up, and I was satisfied of it by the sort of hissing sound (like bacon frying, although not so pronounced) that the fire made; it is distinct from the burning of wood—the smoke was very dense, like you would get from an oil fire—it was paraffin oil, probably—oil fires are not altogether uncommon, in my experience; I have had a good many of them—at one time I had to deal with a firm who ex<lb/>tinguished fires by means of chemicals, and fires were created there by means of oil for the purpose of trying experiments with the extinguishers; and then I have had to deal with the oil mills in Belvedere Marshes; so that I have dealt with pretty big fires one way and another—the conclusion I express to-day is the one I formed and expressed at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A fire arising from oil consists of a flame which bursts outwards; it is rather darker than an ordinary wood fire; it rolls up at the end, and emits a large quantity of black smoke, which comes apparently from the extreme end of the flame—the fire was right through your property—I would not say there were two fires; I think it was alight all over when I got there—there was dense smoke and soot, which I should expect to find from oil—I told</p>

               <p>you that I was very much surprised that a small lamp should have caused it, when I asked you for particulars next morning—we were called at 6.51; we got there as nearly as possible in ten minutes, which would be 7.1; in three minutes after that we had the water on, and I should think it would be another three or four minutes after that before I was in the room; that would be six or seven minutes past seven—it did not take us long to get the fire out in the passage; that went down before us; it would not go down in the room—the room, when I saw it first, was pretty full of furniture stacked up between the two rooms—there was a very considerable distance between the bay windows and the furniture; I remarked at the time it was a very funny way to put it—they said it had just been brought in; but furniture when it is brought in is put as nearly as you want it, and this was stacked up—I saw very little of what was upstairs—all I saw was downstairs; the bulk of it—the furniture being packed close, with bedding and all kinds of things, would not account for the fierceness of the flame—you said you broke the window, and that would account for part of it—I asked you how you accounted for the fire, and you told me it was a pure accident that you were insured at all—the day after the fire I asked you your name—you said Alfred Warner—I asked your business; you said none, it was a private house—I said, "Can you account in any way for this tire?"—you said you accounted for it by the fact that you had just come home and got to the door, and your wife came to open it as your keys would not exactly answer, and in coming to open it she knocked a benzoline lamp off a what-not in the front room ground floor; that seeing the fire, and not <hi rend="italic">being able to get in at the door, as your key would not answer, you got in at the window—I said it was a very inadvisable thing to do to break a window in the case on a house being alight in the way you</hi> described it—you said your anxiety to get to your wile was such that you broke the window to do it—I was very careful about making these notes at the time—there was a pretty fair wind blowing at the time, but nothing much out of the way; there was not anything to cause that fire—we worked from a hydrant; it threw enough water for the job—a steamer came, but we had two hydrants, back and front, before the steamer came—there are three water companies near there, but the Tottenham District Company supply the water there, and their keys fit ail the cocks there; our key will fit any of them—I looked over the premises by daylight after the fire was over; I paid no attention to whether the better-class furniture had been put upstairs—I asked if you were insured, and you told me it was a pure stroke <hi rend="italic">of luck</hi> you were; that Mr. Hart had tried <hi rend="italic">to make</hi> you insure; that you had been insured in the Westminster for six years before, and you did not like to leave them, and that he had prevailed on you to insure in his office—I said, "It is a lucky job for the West<lb/>minster"—a considerable quantity of oil must have been used—when you come to put oil on furniture it goes a long way—I would not say that barrels of oil had been used—from the time the fire was seen it was not three-quarters of an hour before we were in the room—we should <hi rend="italic">hart</hi> been much quicker if anyone had come to fetch the engine—the dense smoke and soot arose from what was burning inside—the walls may have been brick; but they may have been oiled over first.</p>

I am a fire foreman at Tottenham—I went to Abbotsford Avenue on this night, getting there about seven—the house was well alight from top to bottom—I could make no impression on the, front with the branch, so I went to the door leading from the passage, and put my branch on the front room—it appeared as if there had been folding doors which had gone—there was a cloud of black smoke—the water had no effect for a considerable time—I saw a pile of fire in the centre of the front room, and I put my water towards that; it took no effect there for some time—I kept the water round the front room—in certain places it seemed to knock the fire out; in other places it would not seem to touch it—I stayed at the house all the evening, till about eleven o'clock, playing on the fire—I was in the passage fifteen or twenty minutes after we got there; the fire burnt till eleven o'clock—it was a very fierce fire indeed—we had plenty of water for an ordinary fire in a private house—I formed the opinion that there was more than ordinary wood and furniture burning; in my opinion there must have been some oil there; the smoke was very dense—two of my firemen were injured, and were attended by the surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was on the scene at the same time as Eddington, and we worked together for a time—I cannot say whether the brick walls were afire in the room; the flames went up the brick wall—it took two <hi rend="italic">to three minutes to get the</hi> water on to the fire—I was not on the ladder, waiting for water to come through the branch, for about two minutes—I <hi rend="italic">was working in</hi> the <hi rend="italic">front room</hi> window before I went into the passage—in the back room, and in the centre of the front room, there was a good deal of furniture, piled up very close—I don't know when the fire began—the furniture being packed close with bedding, clothing, curtains, and soon, would not account for the fierceness of the fire in a private house—I don't think that ordinary furniture and ordinary clothes would account for the fierceness of the fire—as a seaman, I should say there was a good breeze—I only worked from the street hydrant—four engines came to the fire, one was the Hornsey steamer; and that was the only steamer there—the wrong key was not brought.; the water was not delayed forty minutes—I did not look over the premises by daylight after the fire.</p>

               <p>found that; the flooring was entirely burnt away, and the joists had been burnt into, but not through—the piece of material was about as much as you could hold in double hands—obviously there had been a fire in the back room and in the front room—the passage was not burnt nearly so much as the flooring of the back room—I saw the prisoner some four days after my arrival—he told me the fire had originated through the upsetting of a benzoline lamp which stood on a what-not in the corner of the passage; that in passing down the passage his wife, after admitting him, had pulled it over with her dress—I did not find any lamp or fragments of one in the passage—he pointed out where the what-not had stood; I did not find in the neighbourhood of that place any evidence of considerable fire on the flooring or about it—there has been at one time, so far as I could see, folding doors between the two rooms—on the floor, and almost mid<lb/>way between the two rooms, I saw a small benzoline lamp, to which the prisoner called my attention, and said, "That is the little thing that did the trick"—that was not in the passage, it was about nine feet away from where there was the greatest evidence of burning in the back room—when I first went there I asked the prisoner the cause of the fire, and afterwards in the course of conversation I asked him how he managed to do it so nicely—he made a rambling statement; I could not say exactly what it was, but I know it concluded with something like: "Some people think it is hard to fire a private house."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This material was found about the centre of the back room.

               <p>been pushed to the place I found it—the woollen material I found nearly three weeks after the fire—it was saturated with paraffin to the best of my belief—water will not touch things saturated with oil or paraffin; it will run off—water might mix with paraffin with a lot of trouble, I never tried to do it—I never took notice of people being tried for adulterating paraffin with water—the conversation I spoke of was three or four days or a week, or a little more after my arrival—I thought when you said, "That is the little thing that did the trick" it was rather a bold remark for you to make—I did not report it to my superior officer when I saw him—I first mentioned it to Inspector Williamson, I believe—a detective called to inspect the premises—when I came on duty there were tables, chairs, washing machine, and so on, in the garden, that I was told 70 a had pulled out—I found the lamps uninjured—I found paraffin in them—one of them was nearly full, and another half full—it is quite possible that some of the lamps might have fallen through from upstairs.</p>

               <p>him not to make any claim but what he could thoroughly substantiate to the insurance surveyors—he asked me as to the course adopted by the insurance surveyors—I told him it would be necessary for him to procure invoices for any furniture he had purchased, and to give full evidence as to what furniture he had acquired by gift, or otherwise—he left with me the paper he brought with him, to have it fair copied, as well as the receipt of the 24th October—under my instructions the detailed statement was prepared, which on 30th October was sent to Messrs. Brown, Roberts, and Radmall—this portion of the claim is founded on the written instructions left with me by the prisoner—there was attached to it a letter, which was forwarded with it, I think—there was a cover note for £700; the detailed account shows something over £700—the claim was forwarded direct to the assessors, Messrs. Brown, Roberta, and Radmall, and they had it under investigation in November, and on the 28th of November I received this letter from them, asking for invoices and particulars—I saw the prisoner about it, and showed it to him—he said he had procured the furniture from different auction rooms, that certain furniture was given to him, and others he had acquired from firms which were closed, and consequently it would be difficult for him to get invoices—I recommended him to take the claim, and state upon it to the best of his ability where he had acquired the property—within a few days he brought to me a document, of which this is a copy, purporting to show where the different things were bought—I did not forward that to Brown, Roberts, and Radmall—I saw the prisoner within a day or two, and said that that information would be no use to the surveyors, because it was too vague—I advised him to go through the claim itself, and give better information, and send it him<lb/>self to the surveyors—I had advised him some time prior to this that we could not act for him—I first told him that within a week of the fire—I declined to act because the whole surroundings of the case were so extremely suspicious; I told him so—the prisoner called at our office thirty-eight times, and Barnard called, either separately or with the pri<lb/>soner, twenty times—during the whole of these interviews they spoke about the fires and the origin of the fires, and prisoner, in Barnard's hearing, told me about the origin of the fire in Abbotsford Avenue—my partner was present—at the first interview he gave, as the cause of the fire, the accidental upsetting by his wife of an oil lamp; subsequently he gave me fully to understand that he knocked the lamp over himself—about a week after his first statement he informed me that he had got the whole place packed up; the front windows stowed with furniture, in such a way that nobody could get in from that part to extinguish the fire, that he had lamps distributed all over the place among the furniture, filled with benzoline, and that he had knocked over this lamp purposely in the hall; that there were curtains and loose stuffs all surrounding it, and that the lamp had fallen on it and fired it—he did not tell me as to anything being put on the furniture—he said the better part of the furni<lb/>ture was upstairs, and the inferior downstairs, so in case the fire did not reach the upper floors, the assessors of the insurance office would come to the conclusion that the whole of the furniture was of the best description—there was conversation over the whole of this period; it was common knowledge throughout all fire circles, or there was very strong suspicion</p>

               <p>that this was an incendiary fire; that was my own knowledge—he told me about other fires—Barnard was not present then; he did not appear for some time afterwards—the prisoner spoke about the linen airer fires—he said that he had had a claim against a company, and I think he gave me the amount which had been arrived at by the company's surveyors, and that the claim was not settled quick enough, and he would get the linen airer over again, to make them pay quicker—the assessor in that case was Mr. Montague Gregory, of the Manchester Office—he also in the early days spoke about Barnard, and told me how he had got someone to go to the police and get a warrant against Barnard for something in respect of come salvage that he had received in respect of a previous fire—there seemed at that time a very strong antagonistic feeling between the two, in fact Warner gave information about Barnard, and Barnard was telling me about the prisoner in the absence of each other—for a long time the prisoner represented himself to be Alfred Warner, a man of property, having freehold property at Dover and Folkestone—he told me about this bill of sale, how he had removed the furniture there—I advised him to go on if the fire was genuine, they would support him as to the value—I said to him, "If you have freehold property at Dover and Folkestone why did you borrow money under a bill of sale, and pay a very heavy per<lb/>centage, whereas on freehold property you could have got it at three or four per cent.?"—his idea seemed to be to use our name, anticipating the difficulty of getting the insurance office to settle, and writing to money<lb/>lenders to lend money, telling them to the effect that he was insured for £700, and that a claim had gone in for so much—on the 3rd December the prisoner brought Barnard—this is a copy of my call-book—the prisoner came in and said, "Barnard is outside, shall I bring him in?"—I said, "Certainly"; from that time the two seemed friendly again when they were together—on 5th December, by my dictation, this letter was written by the prisoner—he gave it to me to take to the assessors—from the very first I advised him to withdraw his claim—I did not deliver the letter to the assessor; I showed it to Mr. Radmall, senior, and asked him if he would like to retain it—he said "No," and I have kept it ever since.

               <p>you had lived at Walthamstow—the Walthamstow fire was mentioned—I cannot remember any distinct statement on your part that you had lived at Walthamstow—you made very few admissions lo me, only that you had set fire to the place, and kicked the clothes-horse over—I don't remember seeing Mr. Woolley in my office after the fire when he said he was perfectly satisfied with your character, and would lend you money at any time—I remember seeing Mr. Woolley at my office with you and your solicitor; I believe he said something totally different; I will tell you if you press me—I have not seen Barnard five or six times since the warrant has been out for his apprehension—I should not think he had great influence over you; I should think you had influence over him—I had a very bad opinion of him—you called on me on 26th, 27th, and 29th October; on the 31st you called twice, on 1st November three times, on 2nd November three times, once on the 3rd and three times on the 5th—on four occasions you called three times in one day—I returned your original claim to you some ten or twelve days after the fire, I should think—the total amount claimed by that was between £727 and £730, I think—the first time I saw you was when you brought that claim—if I said at the Police-court that it was not so much your fraud as a man as your inhumanity as a father that decided me, I must have misunderstood the question put tome; it was the whole affair, not one more than the other; your own line of action and your conversation—I decided that I would have nothing more to do with the matter almost directly after you had sent in the claim—I gave you distinctly to understand, and I gave you the best advice I could give you; that was to abandon your claim; and eventually you acceded to what I suggested, and wrote the letter which I took to Mr. Radmall—I told you over and over again that there would be no settlement of your claim, that the insurance company never meant to settle it—I do not remember you coming to my office and saying you had instructions to meet Mr. Radmall, nor advising you what to say and do, and asking you to come back and let me know how you got on—at your first visit to me you introduced yourself as Alfred Warner, and said you had had a fire, and held a cover note from the Guardian Company—that would be the 26th October—the next day you brought the claim—you came and told me you had had an interview with Mr. Radmall—you told me Mr. Greenwood had come, and offered to act for you—I advised you to tell Mr. Radmall that you had had the offer from Mr. Greenwood, and ask him if it would be wise to let him have the matter to deal with—I have no recollection of your telling me, about the beginning or middle of December, that Barnard had left Tottenham, and that you did not know where he had gone—I did not advise you that he was a cunning fellow, and that you should be careful of him—you seemed to be frightened of Barnard, and Barnard of you—when Mr. Radmall's letter came, asking where the goods came from, I advised you to give correct information—you told me, at an early stage, that you had got furniture from your mother, who lived in a village in Somersetshire, ten miles from a railway station, and so they would have difficulty in verifying the statement—we heard what you suggested; we made no suggestions—my advice from the earliest stages was to abandon your claim—you did not say that some of the things were formerly Barnard's, and came from Hoi lings worth's; I found that out myself, a long time after—I found that and the</p>

               <p>three days after the claim went in, the suspicious nature of this fire, the cover note, the nature and quick action of the fire—you had not then communicated the facts to me—I could not tell you who was the first person I told that you had told me you set fire to the place—Rad<lb/>mall had a suspicion of the matter, and there was no reason for me to htell him; he had a knowledge of the suspicious circumstances of the case—the matter was being spoken about by everybody—I am in the habit nearly every day of meeting insurance managers and surveyors, and this matter always cropped up—there was no necessity to help Mr. Radmall; he had his information and his assessors, and means of acquiring infor<lb/>mation, and far better means than I had—he did not want any other information—Barnard's last call on me was on 13th February—the last time you called was on 31st December—Mr. Marks saw you then—I first knew of the warrant being out for Barnard one or two days before the 13th February—I did not tell him there was a warrant out for his arrest when I saw him—I swear the amount of the original claim you brought was not £540 3s.; it was above the amount that was sent in—I did not say we must put on a bit for knocking off, we never do that—I did not alter the price of a picture from £15 to £25—I pointed out to you the extraordinary value you put on a picture, and the amount was reduced; I told you that Radmall would require information about the furniture—I did not find a name for the picture; I asked you if you knew whom it was by, and you told me some old master—I had never seen the picture; you described the picture, and I said, "Oh, yes, Virgin and Child"—there are fifty thousands of virgins and children painted; the title would not mean anything—I accepted your values—I did not add £115s. to a washing machine; you said it was on the hire system, and you had paid so much off—all the prices, I told you, would have to be verified, and invoices got—I did not double some of the original quantities; your claim was in excess of the amount that went in—I went through the whole claim with you—my commission was to be five per cent, on what was got,. and nothing more—this copy of list P of where you got the things from was made by my clerk—that does not suggest that I intended to send it in—I did it to keep full details of all the information you supplied me with—I did not tell you that the assessors looked on it as Barnard's fire and you as his tool—we knew nothing of Barnard at the early stages, and I did not know who you were—I have heard of Barnard for two years past, but I did not know anything of him—I knew nothing of the estrangement between you till you told me—the impression on my mind was that Barnard was a person who had made fraudulent claims; I knew that before the prisoner came to me—Barnard has had fourteen fires, five in King's Road, Chelsea—all his claims were settled by the companies—he called on me early in December, first, I think—he and you came to my office, and I saw you; you up to 31st December, and Barnard up to 13th February—you and he were always in and out of my office; the door was open, and you walked in—I could not over one way or the other; I was not attempting to settle the matter—you were giving me information, and I was informing the insurance company—you made an open confidant of me; you spoke, not only before me and my partner, but before the boy, and Montague Gregory—you laughed over that fire,</p>

               <p>made an open boast of what you had done and what you intended to do in the future, and you showed policies in the Kent and the Westminster, and you said you had taken out a policy on your lodgings, in the Imperial, and I thought it was a matter of public policy that these matters should be investigated—the reason you made a confidant of me was because you thought you had done a very clever action, and that it was a very fine line of business; and you made a sort of boast of everything you had done—I think all the statements you made are true, and that they have been verified—I told you several times the company would never settle your claim—no doubt I received this telegram on 25th October—my clerk went to Tottenham; I do not know whether you accompanied him back—you knew from within a week of the claim going in that we could not settle the matter for you, and were not going to act for you—you told me the police were on the matter, and were making investigation down there—from that and our own suspicions, and information and statements made to us by others, and what we heard about the fire, we knew the matter would never be settled, and that we could never settle it for you, and would be no parties to the settlement—we did not withdraw because we found there was nothing to be got out of it; we told you we should not ask you for any money—if the matter had been settled we should have received our charges in the ordinary course—if we had found nothing was to be got out of it, it would have been a sufficient reason for us giving it up to some extent, without hearing any self-accusations and confessions—you were boasting of what you had done and what you intended to do—within about eight days after I had seen you we determined to have nothing more to do with the claim.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The claim was forwarded to Messrs. Radmall on 30th October—a week after that I had an interview with Mr. Radmall, when I made certain communications to him; I said the whole circumstances of the matter were fraught with suspicion, and that every investigation ought to be made—the claim was left for them to investigate, and remained with them up to 28th November—I saw him from time to time upon other matters, and spoke to him about this in a general way—his letter of 28th November, calling for particulars, I answered by the letter of 29th November, giving somewhat general particulars, and on 30th November he wrote asking for information as to where every article had been pur<lb/>chased—I saw Radmall on the matter specially on 4th December, and said that we should retire from the matter, and that we should give him notice to that effect—I said I had placed the letter of the 30th before the prisoner, and that he had given me this written statement as to where he had procured the property; that we knew the statement to be entirely false, and did not send it to him—this is a copy of that statement—I got it a day or two after the 29th—I had my copy of it at the date of the interview with Mr. Radmall, the original having been handed back to the prisoner and forwarded to Mr. Radmall on 30th October—the prisoner called on 1st and 3rd December, after the receipt of Mr. Radmall's letter of 30th November—it must have been on one of those dates that I gave him the original of this document P—after I had handed the original of P back to the prisoner I saw Mr. Radmall, and I told him that the pri<lb/>soner's statements as to where he had acquired the property varied every time; that we could not answer the letter ourselves, as the information</p>

               <p>given by the prisoner was incorrect, and we declined to send it in, as he had given false information—I did not show Mr. Radmall the copy; he never saw it—on 5th December, when the prisoner called with Barnard, this letter was written, and on 10th December we withdrew by letter—our first requisition from Mr. Radmall was on 28th Novem<lb/>ber—I had heard of Barnard and these fires for two years past—I knew that his claims on insurance companies had been settled by the payment of large sums—there had been no charge made against him—the prisoner was arrested on 29th January—Barnard called on the 1st, 7th, and 13th February—I gave evidence on 15th February—I had not heard of the warrant for Barnard on 7th February, when he called; I heard of it two or three days before the 13th, when he came to inquire what was taking place at the Police-court—when he was at my office I sent a messenger in a cab to Bow Street Police-station—the messenger returned, and about half an hour afterwards two officers came to my office; but Barnard had then gone—that is the way in which the police knew of his visit to my office—I have not seen Barnard since then—we charge five per cent, on the amount we recover from the insurance office, and that covers disbursements and all expenses—it is the usual rate—we charge nothing if we recover nothing—I believe that is not the usual practice among insurance assessors; they make a charge in every case, I believe—the messenger I sent to Bow Street is not here; I can give his name, and I think he can be found in a very short time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Lewis—from the end of October throughout November I saw the prisoner on several occasions when he called—he first made a statement to us, in the hearing of each of us, with regard to the share he had in the Abbotsford Avenue fire about the middle of November—he said the furniture had been brought to Abbotsford Avenue, and specially disposed for the purpose of burning—the better class of furniture was placed in the upper room, and the inferior furniture in the lower rooms; the furniture in the lower rooms specially laid with regard to the necessary draught that a fire requires—then benzoline was thrown over it, and some curtains were placed on the top of the furniture; then it was fired by himself; that a man named Barnard was there at the time; that he had been told it was a difficult thing to burn down a private house, but that he had done this job too well; he had only intended the furniture in the lower rooms to be burnt, so that the surveyors would take the better class furniture, which was in the upper rooms, as a sample of what was supposed to be in the lower ones—he said he was standing at the back por<lb/>tion of the premises; that the fire was burning between him and the front door; that a man came in at the front door; that the prisoner had a pail of hot water, which he threw over the man, and he never saw him again; that he then threw the pail through one of the windows of the back room, in order to create a draught—he first stated that the greater portion of the furniture upon which he was claiming was left him by his mother, who had died—he afterwards said it had not been left by his mother, but belonged to Barnard; that he claimed for two pianos—I asked him where he got them from—he said one of them he had taken in satisfaction of a betting transaction from Mr. Gray, of Hampstead—I asked him if he could produce Mr. Gray, if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189503250075"/>
               <p>it were necessary; but he said he had gone to America—he said the other piano he had bought under the hammer at some auction rooms at Finsbury, I think—that information he gave us much earlier—early in December (it must have been after the 3rd December) he came to the office with Barnard—they said they had been to see Mr. Blaiberg with reference to a loan; that Mr. Blaiberg would lend them £150 if we would write a letter, saying that we had sent in a claim to the Guardian Fire Office for so much money; that there was no dispute; and that if we would do that they would give us £25—we refused to do it—between the prisoner's coming to us and Barnard's coming to us we had been making inquiries in regard to the prisoner, and we had received information with regard to him and Barnard—I knew my partner was in communication with Mr. Radmall, and he informed me from time to time as to the course he was pursuing in the matter—early in December we withdrew from the case, but we decided to do so before, and not to persevere with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen a copy of the evidence I gave at the Police-court—I said I was suspicious of you from the first; and I said, "When he made these statements to us I thought he did it thinking we would lend ourselves to his fraud; he informed me there was in Totten<lb/>ham four water companies, and that this house was just in the middle of the four, so that when the fire broke out it would be the question whether the key of the right main would be forthcoming; when the engine arrived it brought the wrong key, and they had to send back for the right one, and consequently it was forty minutes before there was any water avail<lb/>able for the fire"—I have seen Barnard several times since I have known you—part of the reason for his calling on us with you was in reference to borrowing money—he had represented that he had an interest in the claim; he said that if no money was recovered from the company he should lose £300 or £400—you never admitted your name was Walsh—I asked you once if it was, and you denied it—that was after we had with<lb/>drawn from the matter—you would not admit that you had lived at Wal<lb/>thamstow; you denied it—you told me where both pianos were supposed to come from—I never saw Mr. Radmall—I think the police officer in charge of the case was the first person to whom I said that you had said you had set fire to the house and all the things—I think I can tell you the date from the call-book—Mr. Lewis was present when I gave the statements—he gave his afterwards, I think—I think I was present when he made it to the police officer, and to the solicitor in charge of the case; at the same time, I believe it was—no statement of mine was taken down—I don't think I made any detailed statement of my evidence—the statements you made were not in your favour—about the middle of November you made the statements about the fire—before that you made a statement about the pianos—I think all your statements about the fire were made in Mr. Lewis's presence—I cannot assign any object you could have, or any benefit you could gain, by making such admissions—I should think you probably did it from boasting; you wished to boast how clever you had been in burning down a private house—the suggestion about writing to Blaiberg came from both you and Barnard, one after the other, at the same interview—we did write a letter to Mr. Blaiberg on 6th November—this is a copy of the letter.

               <p>had not been to the office then—I knew you went to Wardour Street to borrow money, and I knew that the letter would not help you in any way—that was the only letter we wrote to Blaiberg—I think T heard you mention Hollingsworth—you mentioned that Barnard had a bill of sale with Hollingsworth, and that part of the furniture that was burnt at Abbotsford Avenue was the property of Barnard, and had come from Hollingsworth—I could not fix the exact time when you told me that; I should think it would be at later interviews, but I cannot bind myself to the date—you told me Barnard had no interest in the goods—I cannot bind myself whether you mentioned about the bill of sale and Barnard in Lewis's presence, but as far as I remember you did not tell Lewis in my presence that some of the goods were Barnard's—I may have mentioned those things to Lewis; I cannot swear—I think you mentioned towards the latter part that Barnard had left Tottenham very suddenly, and had not let you know where he had gone—that would be after the 6th December—Barnard had had a good many fires—that sort of fires does not bring work to us—he had a bad reputation—I had a very strong opinion of him, but it was not a good one—I believe I said the company would sit still and force you to arbitration, and would never pay a penny—I should think at the beginning of December we said we refused to act for you any longer—we told you a few days before the letter of 10th December; it was on the 5th, I think—we told you it was perfectly useless for you to think you were ever going to get any money from the Guardian Fire Office—I was present when the letter of the 5th was written, so was Barnard—you brought two state<lb/>ments showing where you bought goods—we declined to send them in—I think the remark was made that they were useless; that they could trace nothing—I said, "It is perfectly useless to send in such a statement"—if they could trace anything it would be useful to them—I don't remember if Barnard was present when you brought the detailed statement showing where the goods came from—I did not hear Mr. Lewis say he would not trust his reputation to Barnard—I supplied you with a foolscap envelope for the purpose of sending this claim to Brown, Roberts and Radmall; that was immediately after or before we had withdrawn; I think it was after—I was present on 5th December, when you brought a letter which Mr. Lewis said would not do, and he partly dictated the letter that was sent on that date, and it was partly written at your suggestion—my recollection is, we were persuading you to withdraw from the claim, and eventually you took our advice and made up your mind to withdraw, and you brought with you that morning a letter which you thought would meet the case—the letter was written to us, not to the company—it was one way of withdrawing—Mr. Lewis showed it to the company's surveyor—we took it as a withdrawal of the claim—I cannot say whether Mr. Lewis showed it to Mr. Radmall that day or not—that letter was certainly not written with a view to try to bring about a monetary settlement—on the 10th we wrote to the surveyors, withdrawing from the claim—we practically decided to with<lb/>draw before the letter of the 5th—I am not satisfied that several things I allege you told me are untrue—I will not admit that the letter was written as a last resort to try and get the company to settle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the House Fire Department of the Guardian Insurance Company—in October, 1894, a claim was made against our office for £700 in respect of a fire on 24th October—in the ordinary course I handed that claim on to our assessors, Messrs. Brown, Roberts, and Radmall, finding from our agent that the cover, or provisional receipt, had been given to the assured on 23rd October—the effect of such a receipt is to bind the company provisionally until the matter is submitted to the head office, and dealt with in the way of being accepted or declined—the company is bound by the act of its agent till one or other of those two events takes place—the company, through its assessors, asked the prisoner for a detailed statement as to each item in the claim—this letter, dated December 17th, written by the prisoner, and purporting to forward a detailed list, with all particulars, was shown to me by Mr. Radmall, to whom it was addressed, and the statement appended to it. (<hi rend="italic">In the list were two pianos, one stated to have been received, in settlement of a betting transaction, from T. Bennett, on October</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1894, <hi rend="italic">and the other to have been bought through an advertise<lb/>ment in a daily paper, about six months ago</hi>)—these two unsigned receipts (C and E) were not issued or authorised by the Guardian Office—these letters (A and D) were not written under the authority of the Guardian Office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Brown, Roberts and Rad<lb/>mall, assessors for fire losses, and, among others, to the Guardian Assurance Company—about October 30th I received the claim forwarded through Messrs. Lewis and Marks, amounting to over £700—in the ordinary course we should investigate a claim of that magnitude, and take some time for an investigation—that would be known to Messrs. Lewis—on November 10th, 1894, I had an interview with Mr. Lewis—that was the first time I had seen Mr. Lewis after the receipt of the claim—he then gave me certain information, knowing that I was the assessor to the Guardian Office—our investigation lasted till November 28th, and on that day I wrote to Lewis and Marks for further information, and I received this letter of November 29th in reply—I answered that on November 30th—on December 3rd I had an interview with Mr. Lewis, and he made a further statement to me—that was followed by a visit by him to me on or about December 6th, when he showed me a letter from the prisoner, and made a statement to me in regard to the case—on December 10th he wrote, retiring from the case, and I received on December 17th an ex<lb/>planation of where the articles were purchased, purporting to come from the prisoner himself—I afterwards saw two documents of January 2nd and 3rd, said to have been written by the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">These were written on the same sheet of paper, one was addressed to the prisoner's wife, and the other to the salvage officer.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I visited the premises on 26th October, I left my card with the salvage man, instructing you to call on me—I had no means of judging whether the best furniture had been upstairs—I could not get upstairs; there was no ladder—that was the only occasion I saw you—I received a letter from Mr. Lewis on the 29th November, which I answered on 30th—you said you had not had time to unpack all your furniture; you had put some up in the bedrooms and done what you could—you told me there was a bill of sale on the goods, and I asked you to whom it was, and for how much, and you replied—I never told Mr. Lewis I would not settle unless you went to arbitration; I did not lead him to believe so—I did not think there was a large quantity of furniture in the house—neither Mr. Lewis nor Mr. Marks made any communication to me as to these alleged conversations of yours prior to their withdrawing from the matter—they never told me any of your conversations—in the claim two or three skin mats are claimed for.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE COLLINS</hi>. "<hi rend="italic">I think both objections have failed. First of all, with regard to the objection upon the Vexatious Indictments Act, it is hardly necessary to add anything to the suggestions I made during the argument. Convenience is obviously in favour of the contention of the Prosecution, and the words of the Act do not oblige me to take a different view. The clear effect of the earlier Act was to prevent the preferring indictments framed upon something for which the prisoner was not committed, whether the facts relating thereto did or did not appear upon the depositions, without the written consent given of a Judge of the High Court. That was found to be a great practical inconvenience so far as it excluded counts based on matters which appeared in the depositions, and of which, therefore, the prisoner had ample notice. The amending Act met this difficulty and made it lawful to add new counts, provided they were such as could be lawfully joined with the rest of the Bill, and provided they were, in the opinion of the presiding Judge, founded on facts disclosed upon the depositions. But in my judgment it was no more necessary to obtain the opinion of the Judge before hand on the one point than on the other. He must decide if the point be raised whether a count was properly joined, and he must decide if the point be raised whether it is founded upon facts disclosed in the depositions; but I do not see why his opinion is a condition precedent in the one case any more than in the others. The concluding clause of thie section makes this still clearer by reserving a general power of presenting any Bill, with the consent of the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I agree, therefore, with the view of the learned</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I hold that the count impugned is founded on facts stated in the depositions Then as to the point that the truth of the pretences is not negatived by a separate specific averment. The pretences are stated to be false, and they are specifically set out, and nothing but the clearest authority could induce me to give effect to such a piece of technicality as to require a further averment negativing the truth of that which is already stated to be false, I think I</hi>

J. Clarke, the other seems to be in the same handwriting as the third and fourth, as far as I can judge—I knew Clarke at that time as a private inquiry agent, and I knew that he had been employed in this suit before—on April 25th I prepared an affidavit, which was sworn to by Clarke—that affidavit, with others, was filed in Court for the purpose of dispensing with the service of the citation on the co-respondent—it was sworn to by Clarke and signed by him—I never saw him write the signature to this other affidavit—it seems to be the same as the signature to the reports.</p>

I was 22 years old on September 6th last—on June 1st, 1891, I was married to John Edward Barrett, at St. Pancraa Church, London—I met him in India, where he was employed in the Civil Service—up to that time I had lived most of my life in India—I had a disagreement with my husband five weeks after our marriage, in consequence of which I left him for a time—I left him on August 2nd, and went to Paris—he followed me, and persuaded me to return, and I forgave him—I lived with him for a short time at Hastings, and afterwards at St. George Road, Pimlico, and I finally left him on February 15th, 1892, as he wanted his sister to come out and live with us in India—I would not agree to it, and he struck me—having left him, I went first to reside at a boarding house, 32, Foxton Road, Earl's Court—I then instructed Messrs. Greenwood to take proceedings for a judicial separation—I had been an orphan for a number of years, and had no friends in London—I was a perfect stranger—soon after I arrived at Foxton Road a person who called herself Countess Carina came to live there; she went exactly opposite first, and stayed there two days—she immediately sought my acquaintance, and I received a great deal of attention and sympathy from her during the two days she was there—I told her I was going to move, and gave her my proposed address—I moved on March 7th to 166, Earl's Court Road, and a person calling herself Watson came there as a boarder, the prisoner Lyon—she made my acquaintance almost immediately; she said that her husband was an electrical engineer, and was away a great deal, and she had a lonely life, having no children, and was seeking for a young companion—she told me all her troubles, and I told her mine, and she asked if I would be her companion—I had no means of living then except the prospect of getting alimony, but I afterwards got an order for £44 a year pending the suit—I told her I would think over the matter; I finally accepted it next day, or two days after—on March 14th I went out with her to look at some rooms which she had engaged, and met my husband in the street near Victoria Station—I pointed him out to her, and to avoid him I went</p>

               <p>into a stationer's shop; she said she would follow him and see where he went, and bring back evidence against him if he went anywhere where he ought not—she left me, and I went back to Earl's Court Road—she came back late—I was asleep in my room, and she woke me and told me she had followed him all day long on top of an omnibus, and he enjoyed her conversation very much, and he had gone to Bedford, and she knew him to be what I represented, because he winked and blinked at her all the time—I think she was at Earl's Court Road for a week—I was on inti<lb/>mate terms with her—she was very friendly—she used to be out all day long and come home late, when I was asleep, and she would come into my room and wake me up to give me news of herself and family—on March 15th she said she would stay a little time in town, and took me to see rooms which she had engaged, but the woman said she would not let them, and then she took me to 30, Denbigh Street—she left on the 15th, and on the 17th I received a telegram from her and went straight to 30, Denbigh Street—I arrived there half an hour before her, and we took up our quarters together there—she said that we both had bad husbands, but Mr. Barrett was the worst of the two—she said, "Let us go to some place of amusement," that the Empire was very good, and she made me change my dress and put on a smarter one, and did my hair up—she paid 5s. each for the tickets; she borrowed the money of me—I had never been there before—when we got there she borrowed another 10s. for champagne, and we had it together—we went into the 5s. seats, and she said she would look round and see if any of her friends were present, as when she was hard up she was always sure to get a £5 note out of them, and advised me to do the same, and said she would introduce me to her friends—she left me, and went and looked round, and brought the prisoner Clarke, and introduced him as Mr. Stephens, of the Stock Exchange—he asked me how I liked the performance, and after a little while he asked me to go with him to a private hotel—he did not say what for "—I said no, I would not go—he then asked me to go to supper with him at the Cafe" Monaco, and said that Mrs. Watson would come also if I did—we all three went there and had supper, for which Clarke paid—we had more champagne—he drove us home in a cab to Denbigh Street, and kissed the female prisoner and wished her good-night, and wanted to kiss me, but I declined—I went to other places of entertainment with her two or three times—she took me to the Alhambra about a week after, March 17th, and introduced me to two men there, and suggested that if I went to a private hotel with one she would go with the other—she gave me their names—I declined to go—after that we went to the Empire again on March 23rd or 24th—the visit to the Alhambra was between the two visits to the Empire—we took 3s. seats at the Empire—as we went in I noticed a man behind me; she pointed him out as the son of Mr. Charles Wilson, M.P., and said he was the only rich man there—she left me to see if any of her friends were there, and this man then came up and spoke to me, and while he was talking she came back and said, "This is Mr. Charles Wilson"—he said, "Yes"—she said, "I know your brother well; how is he?"—he said, "Yes, I have often seen you with him," and he pressed me to go to a private hotel; Rupert's Hotel—she left me, and he pressed me again to go to an hotel—I refused,</p>

               <p>and then he pressed me to go to supper at the Cafe Monico—I went with him and left her behind at the Empire—she was not present when I arranged to go there with him—she was in sight, but I do not think she could hear what I said to him—he asked me at supper if I knew his brother—I said, "No"—he said, "It is very strange," and asked me if I knew Lord Wolesley and Lord Kiinberley; I said, "No"—he was greatly surprised—he said that he had a yacht, and that his father lived in Grosvenor Gardens and in Yorkshire, that he had taken a fancy to me, and wanted me to receive letters from him, under cover to Mrs. Watson—before we finished supper he pressed me very much to meet him next day at Hyde Park Corner—when we left the cafe after supper I found the female prisoner waiting outside to take me home—she and I went home together—she said that Wilson was a very rich man, and ad<lb/>vised me to meet him, and asked me to receive letters from him—I am quite sure I did not tell her that he proposed writing—she said, "Have them addressed to me, and I will give them to you"—on the following day, the 25th, I met Wilson at Hyde Park Corner, and he persuaded me to go and look at some rooms, as he wanted me to go with him somewhere for a week—we drove in a cab to 19, Welling<lb/>ton Road, St. John's Wood—I went into the passage, and he went up and spoke to the landlady, and when he came down he said to her, "I had better pay for the rooms; here is my card;" but I cannot say whether he gave her his card—I think he said that she was to expect us on Monday; this was Friday, March 25th—I returned home to Denbigh Street, saw Lyons, and told her I was going with Wilson—she seemed very pleased, and said, "That is right, make the most of your chance, at money will be of use to you"—she said that she was going away for two days—when I left Wilson on Friday, he asked me to meet him on Monday at Hyde Park Corner at 1.30—Lyons was away on the Saturday and Sunday—she returned on the Monday morning, and I said that I had altered my mind, and did not think I ought to go away with Wilson—she called me a fool, and said that I ought not to lose such a good chance—she was very angry with me—I went to Hyde Park Corner that day to tell Wilson I could not go—I got there at 1.15, a quarter of an hour before the appointment, and saw Lyons shaking hands with Wilson—she saw me, but made no sign of recognition, and looked cross and angry—I told Wilson that the risk was too great, as I was a married woman—he said that my husband would know nothing about it—I took no luggage with me—we arrived at Wellington Road before two in the afternoon; I went to the rooms he had taken, a sitting-room and a bedroom—in the course of conversation I told him that I had no night-dress, and I went out to get one—we did not dine in the rooms that night—he asked me if I was going to a theatre that evening, and I found out when I got there that it was a music hall, the Metropolitan, in Edgware Road—he said it was a theatre that he was going to take me to—he had several drinks there; he went and ordered the drinks, I think—after the music hall, he took me to supper at some place, and had more drink there; I don't remember where it was; it was somewhere near by—we then walked a little way; first he went and got some more drink, and then we drove in a cab to Wellington Road; it was close on twelve o'clock when we got there—he was then very intoxicated—I</p>

My husband was in the Woods and Forests Department in India—we met in society before I was engaged—I was companion to a lady at Lahore—I mixed in society among the Europeans there—Mrs. Hawkes, my sister-in-law, was a widow with three children—I came home with her; I don't know that I was under her charge; I came home with her—we travelled together—my husband told me that she was coming to England to have her three children educated—she ultimately went to Bedford for that purpose—when my husband was in England he was on half-pay—he wanted his sister to live with us after our marriage—he always wanted the three of us to live together, not at Bedford, in India, and in England, at Bedford—I was in England when I was a child, but never in London—I did not go to the theatres—I went to a theatre once before I was married, with Mrs. Hawkes and my husband—I went to Paris on the 2nd August—I remained there six weeks, I think, I am not quite sure, away from my husband—my address was then unknown to him; it was known to my solicitor—I had a little money with me—I was at some private lodgings, not at an hotel—I did not know any persons in Paris before I went there; my solicitor, Mr. Simpson, recommended me to them—Mr. Simpson first acted for me as my solicitor, then Messrs. Greenwood—before my marriage I stopped three or four months with my sister-in-law; we did not pull well together, I never cared for her—when my husband came over it was only on leave, not permanently; only for a year I think—I did not object to going back to India; I did not want his sister to come out with me; he wanted her to come out—I cannot remember when His leave was out, but it was in a year's time—I did not want to have his sister out—I did not care whether I went with him or followed him—it was not my wish to return with him; I did not care—I told him I would follow him in the autumn—Mr. Wilson struck me as a gentle<lb/>man—he had a good appearance and good manners; he spoke like an educated man—I saw nothing <hi rend="italic">caddish</hi> about him till he snatched my purse—I made an allegation against my husband that he had struck me repeatedly in the face; he was cruel to me several times—I have alleged that Mrs. Hawkes encouraged him and said, "Give it her, Jack"—she incited him, she was all for him; that was because I did not wish to live with her—my husband had private means—Clarke struck me as a gentleman when he was introduced as Mr. Stevens of the Stock Exchange—the other two persons struck me as in the same rank of society; they spoke very well—when Mrs. Lyon told me if she was hard up she would borrow £5 of her friends, she was walking round in the Empire—I understood her to mean her men friends—that did not convey to my mind any idea as to the character of the woman I was with; I believed in her—I did not know the Empire till she took me there—I had no idea of anything improper going on with these men till Clarke suggested going to a private hotel in Rupert Street—no</p>

I put a blanket round him—I met Mr. Broomfield twice accidentally and once by appointment; my solicitors advised me to meet him, so that Wilson could be traced—I made a long statement at Bow Street, in which I told the story of the divorce pro<lb/>ceedings—I believe Wilson gave me the name of his club as the Con<lb/>stitutional—after I told my solicitor about Broomfield and mentioned the Constitutional Club the solicitor said he would advise me to keep up my acquaintance with him, because they wanted to find out Wilson and the woman through Broomfield—my ground for suggesting that Broom<lb/>field was acquainted with Wilson is the strange manner in which he came up and spoke to me, and then I recognised Wilson's hat on his head—he had the same hat on every occasion—he did not mention Wilson's name; he wanted to know about this affair, what had become of these people—I did not tell him in the first place about them; he asked me—the last time I saw him, when I met him by appointment, he wanted to know about the case—I cannot remember the date—I had not spoken to him about it; he seemed to know about it—I did not tell him proceedings were being taken against my husband; he wanted me to go with him to Southsea—when he spoke to me about my case that was the first word that had been mentioned about it—he said, "I know everything that goes on"—I told my solicitor that the last time I saw him he began to ask these questions—I believe he made a note of my verbal statement in my presence—I went to the Empire Theatre twice, and to the Alhambra between those two visits to the Empire—I don't remember the occasion when I returned home alone in a cab from the Empire—I may have been three times to the Empire, I can only remember twice—I may have remembered when I was at Bow Street having supper at the Cafe' Monico, and going home alone in a cab, I cannot remember it now—I went to the Cafe Monico to supper twice—my memory was more vigorous on 13th October than it is now—I went the first night to the Cafe Monico—I went on 23rd March, to the Cafe Monico with Wilson—Wilson did not give me the name of his club; he wanted to write to me; he asked me to write to him; he did not give me the address of his club—the removal from Earl's Court Road to Denbigh Street was not at my suggestion: Lyon asked me to be her companion—30, Denbigh Street was not opposite where my husband lived; it was close by—I did not suggest we should go to Denbigh Street in order to have an opportunity of seeing what he was doing; she wanted me to go and live there—I knew it was near where he lived—I did not keep observation on my husband while I was</p>

               <p>there; I had no curiosity to see what he was doing—I did not ask Lyon to receive letters for me under the name of Miss Temple; she wanted me to receive letters from Wilson under cover for her—the first visit to the Empire was 17th or 18th March, and my first meeting with Wilson 23rd March—I mentioned the Countess Carina to Lyons; she knew I used to go to her house—I have never lunched with the Countess Carina at the Cafe Royal, or at any restaurant—I lunched with her at her own chambers—I did not dine with her—I did not tell Lyon that on 25th March I had lunched with the Countess at the Cafe Royal, and that I had met the man I had spoken to at the Empire the night or two nights before; that is quite untrue—it is quite untrue that on the 19th I went with a gentleman to the Empire Restaurant, 40 and 41, Leicester Square—I don't remember what I did that evening—I never kept a diary—I don't think I was questioned in the Divorce Court about what I did on 19th March; I believed I was asked about it at the Police-court—I went nowhere that evening—I was not at Victoria Station on 20th March—I was in Denbigh Street—I went to Victoria Station two or three times while I was living at Denbigh Street; once when I met Wilson, and he brought me back to Victoria Station and left me there, and once when I met him accidentally, just before the divorce proceedings—I was not living in Denbigh Street then—I went to Victoria Station once, I think, to post a letter—it would be a most natural thing to do to go to the letter-box to post my letters, which were frequent—I can only recollect being at Victoria Station three times—I was not frequently there—I remained indoors the whole day on March 20th, 1892; I often remained in the whole day—I have, not been asked before to-day what I did on March 20th—I should certainly know if I met a man on that day—I did a deal of painting at that time—I told Lyon when I was at Earl's Court that I was in the habit of going to take lessons from Miss McGregor—I did not go there after I went to Denbigh Street—I have never been into Russell's Coffee Rooms—it is an entire fabrication in the report about the 21st March—I have only my recollection to go by as to what I did on that day—I never went to the Burlington Arcade up to this time—I don't remember if Lyon was in my company on March 21st—on March 18th I joined Mrs. Watson at 30, Denbigh Street; on the 23rd I met Wilson—Mrs. Watson used to go out all day; she was in Denbigh Street, and I was living as her companion she used to be in in the evening—I used not to go out with her—she used to go out by herself in the day, and take me out with her at night—I remember saying that I did not go out with her during the day, I only went out with her at night—I only remember going out with her by day on March 14th—that was before we went to Denbigh Street—after that I was not out with her every day when at Denbigh Street—I charged Lyon with larceny at the Police-court—after an exhaustive hearing the charge was dismissed, because the pawnbroker could not remember her—soon after I received the citation I made a statement to my solicitors, which was embodied in what I swore at the Police-court, I believe—I don't know that it differs from what I have said to-day.</p>

I heard them come in, we listened for them—next morning my daughter and I went up to do the rooms—we went into the sitting-room together,—whilst there the lady called to me—I could not exactly hear what she said, and I went to the door to her—she wanted a jug of hot water—she opened the door in her night-dress—I saw into the room—the bed was behind the door—the gentleman was in bed—I went and fetched the water—she opened the door, and I gave it into her hand—she shut the door, and I went away—we were doing the room—my daughter was there the whole time, and "he laid the breakfast, and they breakfasted together—after breakfast they left the house—they ordered dinner at seven—they were out all day—the lady came home first, about an hour or so before the gentleman; about six, or something like that—I sent my daughter up to ask the lady if she would have dinner up, and she said she would rather wait till her husband came in—they had dinner together—after dinner my attention was called to a loud noise in the drawing-room, as if knocking the chairs about, and I went up and asked what was the matter—the gentleman said there was nothing the matter, "We were only having a few words," and I went downstairs—after that the bell rang—the lady had lost her hat, or something—after a short time Mrs. Barrett came downstairs, where I was, and I lent her a piece of paper to wrap her night-dress in—she did not complain to me of having lost anything—she said she was going to her sister—she would be back in the morning, and she left some quarter of an hour after—I heard the sound of someone coming downstairs, like creeping down—of course we were listening; I was going to the door to meet him, but he opened the front door, shut it, and went away; before I could get to the door he ran; I only saw his back; he had not paid me anything beyond the 10s. deposit; he owed me the balance for the rooms and for the food—I never saw him again—next day, March 30th, Clarke came to the house and asked me whether we had any new lodgers come in—I said, "Yes, we had had some come in, but they had gone"—I said,. "Who are you?"; he said, "I am a detective; my name is Clarke; those people are the people I am looking for"—he asked me what the lady was like, and what the gentleman was like, and of course I told him; and then he showed roe a photograph of the lady; I said I thought it was her—he said, "No doubt you will have to be called on in the divorce suit"—I said, "What is it about?"; he said, "There is a case coming on for a Mr. Barrett, and this is the wife"—he asked to see the rooms they had occupied, and I showed them to him—he went away then—one day afterwards, when I was out shopping, Clarke met me and said he wanted me to go and swear an affidavit, and I went and swore it (<hi rend="italic">this was on the</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>)—that was at Seymour Place, Marylebone Road—as I was going in I saw Mrs. Watson (Lyon) talking to Clarke—I was at the trial in the Divorce Court during the hearing; I saw the two prisoners there—a few days after the divorce proceedings were over, Mr. Barrett and another gentleman came to my house.</p>

I am caretaker at 11, Artillery Buildings—I know Clarke as Mr. Reynolds—he took some rooms there with Mrs. Reynolds, the other prisoner, on July 15th, 1893, and was there eighteen months—I last saw Mrs. Reynolds on a Thursday at the end of last year—about the end of January I received this letter.</p>

On 31st May, 1892, I was at Victoria Station with Mrs. Barrett, and saw Allen, a ticket inspector, walking up and down the platform in conversation with the prisoner Clarke—Allen introduced Clarke as Mr. Clarke, a private detective, and introduced me as Sergeant Edwards—Clarke said, "Do you want me"?—he afterwards said, "I hear you have a warrant for someone; do you come from Scotland Yard, or from Waltham Street"?—I said, "From Waltham Street"—Mrs. Barrett, who was standing close to me, said, "Who is this man," pointing to Clarke—I said in Clarke's hearing, "This is Mr. Clarke, a private detective"—she said, "I recognise him as Mr. Stephens, of the Stock Exchange, who took me to a coffee-house, and wanted to take me to a private hotel"—Clarke said, "That is all right"—Mrs. Barrett said, "Where is Mrs. Watson, your female detective?"—he said, "I never make use of such things"—I left shortly afterwards—I was examined at the Police-court, and Mrs. Watson was liberated on bail—Clarke became her surety.</p>

On October 13th, 1892, I re<lb/>ceived this warrant from Bow Street for the arrest of the two prisoners, and a man named Wilson, and made every possible endeavour to arrest them—I could have arrested Clarke earlier than I did, I saw him every week, but I could not find Lyons; I made every possible search for her and for Wilson, and have done since—on January 12th this year, in con<lb/>sequence of information, I went to 2, Ventnor Villas, Lower Tooting, with Mrs. Barrett, and there saw Lyons—Mrs. Barrett said, "You are the woman we have been looking for for so long"—I said, "Mrs. Barrett identifies you as being Mrs. Watson or Mrs. Lyons; I am a police-officer, and have a warrant for your arrest"—she said, pointing to Mrs. Barrett, "I don't know that woman; my name is Lawrence"—I read the warrant to her, and the charges, that they did unlawfully conspire, confederate, and agree together, by subtle means and devices, to defeat the ends of justice, and also to procure Gertrude Alexandra Barrett to commit adultery—she said, "Mrs. Barrett knows it is wrong; how can she say such a thing? She was never in the family-way, and she knows she was not. As God is my judge, I never had anything to do with such a thing, but I am very sorry indeed for Mrs. Barrett"—nothing had been said by anybody to call forth she observation Mrs. Watson made; before I had finished reading</p>

E. Johnson; I put the order in it when the prisoner was close to me, and asked him to post it—he said, "Shall I put it in the pillar-box next door?"—I said, "Yes"—on the 15th I received a letter from Mr. Johnson—during the following week the prisoner came in once or twice, as I had promised to get him a situation—I told him the order had not been received—he said, "I suppose some b—postman has got it; you know where I live; I will always come forward and swear that I posted it"—he stayed away after that, and I sent for him, and asked him to write down that he posted it for me, and he did so—I saw him write this W.

I am a widow, and live at 188, Burridge Road, Plumstead—on March 10th I went to bed at about 12.15 a.m.—I left the doors and windows securely fastened—when I came down about 9.30 I found the room in confusion; my work-box and desk turned over, chairs overturned, and the gas on—in the scullery the window frame was broken in, and there were footmarks in the sink, which was under the window—I missed knives, forks, spoons, teapot, and several articles of clothing—these things are mine, except the teapot—I saw this property at the Police-station—I found this waistcoat lying on the couch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner at Rich mond—on Thursday, 21st February, I was called to the Police-station at Richmond—I there saw the body of a female child, which I judged to be about a month old—it was perfectly naked, with the exception of a white handkerchief passed twice tightly round the neck, and knotted in a double knot—the whole neck and throat were tightly constricted—I formed the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189503250110"/>
               <p>opinion that it had been dead at least twelve hours, how many more I could not say—I, came to the conclusion that most probably it had died from suffocation by strangulation, caused by the handkerchief—I made a post-mortem examination the next day, and the internal symptoms con<lb/>firmed my view of death from suffocation—externally you generally find in such cases the hands clenched, the tongue, more or less prominent, ap<lb/>pearing right up to the teeth, or pushed up to the gum, and extremely congested and blue—as a rule the eyes are wide open and staring, the eyelids well up, and the pupils may or may not be congested, sometimes the face may be congested—that is sometimes present, sometimes not—in<lb/>ternally you have to examine the state of the blood, and the state of con<lb/>gestion of the organs generally—the external appearances I have described were present in this case, the hands were tightly clenched, the tongue prominent, and the eyes wide open—I found no disease to account for death—the post-mortem appearances were in accordance with death by suffocation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The child was very emaciated—that was due to starv<lb/>ation—there was absolutely no food in the stomach or intestines, and hardly any fat on the body—it weighed five and a half pounds; the normal weight of a child of that age would be seven or eight pounds—it would suffer from exposure, and more so if unfed. I have never heard of a child suffering from convulsions on account of starvation and exposure—I have not met with or read of a case of the eyes becoming prominent from a handkerchief being tied round the neck after death, or the tongue becoming black; I do not speak from my own experience of such a case.</p>

I said, "I am just having a look down;" he said, "You are listening to me;" I said, "I was not, mind your own business;" he kept on abusing me—I took no notice; I called for a glass of ale—he said he was a much better man than I, and pushed me—the landlady said she would not have the customers insulted, and wished him to leave the house; he would not—he was not sober—I re<lb/>fused to be drawn into a quarrel with him—the landlady told Barkham to fetch a policeman—the prisoner caught hold of Barkham and pushed him down on his back in the bar—Barkham got up, went through the bar, got over the counter and went for the policeman Bridge, and returned with him—Barkham did not say or do anything to the prisoner; he simply obeyed his orders—the constable took his name and address, and the prisoner said, "Is that all you require?"—the con<lb/>stable said, "Yes"—he gave Barkham a paper, which he put in his pocket—the constable then went out; the prisoner followed him; I re<lb/>mained—the</p>
