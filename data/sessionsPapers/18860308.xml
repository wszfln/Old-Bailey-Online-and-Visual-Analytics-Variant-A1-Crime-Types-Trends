               <p>previous to that we asked him where the money was—he said he had made a fool of himself, he had used it; that was all we could get out of him—we asked him how much it was; he said it might be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—both the other trustees were present at the interview—we took the books and examined them, and made out this list, and we waited on the prisoner with the result, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he did not think it was quite so much.</p>

About 8.30 a.m. on 13th February I went to 11, Sweet Apple Court, with Detective Cooper and another constable—we went to the ground floor front room; Cooper knocked at the door, I can't say who opened it—the prisoner had just got out of bed and was in her night dress—I said, "We are police officers, and have a warrant to search your lodging for counterfeit coin and implements for making counterfeit coin"—she said, "You will find nothing of the kind here, whoever has given you information has told you wrong"—I saw nobody else in the room—behind a box which we could see very well at the side of the bed, I found this iron ladle, which appeared to have been recently used for melting; there were some bright spots on it—I also found this iron spoon on the washing stand by the side of the window—on a sideboard I found these two files, this tin containing a quantity of silver sand, and this copper wire—Cooper handed me a plaster-of-Paris mould from the chimney; the prisoner saw it in my hand, and rushed upon me and said, "You shan't have that," and in the struggle it was broken; these are the broken pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had had time to look at it before, and I could see distinctly that it was a mould for making counterfeit shillings on both sides—he also handed me six shillings, five unfinished and one finished—I said to the prisoner, "You will be charged with making this counterfeit coin with intent to utter it"—she said, "I have not uttered any"—I said, "You will also be charged with haying a mould and implements in your possession for making counterfeit coin—she said, "You have not got the mould"—I said, "Yes I have, such as it is now"—as she was dressing she said, "I suppose I shall get seven or ten for this"—Cooper also handed me two pieces of metal called <hi rend="italic">gets</hi>—I found this rent book in the room—at the police station she said, "You shan't have the pleasure of seeing me get seven years' for this, because I don't intend living long enough for it"—she had only one room.</p>

               <p>she gave twenty-five shillings for it, and gave it to me as a present"—I asked where his sister could be seen—he said "It is rather unfor<lb/>tunate, this morning she left Woolwich for Plymouth <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for New Zealand"—I said then it was no use making inquiries in that direction—he asked me what time the riot took place—I said as near as I could say about half-past four—I did not say anything about the riot—he said the nearest he was to the West End was the City, and he could prove that at five o'clock he was taking a bath at Kingston-on-Thames at a German lodging-house—I did not go there—at the station he simply said he did not steal the watch.</p>

I am a telegraph messenger at the post-office in Drummond Street—on 10th February the prisoner came in, and I followed him when he went out—I went up the right side of Drum<lb/>mond Street, but could not see him; I came down on the other side and saw him, and followed him from a public-house in George Street into the Lord Palmerston public-house in Hampstead Road—he went from there to the corner, to the Sol's Arms, and from there to a private house in Drummond Street—I went back and fetched a constable to the office, where I left him speaking to the clerk—I then went out again and saw the prisoner coming down Drummond Street towards the office with a young lady—I told him he was wanted inside—he went in and was then given in custody.</p>

On Monday morning, the 8th, the prisoner was brought to Old Street Police-station at 11.35 by Huntley, who stated that he had stabbed his wife—noticing blood upon his hands I ordered the constable to search him—whilst being searched he remarked "You have enough evidence to prove that she is stabbed "—that was all that passed at that time—I left him in custody at the station, and at once went to 26, Cowper Street, and saw the deceased lying in the passage, quite dead—I then went upstairs to the second floor back room with the constable, Burrage, who handed me this knife—there was blood all the way up the stairs—in the room I saw blood on the counterpane, and I saw marks as if a knife had been wiped; the knife appeared to have been wiped, there was slight blood on it—the woman was partially dressed, she had no boots on—the baby had been taken out of bed by Mrs. Telfer—I then returned to the station—I told the prisoner, "Your wife is now dead, you will be charged with the murder; anything you say will be taken down in writing, and given in evidence against you"—he replied "All I have to say is that she was unfaithful to me."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Commercial Road, Pimlico—on 7th October I inserted this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle.

(<hi rend="italic">Request<lb/>ing that he would call early, as he was in immediate want of a manager for a grocery and cheesemongery business, address Mr. Marshall.</hi>) Next day I went to 175, Rushmore Road, where I asked for Marshall, and saw Lewis—I showed him the letter—he said he was in want of a manager for a grocery and cheesemonger's business, and that he was going to open a place just close by at Stratford, which would be ready in a day or two, as soon as he could get out—he asked me what I could deposit; I told him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. security, as I thought it was necessary for a responsible position; he said 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I next saw him on 17th October, and went with him to 13, Dalston Road, where he engaged a room at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he asked me if I would mind being in the office till he could get the business ready; I agreed—my wages were mentioned at Rushmore Road as 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I paid him on 21st October 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this is the receipt he gave me. (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">from George Wallace as security against any defalcations, and to be returned at the end of a month's notice provided there had been no defalcations.</hi>) I remained at 13, Dalston Road and Tower Chambers with Mr. Lewis as a clerk till 9th January—he carried on a money-lending business and that of buying and selling businesses and arranging part<lb/>nerships—not much actual business was done—when I left him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was due to me for wages—on 9th January I asked for a return of my deposit; I got none of it back—I have seen Macrow very often at 13, Dalston Lane, he took no part in the business, but was just arranging business between Mr. Lewis and himself—I heard them one day talking about Mr. Palmer's affairs; Macrow wanted to sign the paper, to give Mr. Palmer back his 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard Lewis say to him "Don't be a fool, what I tell you and it will be all right"—no grocery business was opened at Stratford—when I parted with my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believed it was as a genuine deposit on my entering the grocer's or cheesemonger's business—Lewis represented himself as a man of money and a lieutenant-colonel in the Army.</p>

               <p>long, and you said afterwards you would not be humbugged about like that—he wanted money in advance, and you could not pay him because you could not pay me my wages, and I know you had not any money; sometimes I had to wait two or three weeks and got a half-crown or two shillings or sixpence at a time—you asked people to lend you money; the manager at Milk's you asked about this time—you did not afterwards decide to take that place by offering a quarter's rent in advance; you said I would not suit you—I don't know if you offered a quarter in advance—you asked me if I would sooner stay in the office, and I said I would sooner go into the grocery and cheesemongery, I had been used to that; afterwards I saw you were not in a position to take a shop—if I would rather have stayed in the office I should not have given you notice in December—I did not get all my 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at once—I should have got the same amount at the grocer's and cheesemonger's, but I should have got a place to live in, gas and coals, and house rent—you gave me no lodging—when money was left by persons seeking situations, you sometimes advertised to the full amount; you charged 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. also in" nearly every case—I have lent you money; you once paid me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was overdue—I gave you this receipt for arrears of wages—I can't remember if you paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as well—I swear the real cause of my leaving was because I could not get my wages from you—it was not on account of my misconduct with a young lady at the office, because when I gave notice you said "I am very worry you are leaving, I am very well suited with you"—I called at the office at Dalston Lane the following week, and fetched away some astrakan I had left there—I did not say to Burchall I was sorry I had to leave, I was very pleased, as I was no better off than a beggar all the time I was with you—you gave me no reason for not returning my deposit till I think 13th February, and then you accused me of having 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of a woman in Islington, and I found it was a mere excuse for not paying me, as you had the money yourself, and having told the woman you wanted her apartments for a gentleman, and that you charged half-crown as commission, she gave you a half-sovereign, you had no change and kept the half-sovereign—you did not charge me with having the half-sovereign—you did not say to Macrow that it would be foolish not to work on—I have often heard you use words to the effect you did about him being a fool and not to sign the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Southampton Street, Pentonville—on 28th November I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle:</hi>—"A young man wants to join another in business; coffee shop or greengrocer's preferred; about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to start"—Macrow called on me, he said he was a printer and manufacturer—I told him I knew nothing about the business; he said that did not matter, he wanted some one to come to his place and give out the work and receive it as it was brought in—he told me he did business of from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—I went to 13, Dalston Lane the same evening, I where I saw the two prisoners—Lewis said, "Are you Mr. Palmer"—I said "Yes"—he said, "Mr. Macrow is in want of a partner; this is Mr. Macrow"—Macrow said the same as he said in the morning, that he was in want of a partner to give out the work and receive it—I told him I knew nothing about the business, but I would not mind giving it a trial and that I would like a week's trial—Lewis said, "Well, w want a deposit, what will you put down now?"—I said, "Well, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., only I have not got the money with me"—this agreement was drawn up by Wallace (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Palmer agreed to become a partner with H. Macrow, and to pay</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and that he would deposit</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">with the understanding that he should pay the balance as agreed and that the</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">should be repaid, and on the other side it stated, "I, Palmer, agree to give Lewis power to hold the deposit of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">until the sum of</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">is handed over to Macrow"</hi>)—I went to Macrow's premises in Haggeston Road, they consisted of two cellars with two treadle printing machines, and paper bags, not a very large quantity, waiting to be printed on—shortly after he moved to Kingsland Road—I remained with him about five weeks; he did not find sufficient employment for me; no books were kept, I received no accounts—some work was brought in; I did boy's work, stringing up bags—on the fol<lb/>lowing week I made a further deposit of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is half of the receipt I received; I got this on 5th December, the name "J. Lewis" was on the other half—on my paying that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a promise was made that I was to be paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and an agreement was entered into by Lewis and Macrow as to the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I signed; it was that Lewis could hand it over to Macrow with my authority—on the 15th, when the agreement was drawn up, Lewis asked Macrow if any money was wanted to make the business good—Macrow said "Yes"—Lewis said, "Will you advance Mr. Macrow 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "No;" I advanced 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received one sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as wages—on 4th January I saw the two prisoners again at Lewis's office—Lewis and Macrow had a conversation about other business, and it was brought up about me—Lewis asked Macrow whether he was willing to cancel the agreement—Macrow said "Yes"—Lewis said to me, "You have no more to do with us, then; all you want now is your money"—I said "Yes"—he said, "want three days' notice from you to get it from the bank"—on the following day I made out a note and gave it to Lewis, and I went to him on the third day for the money—he said, "I will see you at 7 o'clock; I am going to the bank now"—we met then, he said he was very sorry, the bank was closed when he went, that he would see me to-morrow—I went to his office in Dalston Lane and he was not there—I went to his City office, 47, Tower Chambers, Moorgate Street; I saw him there—he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188603080033"/>
               <p>he was very sorry, he had had advice on my matter, and he wanted a letter from Macrow to say he was willing to cancel the agreement; that was after I had said I would have nothing more to do with Macrow—he said, "Go and find Mr. Macrow"—at that time Mr. Macrow was in his front office, as I saw his leg when the door was open, I could tell him by his boots—eventually Lewis offered me a bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on two or three occasions; I would not take it—he said he had borrowed some out of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 14th December, when I refused to take the bill, he said, "All right, if you won't take it I cannot give you the money"—I said I could take it to Court—he said, "All right, do as you like, you can see me in a felon's dock if you like"—this second agreement was made after the receipt of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">By this Macrow agreed that if Palmer lodged with Lewis</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for three months, on the understanding that during that time he would receive</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, at the expiration of three months the</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">should be placed to Macrow's credit; Palmer to be able to withdraw that sum after three months.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Lewis.</hi> On 5th December, when I signed the last agreement, you asked Macrow if he wanted any money—he said, "I want 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—after I left he did not say he wanted 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you told me to get a letter from Macrow authorising you to pay the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave it to you at 47, Tower Chambers on the Tuesday—I did not give you permission to use 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about two days before Christmas—you offered me on the Saturday to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday and the balance on the following Monday—I did not properly refuse to take it; I said, "I will not give you any proper answer to-day"—I don't remember saying I would have all or none—the Saturday I have mentioned was the 15th of January, I think.</p>

I do not profess to understand any<lb/>thing about the paper-bag manufactory or printing—I was very energetic about it the first week, but not afterwards when I got no money—I was on a salary at first—I came late, and smoked about the place, Macrow did not complain about it to me—Lewis had my deposit, I left it in his charge—the second agreement was made on 5th December—Lewis paid me one week's money—I went and saw Macrow by himself about the partnership being put an end to—I found him perfectly willing to put an end to it—I said, "I want you to sign a letter for me to Mr. Lewis for cancelling the agreement"—he signed it, he was not in the least unwilling to do so—I said, "That will give Mr. Lewis authority to give me my money back again"—I knew I was to get it back from Lewis—I had to call on Lewis with the letter on 12th January, the same day—I called on 4th January and on nearly every day—I told Lewis I and Macrow had come to an arrangement that the agreement should be cancelled, and then Lewis said he wanted three days notice, and I called repeatedly and could not get it—I said nothing about Macrow being there when I saw his legs: I should have done so—I went off without my money—on the next occasion I saw Lewis I said I had seen Macrow in the office, and he said he did not know it—I was to be paid nothing the first week, and nothing out of the profits—the second agreement men<lb/>tioned that I was to receive 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the profits.</p>

               <p>Buildings, where I saw Macrow—he said he wanted a printer to do printing in the day, and to travel in the afternoon, that he was doing about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and that he was thinking of extending it; that he would require about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as security, as he had been swindled a short time previously, and that my wages would be 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I agreed to enter his employment on those terms—my father paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him on the 24th—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the receipt.

I generally give the man about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10 per cent, off—in the case of these warrants I did not take a bill; then my interest is 15 per cent per annum—in this case the prisoner only wanted the money for a month—10 per cent, is deducted for commission, and there is interest charged at the rate of 15 per cent; 10 per cent, includes the valuation—on 24th April, 1885, I advanced him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque, and I completed that loan on 1st May by giving him a cheque for 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making the advance 157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. actually—my clerk drew up this docu<lb/>ment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and I signed it.

At the last trial I was laid up in bed with bronchitis—I am a partner in the firm of Rose, Smith, and Co., timber merchants, at Deptford—on 21st April I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This specified certain timber, and asked what prices they could offer.</hi>) In answer to that I called personally, as I usually do on a first application for goods, on 23rd April I think—Brew was not in, but an appointment was made for the next Saturday, the 25th, at 9 o'clock, at his shop—I called there and saw him—I told him I had received a letter asking for prices of timber, I looked round his shop and remarked "It is an ironmonger's shop, what do you want timber for?"—it was a</p>

               <p>somewhat unusual thing—he replied "I have some building land upon which builders are building, and I should like to supply them with timber as well as ironmongery"—we then went generally into the class of timber required, and I told him we would reply to his letter by a letter—that we did on the same day, giving prices—on 1st May the prisoner called at our office and asked for dock orders for timber—I sent them on to him on the same date, to the amount of 237<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—the prisoner has never paid for those—I have the goods in my possession—the dock orders were given, and never lodged, so that the goods never went out of our possession, and I have got them—there was a receiving order, and on getting that I went to the docks and found the goods still in my name, and I retained possession of them and sold them to other customers—I do not know of my own knowledge what the prisoner did with the dock orders, I never saw them after they went to him—Brew's name was on the dock orders—warrants are founded on the dock orders, and when the orders are lodged at the dock a warrant will be given, not before—I presume that any person having the dock orders could obtain money on them in the timber trade, even if he had not exchanged them for warrants—I never knew it done.</p>

I am manager to George Smith, pawnbroker and jeweller, of 163, Brompton Road—on 8th Oct., 1883, I sold some jewellery to Walter Belt—I knew him before that as Walter Belt—the jewellery was a diamond tiara for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a diamond necklace for 575<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a z pair of diamond earrings for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another pair of diamond earrings for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a half hoop ring for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I believe are the articles—he paid for them in notes—they were delivered to him at the time and he took them away—they are all secondhand jewellery, some of them are unredeemed pledges—I do not think Walter Belt stated what he wanted them for—I knew him as a dealer, more in jewellery than in anything else—I did not know him as a photographer at that time, I did not know his address then—this was not the first time he had bought anything of me, he had not bought anything to so great an amount—I cannot give the exact dates when he had bought anything, it might have been a few months before, perhaps to the value of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., perhaps 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 10th October he bought of me a cat's-eye diamond bracelet for 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it; also this horseshoe pendant for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this brilliant cross for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not tell me what he wanted them for—he paid me in bank notes in the same way—on 27th November, 1883, he bought of me a pair of diamond and pearl earrings for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I believe these are the same—also this pair of horseshoe earrings for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were all paid for in cash—on 12th January, 1884, he bought of me this large diamond spray for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't think he said what he wanted it for—he paid for it in cash.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEMP</hi>. Walter Belt dealt in miscellaneous property, which might be included under the term "works of art"—I did not tell him that all the jewels belonged to one lady—I probably said that some of them belonged to a lady, and he could have them cheap, and that was true—I did sell them to him cheap—I should not have sold them to the public at those prices; I should have charged more if I con<lb/>sidered them separately—there is no fixed price for jewellery of this description—jewels intrinsically worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are frequently sold for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more; there is nothing uncommon in that—there are diamonds and stones upon which it is very difficult to fix a value, fine stones, for which there is a limited sale—on certain things you might get an enormous profit, the great difficulty is to find a purchaser—all these stones would not be correctly described as old; I should say the stones in the tiara sold at 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were old stones—that was an article that had come into our possession by making an advance on it—I think the neck<lb/>lace at 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not an old jewel; it was not made up by us, we purchased it in the trade—I could not tell the date of the spray; I think it is foreign—I don't think the stones are very old; the mounting is foreign—I should hardly like to express an opinion upon it—I know that Walter Belt has traded as Coote and Co. lately.</p>

               <p>of these jewels were unredeemed pledges under special contracts belong<lb/>ing to different ladies, pledged at different times—some we bought at auction sales—the necklace and spray we bought; for the necklace we gave something like 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was shortly before the resale to Walter Belt, we had not had it longer—it might have been from Welby and Son that we bought it—the spray, I think, cost us about 515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I believe that was bought from Jones, of Long Acre—I should have asked you more for it, I do not think I should have cared to sell it in that way; I sold it to Walter Belt because he bought other things, and I considered him a dealer—I think we had the spray from Jones on approbation, I do not know that it was to show to Walter Belt, I am not sure about that, we frequently have things on approval—we sold it at a profit, I believe—the necklace from Welby was in the same way—we had not invested any money in the purchase of those two things—I do not think the same thing applied to several of the other things I sold to Walter Belt, I do not remember them—I never mentioned to, Walter Belt or any one else that these jewels were the property of a Mrs. Morphy, an ex-mistress of the Sultan, no name was mentioned, I never heard of such a person—I did not state to him that they were very old jewels of a person who under necessity was obliged to sell them; there was no statement made to him.</p>

Welby, manufacturing jewellers, of Garrick Street—he did not tell me any particular person for whom he was looking for jewellery—on 5th December that year he bought of me the diamond spray produced for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I got from Jones, manufacturing jeweller, of Long Acre—to the best of my belief the smaller of these two collect necklaces was the one I sold him, not the one I first saw—now I come to look at the two I do not believe either of these is the necklace I sold—it is nearly three years ago since I have seen them—450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represents about the value—I should call these modern stones on the smaller of the two—neither of these came from Welby—the one I sold to Walter Belt did not come from Welby, it was the property of a lady.</p>

I am manager to Welby and Sons, manufacturing jewellers, of Garrick Street, Covent Garden—on 14th October, 1884, I sold to Walter Belt this Cape diamond for 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and left it with us to mount as it is now, old-fashioned, as an old stone—we did it for him—he called on 6th November, paid for the mounting, and took it away—that was not my first transaction with him; we had a transaction on 4th October, 1884—no name occurred on the first trans<lb/>action, but on the second, on the 14th, he gave the name of Coote—he did not give any address or any description of himself—the transaction n the 4th was a diamond collect necklace for 362<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—to the best of my belief this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one—this was an article we had in stock; these are Cape stones—I made no statement to him as to how I became possessed of these two articles—they were paid for in cash—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are single-stone brooches; I do not identify them with any certainty; they are Cape stones—I think they have been in my stock, the two I am referring to, the third I do not recognise—if these are the two I believe they are, the price would be 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am referring to our sale book; it may or may not be my entry—on 11th November there is a sale of two stones of about this size; that is in the writing of one of our clerks—I see the entries from time to time; I see all the entries of sales, and know of the transactions—I do not think those two were sold to Walter Belt, not sold direct to him; they were sold to a diamond broker, who again sold them on commission for us—this third stone is a Cape diamond; the value of that is about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is the largest of the three—this diamond bracelet is not one we sold—the centre stone is Cape certainly; the value of it is about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I should think the weight of this stone is nearly 20 carats—I value a stone at per carat; the worth of two-carat stones being worth double than one, that does not apply to stones of this quality, on'y to rare and valuable stones—I value this stone at so much per carat,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188603080057"/>
               <p>it would not increase in value <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> according to the weight—in ordinary stones of this character a stone of 20 carats would only be worth 20 times one carat, that is the way it is valued in the trade—I can't re<lb/>cognise this jewel as having passed through our hands; I don't know where it comes from—large stones of this kind are not of a very specula<lb/>tive character; the market varies from week to week—in the retail busi<lb/>ness we do not frequently get a large sum for a diamond of this kind—we are wholesale dealers, we have retail customers—in selling we make a slight difference in favour of dealers—this is the jewel which was set as an old stone—the diamonds round the centre one of this bracelet may possibly be Brazilian stones, it has an old style of setting—this centre stone is an unusually large one—Walter Belt said he wished it set in the old style—I should say we did not suggest that, we should have no reason for suggesting it—I have no recollection of his asking me what would be the best setting, and my suggesting as an old stone, and his saying very well—I could not undertake to say that did not occur, I don't remember it—it would not be at all unusual for a customer to discuss with me the way in which a stone should be set, he would seek my advice upon it—I cannot undertake to say that Walter Belt did not do that—I did not know him as a dealer—I have a distinct recollection of seeing him three or four times, if not more—on some occasions he was seen by other per<lb/>sons in our firm—I can't say that we had had this stone in our possession long—I describe it as a Cape diamond, no other description; a fair bril<lb/>liant cut Cape diamond—there are such things as black diamonds, but they are very scarce; a black diamond looks almost like a piece of coal—no one would suppose this was a black diamond, it would not answer that description at all, it is a decided yellow.</p>

There are other things besides the weight of a diamond that affect its value; its color, shape, and brilliancy—a flaw would be detrimental to its value—there are times when flaws can only be seen by the aid of a glass—several circumstances affect the value; freedom from flaws would affect the price of a Cape diamond—we price our diamonds after they are cut—the cost price varies very much from 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a carat—I think the price was higher in October and November, 1888—I should think the difference between the present value and the value in 1883 was 20 per cent, more—I think 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to be added to represent the value of this.</p>

I am a solicitor—I am acting for Sir William Abdy in this prosecution—this matter was first put into my hands some few days before I wrote the first letter of 14th July, 1885—originally Lady Abdy was in England, and brought me the jewels—this is the letter of the 14th. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "To R. Belt, Esq. Sir,—We have been instructed by Sir William Abdy to commence an action against you for fraudulent misrepre<lb/>sentation in the sale of various jewels to him, whereby you have defrauded him of a very large sum of money; and further, to rescind an alleged</p>

               <p>contract for the purchase of jewels, and also to recover 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., money advanced to you. Sir William Abdy is now alive to the fact that under the pretence of friendship you have abused your opportunities, to deceive and defraud him; and, being satisfied of this, it is the intention of Sir William to carry these proceedings to trial. We have to request, during to-morrow, the name of your solicitor, to whom we may forward writ for undertaking, to avoid the unpleasantness of personal service upon your<lb/>self—Yours obediently, <hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS</hi> and <hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS.</hi>") In answer to that I received this letter, dated 15th July. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Gentlemen,—I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday's date, charging me with fraudulently misrepresenting to Sir William Abdy the value of certain jewels I procured for him at his express request. I most posi<lb/>tively deny the charge of fraud, having named to him such prices only as were given me by the person from whom they were obtained. I am quite ready to take back the jewels and to hand Sir William the money he has paid me for them, but I make this offer without prejudice to any question which may arise in case my offer be refused.—Faithfully yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD BELT.</hi>") I replied to that by this letter of 17th July. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Sir,—We are in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant. Sir William Abdy in no way withdraws the charge he has made against you, but inasmuch as you express yourself willing to take back the jewels, and return Sir William the money he has paid for them, we are prepared to accept that proposal. The amount you have received from Sir William Abdy for the jewels and interest, in connection with the two agreements, amounts to 8,410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that amount we shall require to be paid in bank notes against delivery of the jewels at 12 on Wednesday next. We shall also require repayment of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced by Sir William Abdy to you.—Yours obediently, <hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS</hi> and <hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS.</hi>") I then received this letter of the 22nd. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>; "Gentlemen,—In reference to your favour to me of the 17th July instant, I beg leave to say that as Sir William Abdy declines to withdraw the scandalous accusations he now makes against me, I withdraw the offer I made through you to take back the jewels. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> abundant written proofs in my possession to prove how unjust and false these accusations are. With regard to the alleged advance to me of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was given me by Sir William Abdy for various services I had rendered him, by his written instructions, in investigating a matter of a very delicate nature which the letters having reference to this busi<lb/>ness very fully explain, but which I should be very sorry should be made public. So much engaged was I in this business, and so much of my time wasted, that this 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not cover my loss combined with the money paid out of pocket for investigations, &amp;c.; and in respect of which I still have a claim against Sir William; I have also commissions for work from Sir William and Lady Abdy now in progress, and remain, faithfully yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD BELT.</hi>") I wrote an answer to that on the same day. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that as he had not kept his promise, and as his claim for</hi> 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was false, they were instructed to take proceedings, requesting the name of his solicitor, and sending writ by bearer.</hi>) That was the end of the correspondence—I produce the writ in the action—it is dated 14th July, 1886—it was brought for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation whereby the plaintiff was induced to purchase from the defendant certain jewellery, and to rescind a certain agreement for the purchase of certain jewellery, and for certain money advanced by the plaintiff to the de<lb/>fendant</p>

               <p>—Messrs.

Lumley and Lumley. (<hi rend="italic">By the statement of claim Sir William Abdy claimed</hi> 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">money lent, and</hi> 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">damages, and the rescinding of the two agreements of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1884, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1885. <hi rend="italic">The defence admitted the representations alleged, but alleged that they were made in good faith; it also admitted that plaintiff was entitled to judgment, with all costs of action.</hi>) Subsequently an application was made to the Divisional Court to sign judgment against the defendant on that defence—Counsel ap<lb/>peared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Crisp for the defendant—it was made in open Court on 25th November, 1885, and it came on to be heard on 25th November, 1885, and judgment was ordered to be entered for the plaintiff—here is the original order of the Divisional Court: "Upon consent of Counsel, on the statement of defence and statement of claim, the judg<lb/>ment is for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., money lent by Sir William Abdy, 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages in respect of the fraudulent misrepresentation, and to rescind the two agree<lb/>ments under which Sir William Abdy would have had to pay upwards of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further to Richard Belt if the agreements had been carried out"—ultimately Messrs. Lumley and Lumley sent me a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no payment has been made except that, either for claim or costs—Richard Belt was afterwards adjudged bankrupt—the receiving order was on 24th December, 1885; the adjudication was on 4th February, 1886—up to the time of the bankruptcy proceedings no due whatever, as far as I know, had been obtained as to the history of these diamonds, or where they had been obtained from—I applied for a summons against the two defendants, which was granted by Mr. Yaughan, of Bow Street—I don't remember the date.</p>

Before Lady Abdy's visit to me I had never been concerned for Sir William or Lady Abdy—I really forget whether Lady Abdy brought me a letter of introduction or not, I think Mr. Harrison, of the firm of Harrison, Ingram, and Co., of Lincoln's Inn Fields, sent me a letter of introduction; I have had so much pass through my mind since that, I should not like to say positively, but that is my impression—I had seen Sir W. Abdy before the letter of 14th July; I had seen Lady Abdy, I should say a few days previously, probably three days—Sir William was in Paris, and Lady Abdy had come from Paris to London, and Sir William followed two or three days after—I saw him for the first time, just before I wrote the letter of the 14th July—I was not aware that Lady Abdy had been making inquiries in London about the jewellery; I did not hear from her that she had been to Mr. Beyfus—she did not bring me any photographs, she brought me certain portions of jewellery; she brought me a great quantity; I took no note of it—I sent it on to the Union Bank; after I had shown it to a jeweller—I did not make a list of it before I sent it to the bank; I have not a list of it even now—I might tell you what the articles were if you suggested them to me—I think I might possibly remember some of the large ones—I cannot tell whether she showed me the large diamond in the old setting; I should not like to swear it, for I could not tell what she did bring; she brought a great quantity—Sir William Abdy brought the rest subsequently, he went over to Paris and fetched it—I did not hear that it had been pawned in Paris</p>

               <p>first mentioned about jewellery, the same month in which I lent him the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that he knew a lady who was very badly off and who had owned some of the most beautiful jewellery, and to raise money she had left it with a Mr. Beyfus, who had lent her money upon it at a comparatively small price and at enormous interest—he mentioned the name of the lady, a Mrs. Morphy, that the Sultan had given them to her because she had been his mistress, that they were said to be Indian and Brazilian stones—he told me that—on that day they were not produced; it was the next day, or the day after, that I first saw any of them—he said they were worth having because they were very fine stones, and I should not pay the enormous prices that jewellers usually charged, that it was an occasion not to be let pass by—next day, or the day after, a man came to the hotel with a hand-bag containing jewel cases—Richard Belt had said that a man would bring them—he was there when the man came; he was with me when the man was there—I am not sure whether he came with the man; I had made no appointment—on that day I bought the tiara and the wide necklace; this is the tiara—I do not know who the man was that brought them, it was not Walter Belt—I do not recollect what price was put on the tiara—I bought several other things besides this in October in one lot at different times—I bought the tiara and necklace on the first day, and something else, I am not sure what; the cross belonged to that lot to the best of my belief—I bought the first lot within three or four days from the first production of the jewellery—among them were two sets of earrings, single stones, a cross, a ring, a cat's-eye and diamond bracelet, and a horseshoe pendant—there was no other bracelet to the best of my belief—these before me are the things I bought in October—I gave for this lot, if my memory serves me right, 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and something; I believe so; it was really more, I paid some more money which I cannot swear to, it was considerably' over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—first of all I gave a cheque for 1,980<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a bill for 870<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which no doubt I afterwards met; I did not meet it at maturity, but it was ultimately paid—this is the cheque, dated 8th October, payable to self or bearer—the bill is dated 10th October; it is endorsed "Richard Belt," and stamped "A. Artis, poulterer, 18, Motcombe Street"—the cheque was payable to "order;" that is struck out, and "bearer" put—I did that for this reason, Mr. Belt told me it would not do to put the name of Belt on it—I did not cross it, it was given over from hand to hand—I was not asked to cross it—I always cross cheques when for a large sum—I was told that Mr. Praed used to draw the money that was due from the trial, and therefore the money would be stopped by Mr. Praed if it passed through his hands—in addition to those two sums, which together make 2,855<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there were two payments of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Richard Belt by ray solicitor—those two sums had no relation whatever to this jewellery—all I paid in relation to the lots I bought in October were the cheques for 1,985<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the bill for 870<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and something more that I cannot trace—to the best of my belief I gave a cheque on Coutts' payable to self; but as there was more than one that I drew at that time I could not swear which it was—I afterwards saw a riviere, but that transaction did not take place in October—it was some time in the winter following, the winter of 1883-4—I cannot swear to the date—in buying this jewellery I relied on the representations and statements made by Richard Belt as true—I had no idea or knowledge that the jewellery had been obtained about</p>

               <p>that same time from Mr. Smith, the pawnbroker—the riviere was pro<lb/>duced to me in October, but the transaction was carried out later, Decem<lb/>ber it might be, or January, or February—I did not see Walter Belt in reference to the first set of transactions—Richard Belt said the riviere belonged to some lady, part of the same jewels that had been previously mentioned—I recollect one day being with Richard Belt at my hotel, the Grosvenor, when Walter Belt appeared (<hi rend="italic">Walter Belt:</hi> "It is false")—he brought the riviere in a case in his hand, or in his pocket—he brought it up to my bedroom—it was in the evening about 5—I had no sitting-room—I was only in London for a few days—they did not come in together—Richard was with me and Walter brought in the riviere—I had not made any appointment that Walter should bring it—that was the first time I had seen him in relation to those jewels—I had seen him before and spoken to him—I looked at the riviere and examined it—I have no know<lb/>ledge whatever of the value of jewels and no experience in the matter—I had bought jewellery before then at jewellers' and paid for it, and had done with it, I don't care for it—Richard Belt told me this was a very fine thing—he did not tell me directly to buy it, but he held it out as a very beautiful thing—Walter said it was a very beautiful thing too, and old Brazilian stones—I am not quite sure that Walter said that, Richard did—I think he said it in Walter's presence when we three were together, but I would not swear to it—at the end of the interview Richard Belt said to Walter, "Mind you don't lose the receipt you have for it," or, "Get the receipt back, mind you don't lose it, take it back," or something to that effect—I understood from him that he had given a receipt for it—I remember distinctly the words he was not to lose the jewels—he was to get the receipt back that he gave for it I understood—afterwards I understood from what was said that he was to get the receipt, he had given for the jewels—he said something about a receipt, and then he said ho was not to lose the jewels—I understood he had given a receipt for the jewels—he was to take care of the jewels and not lose them, and get back the receipt—I understood so—I can't say the exact words—Walter said "All right, I will see to that"—I think something was said that day about the price, 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the price I was to give—I after<lb/>wards agreed to buy it and paid 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I had no suspicion or idea at that time that this had been purchased from Messrs. Welby for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Meyer.</hi> I am not sure whether this came from me or Mr. Shout; one collet necklace is so much like another I should not like to express any opinion.) The 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for it—in the beginning of January, 1884, or the end of December, Richard Belt spoke to me again about the purchase of jewellery—he said he had another very fine lot of jewels of the same sort belonging to the same Mrs. Morphy; very valuable old stones—I said I could not afford any extravagance at the present moment—he said it was a pity I could not—that was all he said; he seemed to be reflecting—I said "Could not anybody lend money upon them; if they were very fine things we might acquire them in that way;" and did he know anybody who would do it—he said he would see and look for some one—he came back on the morrow, or after the morrow, and said a friend of his, a medical man, had consented to do so—he concealed the name of the medical man, he did not seem anxious to give his name, he would not tell me who he was—he said he lived at Kensington, that he would find the money, that he had not it ready; he had to realise by</p>

               <p>sale, I did not exactly understand what, some house property securities—I asked what interest had to be paid for it; that I thought five per cent was very good interest at present—he said that would not suffice, because the selling out of the securities cost him money, and he might have to wait a long time, when I refunded the money, for another investment, and on account of that his friend wanted six per cent—I agreed to that—he said it was wonderfully fine jewellery—then the dates were settled when the interest was to be paid—we drew up a mutual agreement—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the agreements; this is my writing, I wrote it out in Richard Belt's presence, it was the composition of both of us—they are dated 10th January—Richard Belt signed this one, and I signed the other, and he made out this duplicate list of the jewellery. (<hi rend="italic">By these agreements Richard Belt agreed to pay the witness</hi> 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">at a charge of six per cent interest per annum; the list of the jewels was annexed, amounting to</hi> 5,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">some articles were struck out.</hi>) The list was first of all complete, and afterwards some articles were struck out when the jewellery was delivered—I bought them in October, 1885, I think; in January, 1884, I had seen all the articles, Richard Belt showed them to me; he took them away with him—when this agreement was entered into I believed the statements he made to me about the jewellery, and about the medical man—the jewellery was not in my possession when I signed the agree<lb/>ment—I never received a penny of the 4,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to pay six per cent interest on the amount, and he was to keep the jewels—I thought I was secured by the loan he got from the medical man—I understood the medical man had lent Richard Belt 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had paid it to Mrs. Morphy—I was to get the jewels as I pleased, as I chose to buy them, as I paid up the 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the value was put against each separate article, and I could buy them article by article, I paying interest in the meantime—this is my cheque for 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Coutts and Co., dated 7th April, 1884, in favour of Richard Belt—this is his endorsement—I drew this in Paris, and sent it to him, it was for the half-year's interest—I sent it a few days before it was payable—I believe I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money in May for a pair of diamond earrings—they were delivered to me—this cheque, dated 26th May, is my cheque on Praed's, one of my bankers; it is payable to Richard Belt, and is endorsed by him—I gave it to him to pay for the earrings—he gave me the earrings shortly before on the understanding that I was to give him a cheque afterwards; those ear<lb/>rings are struck out of the list—afterwards two diamond bracelets of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each were delivered to me, but they are not struck out—Walter Belt delivered them to me I believe in June, 1885; the pearl and diamond ear<lb/>rings were delivered at the same time, I did not pay for them—I paid 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Richard Belt for the horseshoe earrings, in October or beginning of November, 1884; they are struck out of the list—I also paid 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the Maltese cross at the same time—the emerald and pendant earrings were delivered to me last summer, the same time as the others, and not paid for—the two half-hoop rings were delivered to me in Paris by Walter Belt, and were not paid for—the two diamond rings for 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were also delivered to me last summer by Walter Belt, and not paid for—this cheque of 7th November, 1884, for 830<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was drawn for the purpose of paying for some of those things—this spray for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was delivered to me by Walter Belt in May or June, 1885, and not paid for—this cheque of 1st October, 1884, for 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is made payable to Richard</p>

"You can redeem these, and the balance my friend will supply," and we could put them at the bank as security for the money advanced on them, that I was to pay 6 per cent interest, and as I chose to buy them they were to be delivered to me—at that time no agreement had been entered into—at the end of October, while in Paris, I received this letter from Mr. Belt, with this agreement of 14th June, 1885, and also this list of jewellery, in Richard Belt's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "My dear Sir William,—I feel by your letter that things are more peaceful. I hope it may be so. It does seem hard that at this moment, when I believe money is of so much use to you, that you are obliged to adopt the plan you suggest for the purpose of removing this absurd idea, but you know if it is worth it, and feel certain will do what you think best for all concerned. Enclosed is a notification that I am answerable to you for the diamonds, and I have worded it in a similar manner to the one you first wrote; but referring to the other jewels, I wish Morgan could have run over to you, for I really think a calm head may have done some good. I feel terribly the position I am in, and you know I will do anything in my power to assist in bringing back happiness to you both. Do try and get your wife away from Paris; it must be her health is bad, or she would never persist in these delusions. Tell her from me that it would be fearful if such matters became known.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. In October, 1883, I lent Richard Belt 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without interest—I have no direct receipt from him with regard to that—I have a document signed by Mr. William Morgan acknowledging the receipt of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I paid him to pay over to Mr. Belt, but I have no document signed by Richard Belt with regard to it that I am aware of—I did not give him that money, I lent it him—at the end of September, 1883, I thought he had rendered services to me, but it is not true that I am under any obligations to him at all—I believed certain things to be true which I found out afterwards were not true—I believe I that he had acted well towards me, but I did not believe there were any serious obligations at all, nothing that was to be paid for with money—I did not believe he had done me considerable service—he had done me services which might or might not have occupied a good deal of his time and attention; but I did not believe he had put himself in danger in any way—when I wrote to him from Paris on 29th September, saying that everything should be done for his security and peace of mind, he had told me that he was being watched in the street, and I said I would do all I could to prevent his being watched, or his house being watched, which caused him, as he said, great anxiety and great worry—I don't know why he was being watched, I had no idea; he said it was because he was with me in working out something regarding a Mrs. Crow—I thought his security and peace of mind might be threatened in conse<lb/>quence of services he had rendered me, and I promised that when I came over to London I would do all I could to protect his security and peace of mind—what I meant by giving him security was to see how I could act to prevent his being watched—I did not believe that I was in danger when I came to London—I believed there was some plot that Mr. Belt told me about, got up against me; but I did not know there was any want of security—I knew nothing at all about these matters, except what Mr. Belt told me—he told me things that were true, one tiling that was perfectly true—other persons had not told me things, but there was a thing that proved itself, a thing that was beyond doubt—he told me the con<lb/>tents of one of my letters to Mr. Harrison, that was true—I was not under great obligation to him at the end of September—I believed he had acted well to me, but I did not believe I was under great obligation to him. (<hi rend="italic">Part of a letter from the witness to Mr. Belt, dated</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1883, <hi rend="italic">was read, in which was stated:</hi> "I shall arrive at Victoria and put up at the same hotel, under the same name, as I did last time.")

               <p>know I was in town—the letter says: "If you do not mind sharing my bed-room with me, we can protect one another"—that was a silly word to have written, nothing else—I wanted protection, that people should not know I was in London, nothing else; that was all I meant—he said that his house was being watched, and that he did not feel safe; he said that many times—I sent to my house at Queen's Gate for a revolver, which I gave him—I did not want it for myself, I gave it to him, because he said he wanted one—I kept nothing for myself, he kept it on his person, he carried it away with him—the letter says: "When I come to London I mean to set the matter at rest for ever and to see that you suffer no worry for the friendly act you have done me"—I meant that when I wrote it, I believed he had behaved well to me, certainly, I do not go beyond that—it was at the beginning of October that I handed him the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a receipt—I took no receipt from him, nor any I O U—I am not aware that in any subsequent correspondence I ever referred to the fact of lending him that money—I may have expressed my thanks to him for service he had ren<lb/>dered me, perhaps I did—the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lent to him; I have no note of my own that I had lent him that money—it was in October that I saw this jewellery, I forget whether it was in October that he went to Paris with me—I stayed at the Grosvenor Hotel with him under an assumed name for several days—my object was not at that time to get some jewellery for my wife—I don't remember whether she had had any jewellery stolen, I don't say none had been, but I don't remember it; I know nothing about any theft, I have not heard of it—I understand what you mean, it had been taken by somebody it had been entrusted to—I thought you meant housebreaking, it was breach of trust—I wanted to give some more jewellery to Lady Abdy—we never spoke of getting it from somebody also, to the best of my belief, I don't think so; I might have suggested getting some through Mr. Harrison, I won't swear it—I don't say I did not, but I won't swear that I did—it was not understood between myself and Lady Abdy that instead of asking Mr. Harrison, Mr. Belt should look for some; I mean that—he spoke to us about jewellery, but we never came together as wishing to buy it from him—I don't remember before I came to London that it was mentioned between Lady Abdy and myself that Mr. Belt should be asked to look out for some jewellery for me; I cannot remember it—I promised to get her some jewellery, that is another thing—I had not fixed a time, it was merely in general terms, it might be this year, or next—I did not when I came to London suggest to Mr. Belt to look out for some for me, because I could not go and buy it myself, I say that positively—he told me that he had had something to do with jewellery before; I don't know when—I never knew him as dealing in jewellery—he told me he had found a lady some jewellery, a great bargain—I forget the lady's name, or when or where he told me so—he mentioned that to me, before I bought anything of him, before October, 1883—I knew nothing whatever about jewellery; I had bought some diamonds when I was a bachelor, not since—I used to buy them, pay for them, and have done with them—I knew nothing at all about any jewels whatever—I never represented myself to Mr. Belt or anybody else as having experience and knowledge of diamonds, because it is not true that I had—I did not see the jewellery till a day or two after he had mentioned it to me—Mrs. Morphy's name was mentioned—I never heard or knew any<lb/>thing of a Mrs. Morphy except in this regard—it was not suggested to</p>

               <p>me—beyond that of a person having a name there was no interest to me in the name—I have never mentioned the name of Mrs. Morphy in any letter written by me to him—I did not attach much importance to the lady being a mistress of the Sultan, I thought it was no business of mine, or what her character had been—when the jewels were brought to the hotel I saw them—I liked the shape of them; I knew nothing at all about the colour of the stones—I thought they were good diamonds, I believed the word of Mr. Richard Belt, but I knew nothing at all about diamonds—they pleased me as they would please a man who knew nothing at all about them, I liked the shape and design—I was asked to buy them, Belt asked me to buy them—he asked me in this way, he paraded them before me and spoke in their praise; he did not actually ask me to buy them, he said it would be a very wise thing if I did, it would be the best thing I could possibly do, and; I looked at them and came to the same conclusion, and bought them—the bill for 870<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given then—on the back of the bill is the stamp of Artis, poulterer, Motcombe Street—I knew nothing at all about Mr. Artis with regard to the bill or the cheque for 1,985<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went on some day to Artis's shop about the cheque for 830<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated 7th November, 1884—to the best of my memory I gave Mr. Belt a cheque on Coutts's at the same time, but I cannot trace it because it was made payable to self, and I cannot swear to it—I only banked with Coutts's then; when I came to London in October I had just opened an account at Praed's—Mr. Belt introduced me to Praed's—they advanced me some money, and I drew—I did not mention at the police-court about the cheque I could not trace, because I could not swear to it, and I have dropped it—Mr. Belt told me that these were Indian or Brazilian stones, and at that time showed me the tiara and the wide necklace—I have not, that I am aware of, represented to several people that I was a good judge of diamonds; I am not aware that I have said so to Mrs. Alston, my cousin's wife; I did not tell her so, I say so positively—if I told her that I had seen some diamonds in Vienna which I particularly admired, I did not tell the truth, because I have not been to Vienna since I knew what a diamond means, not since I was quite a boy, so it is quite impossible—I might have said so, if I did it was a silly thing; I could almost swear I did not, because it is almost impossible that I could hate said it—I can say positively that I do not remember it; I do not remember ever saying such a thing in my life—I did not tell Mrs. Alston that I had seen in Vienna a horseshoe brooch in diamonds which was very beautiful—it is very possible that I may have mentioned Dresden as a place where I had seen some beautiful diamonds; I do not remember doing it; it is very possible, because I had seen some very fine diamonds there—my attention had been attracted by some old-fashioned shoe-buckles there, and some fine old diamonds; I remember saying that—I do not remember telling her that I was going to buy the old-fashioned buckles when I could afford it—I do not know that I told Mrs. Alston what diamonds meant; I might have done so, I do not know; it was so unimportant, it has escaped my memory—I have not represented to Mrs. Alston and others that I was a connoisseur in diamonds and a judge of them—I told her about the diamonds, and showed her those which I had obtained in London, but not all—I think Mr. Belt went over to Paris in October—Mrs. Alston and her daughter came to dine with me at my house in Paris—I remember</p>

               <p>taking these diamonds out after dinner on 9th October and showing them to her in Richard Belt's presence—I do not know whether he said that he knew nothing about diamonds, he was a sculptor and was no judge of them; the conversation has quite escaped me—I do not remember telling her that any of the rings were inferior stones, but that I bought them because they matched—she may have asked me why I did not get the stones valued, I do not remember Haying that I knew quite as much about stones as any dealer or valuer, and they were dirt cheap—I do not remember any details of the conversation, my mind is a perfect blank—I am telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth—I took the diamonds out of their cases and held them up to the light—I do not remember saying that I had travelled all over the world and nobody could deceive me in diamonds—it seems an utter impossibility for me to say so, because I know nothing about them—I cannot tell whether I mentioned Mrs. Morphy to Mrs. Alston—I said to somebody that some of these jewels had belonged to the Duke of Leeds, but what I said is a blank in my memory—one of these jewels had a coronet on it, and Mr. Richard Belt said something about it—I may have said that it beloged to the Duke of Leeds, but whether I said it to her I cannot say—I did not say that some had belonged to the Shah of Persia—I do not remember asking Mrs. Alston to keep up the story of their having belonged to those people, as otherwise Lady Abdy would not wear them; my mind is so perfectly blank—some con<lb/>versation passed but I am unable to say what it was—it seems perfectly new to me—I am not in the habit of laying myself down as a connoisseur in lace—I understand some things better than others, but I am not a great judge of lace—I produced some lace on the same evening as I talked to Mrs. Alston about the diamonds—I spoke of lace as constituting a collec<lb/>tion, but not diamonds—I know Miss Luke, the daughter of a clergyman in London—I have not told her that it was impossible for anybody to take me in with diamonds, I knew so much about them—I may have said so about lace but not diamonds—I remember seeing Miss Luke at Mr. Belt's house two or three times—he was then living with his wife in London, and I dined there, but my wife did not—I may have told Miss Luke that my wife had some of the best diamonds in Paris, because I believe she had, but I do not remember saying that nobody could take me in—I did not purchase the riviere in October, it was later on—I am not certain whether I instructed Mr. Belt to buy one for me when he was in Paris—Lady Abdy very often will not eat any meat, and I told her in Paris, when Mr. Belt dined with us, that I would give her a riviere of diamonds if she would eat her meat, I do not remember whether she did so, but Mr. Belt may have come back to London commissioned to get a riviere of diamonds—I am mistaken, it was after I left London I pur<lb/>chased it—it is perfectly true that Richard Belt said that it belonged to the same lady, and Walter Belt brought it to the bedroom, and Richard Belt was with me at the time he brought it—I saw the riviere in London before I purchased it in Paris, but I may be wrong about the month—Walter Belt brought it to the bedroom when I was with his brother—it was showing to me in London before I brought it from Paris—that is the truth and nothing but the truth—when I describe Richard Belt as being with me in the bedroom I refer to the time when the riviere was shown to me and taken away again—there can be no doubt about my memory</p>

               <p>there, because it was the first time I saw Walter Belt in connection with jewellery at all—Richard Belt said "Get a receipt," and there is no doubt about the transaction—I came to London with Lady Abdy in De<lb/>cember, and went to the theatre with her on Christmas Eve—there was a conversation about more jewellery, and Richard Belt said there was a tine lot of the same sort and from the same Mrs. Morphy, and they were very valuable—I said that I had not money to buy them—the second lot was brought to the hotel, and, beginning with the large spray, they were shown to me—Lady Abdy saw them for a few minutes—she just cast a glance at them—she had nothing to do with the transaction—she knew nothing at all about them, and did not know how they were come by—she did not wear some of them when I went to Toole's Theatre with her, she wore some but not that lot—I mean only the first set, those I had bought in October, and with which I was quite satisfied—I had not got the money, and I asked Belt if he could find somebody to provide it, and I wrote out these two long documents of agreement with my own hand—the diamonds were priced to me by word of mouth, so that I could have bought some and left the others if I desired—I had all those brought to the Grosvenor Hotel—it did not matter to me whether the money was found by a medical man at Kensington, what I wanted was to have command of the diamonds—I drew up this agreement—I understood that Belt was to keep the jewels as I could not afford to pay for them—I understood that they were to be given into the hands of a lender at mortgage—Mr. Richard Belt said that his friend did not wish to break the Pawnbrokers' Act—it did not matter to me whether the clergyman lived at Kensington or whether Mrs. Morphy was Mrs. Smith, if I had command of the jewels, that was all I wanted; they amounted to 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have had them all; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is supposed to be the bracelet with the black diamond—I know now that it is not a black diamond, but I did not know it—I was first told of this bracelet at Spa, Richard Belt told me of it; that was, I think, in August or September, 1884—I commissioned him to get it if he could—he told me that it came from Mr. Beyfus and it had the same label—there is no doubt that this is the bracelet with regard to which I made that statement—it is the large stone with the little stones round it—I do not know to whom it belonged, it belongs to me now—I do not know the lady to whom it belonged; Mr. Belt never told me that it was the pro<lb/>perty of Mrs. Bonsor—I know a Mrs. Bonsor, and I believe she lives in Charles Street, Mayfair, but I did not know that it belonged to her; he told me that it belonged to the same person, Mrs. Morphy, and Beyfus was the holder of it—I have never said that it belonged to Mrs. Bonsor; I have never heard Mrs. Bonsor mentioned with regard to any of the jewellery till you mentioned it now—I remember meeting Mr. and Mrs. Bonsor at Covent Garden Circus, I think it was in January, 1885—Mr. Belt was with me, and we four supped together—I never mentioned to Mrs. Bonsor that I was making a collection of diamonds, but I did of lace—I made some observation which would be pleasant to her about the lace on her dress—I do not remember speaking to her about the bracelet I had bought of Mr. Belt, or telling her that the surrounding stones were very good but that the centre one was an inferior one—I could not say that about a bracelet I purchased from her, because I think I purchased the bracelet from Mr. Beyfus belonging to Mrs. Morphy; that is where I</p>

In the early part of 1885 I went to Mr. Alston's house, I forget whether I went into the smoking-room, or what room I was in—I saw both Mr. and Mrs. Alston once, I am sure—I did not tell Mrs. Alston, among other things, that I had met a lady to whom some of the jewellery I had bought belonged—I don't remember having said so—I will not say I did not, to the best of my belief I did not. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to Mrs. Alston, either in London or Paris, that you had met a lady in London a charming person, from whom some jewels had been obtained for you, that you hoped soon to have the jewels in Paris to add to the rest, and ask her not to say anything to Lady Abdy about it, and tell her that you never mentioned anything of the kind to Lady Abdy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't remember having said anything like it—I am telling you the truth—I can't remember anything more—it seems very extraordinary that I should have said so, I don't believe I did—I had not then determined to buy the 5,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellry. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me remind you—did you play a game of cards for jewellery with your wife at Spa? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was all nonsense—we did not play at cards; there was a bagatelle board, and it was a question how many of those holes on the board should be hit by the ball, and we went on joking together till it went up to several thousand pounds, a great deal more than 5,000—the whole thing was a joke and nothing else—I did not play the game for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I played it by way of a joke and nothing else—I might say 500,000 or five millions—5,000 was mentioned, and a much larger sum—Lady Abdy said she would like to make it 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she was not to get jewellery to that amount—I was not to pay anything, it was no agreement whatever—I don't know whether I lost, it did not matter—Lady Abdy might perhaps remind me that I had lost, perhaps she did, it was so in different to me that I took no notice of it—that had no connection at all with the third lot of jewellery—Richard Belt was at Spa with us, the game was played in his presence—the third lot of jewellery was in my wife's possession from the end of 1883—I took out portions of it twice, I think, and Lady Abdy</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "14, Rue Pierre, Charron, June 7, 1885. My dear Belt,—I cannot tell you how grieved I feel at what has happened—first, that the harm should have come from my wife; and, secondly, that it should have been done to the best and truest friend we have in the world. I am sure that you believe me when I say that the telegram was dispatched behind my back, and that had I had the slightest suspicion of it I should have seen that the telegram never left the house. This house, I am sorry and broken-hearted to have to say, is now a hell upon earth, I being worried out of my life, and I have by this post written to Mr. Morgan in order to allay the storm, and to wipe out the doubts of fancy and the untruthful imaginations that may possibly become the ruin of both of us. Just fancy such a thing. I am believed to be keeping Mrs. Marius, to have taken all the diamonds out of the bank and given them to her, and to have spent twelve (sometimes she says twenty) thousand pounds upon her. It is too monstrous a thing for any one to believe it; but true it is. All my statements are lies in her eyes. My wife says she has been informed of it by a letter received from a 'good friend' in London, and she refuses to say who he is. I should like to know who the scoundrel is. Mr. Morgan will see you about the diamonds, and I trust that, if you care a little for my peace and happi<lb/>ness, you will be able to give him such papers as will prove beyond the shadow of doubt to any sane and sensible mind that I have redeemed no diamonds out of the bank since those I took when I was in London in January. My wife says Mrs. Marius was in Paris with her husband when you were staying with us, and that we both of us went to the theatre after dinner, where Marius was, in order to meet Mrs. Marius, who was also there. I must apologise for boring you with such absurdi<lb/>ties, but they are very painful ones, and will have to be put down once</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188603080072"/>
               <p>for all. In one of your letters you write as follows, 'All is going on smoothly. See much of B. P., but not one unkind word is said.' Will you tell us whom you mean by the initials B. P. The photographs Mrs. Marius which you sent me have been the cause of much mischief. It is very painful for me to have to tell you that my wife positively affirms that the rivieres round Mrs. Marius's neck in the photo are those which I have bought for her, and that I had redeemed them out of the bank and given them to Mrs. Marius. The tiara on her head in the photo I am told that I have given her, and that it is the same one that you mentioned to her as having been in the same place whence the other jewels came. Mr. Morgan must come, and when he comes through London I hope you will be able to give him the papers about the diamonds, to bring them over with him. You may show him this, and my other letters on the subject, but to no one else in the world. It is with great pain that I see myself obliged to write to you as I am now doing, and with that pain is united a feeling of shame on my part that you received that telegram, and also a sincere hope that it may not work the mischief which you seem to anticipate. But when I shall have fully said all that I feel on this matter there will still remain one thing which I can find no words to express—my heart<lb/>felt sympathy.—I am, my dear Belt, your true friend, <hi rend="smallCaps">WM. ABDY.</hi>") I have no letter in answer to that, all the letters I had I gave to Messrs. Lewis and Lewis, all that I have not destroyed—I believe I received from Mr. Belt an answer to that letter.

                  <hi rend="italic">read a copy of this letter, dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th June:</hi> "Dear Sir William,—I am sorry to hear from you that my lady disbelieves Mr. Morgan, but it is not my business to defend his honour; he can take care of himself. Nor will I now enter into matters connected with Mrs. Marius, and the foul charges preferred against her, and the contempt you tell me with which she treats Mr. Morgan's advice. But I feel very deeply that not only yourself and Mr. Morgan she stamps as liars, but the same is attributed to me, and to come from one (who, to say no more, I have risked my life) not only astounds, but is insufferable, and I will ask you to tell my lady that I will not move my finger to afford further proof to vindicate you, or the cruel and serious charges, or to show her I am no party to it. Once for all, I am responsible to you alone for the jewels, and every stone on demand can be handed over to you, according to agreement. I feel from my heart for you after what you have passed through for your wife's sake, that you should have to suffer this, and if I can avoid it I will not add one word to give you further pain; but your wife is fully aware that the charges she makes against you are false, and to me, I regret to say, is clearly a subterfuge. This is the soil upon which this matter should be fought, and if my lady has any self-respect after the proof she says she possesses, it is her solemn duty for all concerned to come here at once.—Believe me, ever yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD BELT</hi>. P.S.—When did your brother leave you?") Until 14th June there was no agreement in writing between me and Richard Belt with regard to the 5,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewel<lb/>lery—in my letter of 13th June I say "My wife says that if she went to London and saw the jewels at the bank you would have been informed of it beforehand by me, and that you would then have borrowed them from the lady who is believed now to have them, and would have taken them to the bank merely for her inspection. This statement is too</p>

               <p>absurd for me to go into at all; I see now what it will have to come to, I shall have to find the money and take out of the bank and give her all the jewels of the kind that were on Mrs. Marius's photograph." This letter of 17th June is my writing: "It is important that I should have these diamonds as soon as possible"—I wrote again on the 18th, stating that my wife's doubts were very strong, and requesting that the jewels might be seen at the bank—on 20th June I telegraphed to Belt "By what train will your brother leave? Shall fetch him at station"—Walter Belt came over to Paris, bringing all the jewellery, although a great number of them had not been paid for—those jewels were delivered to me—I do not remember on what day Lady Abdy left Paris to come to London—she came over because she had doubts about the jewels—I did not know she had them in her possession—I did not execute an assign<lb/>ment that I am aware of; I don't remember; to the best of my belief I did not assign anything to her; if I have done so I should much like to see it; I did not—they were her property, I gave them to her—that was not put in writing I think, I am sure—I never gave her any document—I should be very much astonished if you can show me one—I did not do it—I say that positively.</p>

The first interview I had with Walter Belt relating to the jewels was on 1st October—I had met him before and said "How do you do" to him, nothing beyond that—he came to the Grosvenor that once to see his brother, downstairs in the hall, but I only saw him once with regard to the jewels—it is not possible to confuse one occasion with the other—at that time I was passing under a name not my own—very possibly I had told Richard Belt at that time not to let anybody know that I was in London—my object was not to let anybody know that I was in London—the interview took place in my bedroom—Walter Belt came in as the bearer of the riviere, and he showed it, but he said nothing—during that interview Richard Belt did not leave the room, that I am aware of, and then return and produce the riviere—I don't re<lb/>member that; I would not swear that he did not—I positively swear that Walter Belt did come into the room with the riviere—I pledge my oath unhesitatingly that Walter Belt was in my room on that occasion—I did not see Mr. Morris, I don't know him; I did not see a messenger—I do not remember Richard Belt being called out by a messenger—I did not, that I remember, say to Richard Belt, when Walter came, "Why did you allow your brother to know I was in London?"—I thought if he merely told his brother it would not matter much—I should say Walter was there about a quarter of an hour in the bedroom—I saw nobody else—I don't remember anybody coming into the room—from that time till June, 1885, I never saw Walter Belt in relation to the jewels—that was when he came to Paris and delivered the jewels over to me, that was all he did—afterwards there was some question as to whether the stones had been changed, and Walter came a second time; he then told me that they had not been changed—he said nothing voluntarily about the diamond being a black one, he volunteered no remark about it—I thought a black diamond was a yellow diamond—that diamond had not been cleaned by the Paris jeweller—I asked the question very often if it was a black diamond, and at last he said it was; he hesitated some time about answering—I don't remember his saying "I think it is," he may possibly have said so—I am not sure of the exact words—that was not one of the</p>

The suggestions made in the letters I received were entirely false—they did not relate to any supposed conduct of my wife before her marriage to me—they were hints, nothing more—at that time Messrs. Harrison and Ingram were my family solicitors—Richard Belt said ho knew a very good man, a Mr. Morgan, and he tele<lb/>graphed to Mr. Morgan from Paris, and so took it out of the hands of my family solicitors—I yielded to his advice—up to this moment Richard Belt has never furnished me with, or made any statement to me of any supposed expense that he has incurred in that inquiry—after I had been in Mr. Morgan's hands for some time I returned to my family solicitors, who are now acting for me—I did not attach any importance to Richard Belt's correspondence, I tore it up—I handed to Mr. Lewis sack letters as I had preserved—I never heard any suggestion that my life was in danger, or that I needed protection by having a revolver—I got a revol<lb/>ver and gave it to Richard Belt—he said it was a safe thing to carry a revolver, that he was not safe of his life—he took it away with him—I can't say whether it was loaded or not—in the photograph of Miss St. John (Mrs. Marius), she had some jewels round her neck—at that time I supposed the jewels to be in the bank, because Richard Belt told me they were at the bank of his friend, the medical man—I asked what bank—I forget the name of the bank—it was the bank on the right in the Cromwell Road as you leave Queen's Gate, a joint stock bank—in driving past one day I asked him where the bank was, and he said "This is the bank"—I never saw any of the jewels there—I never gave the jewels to Mrs. Marius—as far as I can judge it is not true that the was wearing them—I had not got the control of the jewels at that time; what Richard Belt might have done with them I could not have any idea—I never got any invoice for any of them from any tradesman, jeweller, or pawnbroker—I never got any receipts for any of the money I paid to Mr. Belt—I paid it in cheques—I intended the jewels for my wife—I bought them in order that she should wear them—on the occasion of the riviere being produced at the hotel in October, 1883, I saw Richard Belt first—he was with me in my room—I had no sitting-room at that time—we had been together quite half an hour before Walter Belt appeared—I do not rec<lb/>collect how he was announced—when he came in the case was opened and the riviere was shown—Walter Belt held it—he produced it—I remember that—I saw no person of the name of Morris, and heard no mention of the name—I know nothing at all about him—that was the occasion when Richard Belt told Walter to be careful about getting back the receipt, I am sure of that—neither Richard nor Walter Belt ever gave me any more definite description of this supposed medical man—up to the time of the handing over of the quantity of jewels at Paris I had implicitly trusted Richard Belt and believed him to be a friend upon whom I could rely.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor practising at Stafford—I have known Richard Belt, I think, about eight years, and also his brother Walter—in the year 1883 Richard Belt introduced me to Sir William Abdy—I believe I had a telegram from Paris to meet somebody, I did not then know who it was—I came from Stafford to London, and there met Sir William Abdy for the first time—after that, by Sir William's directions, I made various payments to Richard Belt—I received instruc<lb/>tions from Sir William about 13th October, 1883, to pay this cheque for 1,000/. to Richard Belt; I in fact paid it in May, 1884—the interest was added on it, and that makes it 1,030<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is drawn on Praed and Co., Fleet Street, dated 28th May, 1884, payable to myself, and there is a stamp at the bottom, "Sir William Abdy, Bart.;" that is also crossed, stamped "London and County Bank, Knightsbridge," and at the back there is the stamp of "Artis, poulterer, &amp;c.; 16, Motcombe Street"—when Sir William gave me the instructions to pay that, I happened to say to Mr. Belt that it was not convenient, there were no funds available at that time of Sir William's to draw upon, and I had arranged to advance him such moneys as he required from time to time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Richard Belt's receipt for the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 16th October, 1883—I told Mr. Belt that it was a little inconvenient for me to find so large a sum as 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a moment's notice—he said, "I can arrange that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you for a short time if you will pay interest on it," and when Sir William's affairs were in funds he paid me that cheque to repay myself, and I repaid Richard Belt the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and interest, it was a transaction between myself and Mr. Belt at that time, and I did this in order to keep the transaction between myself and Sir William Abdy perfectly clear—I did not say that Mr. Belt had lent the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he had arranged it—Sir William did not give me any cheque on 13th October; he had no funds then—I was to advance him such moneys as he might require—I did not advance him anything at that time, nor did I advance Mr. Belt anything—I got that receipt from Mr. Belt; I was accountable to him for the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have an account with Sir William Abdy; it has been audited by Kane and Co., of Chancery Lane; it is a half-yearly account, settled at Christmas and Midsummer—I believe the Christmas account shows the paying of this 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by me to Mr. Belt; I am not sure that it does, but I believe so—I did not produce that receipt to the auditor as my voucher; I took it in the first instance because I was going to pay the money—this cheque of 14th November was paid at that date; it is on my own private account—this is the receipt I got, dated 21st May, 1884, for 878<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was to take up the bill given in October—it is on Praed and Co., payable to Belt or order,</p>

                  </hi>. In 1883 I knew Mr. Walter Belt, he was a friend of mine—I must have seen him several times in October, 1883—between 1st and 13th October he handed me a case containing a riviere of diamonds to take to the Grosvenor Hotel—I took it for him—when I got there I sent in for Mr. Richard Belt, and he came out to me, and I gave him the riviere—he left me, turned through a corridor, and went into a room—he returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I remained in the hall—he then brought the riviere back to me and I took it back to Walter at Drayton Villas—I saw no one at the hotel but Richard Belt—Walter was not with me.</p>

Drayton Villas is about 20 minutes' walk from the Grosvenor Hotel; it is a private house—Walter Belt lived there; I was a friend of his, I painted miniatures for him and things of that kind—I have known him 12 or 14 years, and Richard Belt a year or two longer—I was not sent for to Drayton Villas, I was accidentally there—I called on Walter and he then asked me if I would take the case of jewels to his brother at the Grosvenor—he told me to be sure and take care of them, and to deliver them to no one but Richard—he put them in brown paper while I was there; he just opened them, and I just saw the riviere—he asked me to wait for them and bring them back—I did not ask him what they were to be taken there for—he told me his brother was staying there, not residing there, because his residence was at Dray<lb/>ton Villas—I can't say why Walter did not take them himself—I was to ask for Mr. Richard Belt at the hotel—it was about 7 in the evening—one of the waiters went and fetched Richard Belt—I stayed in the hall and amused myself by looking at the periodicals and papers there—when I gave him the parcel he did not go upstairs in a corridor to the right; he went downstairs in a corridor to the right, and turned into one of the rooms there—I saw him go into a room; he stayed there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I should say—I could see that the parcel had been opened when it was brought back to me; the paper was</p>

               <p>different, it was wrapped up; it had been opened and packed up again—Richard only stayed an instant with me, and asked me to return it to Walter—I don't say he used those words, something similar to that—I did not understand either from Walter or Richard what the riviere was sent to the hotel for, I knew nothing of that, and never asked—I took it back direct to Walter Belt—I was a witness for Richard Belt in his action against Mr. Lawes, I have been very intimate with him—I was at Bow Street at the examination there, and I then heard it said that Walter had taken these jewels, and I then spoke to Mr. Collier, Walter Belt's clerk, and told him of my visit there—I have something to fix the date as between the 1st and 13th October; the 1st October happened to he my mother's wedding day, and the 13th was St. Edward's Day, and I spoke to Walter on this occasion of my intention to visit the shrine of St. Edward, which I remember was on Saturday, the 13th, and it was a week prior to St. Edward's Day, and about a week after the wedding day; it was midway between those two dates, but I could not fix the actual day—I went to Bow Street to hear the case, not as a witness.</p>

I had not at any time in October, 1883, a ground floor room at the Grosvenor Hotel—Richard Belt showed me some jewellery in a ground floor room in the hotel, but that was the first lot—we went into the drawing room or a room adjoining the drawing room on the ground floor; that was in Sep<lb/>tember or October, 1883—it was not the riviere that I saw there—the room would be on the right looking into the street, a smallish sitting room—I am quite sure that was not the riviere that has been spoken to—I first saw this bracelet of Mrs. Bonsor's at the end of October or the very first days of November, 1884; it was then in Richard Belt's posses<lb/>sion—it was first in my possession, I believe, in June, 1885, when Walter Belt brought it to Paris.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am sub-director of the Caisse General de Reports et de Depots, at Brussels; they are a limited Company engaged in advancing money, and selling bonds—in June, 1885, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in French, headed, 66, Holborn Viaduct, London, 26th June, 1885. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Coulon Noel and Co., offering their services in London, and asking terms for doing bank business, and loans and sales of securities, and conditions for opening an account, and giving as references the Bank Parisien in France and the City Bank in London.</hi>) We made some inquiries in consequence of that letter, but no business was done, and the letter remained as it was until the end of November—we then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This referred to a letter from the Caisse de Reports on</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th June, giving conditions for opening an account, and enclosed</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">City of Brussels bonds of the</hi> 1872 <hi rend="italic">loan to be sold for Coulon and Co.'s credit, a cheque for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be remitted to them; the numbers of the bonds were also given.</hi>) Those 25 bonds were sold, and we remitted the proceeds, I believe 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to Coulon and Co.—up to the present time we have not received these bonds back—on 2nd December I received this letter.

I received back on 6th January as a forgery one of the second lot of the 25 Ville de Paris bonds, which had been seat by Coulon Noel and Co.—it was sent from Paris, and it was stated they were false—I immediately came to London, and communicated with the police—the first and second lot and the 100 Ville de Paris bonds were sent back with the mention that they were forged—I gave the 100 bonds up at Guildhall—I have also given up some of the two lots of 25, but some were retained in Brussels, and some in Paris—the 100 are all there.</p>

The first lot of the 25 Ville de Paris were sold in Brussels to an agent who sold them in Paris, where they were seized as forgeries; I know that from the agent to whom I sold them—on the afternoon of the 6th I knew the first lot of 25 were forged—I put no mark on the first lot of 25 Ville de Paris by which I could identify them—the second lot of the Ville de Paris I sold in Brussels to another agent; we put no marks on them, the numbers are sufficient—the 100 Ville de Paris were not sold at all, we retained them—we do a great deal in Ville de Paris bonds—after we received the 100 they were kept in a safe where only the cashier and the directors could get at them—all securities are kept in that safe, but there is a separate endorsement on each for each client, they are not mixed up together—a band of paper is put round each parcel with marks on it—sometimes I am there to open the letters and sometimes one of the other directors; I do not know posi<lb/>tively whether I opened the letter containing the 100 bonds—it is the duty of one particular clerk to make the endorsement on these bands before they are put in the safe—it would depend on the business in the bank how long it would be between their being received and the band being put round them—the numbers of the bonds are put in a special book—after I came to London I handed the 100 bonds to the Belgian Consul on 7th January.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HALL</hi>. The English post arrives at Brussels sometimes at 9 and sometimes 11—we receive our letters at the bank at about those hours—when we received the letter of June, 1885, we wrote to the Imperial Bank, our London correspondents, who said the firm of Coulon Noel had only existed about a year, and so they should act with prudence—we were only satisfied so far that we wrote and told them we would do no business unless the bonds were placed in our hands, so that we might be safe—we did no business with them till after 27th Novem<lb/>ber, but we did not trouble any more about it as they did not write again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We did not send the money till we had received the bonds—on the morning we received the 100 bonds from Coulon Noel and Co. we did not receive any other parcel of 100 Ville de Paris from any other person, and no other packet of 100 bonds—on the 5th we re<lb/>ceived the 100 and we knew on the 6th they were forged—on receiving back the one forged bond, the first thing we did was to look at the 100 which we then had, and I than saw the difference between them and a genuine one and that the 100 were forgeries—that was before the 100 had ever left our possession—on the 7th I brought to London the same 100 I</p>

I was assistant manager at the City Bank, Holborn Branch; I am not now—on 16th May, 1885, a drawing account was opened at our bank by Coulon Noel and Co.—I saw a person whom I understood was Mr. Noel—before the account was opened we were re<lb/>ferred to Messrs. Willats and Charlton, the auctioneers of Holborn Viaduct—the account was just a drawing account, a certified copy has been handed to Messrs. Wontner—somebody signed in the book (which I have not here), before the account was opened, the name of Coulon Noel and Co., Coulon Noel being the sole partner who had the right to draw and the person I saw—on 6th January this cheque on the Imperial Bank was paid in to that account—it bears my crossing—I presented it through the Clearing House in the usual way—I should say this endorse<lb/>ment on the back is in the writing of the person who opened the account</p>

               <p>Institute—he told me that if I went to the drawers in his room in a wooden box I should find the money—he said he had not counted the money—he made a mistake in it at first; he said it was 590<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that he had not counted it, or something of that sort—he said he had counted what he had sent away—he was the first person who told me anything about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sent to Williams—he gave me his keys to open his drawers—he said he was to send the money in parts to Trusovitch—in coming from Sweden, Trusovitch on several occasisns emphatically declared that Finkelstein did not know where the money came from, and that Finkelstein had nothing to do with the firm of Noel and Co.—he said that also to the chief of the detective force in Sweden—I have not since come into connection with people who knew him as giving lessons in foreign tongues.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HALL</hi>. The first thing Trusovitch said tom was "I am not Dubois"—when I read the warrant to him he was in the custody of the Swedish police, having been arrested by them as Dubois—the terms of the warrant were in the Lame of Noel and Dubois, no other names were known at that time—I was under the impression when the warrant was issued that there was a man Dubois in the firm—I have since heard there was a real man Dubois, who was seen at Aldersgate Street, and there was also a real man Noel, all mixed up in this concern—the Swedish police extradited this man as Dubois, he was in the name of Reicher—there was no warrant out against Trusovitch—I am satisfied he is not Dubois, and he is not Noel—I am sure Alphonso and Noel were different persons; if Trusovitch meant to convey that impression to me he did not do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we live at 2, Shepherd Place, Wood Street, Westminster—on Sunday, the last day of January, I had some words with my husband—we have been married 18 years, and we have eight children—on February 1st I left home early to go to the police-court for protection, I was frightened of my husband—they did not grant me a summons, and I went back about dinner time and found my husband there—he said "You have been out since seven this morning drinking my money"—I was the worse for drink—I went out again and had more drink in the afternoon—I had my baby with me—about 5.30 I went to a public-house at the corner of Marsham Street, and afterward</p>

               <p>to the Adam and Eve, and my husband was just coming out at the door—I began to go on at him, and he said I had been drinking his money all day—he put his hand up and I struck him—he was suffering from the effects of drink—he put his hand up, I thought, to strike me, but I found myself cut—a little girl took my baby from me, and I was taken to the hospital and had my nose stitched up.</p>

I asked her where she had been, and she said looking for me; I said 'I will give you something to look for, I will cut your b—nose off'"—I asked him if he struck her, he said "Only with this," drawing this knife out of his pocket—it was shut—I opened it—there is blood on the handle and on the blade—I took him to the station—he said that if he met her again he would stick a knife into the bottom of her belly and rip her b—guts out, and he would let her see what a b—Irishman could do, and that he would kill the Inspector the first opportunity he had.</p>

I want you to ask Mr. Wontner to allow me to see John Salmon and arrange for him to return the gun. He had one gun and Captain Rhys had the other. I borrowed a little money for temporary purposes from each upon them. I did not sell them to them. I repeatedly went to the First Avenue Hotel to repay Captain Rhys, but could not find him. They distinctly under<lb/>stood from me that I could neither pledge nor sell them. If you can give me till Wednesday I can arrange with John Salmon for the return of the gun he has. Of course I cannot return the one you have"—I arrested Wright on 28th January in Holborn—I said, "You will be charged upon a warrant for attempting to obtain a gun from Mr. Horsley, of York; you will be further charged with conspiring with Lord Hinton and George Alcock to obtain a gun from Messrs. Cogswell, in the Strand; and you will be further charged with obtaining, in 1883, a gun from Messrs. Alport, of Birmingham"—I read the warrant to him—he made this statement, which I took down, and he signed it: "Every word in the letter I wrote to Messrs. Horsley, dated October 11th, 1885, is true. With regard to the letter dated August 31st, 1895, addressed to 'Dear Mr. Wright,' and signed 'Hinton,' I did go to Messrs., Cogswell and Harrison's, Strand, and selected a gun, but I do not recollect taking the letter. I saw Alcock about my visit to select the gun, but I did nothing further in the matter. I believed Alcock to be Lord Hinton's agent, and I still believe him to be so. I remember purchasing a gun from Mr. Alport, of Birmingham, and I gave him my acceptance for it as agreed in writing, and as set out in the terms of my letter. My acceptance before maturity was, by mutual arrangement between Mr. Alport and myself, renewed. Mr. Alport called at my private house with reference to this matter and saw Mrs. Wright, this was when the first bill was running. He arranged to see me at his hotel, Wood's, Furnival's Inn, and I went on three following mornings to see him but on neither occa<lb/>sion was he in. I have never seen him." He made this second state<lb/>ment, 18.1.86, on seeing the documents taken from 2, Chaddesden Villas, Ashbourne Grove: "I recognise these books and documents as having been in my possession at 2, Chaddesden Villas. I am Lord Hinton's general agent for everything. You will find in my pocket book a joint declaration made by Lord Hinton and myself fixing the amount approxi<lb/>mately he had received, I mean actually received upon his securities. He may have received only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or even nothing, upon a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bond, through</p>

I was going to try to find him to-day; I might have to go to a dozen places. John Salmon might know where he is." I found at Alcock's house the documents produced, which I handed to Mr. Wontner—I received originally a communication from the police at York—I issued a notice to the pawnbrokers—on 28th October I received a com<lb/>munication from Mr. Whistler—I saw Mr. Boynton, who made a state<lb/>ment to me; then I saw Mr. Reece and received a statement from him—I went to Lewisham and saw some goods spoken to by Hill and Smith, on the railway company's premises—I stopped what goods I could get hold of.</p>

I received the prisoner in custody and took him to Plaistow Police-station—I there searched him and found the key of his box and a knife—on further searching him I found, concealed in a rag on his finger, this small key—I asked him what key it was—he said it had nothing to do with anything, it was an old key—I examined it—it was a peculiar key and matched the prosecutor's key, only a little finer—he said the key round his neck was the key of his own box—on the way to the station he said to the prosecutor, "I will give you the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and you can have the rest if you won't go any further."</p>

                  </hi>. I have been master of Lambeth Workhouse in Renfrew Road, Kennington Lane, since October, 1884—during all that time the prisoner has been acting as superintendent of the wood-chopping depart<lb/>ment—wood when chopped up was tied up in bundles—orders came from oil and other shops for Wood, and wood was then delivered by van or truck—before the wood was put in the truck or van it was the prisoner's duty to see that the customer's name, with the quantity and the amount, was entered in the delivery book, on the counterfoil, and on the receipt side as well—the folios and counterfoils bore the same numbers, which, were consecutive through each book; one book is used for the van, and one for the truck—paupers go out with the van or truck, to hand the wood to the person whose name is on the book; the outer piece is left with the cus<lb/>tomer, who signs on the counterfoil the actual receipt—if the paupers bring back money they give it to the prisoner, who accounts to me weekly—I copy from the delivery book into the cash receipt book the name of the person who is supposed to owe the money—that is also in the same way numbered alike on the outer side, the receipt and the counterfoil and with consecutive numbers—it is not usual for the pauper to collect, or for persons to pay on delivery—when the book is filled up by me from the delivery book I tear out and give the receipt to the prisoner, and he brings me back either the money or the receipt—I reported the prisoner to the Guardians for his improper behaviour in the House and subsequently in May the duty of going out to collect money was taken away from him—from the beginning of June he no longer collected money—I knew of complaints—I was left to see after him and see he did his duty properly—in December I had to make other complaints about him and he was instructed by the clerk to resign—I knew of that and conversed with him on the subject—after the time of his resignation was fixed I had a conversation with Milton, one of the paupers, on 12th December—I had had no communication from Milton until it was known the prisoner was going—then the last witness, by my direction, put the questions, which he has repeated, to the prisoner as to whether anything was omitted from the book, and whether everything was not handed over—I saw these two delivery books on 12th and 14th December, and then on the morning of the 16th—by the 16th my attention had been directed to the names of Stamford, Staff, Pace, and Keogh—these are the two books that were in use for delivery—the earliest date in them is June 27th, 1885, they go on to December—I find on December 15th entries of Mrs. Stamford, 100 bundles, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Mr. Cook, 100, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Mrs. Burchard, 100; Pace, 100 and one sack of dust; none of those are signed by the customers—I swear they were not in the book on the morning of 16th December—they are in the prisoner's writing—with the exception of that one counterfoil, with the name of Pace on it for wood and sawdust, there is no entry in any of the books for six months previous of Pace or Stamford—on these fourteen bits of paper the word "Paid" is in prisoner's handwriting—some have merely "Paid" and</p>

Crossley, but they have no business to be; I never gave any instructions for that—I paid the rent of the premises, but not till after I tamed him out—I still adhere to the statement that he was not my manager—I did not present the bill at the bank because he had nothing there, but I asked him to take it up in March—my brother was with me on several occasions, he used to drive me over—he has money of mine, I had no banking account at that time; he drew cheques for me—I kept this bill four years before I sued the prisoner on it, I never had a chance before—I did not know where he lived, though I often saw him—he lived in the same street for a very short time, but in a very poor position, and it was no use my suing him for it—I turned him out in October, 1882—I did not feel very friendly to him then—I put his brother in to take care of the place.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Other letters to the prisoner from the witness to the same effect were partly read.</hi>) Marvin behaved ill about money matters, and I prosecuted him last April and got him committed for trial, but did not go on at this Court—I paid, "I heard in June or July that the ring had been pledged, before I prosecuted him I should have been willing to pay the money to take it out of pledge"—I have always found him straight in his dealings with me before this—I don't think he had any intention of doing away with it entirely—I got the in<lb/>formation from my lawyer that the ring was to be found at Attenborough's—he showed me a letter which said, "A friend of mine pawned the ring "—for a certain time he concealed the name of Marvin from me, but he told the solicitor that Marvin pledged it and where it was pledged—the pawnbroker is ready to give it up—I desired to withdraw from this pro<lb/>secution on account of my health; the doctor said I should not go on—I waited from July to November before taking criminal proceedings, and I thought he was going to give me the ring—I have lost all support from my brother through this ring.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I acted under my lawyer's advice—the name of Marvin is not mentioned in the letter—I prosecuted him, and when we came to this Court, the lawyer having returned the property, we could not go on—my brother is the manager of a large firm in Rangoon, and writes to me to send him out things, whether for his personal use or for his friends I do not know—the prisoner was in the City every day, and used to buy these things for me—I had receipts from him for large sums paid to him, but when it was only a few shillings I never thought to ask him.</p>
