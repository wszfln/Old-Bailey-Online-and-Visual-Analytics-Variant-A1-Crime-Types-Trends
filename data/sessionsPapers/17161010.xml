             depos'd, That he lodged at Mr. Read's Mug-house for some Time past; and being asked to give account what their Demeanor usually was when the Company which used the House met together, he answered, That he never knew the Society give any Provocation or Affront to any Person, except that once they turned a Man out of the House for hissing at the Duke of Marlborough's Health: And being asked, whether they ever drank Confusion to any Persons, or to any Sort or Order of Men; he answer'd That he never heard any Confusion drank but once, and that since the last Sessions, they drank Confusion to the Ottoman Attempts against Prince Eugene and the Empire, or to that Effect. He further depos'd, That the Friday-Night before the Day mentioned in the Indictment, a Mob gathered about the Mug-house, whereupon some Gentlemen sent to a Mug-house in Tavistock-Street to some of their Friends, who immediately came and disperst the Mob; so that no Harm was done that Night, only a few Panes of Grass were broke. That upon Monday the 23d of July, in the Evening, a Mob began to gather in the Street when the Society was assembled; that one Overs, a Constable, came to the Door with some Watchmen, and drew up in a Rink before the Door, and then the Mob began to increase very fast, and hiss'd the Gentlemen as they went in and out; whereupon the Witness went out and ask'd them what they hiss'd at, but they threw Stones at him and at the Windows. That some Time after one Johnson, another Constable, came with more Watchmen, but they did not endeavour to disperse the Mob, but encouraged them, and they continued to throw Stones at the House whilst the Constables stood by. That he being in the Coffee-Room, a Stone was thrown out of the Street into the Room, which hit him upon the Leg; whereupon he went out to the Constables, and told them, he wondred they would suffer Stones to be thrown into the House by the Mob when they had Power enough to disperse them; but they answer'd, that the People in the House threw the Stones from above and broke their own Windows; which was impossible for them to do, for the Window shutters above were fast shut, so that no Stone could be thrown out. That Mrs. Read offer'd the Watchmen a Quart of strong Ale to drink the King's Health, but the Constables would not suffer them. That Mr. Hucks offered them a Crown to drink the Kings's Health, but the Constables refused it; and he having given it to one of the Watchmen, the Constable made him return it. That all this while the Mob continued throwing Stones at the House and Windows, so that was scarce a whole Pane left below Stairs; whereupon one Badcock, a Constable, who was in the House, went out and read the Proclamation, and the Mob all the while hiss'd at him. That very soon after the Proclamation was read the Constables and Watchmen went away, and the Mob went away at the same time: And being ask'd what made the Mob go away with the Constables and Watch; he said, he believ'd they did not care to stay after the Constables were gone, for that they were more afraid of the Gentlemen in the House than of the Constables. That the next Morning about Six a Clock the mob began to gather again, and threw Stones at the Windows; upon which he went out to persuade them to be quiet and to do no more Mischief, but he received two Blows on his Head by Stones, one of which gave him a great Swelling in his Forehead, and the other cut him on the side of his Head, and made him bleed very much.</p>
               <p>That thereupon he went into the house and brought out a Stick and drove them a little way, but struck no body but the Man who hit him with the Stone.

That Mr. Read and the Grenadier presented their Pieces 3 or 4 Minutes, and bid them stand off and have a care; but they pressing on, Mr. Read and the Grenadier fir'd , and Vaughan fell. That the Mob coming on still with great Fury, the Witness and another Man consulted together to make a Barricade upon the Stairs, by which Means the upper part of the House was preserved till such time as the Mob were disperst by the Guards: But that below Stairs the Windows and sashes were all broke to pieces, the Bar and the Cupboard, and the Post to which the Coffee-Mill was fixt , were broke down, and also the Benches and Wainscoat, and it look'd just like a House that was pulling down; and all the Goods were broke to pieces and destroy'd.</p>

But the Constable took their part, and said the Windows were broke by the People in the House, and bid the Witness go away from the Door; and said the House ought to be pull'd down to the Ground. That the next Morning the Mob gathered again, and threw Dirt and Stones at the Windows; and a Woman came up with two Brickbats and broke the Windows with one of them; upon which he bid her be gone; but she threw another, crying out High Church and Ormond, Damn all the Hanoverians, Down with the Presbyterians. That thereupon he took hold of her, and was bringing her into the House; but one Delander a Watchmaker made several Strokes at the Witness, and he was knock'd down by some among the Mob; and the Woman was rescu'd from him.

Men, others said the Duke of Berwick and others the Lord Tinmouth: That after Mr. Read had fired, the Witness and some others went up Stairs, and made a Barricade, which probably prevented their being all killed; that after he was up Stairs; he heard great clattering and breaking of the Wainscot and Goods: That he saw the Prisoner, who had a Black Patch upon his Nose, in the House Five or Six Minutes, very busy, breaking the Sashes and Frames of the Windows; that he had an instrument like a Butcher's Cleaver with which he was cutting one of the Side Posts of the Door, and that the Prisoner joined all the while in the aforesaid Cries.</p>

             Deposed That he was that Morning at Holbourn-Bridge , and saw a Mob passing along with Sticks upon their Shoulders who said they were going to pull down the Mug-House.

That when they came to an Alley by Adam's the Cook's in Shoe-Lane, they distributed the Sticks; and he heard them say, come Boys, here are Sticks enough: That thereupon he went to the Mug-House, and acquainted them with what he had seen; upon which the Proclamation was read, but they prest forwards, and were afterwards beat back again by the Grenadier; but they growing stronger beat back the Grenadier, and the others who were in defence of the House, throwing Stones and Sticks in great numbers at them and at the House.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robins depos'd That on Monday Night he saw a great Crowd of People at the Mug-house Door, who hiss'd at and abused every Body that went in or out of the House. That the next Morning he went to the Mug-house, but knew no body there; however he durst not venture out immediately for fear of the Stones that were flung by the Mob. At last, he and a Gentleman that was with him having an Opportunity, came out, and went to the Castle Tavern in Fleetstreet. That about 12 a Clock he went again to the Mug-house, and a Gentleman brought a Blunderbuss in a Coach, and told the People in the House, that a prodigious Mob was coming down Shoe-lane. That a great Mob appeared immediately, and the Witness went to the Corner of the Square, and staid there till the Piece went off. That he saw the Windows of the Mug-house broke to Pieces. That the Mob threw Ropes over the Sign-Irons, and pulled with such Violence in order to pull down the Sign, that he was afraid the Front of the House would come down and do a great deal of Mischief, and thereupon he went away. That he saw a Parcel of Sticks deliver'd to the Mob out of a Druggist's House at the Corner of Salisbury Court in Fleetstreet, and afterwards he saw several single Sticks delivered to them out of the Shop Window.</p>

             depos'd, That on Monday Night he going by the End of Salisbury-Court in Fleetstreet, saw a great Mob in the Court, and was told they were going to pull down the Mug-house; and going up to the House, he saw two Constables and several Watchmen in the Street before the House, who encouraged the Mob, for that he was sure they were able to have dispers'd them, if they had a Mind to it. That Stones were brought in Baskets to the Mob, some of 7 or 8 Pound Weight, and laid down just by the Constables and Watchmen who suffered the Mob to throw them at the House. That when the Constables and Watchmen went off the Mob presently after run away, apprehending (as he believed) more Danger from the Gentlemen in the House whom they had abused, than from the Constables. That the next Morning he went there again, he saw a great Mob breaking the Windows and Goods of the House to pieces; and heard them say, Just thus will we pull King George from his Crown, which is none of his own.</p>

             mention'd many of the Particulars of the Riot, both on Monday Night and Tuesday Morning, to the same Effect with the former Witnesses. That after the Mob had beat the Grenadier and the others with him back to the Mug house, he saw a Man bring out two Bottles and carry'd them over against the Swan Ale house, where he and several others drank the Pretender's Health by the Name of King James the Third, and were answered with Huzza's by the People at the Swan Windows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carleton Smith deposed, That he was sent by my Lord Mayor to Salisbury-Court on the Tuesday Morning, to see what was doing there. That when he came there, he found the Crowd so great that he could not get in at the End of the Court in Fleetstreet; so he went thro' St. Brides Passage, and saw two Parties engaging and

                  Daniel

             deceased at the Head of the Mob. That as the Witness was getting into the said St. Brides Passage to save himself, Vaughan was shot; and fell just by him. That presently he heard a great Noise,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171610100003"/> and rashing of Boards breaking in the House. And then he thought high time to go and inform my Lord Mayor what was doing. That the Prisoner was brought before my Lord Mayor that Day, and committed by his Lordship. And that the Prisoner had then a Patch upon his Nose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Badcock depos'd, That being informed on Monday Night, that there was a Design to pull down the Mug-house, and being a Constable, he was desired to go thither to keep the Peace, which he accordingly did. That he found a great Mob about the House, and a Constable and some Watchmen before the Door. That the Mob stung Stones at the House, whereupon he went out to the Constable, and desired him to keep the Peace and to disperse the Mob; but he answered, that there was no Disturbance but what was made by the People in the House, and that his Hour (10 a Clock) was not come. That the Mob continuing to throw Stones , he went out again, and found Johnson (another Constable) there, and about 20 Watchmen. And the Witness told him, he wondred he would suffer the People to throw Stones so, and to insult the House; acquainting him that he himself was a Constable, and offering to assist him in dispersing the Mob. But Johnson answer'd him, that he (the Witness) was no Constable of the Night, nor of that Ward, and had nothing to do there, and that there were no Stones thrown but what were thrown out of the House, which was impossible , for the Shutters were fast shut, so that nothing could be thrown out at the Windows. And then one of the Watchmen took hold of the Witness, and would have pulled him out of the House. That afterwards he went up Stairs, and often came to the Stair-head to hearken whether the Noise encreased or not. And after some time finding it very great, he came down, and ventured into the Street, and read the Proclamation; and during the time he was reading it, the Mob threw Stones and Dirt so thick, that he was forced to turn his Back to them for fear of receiving Mischief from them. That presently after reading the Proclamation, the Constables, and Watchmen, and the Mob went away almost at the same time.</p>

That he saw him afterwards chopping the Frame of the Window with something like a Butcher's Cleaver.

               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, he did not join with the Mob, but was coming through the Court accidentally in his Way from Dinner out of Shoe-Lane to his Place of Work; and denied his being in Read's House: Then he called abundance of Witnesses, who were all heard,</p>
               <p>The First swore he gave the Prisoner the Blow on the Face which occasioned the Patch.</p>

             depos'd, That the Friday before the Lord Mayor having Information that a Procession was intended to be made the next Sunday, by a Number of Persons who were to be drest with White Hoods and Favours, and to walk in that Manner thro' the principal Streets of London, his Lordship gave him Orders to enquire diligently into it, and endeavour to find out where they who compos'd it were assembled; and about Nine a Clock that Morning he saw a great Crowd of People (near a Thousand) in <placeName id="t17161010-2-crimeloc10">Salisbury Court</placeName>

That in the Afternoon he went in Search of them again, up and down, where he imagined they were; and about Three a Clock saw a very great Concourse of People at the farther End of <placeName id="t17161010-2-crimeloc11">Water-lane</placeName>

That he would have had the Train'd Bands level their Pieces to make that Boat bring to; but they did not think fit to do so. That Beaver jump'd out of the Boat into the Water to make his Escape; but was retaken. The Men had White Gloves and Favours; and some of the Women White Favours, White Sarsenet-Hoods, and White Gloves; others had no Favours. That all the Prisoners were then carried before the Lord Mayor, and said upon Examination, they were going to St. George's Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. John Hill depos'd, that being with the Captain of the Train'd Bands that Afternoon, Mr. Smith came to them, and said there was a great Multitude of People in a Procession in Water-Lane; upon which a Detachment was order'd out; and he went after the Prisoners to observe their Motions, and saw them take a Boat at Black-Fryars-Stairs; but that not being sufficient for them all, and no other being ready, he hastned to the Officer of the Train'd Bands, and told him, he might overtake some of them before they could get off, who therefore march'd with all Expedition, and came up with the Prisoners just as they had put off; upon which he jumpt into the Water, and caught hold of the Boat-rope and haul'd it ashore. That there were three others with them dress'd after the same Manner who the Lord Mayor discharg'd, it appearing they had not been at Bean's Funeral with the rest, but were invited and allur'd into this Procession by them.</p>

But Mr. Hill bringing him Advice, that he might still come up with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171610100004"/> some of them before another Boat could be ready to carry them off, he pursu'd his March to Black-Fryars-Stairs, and there took the Prisoners. They all endeavour'd to excuse themselves to him by saying, We have done no Harm; Can't we go where we will with our own Favours, and such like. He further depos'd, That he had receiv'd Information that the Procession was to consist of 2 or 300 People dress'd like these, who were to go in the Morning to St. Septebres Church, and take a Turn round by all the Mug-houses, and then to St. Brides Church yard where Bean was buried, to commemorate him: which being a most infamous Contrivance to disturb the Peace of the City, and his Majesty's Government, and in open Defiance of the Laws of the Land, he thought it his Duty to give Notice of it to the Lord Mayor; for which Service some of the Leaders of the Party had since arrested him in an Action of 50 l.</p>

            , That being a Constable, he was desired by Lieutenant Blackwell the Saturday Night before, to accompany him to Salisbury-Court that Sunday Morning, which he did, and went with the Detachment to Black-Friars , where he was charg'd with the Prisoners after they had been taken in the Manner before depos'd; who said they had done no Harm, but had chosen the By-Ways to prevent giving Offence. He also deposed, That there were some Hundreds of People through which they pass'd, who were very rude, violent, and tumultuous.</p>
               <p>The two Men, Beaver and Eldridge, said in their Defence, they were intimately acquainted with the late Bean, and were invited to his Burial by his Mother, after which they agreed to go with the rest, who were also invited, to Church in their Favours, and other Funeral Ornaments, as was usual in such Cases; and neither thought nor intended to give Offence; and humbly hop'd that the Court would consider their Youth and inexperience, and not punish that for a Crime which was never intended by them to be one.</p>
               <p>As to the Woman, they all said too, they were invited to the Burial, and Stibbs said she made an Excuse to go to see her Aunt, to her Master, when she went to it; Lane said she was Bean's Fellow Servant; and Hornsby, that she liv'd once in the same Court with him: And that they furnish'd themselves with what Ornaments they had, and thought they had committed no Offence, nor done any thing but what was usual.

               <p>ADVERTISEMENTS.</p>
               <p>The most excellent BALSAMICK WATER, being the greatest Preservative of Health in Nature, that in 50 Years Study of Physick I could find out, needs not much to be said in its Commendation, for it will recommend it self; and I have no other Interest in making of it Publick, but for the Satisfaction of my Friends, and the general Good of Mankind, and that it may not die with me, I don't (like the English Quack) say that it cures all Distempers; but it infallibly keeps the Body in good Health, and defends it from all infectious Airs and distempers, by taking 3 spoonfuls of it in half a Pint of warm Ale, a Glass of White Wine, Tea, or any other Liquid. It may be taken by all Persons, of what Age or Sex soever, at any time of the Day, without Confinement or Hinderance of Business, according to the printed Directions given with it. It prevents Consumptions, and cures them if not too far gone; it relieves the Tissick and Shortness of Breath; cures Ulcers in the Lungs, or in any part of the Body; it opens all Obstructions, and infallibly destroys all sorts of Worms in Young or Old. It cures the Yellow and Black Jaundice, Leprosy, Itch, and Scald Heads. It certainly eradicates that reigning Distemper the Scurvey; chears the Spirits, strengthens the Stomach, and creates a good Appetite . I recommend it to all Child-bearing Women, it preserving the Infant from those Infirmities that Children are generally afflicted with, purifies the whole Mass of Blood, renders the Skin beautiful and clear , and causes easy Delivery. Likewise I recommend it to Sea-faring Men that Trade to the East or West Indies, or those Countries where Fevers or the Plague are infectious . When all other Remedies fail, this excellent Balsamick Water drives out the small Pox or Measles, and keeps them from the Stomach or Throat, preventing that Soreness which generally accompanies, and often proves fatal to that Distemper; and also prevents the Small Pox or any other infectious Distemper, from spreading in a Family. It's excellent for Gentlemen after hard Drinking, far exceeding any thing; it discharges the Body from the Impurity of bad Wine, and cleanses it from all Scorbutick Sports, Scabs , or Boyls, by bathing outwardly; and cures all Old Sores and Green Wounds, by washing the Place with it; and all sorts of sore Mouths caused by inward Heat or Canker. It is also excellent for all Persons that drink the Waters, causing them to pass and evacuate whatever Humours offend the Body. This excellent Balsamick Water is put up in half Pint Bottles, at 2 s.6 d. each Bottle, with Directions at large for the Taking and Use of it, which being close stopp'd retains its Virtue in all Climates; for the older it grows, the better it is: It generally gives one Stool, and works off by Urine. This excellent Balsamick Water is made by none but my self; and, to prevent Counterfeits, is fold only at Mr. Parker's Books-seller , at the Bible and Crown in Lombard Street, near Stocks-Market, sealed with a Lion and Dagger.

             , who keep the great o'd publick News-shop over against the Blue posts and Rummer Eating-house at Charing-Cross, do hereby testify, that by only putting about our Child's Neck at three Months old, the celebrated Necklace recommended by Dr. Chamberlen for Childrens Teeth, it has now cut most of its Teeth, being near a Year old, and never has had any Fever, Convulsions, Pains, or such usual Illness and Uneasiness, which commonly attend Children in breeding and cutting their Teeth; but has all this Time (notwithstanding it has bred and cut so many Teeth) so thriv'd , and has all along been so healthy and well, that perhaps all England cannot shew a finer Boy, as any Person that pleases may be fully satisfied of who will but give themselves the Trouble to come or send any to see the Child. Witness our Hands the 14th of August 1716.</p>

               <p>This wonderful Necklace, pr.5 s. with printed Directions in English and French for wearing it, is only to be had up one Pair of Stairs at the Sugar-loaf a Confectioner's Shop over against Old Round Court near the New Exchange in the Strand, and no where else. Where (for the Satisfaction of the World as to the real Virtue of this Sovereign Necklace) is given Gratis the Philosophical Essay, dedicated to Dr. Chamberlen and the Royal Society, upon this Necklace, occasioned by the great Increase of late Years in the Bills of Mortality, by which it appears, that in and about London only, above 12000 Children yearly die of their Teeth; whereas out of the great Numbers of Children who in time have worn this Necklace, we do not know of so much as one that has died, but on the contrary, has bred and cut them without any Pain, and all the while thriv'd extreamly. Note, At the same Place is also given Gratis in English and French, The 16th Edition, dedicated to Dr. Chamberlen, of the Practical Scheme of secret Injuries and broken Constitutions, by fast living, former ill Cures, Salivations, and Mercury.</p>
               <p>For the Good of the Publick.</p>
               <p>Whereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex, in this Kingdom, have contracted an evil Habit of Body, wherein the vicious Humours, at first dispers'd thro the Whole, come at length to be lodg'd in one Part or another, and many times, for Causes too long to be here mentioned, are thrown down upon the Womb, occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part, which being neglected, at last turns Cancerous, and often proves Fatal. I cure the Diabetes when given over by all other Persons. This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion, that a speedy Relief is to be had from an Experienc'd Midwife, dwelling at the Sign of the Queen's Arms, a Gold Smith's Shop, near Exeter Exchange in the Strand, who perform'd a Cure upon a Lady at the Bath, after she was given over by the Physicians, and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London. I should not have put my self in Publick Print, but to satisfy the Afflicted where they may have speedy Relief after they are given over by all other Persons.</p>
               <p>At her House the Red Ball in Queen-street, Cheapside, near the Three Cranes,</p>
               <p>Liveth a Gentlewoman that hath a most incomparable Wash to beautifie the Face; which far exceeds all that are extant, as abundance of the greatest Quality have found by Experience, to their great Satisfaction. It takes out all manner of Wrinkles, Freckles , pimples, Redness, Morphew, Sun-burn, Yellowness, caus'd by Mercurial poisonous Washes : It also plumps and softens the Skin, making it as smooth and tender as a sucking Child's: The Young it always keeps so, and the Old it makes appear Fair and Young to Admiration. It has nothing of Paint in it, neither doth any Person know the Secret. You may have from Half a Crown to Five Pounds the Bottle. You may have Pomatums, White pots, the like not to be compared with; also a Powder for the Teeth, which makes them as white as snow. She hath a most excellent Secret to prevent Hair from falling, causing it to grow wherever it is wanting. She alters Red or Grey Hair to a delicate light or dark Brown in a few Days, which will never change. She shapes the Eye-brows, and makes them beautiful: She hath a delicate Paste to whiten the Hands, and a Red Pomatum to colour the Lips, and prevents their chopping in Winter. She has a certain and infallible Cure for the Toothach, without drawing , that the Pain will not return. Note, Remov'd from the Cheshire-Cheese in Walbrook.</p>
