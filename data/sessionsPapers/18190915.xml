On the 3d of September I was sent for, and found the prisoner at the watch-house, the prosecutrix charged her with stealing her box of clothes - she denied it positively. The prosecutrix claimed the gown she had on, and said that the apron she wore was made out of another of her gowns, and she had let the tucks of the gown down to make it fit her; the prisoner said she had bought it in Monmouth-street. I searched her pockets, and found some pieces of stuff, a thimble, and a piece of a gown, which the prosecutrix claimed as being in her box when it was stolen. The prisoner said nothing then. I asked her how she could rob a poor girl of every thing she had? she said the Devil must have come over her when she did it. She gave me three duplicates of the prosecutrix's things.</p>

Stone ran away - Britton ran about three steps, and then stopped; I called Stop thief! I saw them the next day, before the magistrate, and am certain they are the persons; I did not know them before. Britton stood looking very hard at the house, while Stone was stealing the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BRITTON. Q. How can you swear to me - A. He had a green apron on; I saw his face for about five minutes afterwards. I did not see Stone's face, but the right shoulder of his coat was torn; I saw that coat on him the next day. He is the same size and figure - I am certain they are the same persons.</p>

On the 2d of August, I sent eighteen sheep and a lamb to my sheep-house, in Neal's-yard, Seven Dials; next morning I missed sixteen sheep, and a lamb. I went that day to a cottage near the Old Cricket-ground, Regency Park, and found six of them just skinned; the skins laid under them. I found the other ten and the lamb in a field about two hundred yards off; I knew them all by the marks on the skins. As we were bringing the sheep away, we met the prisoner coming towards the cottage, about two or three hundred yards from the cottage. A boy, who we had in the cart pointed to him; he immediately turned, and ran off. Plank pursued, and took him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of August, about two o'clock, I went and found six sheep in a cottage, which was locked; I forced the door open. I found ten sheep and a lamb near the house, in a field; the prisoner was pointed out to me about thirty yards from the cottage; he turned round, and ran away. I followed, and saw him running; he was at least one hundred yards from me when I first saw him. The boy in the cart said something, but the prisoner could not hear it; he was stopped about a mile off. I found a box in the cottage with his name on it - it was not in the same room as the sheep.</p>

I heard a noise, and then the word trap was given by some of them, both before and behind us. Upon this signal being given, I was struck behind on my head by some instrument or stick; my hat fell off, and I fell down. I rose, and instantly as I got up, I was attacked by six or seven of the gang, who grasped my pockets. I was knocked down again by some person striking me behind with a fist; I got up again, and they tore my pantaloons. I made all the resistance in my power, and knocked one or two of them down. I was all over blood, which flew on me from their mouths or noses - I did not bleed myself; when I knocked them down, I got separated from them a little. There was an immediate cry of</p>
               <p>"D - n the little fellow, he has escaped, give it to him again!" I suppose about twenty of them came in a body, and knocked me completely through the canvass into a booth - three or four followed me in. Two or three fiddlers, who were in the booth, protected me; the men retreated through the hole, and joined the gang. I was separated from my friend immediately as they attacked us, and he received several blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the gang armed - A. Several of them had sticks. It was quite daylight, but it was so sudden, that I could not notice them; they all acted in concert; there were full from sixty to seventy of them. I was obliged to remain in the booth until three o'clock in the morning; I dared not come out as they knew I had money about me; they had cut holes in the booth and watched me from nine o'clock in the evening till two o'clock in the morning, so that I could not stir. Several other persons were brought into the booth much cut and wounded; they were cut and wounded by the same party, and in the same place. I lost my hat and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the persons who were brought into the booth, remain there as long as you did - A. Yes. Two young ladies in particular were cut, and their clothes torn off. Furrian brought me my hat and handkerchief two or three days after; my name is in the hat. I was in great terror, and cannot identify any of the men.</p>

               <p>"You b - g - r, if you move." While he held me, a great many others came, and took two half-crowns and some sixpences from my pocket; they tore my waistcoat off, which had my comb and other things, in the pockets. They tore my breeches pockets off, and took my hat off my head, in which was my handkerchief; they took both away; they took away every thing I had. Then the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Let the b - g - r go;" I made the best of my way home. I lost my friend before they attacked me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the following Wednesday morning, I met him in Oxford-road, knew him, and had him secured. I had seen him about Oxford-road before the robbery; I never spoke to him before, but am certain he is the man - they were three or four minutes robbing me. I had seen the prisoner walking in Oxford-road about a week before, and four or five times before that. I have not seen my property since.</p>

Crawley said, he and two others were concerned in the robbery, that they got in at the window by taking the bar down, as the pins were not fastened inside, and one of them got in, and brought the things out. He said they did not intend to steal these things, but they went for a bowl of silver, and being disappointed, they took them, and that Clark pawned them in Kingsland-road.

I heard a noise about half-past twelve, and at two o'clock in the night, like the creaking of a door, but thought it was at the next house. About half-past five o'clock, I was alarmed, and informed that my door was open - it was light then. I found the iron bar of the area forced off, which would admit a person; they could then get in at the kitchen window, which was shut close down. They forced open my parlour-door, where the property was, and I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 15 l. together. I have employed the prisoner in the house for many years, and within the last three months. He knew the house very well.</p>

I went to the door, and saw the prisoner had just shut the passage-door, and was walking down stairs. I asked him what he did in the house? he made no answer, but looked confused. I suspected him, and went down after him; he looked behind and saw me, then ran away; I called Stop thief! and he was stopped. I went up to him, and took him to the watch-house; he was searched in my presence, and in a handkerchief that he had in his hand, was found, two silver cups, a wine-strainer, a plated toast-rack, and a phosphorus box; and in different parts of his clothes, were found two gravy, four table and four desert-spoons, all of which are mine, and are worth above 15 l. as old silver.

            . I am a constable. I followed the procession from St. Mildred's-court to Cornhill; there was a bustle, as a gentleman had lost his watch; some of the mob gave the prisoner in charge. I found a watch in his fob, which he said was his own. I went to the watchmaker, and found the prosecutor out - he claimed it. The prisoner had two other seals in his pocket.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Maynard. The prisoner came to the shop, and looked out articles to the amount of 10 l. While she was looking at them two ladies came in a carriage; I had to attend them, being the only person in the shop; she must have taken these things during that time. Miss Maynard sent me a note, and I detained her as long as I could. She went out, I followed, and charged her with having a shawl in her pocket; she went into the shop followed by the beadle, whom I had sent for. He searched her, and found all the articles stated in the indictment, except the square silk shawl - the silk stockings she dropped in the shop. She was then taken to the Compter where the shawl was found on her.</p>

            . Having frequently missed brushes, and particularly on the evening of the 8th of September, I suspected the prisoner, as he was the only person employed in that part of the warehouse. Next morning, I concealed myself, and saw him take the brushes off the counter, put them on the ground, close to the cellar-window; he then went down stairs, and took them through the window. He came up soon after, and left the warehouse; I sent a porter to bring him back, and charged him with the theft - he denied it. I found four brushes on him, and gave him in charge.</p>

On the 26th of July I was returning from West-End fair about nine o'clock, I was met by a gang of eight or nine men and boys, who surrounded and carried me away from my friends. I caught hold of my watch by the ribbon; I held it, and received several cuts about my head with sticks. I struggled with them for ten minutes - they then got my watch. I was separated from my friends, who were afraid to come to my assistance. I received several kicks about my body. They tore my breeches-pocket out, in which was 9 s.; I also lost my handkerchief. I was stunned with the blows, and could not discern any of them.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in Cable-street, Wellclose-square. On the 28th of July the prisoner came to sell me a watch, I said it would not suit me. He came again at three o'clock, and left it to be repaired; it was to come to 6 s. - the swivel was broken by some violence. He was to call next day for it, he did not call until the day after. In the mean time, Coombes had given me information. The prisoner was to call on Thursday, but did not until Friday at ten o'clock. I told him to come in an hour, and it would be ready - he came to the door at three o'clock, and asked for it - I told him to come in, he declined it, and went away. I did not see him again until the next day, when he was in custody.</p>

On the 9th of August, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came with two bundles, he sat down in the taproom, and had some beer; in about an hour and a half he asked if he might leave the bundles while he went down to Bow He returned in about two hours, and took one away; returned afterwards, and sold a pair of sheets out of the other bundle to a man for 9 s. In the course of the afternoon I had information, and gave him in charge with the other bundle.</p>

I returned on the 5th of July, and they were stolen. I had received the 50 l. note from a banking house in Lombard-street, and the 30 l. note from Mr. Wood. I have since got the number of the 50 l. note, but did not know it at the time. My husband died on the 18th of June - the prisoner was his brother - he knew I had this money. The glass of my window was broken, and then the fastening undone. I had asked the prisoner before I left to put a gimlet in the window to fasten it, which he did. The gimlet was used to force my drawers open. In consequence of information I had the prisoner apprehended, Mr. Birnie discharged him, and told him the best way to prove his innocence was to find the robbery out for me, but he never came near me. He acknowledged he had been in the house twice while I was absent. The 30 l. note has Wood on it.</p>

I went there about a quarter after seven o'clock, and opened the door without making a noise, and saw Morton bringing part of a sack of buck wheat along the floor towards the door. I asked him what he was doing? he said he did not know. I then saw Townsend and Dick on the same floor, filling sacks from the bulk; before they saw me they were bringing sacks towards the door, where four other full sacks had been placed. I asked them if they had any orders to fill the sacks? Townsend said he knew nothing about it. I asked if Dick had any orders? Dick immediately made his escape down, through the cellar. I got Morton and Townsend together, and asked them why they were putting it up without any order, or a meter to attend them? Morton said,</p>
               <p>"We have done wrong, let us shoot it back to the bulk." I said they should not move it unless they called Dick back; I got assistance, and had the prisoners secured. The sacks were not our's, they contained eight quarters and three bushels of buck wheat, which corresponded with the bulk. They said it was of no use having a piece of work about it, and wanted to shoot it back. As soon as they saw me they dropped the sacks and concealed themselves. Corn cannot be delivered without an order.</p>

               <p>"Here he is." The prisoner came to the door with a horse and cart. They opened the door, and brought him out three or four large bundles, which he drove away with towards town - they followed. I knew the prisoner by sight before.</p>

            . I am an oilman, and am son-in-law to Mrs. Dark. On the 24th of June, I received information, went to the house, and remained there all night. About<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150012"/>four o'clock in the morning two men passed the area, and peeped down. I followed them part of the way to Fulham - they kept looking back. I returned between four and five o'clock, and saw the prisoner with a horse and cart, walking about - there was neither name or number on the cart. I asked him why he was there? He said he was waiting for two gentlemen, who were coming from Kensington, as he was to take them to town to save the toll. He said his cart had been painted a week before, which was the reason he had no number. He took me to Mr. Gan, of Deptford, whom he knew. I left him there.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. I found the prisoner at the watch-house. I told her it was an improper time to be looking for her husband; another watchman came in and said her husband was in bed. She then said she must tell the truth - she went there for a few chips. I said she might get them at a proper time. She said there were too many eyes about. I searched her, and found the coffee in a handkerchief under her apron.</p>

I said, he was the man who had robbed me, and ran over the street to him - he laid hold of my arm. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man who robbed me, will you give me my clothes." He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you will go with me." I said I would not, but must give him in charge. I laid hold of him, but he struck me, and ran away. I called Stop thief! He escaped into a house, and I told the people to secure him, while I went for an officer - he was secured. I am certain he is the man - he walked forty or fifty yards with me.

            . I am a shoemaker. I heard the cry of Stop thief! saw the prisoner running, and followed him into a house in Luntley-place. I asked him what he had been about? He told me to be quiet, and it would soon be over. The prosecutrix was following him, and said she had been robbed. He wished her to come into the house, but she said she would not, for he would murder her; I held the door to keep him in while she fetched an officer - a woman came and ordered me out. I went out, but suspecting he would make his escape backward, I went into the next house, and saw him getting over the wall; he ran round into Luntley-place again, and defied any man to touch him. We at last secured him.</p>

My hat and handkerchief were taken from me before they used any violence. I do not know the prisoner as it was quite dusk.</p>

On Sunday I made inquiry after him, and heard he was gone to Ireland, and saw nothing of him until about three weeks ago, when he passed my door; my wife followed him. I got a constable, and had him secured. He said he gave the clothes to a friend at Deptford to pawn for him. I asked him what possessed him to rob me, after being so long with me? he said he believed the Devil possessed him. I said nothing to induce him to confess.</p>

I felt round his body, and found something hard under his waistcoat. I turned round, missed him, and followed him into the street, but could not see him. I went to the yard, and there saw him standing by the water-butt. As I approached him, I heard something fall, saw a table-spoon lying at his feet, and another table-spoon in a cloth on the ground. I collared and took him into the tap-room, sent for a constable, and said, if he would give me the rest of the property I would let him go.

On Tuesday, the 27th of July, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, I was coming out of West-End fair, and saw a number of apparently boys jump over a hedge. Several people were before me - I thought I would get up to them for protection. The prisoner came up to me, and knocked my hat off - I turned about, and struck him. I believe him to be one of those who came over the hedge. I knocked him down - he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Stall here - stall him! cut his throat!" In about a minute, near fifty of them came up, and held me up. I was beat about in every part of my body with bludgeons and other things. I was so severely beaten, that I laid at Mr. Bannister's, a surgeon, at Hampstead, for two days and three nights, and was senseless a day and a night. While they held me, I lost a silver snuff-box, 16 s. in money, a pair of gloves, and a silk handkerchief from my person. My coat was torn all to pieces. When they had got all I had they left me. I fell down with the loss of blood, and crawled into one of the booths. A friend happened to see me afterwards, and conveyed me in a coach to the surgeon's. I became insensible before I was put into the coach, and remained so. I missed my property before I was insensible.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were beating you, did you observe them robbing you - A. No, my Lord, they were beating me on all sides. My property was safe before they attacked me. I heard the prisoner call out several times,</p>
               <p>"Murder him!" till they began beating me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is the person who knocked off your hat, and called out - A. I am; I took particular notice of him, and struck him. They all belonged to the same party. I have never recovered my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Were you sober - A. Yes; I had only drank part of a bottle of cyder; I could distinguish the prisoner well. I saw him at Bow-street on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that you cut the prisoner's head - A. No; I said I thought I might. I can swear to another of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner struck off your hat, which called your attention to him - A. Yes, and I struck him on the head. He came in a direction from the hedge, at the same time as the others.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUNT. I am a constable of Hampstead. On the 27th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I apprehended the prisoner, with twelve others, in a booth at Hampstead. I found nothing on him. I went with a strong party.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN HARRISON. I am headborough of Hampstead. On the 27th of July, I apprehended the prisoner and twelve more, in the booth, that belonged to Smith, of Bayswater. Next day, before I went to Bow-street, I heard that the prosecutor laid at Mr. Bannister's, and went to him; he described the person of the prisoner before he saw him in custody, and on Saturday he pointed him out from the rest of the prisoners, and identified him as the person. I produce the prosecutor's coat, which is torn and cut to pieces.</p>

I said I suspected he had been robing his master of leather. He said No. I asked him how much money he had got in his pocket? I pulled it out of his pocket and put it on the table; it was six half crowns and three shillings. He said it was his own, and he was never without money. I then showed him the shoes, and he said,</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Chandler, who is a salesman, in Newgate-market. Johnson bought two lambs, took one away, and left the other in my care; the prisoner came soon after, and took it off the hook. I asked him where he was going with it? He said, down to the cart. I said,</p>
               <p>"What cart?" He said,</p>
               <p>"That man's cart, that has just taken the sheep away." Two people immediately stopped him with it. He threw it on the ground.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EVANS. I am a porter. I was sitting on the board where the lambs hung; the prisoner was walking backwards and forwards - he took the lamb of the hook. I asked him what he was going to do with it? He said,</p>

               <p>"That man told him to follow him with it." I told him to hang it where he took it from, instead of which, he threw it on the stones. We secured him.</p>

I went to the kitchen-door, saw the clothes were taken off the bannisters, and saw the prisoner about half way down stairs with them on his shoulder. I called out,</p>
               <p>"You have got my husband's clothes." He still kept creeping on with them. I called out Stop thief! some gentlemen down stairs in the office heard me, and coming to my assistance, they made a bustle; he heard them, threw the clothes down, and endeavoured to escape, but the witness caught him at the bottom of the stairs; the clothes were taken of the bannisters of the first-floor - we lodge on the second-floor. The street-door was left open, as there are offices on the first-floor.</p>

They began to walk very fast; I watched them to the end of Fleet-market, where they closed up to him. The prisoner opened the gentleman's pocket with his right-hand, and with the left took the handkerchief out, put it in his side-pocket, and crossed the street towards the market - upon seeing me he ran. I laid hold of him as he turned the corner, and gave him in charge of two gentlemen while I fetched the prosecutor, who had got as far as Ely-place. I took him back, and produced the handkerchief, which he claimed.</p>

I found myself surrounded by a crowd, who were hustling me, and attempted to take my pocket-book. I had no sooner secured that than I felt my watch drawn from my fob. I felt the prisoner's hand pass between me and a lady who was with me, and immediately seized him, being convinced he was the person who took it, and collared him. As soon as I did that, he tried to pass my watch to another boy, and exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"D - n me, George, why don't you take it?" The other boy, I believe, got hold of the seals, but the lady laid hold of it, and recovered it. I took him down a yard, and sent for a constable - I saw it in his hand. I never let him go.</p>

On the 3d of June we were in the house together - none of the other servants were at home; she desired me to get the tea ready in the kitchen, while she went up stairs to dress herself - I did so; after which I went up stairs, and saw her in my master's room on a chair, with a bit of wire, in the act of opening the wardrobe, by pulling the upper bolt down with the wire, and the lower bolt also. I went out of the room; she did not open the door then, as she saw me, and jumped off the chair. I went up into my own room, and in coming down I heard the wardrobe-doors creak on the hinges, I looked in, and saw her in the act of shutting them, she then had a bunch of keys in her hand. I said to her,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you have not opened the wardrobe-doors to get the keys, have you?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have, and that is nothing to you. It is no sin to take things from my mistress, as she has not been the best of mistresses to me" - she went down with the keys in her hand, I followed her. She went into my pantry, where there is a store-cupboard. I went into the kitchen, and in a few minutes I saw her put some things in the kitchen-drawer; she then went into the back-kitchen - in a minute or two I followed her, and saw her at the wine-cellar. She brought four bottles of Port out, opened one bottle, and presented me with a teacup full of it - I refused to drink. She said.</p>
               <p>"You may as well drink it, for you are as deep in the mud as I am in the mire." She drank some of it, and took the keys up again. Sometime after that I gave information.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Saracen's Head, Snowhill. On the 5th of August Mrs. Stent came there by the Liverpool coach, I shewed her into a room. I wrote a letter for her, which was sent to the post by a porter. She remained in the house all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming that evening - A. Yes; he came and inquired for a young woman who had arrived by the Liverpool coach, I introduced him into the room to the last witness - nobody else was there - she got up to meet him, and I immediately withdrew; not a word was spoken while I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you heard any noise - A. In about ten minutes I heard the shriek of a woman, and immediately went into the room; on entering I perceived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150021"/>the prosecutrix lying on her back, the prisoner stood close by her. Turner and Pithouse were in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing in his hand - A. A knife laid on the floor - it had blood upon it. I discovered that she was wounded, and went for an officer. I heard her say to him, that she hoped no harm would happen to him for what he had done, for she had been a very base wife, and he was one of the best of husbands. I left the room, and fetched an officer.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Saracen's Head. I remember the prosecutrix coming by the Liverpool coach - she remained there - I did not see the prisoner come. About half-past six I was in the passage, heard the shriek of a woman, and almost instantly another shriek - it came from what we call the large parlour; I and Turner went immediately to the room, found the prosecutrix on her back, and the prisoner with his knees, apparently on her body, or on her side. Turner spoke. I looked, and saw the prisoner had a knife (looks at one), this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing with it - A. I believe it was in his right hand, I saw him stab her in the neck with it, striking it downward; I immediately attempted to take it from him, but missed my hold, dropped it, and picked it up again. After he struck the blow he turned the knife up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have accomplished my purpose, and wish for nothing more but to suffer for it, and I know I shall." She exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"You have, you have, Henry! and I freely forgive you; I hope the law will take no hold of you, and no harm will come to you." She said,</p>
               <p>"Kiss me, pray do, I freely forgive you." He kissed her twice, she returned it, and said he was the best of husbands, and she the worst of wives. She repeated this several times, and said she highly deserved all she had met with. I took her to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her saying any thing as you entered the room - A. She said,</p>
               <p>"Take him away, take him away, or he will murder me." This was after the fourth shriek.</p>

            . I am porter at the Saracen's Head. On the 5th of August, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the passage, and heard the shriek of a female; I went to the room, and was the first who entered, I saw Mrs. Stent on her back - the prisoner had his knees on her stomach, I believe both his knees. He rose as I advanced, I then perceived a knife in his hand, I started back about a yard, and saw him stab her after that in front of her neck; he then said he had accomplished his purpose, and dropped the knife. I desired Pithouse to take care of it, and I would hinder him from escaping. He said he had no wish to escape. I desired Pithouse to send for a surgeon. King then entered the room, and an officer was sent for. I turned to the prisoner, and told him he was a rash man to be guilty of the act he had done, and that in all probability he had signed his own death-warrant; he said that he had cause sufficient, for she had been a base woman to him. She immediately said,</p>
               <p>"Indeed, indeed I have been a base woman to one of the best of husbands." She requested to be rose up. I rose her up between my knees, she requested him to take her hand, which he did, and that he would kiss her, which he did, twice. I believe she said she freely forgave him, and hoped her fate would be a warning to all bad wives, or women. The officer arrived, and took him into custody. I took her to the hospital.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of St. Bartholomew's hospital. On the evening of the 5th of August Mrs. Stent was brought there, she was very cold and faint - she had one wound on the lower part of her neck, which penetrated the windpipe - such wounds are attended with danger - it might have caused her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose she had not had surgical assistance - A. I think, considering she was in good health, it might have done well without a surgeon, it is possible, and even probable.</p>
               <p>Q. What other wounds had she - A. A cut in front of the chest - it was a superficial cut; she had a stab in the right breast, about an eighth of an inch deep; she had one wound in the right side, which was a considerable depth, it had passed between the ribs, and had wounded the right lung - this was, most certainly, a dangerous wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any discharge of blood from that - A. She had lost and did lose a considerable quantity of blood from it afterwards. She had a trifling wound in her right arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one, or all of these wounds together, likely to occasion her death - A. Certainly, that in the lungs was likely of itself to cause her death, I think none of the others were. That which penetrated the wind-pipe would. I think, occasion greater danger than the one on the lungs. I considered her in danger for several days.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such a knife as that produced inflict these wounds - A. Yes.</p>

            . I belong to the Surveyor's office at the Bank. On Saturday, the 28th of August, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go in and come out of of Shackell's apartment - he is the keeper of the Lothbury Bank gate - she had a wicker basket. I told Shackell of it, who was under the gateway.</p>

She asked me if my name was not something, that I do not remember. I ran in, but missed nothing. About half-past three o'clock, when I came to lock up the gate, I missed the keys. These are them - (looking at them.)</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's lodgings in Hope-alley, London-wall, on Monday, the 30th of August, I saw her son; he called her, and she came down. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken some keys from the Bank, on Saturday last." She said it was no such thing. I went up stairs; she said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got them." I said I would search. I saw a large trunk, tried to lift it, and said,</p>
               <p>"These are all keys." She said, what was that to me. I also found a box of keys; she said, that was nothing to me. I asked her for the Bank keys? She said she had not got them in the house, but if I would go down stairs she would see what she could do. I went out, she told me to go to the bottom; I heard some keys rattle, ran into the room, and she locked the box. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where are they?" She made no answer. I found two keys between the bed and the mattress, with a label on them, and</p>
               <p>"Bank of England, August 28, 1819," on it. I took her into custody. I found a large trunk, and two boxes, containing about 4000 keys in all, and all, except about 200, were labelled and dated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have done all this because I never could get any money from any one. I have carried on this, thinking to be brought forward, and that they would come and take me, but they did not. The constables often came, and turned my keys over, so I labelled them to know them. I took them to secure my Country's and my own rights. I have come here for justice, and will have it before I leave the Court. There has been none here for a long time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner frequently interrupted the Learned Judge in summing up the evidence, and the Jury found her NOT GUILTY.</p>

            . I left him in the fair about half-past eight o'clock, came down the fair, and bought 1 lb. of gingerbread nuts - it was then a quarter before nine o'clock, and quite light. I came about thirty yards from the stall, through a gap into the field, and the prisoner seized me by the collar. Another young man in a snuff coloured coat and slouch hat, came up on my left-hand - the prisoner was on my right side. Then fifteen or sixteen others, men and boys, came up, surrounded me, ripped my waistcoat right open, undid my breeches, and took a pen-knife out of my breeches pocket; they took away my hat and handkerchief, also a 1 l. note from my breeches pocket, and 14 s. in silver from my waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any blows - A. One of them, whom I should know again, said</p>
               <p>"Rip his entrails out." They beat me and knocked me down with this weapon - (Here the witness produced a bludgeon four or five inches thick, and pointed at one end.) - while the prisoner held me, another man knocked me down with this bludgeon; I fell into the ditch, and the bludgeon laid under me. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"We have killed the b - g - r, let him lay in the ditch." I received a cut on my body with some instrument, but what it was I do not know. I remained about ten minutes in the ditch, then got into the fair, and made my complaint. I took a coach, and was carried to Mr. Batty's public-house, at Kilburn, very much bruised with the blows I had received. I was very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner again, and say if you are certain he is the man who collared you - A. Yes, I am convinced he is the man; I saw him again at Bow-street about one o'clock next morning among a great many others, I pointed him out immediately, and have not the least doubt in the world about him. As soon as he saw me at Bow-street, he appeared as if he remembered me - he told the magistrate he did not know that he had ever seen me. I have kept this bludgeon ever since.</p>

Between two and three o'clock in the morning, the watchman found our street-door open - he rang the bell, and informed me that the house had been broken open. I came down as quick as possible, found three watchman in the passage, and the bar-door broken open. I went into the bar, found the till had been forced open by an instrument, and between 5 l. and 6 l. in money, two brewer's books taken out, and all the silver spoons that were in common use gone. I immediately suspected the prisoner - he was not an hired servant. He was brought to my coffee-room, and taken to Giltspur-street - they found a key, a tooth-pick, and a pen-knife on him. I had no character with him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday, the 25th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw Mr. Thompson's door open, went in, and saw two panes of the bar-window broken - the till had been broken open. I called Thompson up; he came down, searched the house and missed the property. Nothing was left in the till but a few halfpence. About eight o'clock Thompson said he suspected the prisoner. We got information, took him at his mother's house in Tabernacle-row, and found a key on him; we took him to the prosecutor's, and then to the Compter; I returned to his mother's, but found nothing there. She took us to his lodgings in Windmill-street; we went up stairs, searched his bedroom, and found the key, which he had in his pocket, opened a little box under the bed; we opened it, and found four 1 l. notes, 14 s. in silver, in a purse, seventeen spoons, and a punch-ladle; ten of the spoons and the ladle were broken up.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prosecutor's, he said he suspected the prisoner. I apprehended him, brought him to the watch-house, and found a knife, a key, a tobacco-stopper, and a little silver, on him. I then took him to the prosecutor's, who charged him with robbing him - he strongly denied it. I went into the cellar, and there observed a footmark; I went up stairs, got his shoe, brought it down, and it exactly fitted the mark - there was half an iron on the heel of it, and that mark was in the impression. I went up, told the prosecutor, and took the prisoner to the Compter, returned, searched his mother's lodgings, but found nothing. I asked her if she had a trunk which the key belonged to? she said she had not, but it was at his lodgings. I went there - she showed me his trunk. I opened it, and the first thing I observed, was seven large tea-spoons, and the rest broken up, also a purse with four 1 l. notes, and 14 s. in silver. I took them to the prosecutor, who claimed them. I produce them.</p>

On the 17th of July, I was at the chapel in White-street, about nine o'clock in the morning, with my sister and brother, I saw the prisoner sitting on a bench by the poor box, I watched him, he came up, and asked what I was waiting for? I said I was waiting for prayers. He said there would be none till eleven o'clock, and sent us further up the chapel - my brother and sister went, but I sat close to where he was, and saw him getting up and down to the box; I peeped through the chairs, and saw him put his hand on the box, he then went and spoke to a gentleman. He went to the box two or three times, and lifted up the top, then walked out very quick. I heard a sound like a penny falling - the person whom he spoke to ran out after him.</p>

I knelt down again, not suspecting any thing; in about a minute I heard a bustle, saw he was gone, and another man in pursuit of him. I went out, and the prisoner denied being in the chapel.

On the 17th of August, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Coleman-street, and saw the prosecutor going up to the top of Coleman-street, I saw Clark and Davis lay hold of him, and walk down the street with him. I followed them into the Swan, public-house, there, they came out again in about a quarter of an hour with him - one had hold of one arm, and the other hold of the other - he was quite intoxicated; they began to pull him from one side to the other; they went near to the corner of London-wall, by the china-shop, and stood there about a quarter of an hour with him, I then saw Davis cross the way towards the other corner, with a cane in her hand. I went by her, she was stooping, as if she was tying her shoe, I made the best of my way round by the Castle, at Moorgate, and saw Cummings in custody of a watchman, with the cane - we took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prosecutor with the female prisoners - he was very much intoxicated. I thought all was not right, and followed them up Coleman-street. I saw them go into the Swan, and waited outside until they came out, while so waiting, I saw Cummings and another man walking backwards and forwards, which created my suspicion. I went in, and had a pint of porter, to see what they were about. Davis was sitting on his lap, Clark was not there then, she came in while I was drinking my beer. I came out, and found Girton and

Clark and Davis attempted to help the prosecutor to walk, but he fell down, Davis had the key in her hand. They tried to get him up, but could not; I went myself and helped him up, and asked if they belonged to him? they said Yes, they knew him very well, and were going home with him. I left them, and went through an alley into London-wall, towards where Cummings stood, and saw Davis give the cane to him - I never lost sight of her until she gave it him. I saw her go away from him, and return to the prosecutor and Clark - I passed them, but could not hear what they said. Cummings walked away, I laid hold of him. Girton came up, and we took him to the watch-house. We found nothing on him but the cane, which he said was his own. I left him with the officer. I heard the cry of Stop thief! ran up Little Moorfields, stopped Clark at the corner of Short-street, and saw the watch fall at her feet. My brother stopped her before I came up.</p>

My lodgers were all at home, and in their rooms - I went to bed last. The articles stated in the indictment were sent me to wash. I got up first next morning, about half-past five, went into the back-room, and found the window wide open - somebody must have pushed it aside; these things were gone. My house is five miles from Lee-bridge.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 14th of August, between half-past three and four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming over Lee-bridge, from the Essex side, with a bundle, it was then just getting light. I stopped him, and asked what he had got? he said he had got clothes, was going to town, and had brought them from his sister's. I asked where she lived? he said he did not know, then said she lived with a farmer named Perkins, about a mile and a half lower down (pointing to the Essex side). I said it was odd he did not know where it was, or the name of the place - he said he did not, for he had only been there two days with her. I took him to Hackney watch-house; he carried the bundle himself all the way. He gave the constable of the night the same account. The pantaloons and waistcoat were in the crown of his hat. The rest of the property was in the bundle. The prosecutrix's house is about five miles from Lee-bridge.</p>

On the 8th of July, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the money and notes safe in a desk in my counting-house, which was not locked - the prisoner was a stranger to me. I did not miss the money until Saturday, the 10th, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning. I went immediately to the Bank, and stopped the payment, giving them the numbers of the two 10 l. notes, which were 5569, 5570, dated June, 1819. I had scarcely returned before I was fetched to the Bank, and found a person detained for offering No. 5569. He was bound over to give evidence, but we have not been able to find him - his name was Hearne. I accompanied him with an officer to a public-house in Golden-lane, where he said the man who gave him the note was waiting, but I did not see him; I saw the prisoner in a court near Goswell-street, and Hearne stated that the officer had came to him about that 10 l. note which he had from him - the prisoner said he knew where he got it - this was about eleven o'clock in the morning. In endeavouring to get out of the crowd, we were assailed by a gang of about fifty; the officer was knocked down - I let Hearne go, and secured the prisoner with the assistance of some other officers. Although it was day-time, the shopkeepers were obliged to shut up their shops, through the interference of the gang. Hearne attended at the Mansion-House, and was bound over to appear here, and the prisoner was committed. Hearne declared in his presence, that he had it from him, and he acknowledged it. I had never seen him about the premises. The note is mine.</p>

               <p>"I know whom I took it of." Hearne said, before the prisoner's face,</p>
               <p>"That is the man I had the 10 l. note of." The prisoner said he had it from him; we went to the bottom of the alley. The prisoner was then seized by a gang, who swore he should not go, and knocked me down - I extricated myself from them. The prosecutor and the prisoner were in the kennel; the prisoner would then go no further. A man came to assist me, and another came up, gave him a blow and cut his lip. I got the prisoner into a shop, and handcuffed him.</p>

When we were about half way over the water, I felt the prisoner's hand tremble against my side - I felt it a second and a third time. When the boat got ashore, he attempted to get up off the seat, and on getting up fell across my knees - when he moved I put my hand down and missed my watch; I instantly caught him by the arm, and desired he would give it to me - he made no answer. I asked him again, and then called my brother to take hold of him. He desired me to feel in my pocket, which I did - it was not there. He took hold of the prisoner - it was afterward found.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's brother. When the boat was put ashore I saw him fall across her lap. She laid hold of him, and asked me to take hold of him, for he had taken her watch. I caught hold of him - he was still leaning on her. He put his hand over the side of the boat, told me not to use him like a blackguard, and told my sister to feel in her pocket. She said she had not got it, but found a piece of the chain left. He fell across the waterman's seat; I could not find it on him; one of the Police boats was near, and my sister gave him in charge. We got a candle, went to the waterside, and the waterman found the watch in the water.</p>

            . I am a proctor of Doctors' Dommons. On the 7th of July, the prisoner applied to me for a probate of this will - I prepared it for him, also the jurat to swear, and was present when he swore it before Dr. Clark, who was authorized to administer the oath; he described himself as stated in the jurat - I took it from his own mouth. He said that he was executor to the will, and wanted a probate. I observed that the name was spelt Anderson at the head of the will and that it was signed Andreason, therefore, I must alias it, which is nothing unusual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the testator - A. He said he died last year, on board the Batavia. A probate was granted him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say he died in Bombay hospital - A. I do not recollect. I told him there was a caveat lodged against the will, and he was to call next day for the probate. He insisted that it was a good will, and likewise upon having the probate. The caveat was lodged in behalf of a creditor, but was withdrawn, as he could not hold it.</p>

             for eight or nine years. I first got acquainted with him in 1809, on board the Bombay seventy-four gun ship. We shipped ourselves on board her off Sheerness, and were both on board together for six years. We were then drafted on board the Elk, sloop of war, in 1814, and sailed from Portsmouth harbour to India. She was three years on the voyage, and returned in 1816 to England about six weeks before Christmas. We were together all this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Elk the whole of March 1816 - A. At Bombay, and Anderson was on board with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the Elk paid off - A. At Plymouth. I stopped ashore nine or ten months, but Anderson went to the West Indies in the Shannon, and then shipped himself with me, in 1818, on board the Batavia, which sailed to New Holland, and then to Bombay. He died in Bombay hospital about nine months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was Anderson in England - A. At the latter end of 1816, my Lord. He was only on shore four days, and lodged at the Waterman's Arms, Wapping. I never heard of his living in Prince's-square.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he in England before that - A. In 1809. I knew him from 1809 till his death.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent in the Shannon - A. Nine months, and arrived at the Watermans' Arms from the Shannon; I was acquainted with him while he was in England. He did not lodge in Princes-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent from you in England - A. Not two days.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were at Bombay did you lay near land - A. About a mile off - he was the boatman; he went sometimes ashore, and staid a quarter of an hour - I was mostly with him. When he went with the boat he could not leave it. I knew all the crew.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he in March, 1816 - A. I think at Fonsick's house the whole of 1816, I am almost sure of it - the prisoner was ill at the time.</p>

            . I have known Vodriguej four years - he lived off and on with the prisoner. I have not seen him for eighteen or twelve months, and believe he is not in England. Fonsick went to live in Prince's-square about ten years ago, and I am not certain whether it was the first summer, or the summer after that, that I made Vodriguej a suit of clothes; he acted as assistant to Fonsick.</p>
               <p>Q. That was nine or ten years ago - A. Yes. I think Mrs. Fonsick died in March, 1816.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Vodriguej remain there after her death - A. About two months. I do not know where he went to, but I saw him in different parts of the town for twelve months after her death.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not have gone to Bombay and back in that time - A. He might, from the time Mrs. Fonsick died until I next saw him. The prisoner's effects were sold off in May, 1816. Vodriguej remained there all the sale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you know Arkinstall - A. Yes, he came from Bilboa with Fonsick, about a year before his wife's death, and remained at Fonsick's, off and on, for two years. I saw him last about two years ago. I never saw the prisoner write - I have seen Vodriguej write.</p>

            . I discharged the prisoner when I first came up about the bill. About a month ago I saw him at the Mansion-house, in custody. His examination was postponed, that I might go again to Manchester and Carlisle, which I did, and made every inquiry, but could find no such persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you engage the prisoner - A. He came to me at Leicester. He sent me several bills before he sent this. In January a friend made inquiry for me at Carlisle, and wrote me that he thought it was a bad bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then propose to the prisoner's brother to give him a commission to get rid of the bill - A. No; I told him I thought it was bad - he said I might depend upon its being good; I said, then I wished he would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, if he would pass it to any person you would allow him a handsome commission - A. I did not use the word</p>
               <p>"any." I inquired at Queen-street, Cheapside, where it was payable; I found the persons had been there, but were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How often after the prisoner left you, and before July, did you see him - A. Often. He left my service when I complained of his conduct, I did not discharge him.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to you afterwards to assist in some business - A. I had him as a witness in a law-suit about July. I was bail for him since he left me, and he made depositions in Chancery about Hindus's bankruptcy for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you surrender him - A. About a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell his attorney that you thought him honest, though he had acted improperly - A. I said I hoped he was, but that circumstances bore in my mind that he was dishonest.</p>
               <p>Q. And after all that you set him up to give evidence for you - A. Yes, I was obliged, and was bail for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his first examination about a bill for 16 l. 10 s. - A. There was a bill of 16 l. 10 s., which I thought was forged, but Hambridge, of Liquorpond-street, on whom it was drawn, said he would not swear that it was not his writing, as he had accepted bills in blank.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner was examined for you about Moseley Woolf's business - A. Yes, he had pawned my goods with him without my order - I prosecuted Woolf - this was before the bill was due.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in St. John-street, Smithfield. In November last I was acquainted with one Harrowell, a coachmaker, in Long-acre - I do not know where he lives now. A person named Pearce gave me the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose bill was it - A. I supposed it to be Harrowell's, as he applied to me on behalf of Harrowell. It was endorsed, Laws; I was to lay the bill out in hosiery, which Harrowell wanted. It being some time since, I do not know whether they were to be purchased for Harrowell or Laws. I went to Messrs. Robarts and Curtis, to inquire about Rowland, the drawer, and offered the bill to the prisoner at Wheatley's, in the presence of Reynolds, for hosiery. I left the bill there with the prisoner, and directed him to inquire at Messrs. Robarts and Co. about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive the goods in exchange for the bill - A. I suppose I did as they were sent to my house a week or ten days after I went; I never saw the packages opened. They were fetched away by Harrowell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Perhaps you do not know that - A. No my Lord, nor do I know that they came from Wheatley's - the prisoner's brother went with me to Messrs. Robarts and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any commission for it - A. No, I only did it to serve the prisoner, as he had discounted a bill or two for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where is Harrowell - A. I understood he was in the West Indies - he has not endorsed the bill. I do not know where Pearce is; he was in the leather trade, in Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. I never saw Law.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not odd that a coachmaker should apply to a shoemaker to buy hosiery - A. I knew he shipped a good deal.</p>

He said if I would lay it out for him as a broker, or get goods for it he should prefer it - I declined it as he said the inquiry was not satisfactory.

I knew Mr. Rowland was formerly a timber-merchant, but do not recollect his Christian name - I think I said he was a timber-merchant. I told them he was a respectable man, but I did not know his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was you asked for C. W, Rowland - A. I do not recollect. I said I knew a Mr. Rowland who was a respectable man.</p>

On Sunday, the 25th of July, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, Mrs. Sharp and I went out - the servant went out at the same time. I pulled the door to; I am certain the spring-lock caught - all was then safe. I returned about half-past nine o'clock in the evening with Mrs. Sharp - I found the door shut. In consequence of information I received from next door I went in; there was no appearance of violence - my own key opened the door. I found two baskets of cut glass packed up in the shop - they were on the shelves when I went out - the baskets were not ours. I took a general survey of the shop, and found a quantity of property was quite gone. I went up two pair of stairs, and on Mrs. Sharp's drawers, I found the shop poker, which was in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150034"/>when I went out. The drawers had been rifled of their contents, and a large trunk containing wearing apparel almost emptied; a hair trunk containing women's wearing apparel was broken open and rifled; a small wooden box containing five 1 l. notes, and 2 s. in copper was also gone, and the bed-clothes greatly disturbed. I then went to the first-floor; some drawers were broken open there, and a few clothes taken. The bed in that room was also disturbed; I found nobody in the house - it was not quite dark. The prisoner was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your servant - A. I found her at the public-house next door waiting for us; it was known in the neighbourhood that we were going out early that morning. I missed all the articles stated in the indictment, amounting to upwards of 100 l. in value.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. I went and informed Worral the officer, then got Armstrong, and apprehended the prisoner at half-past twelve o'clock that night in Swan-place, Plomer-street, City-road, I went to a house there, but did not find him; in about half an hour he came up the court - I laid hold of him. He then said he lived at the second house on the left hand up that court. The watchman took him to the watch-house on a charge of assault, and I ordered him to be detained for robbing my house - I have found none of my property. It must have taken at least three hours to do what they had done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did you take the key with you - A. Yes. The servant had no key.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed - A. In a blue coat, and I think a light waistcoat and trowsers, shoes and stockings. We searched his house, but found nothing.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live next door to the prosecutor - I saw him and Mrs. Sharp leave the house. A little after six o'clock I was at my door, and saw a hackney chariot standing at the public-house door, about four or five doors from mine. I noticed it a great deal, left the door, returned in a short time, and saw it was then at Draper's door, which was wide open. I saw two bundles put in the chariot - I am not certain whether there were more. I went to the chariot-door, and the moment the prisoner saw me he shut the door, and told the coachman to drive on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the man - A. I always believed him to be the man - the coach drove on. He did not get in himself; he

On my return I met a man, and told him to follow the coach, as I thought a robbery had been committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Draper returned did you see the servant - A. She came and inquired for her master, and remained at my house till they came to let her in. I said nothing to her, but immediately I saw Draper I informed him. I saw the prisoner next morning at Worship-street Office, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are the gentleman who I saw put the bundles in the coach." He made me no answer.</p>

On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was taken from Old-street, by two genteel-dressed men, who got in, and ordered me to go to the corner of Fleet-market; when I got there they said they should be back in five or ten minutes, and I might go to the public-house the while. I went to the Angel, four or five doors from the last witness's, and was called from there to the glass-shop, a few doors higher - it was the prosecutor's shop. I drew up close to the door, the door was open, and two men stood at it - they put two bundles and a basket into the coach, which appeared full. I only observed one person putting them in - one of the men then went across the market, and up one of the streets on the opposite side, the other rode in the chariot with the bundles, The man who ran across the street, I believe, pulled the door to, but am not positive it was him. I drove one of them to the corner of Swan-yard, Plomer-street - it was then about seven o'clock; the bundles were then taken into the second house on the left side.</p>

            . I live in West Smithfield, and am a labourer. I was in Fleet-market about six or seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the coach at the Angel, public-house, door - I was then going by Mr. Draper's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150035"/>house, talking to a friend, and saw two men come out of the house, and then the coach stopped - one of them shut the door, and told the coachman to drive on, he did so - neither of them were in the coach then; whether the prisoner was one or not, I do not know - one was a short man with a blue coat. When the coachman found his number was taken, he stopped, and said,</p>

               <p>"I shall go no further unless you get in." The short man then got in, what became of the other I do not know. A man went across the road, whether he was one of the two I do not know - the other man had left the short man before that. I followed the coach into Plomer-street by Mrs. Remmington's orders; a man jumped out, I do not know which way he went. A lad came and took the things out of the coach. I saw the prisoner next day at Worship-street, but can neither say he was or was not the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw two men - A. Yes; it was not the prisoner who got in. The man who went across the road had a snuff-coloured coat, but whether he was at the door I cannot say. I did not notice them sufficient to form a belief whether the prisoner is or is not one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Who should recollect best, the coachman, or the woman, who only saw the man a moment?</p>

On the 12th of October, 1818, I missed a gold watch, worth thirty guineas, and three seals - I suspected her, charged her with it, and said she had better confess. She gave me the duplicates of the property, I put them by for six weeks, and then gave them to my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you put them by so long - A. I was almost afraid to tell my husband. I never saw the watch until about three weeks ago, when I saw it at Bow-street. I also lost three handkerchiefs and two pair of stockings.</p>

I always tear my notes in this way to know them, as I cannot write. We lost 50 l. in 1 l. notes.</p>

            . I am headborough of Smithfield. On the 27th of August I went to the prisoner's house, and found him on the bed, quite drunk. I searched him, and found five sixpences on him - I left him. On the 29th of August he was brought to the watch-house, I then found three 1 l. notes in his fob, and asked him how he got them? he said he received them from a publican. I asked him to bring the publican forward, he never did. He said the publican lived in Whitechapel.</p>

On the 23d of August, the night of the robbery, I went over to get change for a sixpence - a man crossed, and sat on the step of the door; I asked him why he sat there? he made no answer - as I came out I put my hand on his shoulder. About ten minutes after, I heard of the robbery. I cannot swear positively to the prisoner, but to the best of my belief he is the man, he has every appearance of being the man; he was dressed as he is now. I went again after the robbery, and the person was gone.</p>

They came, and formed themselves round us in a half circle, and attacked us with sticks, I then saw the prisoner among them. This was ten minutes after I had lost my hat; I got from them. I saw the prisoner at Bow-street next day, and knew him.</p>

               <p>"Halloo, friend, this is an unseasonable hour to be carrying things about." He made a full stop, and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes watchman, but I could not get away sooner, all is right, the things are all my own." I said I must see into that. He said,</p>

               <p>"You have passed No. 4."</p>
               <p>"No, I have not - I am a d - d long way from it; I am going to No. 4, Alfred-cottages, if you will go there you will find all right" - I am certain he at first said No. 4, Baker-street. I then said he must go to the watch-house. I had scarcely said the words before he let go the desks with one hand, which, being open, threw a quantity of papers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150038"/>and books on the pavement, he said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, watchman, what have you done?" I told him if they belonged to him to pick them up - he laid the desks on the pavement and began to pick them up; I called to Burrows, who was on the other side, for assistance. The prisoner immediately ran off, leaving the desks on the pavement - all the papers were not picked up then. I sprang my rattle, called Stop thief! and followed him about thirty yards, then returned and took the things to the watch-house. Burrows pursued and brought the prisoner back.</p>

I ran after him, and overtook him in Hart-street, where he had either fallen down or was knocked down; he was on the ground. I had only lost sight of him in turning the corner, and am sure he is the man, I took him to the watch-house in North Baker-street, and called to Salter to know what charge he had against him; at that moment a man called out that he was cutting his throat. I turned, found he had cut his throat, and took a knife from him. I got his wound dressed, and took him to Middlesex hospital. He said, he was no thief, and I need not hold him, that he found the things under a hedge, as he was coming from Portsmouth.</p>

            . On the 4th of August, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner by Mr. Montague's house, in Portman-square. Knowing him, I asked him if he was out of a situation? He said he was, and that he had been at Portsmouth a fortnight. I asked him what time it was? He pulled out a watch and said it was half-past ten o'clock. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have broken the glass." He said he had, for he had had rather too much the night before or the night before that - I left him. I was at the watch-house in the evening when he was brought in; I saw him afterwards, and asked him where the watch was? He said it was in pledge at Hall's, but he did not know in what name, and desired me to call and tell Mr. Bevan. He said he found the property in a hedge-bottom as he came from Portsmouth. The watch was cracked on the face like this.</p>

            . I keep the Royal Oak, public-house, Circus-street, New-road. The prisoner came to my house one afternoon with two desks tied up in a bundle - he offered them for sale to my son; I did not see them - he went to sleep in the room. I awoke him, and told him to take care of them. He said he came from Leicester, and had had a misfortune with one of them, as he was getting out of a boat, and stepping on a truss of hay he fell back into the boat, and broke the hinges. He left between ten and eleven o'clock with them, I afterwards heard that he had cut his throat that night. I will not swear to his being the man.</p>

               <p>JAMES BASS. I remember a man like the prisoner coming and offering the desks for sale; I saw them - they were like those - I believe he is the man, but will not swear it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Portsmouth after a situation, returned and slept in a field about two miles from Hanwell; curiosity drove me to the hedge, and I there found these things.</p>
               <p>MR. BEVAN re-examined. I did not hear of the prisoner's being in our neighbourhood; an old servant of ours was seen on our premises that day, and was taken into custody. Nothing was found on him, and I believe him to be perfectly innocent.</p>

He put his hand against the prisoner's breast, gently, merely to push him off - the prisoner directly drew his right-hand from behind his coat, and struck him on his left side. As he drew his hand back I saw he had the blade of a knife. Before I could catch hold of him Huke cried out,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have rued me!" then ran at him, and both fell - as Huke fell, I saw blood come from his breast. The prisoner made three or four more stabs with the knife. I caught hold of Huke, and lifted him up - the prisoner got up, and asked me why I interfered? I said he must be a villian to use a weapon, and secured him with this knife in his hand - (looking at it) - he broke the point with the first blow. I could see the steel was fresh broken against something; I told him of it, and the prisoner said he knew the point broke at that time.</p>

I went to my chest, and found it had been opened by a picklock-key, which was left in it. I missed two 5 l. and seven 1 l. bank notes, and 6 l. in silver; also six cornelian buttons, with gold shanks, and gold-mounted. There was a benefit society-box in my room, which had three locks to it, it was forced open. In consequence of suspicion, I and Stirling went after the prisoner, and apprehended him next morning, about nine o'clock, at a public-house in Essex-street, Whitechapel - the buttons were found on him, which I can swear to.

He said it was a very warm day, and walked up stairs - I heard him unlock the prosecutor's apartment. I said nothing to him as he had been before. I went up stairs afterwards, and saw him coming out of the room; he saw me, and stepped back as if to make way for me. I saw him come out and lock the door after him - he carried the bag out. I am certain nobody but him had been in the room.</p>

            . I live at Leeds in Yorkshire. On the 30th of May I dined at the Dog tavern, Holywell-street, Strand, with a friend; I then had this property in a paper in my breeches pocket - I left between eleven and twelve o'clock with my friend - I was quite sober. We went through Maiden-lane, and into Munday's coffee-house. I got to my house in Bedford-street about twelve o'clock, and then missed them - I do not know how or when they were taken. My friend had retired into a passage a short time, and I stood in the street the while. I found my rubies gone, and my gloves put in my pocket in their stead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. When did you last observe them safe - A. At the Dog tavern - I might have put my gloves into my pocket myself; some women came near me in the street, but I did not speak to them - I never saw the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live at No. 68, New Bond-street. About the 26th of May, the prisoner was recommended to me as a person who could purchase stones for me; he shewed me all he had, and I particularly noticed the ruby, and two large turkois. On the Monday following he called and said he had lost them; I advised him to advertise them. On the 12th of June the prisoner brought me twelve, which I purchased for 3 s. each - he was a stranger to me. In a few days he brought me nine more, not so good as the former, and I gave him 2 s. 6 d. each for them. Some time after he brought me twenty more, which being inferior I did not buy. About a fortnight after that he brought me the two large turkois which the prosecutor had shown me - I did not know them again. I said one was pretty good, but the other was not good. He asked 20 l. for one, and 10 l. for the other. I offered him 10 l. for the fine one, and would not but the other - he agreed, and I bought it of him for 10 l. Immediately after that he said,</p>
               <p>"I have something that will suit you better than these." I said why not show all you had at once? - he produced the ruby. The moment I had it in my hand, it struck me that it was Mr. Hebden's. It was a little before nine o'clock in the morning; I was alone, and considering he was a stout man, I was afraid to stop him, but kept examining the ruby to divert his attention till my clerk came. He found I was a long time, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not wish to purchase it to day I will call again;" and to induce him to call again, I said I would give him 15 l. for it, and 3 l. for the bad turkois; the ruby was worth 20 l. - I returned them to him, and he went away. I called my boy up to follow him, and saw him go towards Hannover-square. I went out of town directly after, and left directions with my clerk to stop him if he came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are a great number of turkois in the market - A. Yes; many persons come to sell them; he appeared to know the value of them. Turkois are very much alike; it is almost impossible to distinguish them.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Delony; I was present when the prisoner sold the turkois for 3 s. each - he afterwards sold twelve at 2 s. 6 d. each, and about a fortnight after, he brought another parcel, which Mr. Delony declined purchasing. About the beginning of August he brought two large turkois, and asked 40 l. for them; Mr. Delony declined buying them; I received orders from Mr. Delony to stop him. About three days after Mr. Delony went out of town, he came again with the bad turkois and the ruby, and said Mr. Deloney offered 15 l. and 3 l. for them. Perceiving that they were the things belonging to Mr. Hebden, I kept him in conversation till the porter came in; I sent for an officer, and had him secured. I asked him how he came by them? He said he bought them of a foreigner. I told him they belonged to a gentleman, who had lost them. I afterwards went with the landlord of the Dog and Duck, to Coldbath-fields to see if he knew him; he said he had often seen him about Covent-garden, but nothing further. I asked the prisoner who he bought them of? He said he was a foreigner of the name of Laprell, but he did not know where he lived.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to Marlborough-street Office. He said he was a general dealer, that he bought and sold any thing, and that he bought this property of a foreigner, whom he did not know. I asked him where he himself lived; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150042"/>said in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square; he said he could not tell the number, but the housekeeper's name was Delany, and it was a private house nearly opposite the chapel; I went and inquired at every house, but could find no such name. I returned and told him so; he said I had mistaken the name of the street. I asked him what street he meant; he mentioned several, but could give no direct account - at last he wrote down Chandos-street, but what Chandos-street he could not tell. I proposed to go with him, but he refused, saying, he was a respectable man, and did not choose to be disgraced in the neighbourhood. I made inquiry, and went to No. 5, Cooper-street, Westminster, and found a book in the kitchen. On my fetching him from the House of Correction, I asked him if he lived there? he said he never did. I shewed him the book; he said it was his, and contained an entry of the ages of his children; he then said he did lodge there, and asked if I had taken his wife. It was a small poor house.</p>

            . I am a poulterer, and live at Acton, on the Uxbridge-road, two miles from Castlebar. On the 9th of July, about five o'clock in the morning, I was coming towards town, and saw the prisoner behind me with an ass and a pair of panniers heavily laden; I knew him by sight before - he lived at Hanwell, about a mile from the Duke of Kent's; I suspected he had got lead - he passed me. I was determined to follow him and see where he went to. He went to a cottage in St. George's-row, kept by Taylor, who is a bell-hanger - he stood at the door. A man came out, whom I believe to be Taylor, or his man Parkins. The hampers were covered over with grass to hide the lead; I went away, leaving him with the ass at the house, and fetched Woodbury. We went there, and the first thing I saw was the grass which covered the hampers lying by the side of the lead, which was doubled up to go into the hampers. There was some wet dirt on the lead, and some in a pint pot, also a sack with Mr. Johnson's name on it. Woodbury put the lead in the sack, and took it away in a cart - it appeared to be just shot out of the the scales. There were some large weights in the scales like what the lead would be weighed with; we immediately went towards town with the lead in a cart. When we got through the turnpike into Oxford-street, we met both the prisoners together with the same ass and panniers, returning towards the house. I saw some wet dirt on the panniers like that on the lead. We took them both to the public-house. I left them both with the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 9th of August, about a quarter past six o'clock, Marnham applied to me. We went to Taylor's; I pushed the door open, and the first thing I saw, was grass on the carpet, and a little mould. I then went to a shed which was open, and found a quantity of lead flatting lying by the side of the prisoner's scales with large weights in them; there was a little mould on the corner of the lead, and a little grass strewed about the yard - Parkin's was at work there. I took the lead away, and on our return we met the prisoners together just by Park-lane, returning towards Taylor's house. I took them into custody, and asked Taylor how he came by that lead? He said it was left by or for Mr. Bradshaw, of Bayswater. As I was taking him to the office in a coach, I asked him what he came to town with Shearman for? He said it was to get change for a note to pay Shearman 7 s. 6 d. for some old iron in the yard - it appeared to have been there a long time; it had been rained on and could not have been brought there that morning. I asked him what occasioned him to come to town when I found 25 s. on Shearman? he made no answer, but Shearman said he wanted the silver to buy fish with. As I sat in the coach I said to Taylor,</p>

               <p>"Why have you got no stocking on? you got up in a great hurry." He made no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Taylor say if he was at home when the lead was brought - A. He said he came from his house with Shearman. After they had been a week in custody they were discharged, no owner being found. On the 22d of July I received information, and took the lead to the Duke of Kent's, and saw it fitted to the roof of his lodge; it tallied exactly in every place, and made up the exact quantity; it fitted the nail holes exactly, and weighed 160 lbs.</p>
               <p>Q. What height is the roof from the ground - A. About eight feet.</p>

            . On the 29th of August I had been out for a walk. I returned about half-past eight o'clock, and saw a lad sitting on Mr. Stephens's step, looking up and down the place; he was about fourteen years old. When I got past him, I saw two men came out of the area, with a bundle under each arm. I followed them into Marylebone-lane, there being nobody present to assist me. When I was within ten yards of the prisoner, I called Stop thief! and he dropped the bundle of clothes before him, ran about three yards, and was stopped by a coachman. I gave him in charge, and am sure he is the man who came out of the area. The property was picked up, and given to the officer. The other man was about twenty yards before the prisoner - he dropped his bundle, and escaped. I lost sight of the prisoner for two minutes as he ran down a court - I ran round, and caught sight of him again with the bundle, and did not lose sight of him after he dropped it. I saw him come out of the area.</p>

I lodge in the Commercial-road, On the 11th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise, looked out of window, and saw the prosecutor surrounded by fifty or sixty men and women. As he came nearer, I observed both his pockets turned out. I saw him take his watch from his fob, and put it in his coat-pocket. At that time, a girl who was with them, struck him on the back of his head - Anderson took the watch from the prosecutor's coat-pocket, and put it in his bosom, turned round, and ran away. I ran down, called Stop thief! pursued him, and overtook him at the top of the street - I began to search for the watch; a little boy picked it up, and gave it to me. I know nothing of Lindon.</p>

I went to the Two Brewers, in Soho, by appointment, and after sitting an hour the prisoner came in, and asked if I was ready for him. I had ordered two score. I said I was, and gave him the 14 s., which he put in his right-hand pocket. He went out, I followed him, he gave me from his left hand into my right hand, a parcel containing counterfeit shillings.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the middle of last Term the prosecutor applied to me to commence this action. I advised an action of trover to be brought. I moved the Court, and charged him 35 s. Brown agreed to give up the property. The prosecutor wished me to proceed with the action against Hobcraft. At the return of the writ I filed the declaration, and served the defendant with notice and rule to plead; I attended at the office in proper time, and found no plea was put in. Crawley said he should be better satisfied if he went to the office himself; I suppose this to be the office he says he searched. He refused to advance more money, and never paid me for filing the declaration. I refused to proceed, and he had me apprehended. I do not consider that my case is connected with a Criminal Court.</p>

            . I am near nine years old. My father lives at Bancroft's-place. On Saturday, the 28th of August, before two o'clock in the afternoon, I went out with Jonathan, David, Joseph, and my little brother Benjamin. I took them to a <placeName id="t18190915-138-crimeloc736">field near Bancroft's alms-houses</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did any body say any thing to you about some cakes - A. Yes, that lady (pointing to the prisoner) - I did not know her before; she asked if that was Bancroft's-place? I said Yes. She then asked if there was a cake-shop near? I said Yes. She asked if that was my brother? I said Yes. She took the child out of my lap, gave me 1 s., and told me to go and get three pennyworth of cakes. I went to Mile End-road for them, and then returned - Benjamin was then missing; I was gone about a quarter of an hour. I went across the field to look for him. I looked about, and asked the people if they had seen him - I could find neither him nor the lady. The lady had a bundle in her hand; I do not know what it contained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Does your father go out much in the day - A. No. The lady had a white straw bonnet and a white gown on, and no veil. I did not look particularly at her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say where you were to find her when you returned - A. She said she would walk about the field. I left my brothers with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person of your family that you told of this - A. My mother - she was out when I went home. I saw her in about half an hour, and told her.</p>
               <p>Q. You told her you saw so little of the lady that you should not know her again - A. No; I said she was dressed in a white gown and a straw bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mother threaten to beat you for trusting your brother with a lady, whom you said you should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150048"/>not know again - A. No, it was for losing my brother. I saw the lady again in about a week, at Lambeth-street. The prisoner was the lady who took my brother. She was dressed at the office as she is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Benjamin his best clothes on - A. No, he was dirty; he had a hat on.</p>
               <p>MR. ARABIN. Q. When you saw her at Lambeth-street did you say she was the woman - A. Yes, she took him in her lap.</p>

            . I keep a green-grocer's shop, and live at Gould's-hill, Shadwell. On Saturday, the 28th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came with a child to my shop to buy some fruit - I am sure she is the lady. I particularly noticed both her and the child; to the best of my belief this is the same child - (looks at it) - I was cleaning my shop-door, which was wet, and I asked her to wait while I wiped it up. She appeared agitated, and trembled very much. She said she was very much fatigued, and had lost her way, that she wanted a coach, and did not mind what she paid for it - she had the child in her arms. I asked her what part she wanted to go to? she said to Old-street. I said she was a long way from there; I was busy, and pointed out the nearest coach-stand - she sat down in the shop about ten minutes. I looked at her particularly, seeing that the child was much worse dressed than herself; its hat came off as it was too little for it - it was a new hat and was much better than the rest of its clothes; it was a light coloured hat - she went towards the stand. I suspected something, and communicated my suspicions to a lady. The prisoner said she thought she was near the Tower. I told her she was at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from Bancroft's-field - A. I should think about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes walk, I did not see her get into the coach. I am certain she is the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your suspicions draw your attention particularly towards her and the child - A. It did, my Lord.</p>

            , I live in New-square, Minories. On the Monday preceeding the 28th of August, the prisoner took an apartment at my house. On Saturday she dined early, went out about half-past two o'clock, and said she should not return till night, probably.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her having a hat - A. I did not observe it, but a day or two before, she said she supposed I wondered what she took out a bundle for, and said it was a little hat she was going to give to a poor woman for a child. I had not noticed the bundle until she spoke of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterward see her on the Saturday - A. She came for her things about seven o'clock in the evening, and discharged her lodgings; she took it by the week, as she said she had business to do, and might not stop a week. I did not see her afterward.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She conducted herself very respectably - A. Very much so indeed. She took her things away in a coach, whether any one else was in the coach I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your belief about it - A. I am uncertain about it, it is so much improved for the better, for it looked very pale, and fretted and pined a good deal; it appeared to want the breast. I am a mother of five children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She treated the child with great tenderness - A. Yes.</p>

            . I was constable of the night at Mile End, Old Town. I am a married man, and have seven children - my son Samuel is nine years of age; I have an infant named Benjamin; on the 28th of August he was a few days more than fourteen months of age - he was at the breast. Three of my sons, who are seven, five, and three years of age, went out with Samuel. I went out about eleven o'clock in the morning, returned about four in the afternoon, and found the child was gone, I made a diligent search, and traced the prisoner across the fields as well as I could. Owing to a letter which I had received, I followed the prisoner to Birmingham, and arrived there on the Thursday morning following - Martin had gone before me; I found the prisoner in his custody; my child was in the same apartment. Martin held it up, and asked me if it was mine? I would not answer him though I knew it, thinking it would hold its hands out to me - it was mine - I claimed it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was said - A. He gave me the child, pointed to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the lady who stole it." I looked at her, and said, I believed she was, from the description I had given me - her sister-in-law was there. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"How do you know it to be your child?" I pointed to a mole on the right arm - they said I might have discovered that since I came; I do not know whether it was she or her sister. After I had pointed out two or three marks, I described one on the leg; the same answer was made. I said I had brought them something to assure them it was mine, and produced a printed bill with a description of the child. The prisoner then put her hands together, made some confession, and said she had been deceived or taken in, and that the child had been put into her arms.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it in good health - A. I did not find it well when I arrived at Birmingham. We always call him Benjamin. It has not been christened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your wife and you differ about its name - A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Birmingham<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150049"/>on Tuesday night, and arrived there on Wednesday morning, the 1st of September, at ten o'clock; I found the prisoner at a house there - I had seen her on Wednesday and the day before. I saw her nursing and kissing the child on Wednesday - it was then dressed very meanly indeed. On Thursday morning I went into the shop, and inquired for Captain Reading - he was not within. I sent my name up, and the prisoner was called down into the back parlour. I told her that I was an officer, and in search of her for stealing a child; she was greatly agitated, and said,</p>
               <p>"If that is the case, the child was given to me as mine." I said,</p>
               <p>"That is not the case, you have no child." Her sister-in-law said,</p>
               <p>"What does this mean? explain it, my dear." After a little time she said, the Captain had frequently wished her to have a child, that she went to London for the purpose of adopting some poor person's child, that she was walking about for that purpose, and observed some children playing; she said she went up to one of them to ask if they would have some cakes, when the little boy got up, and eagerly said,</p>
               <p>"I will fetch them, Ma'm," and pushed the child into her arms, and that she walked about the fields, waiting the return of the little boy, but as he did not come back, she thought Providence had placed the child in her arms to take care of it - she said she went away with a view to inform the parents, as soon as she could learn where they were. A lady there delivered me the clothes, which I understood the boy had on when he was taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found it first on Wednesday - A. I saw it at the door in an exposed situation. On Thursday she gave me this account. The child was much better dressed than when it was taken.</p>

               <p>"It is quite a mistake - I am sorry for it." I said,</p>

In July last, the family were at the country house at Harlow, in Essex; the cook and the prisoner were left in town; the groom went to Essex, leaving his wife in town - our port wine was kept in quarts and pints. In consequence of what Mole told me, I went with her to the prisoner's room in our house, and found a quart bottle in his box, about half full of port wine. I told him he had better tell the truth. In consequence of what he said the officer went to Mrs. Grigg's close by. One set of the cellar keys were kept in the cellaret, and another set in a private drawer of my father's room. I found that the key of the plate-drawer, which was in the prisoner's possession, would open the drawer next to the cellaret, and one ward had been altered to make it fit that where the keys were sometimes kept.</p>

I received instructions from Mr. Clark, and searched the prisoner's lodgings in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, and found the articles stated in the indictment, and other goods. I told him I had been there and found the property. He begged to be let into the yard of the lockup-place, and wanted to go on his knees to beg his master's pardon. His master told him to be a man. He said he would send to his friends in the country for money to recompence his master for the injury done him.</p>

The strange man asked if there was not a cistern to be cut up? I said there was, and if it was cut up, I should like it to be taken away - he began to cut it up. I could look into the yard from where I was at work, and saw he cut it much smaller than is usual. He assisted the prisoner in making some pipe, and then both went into the yard.

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 10th of August, between two and three o'clock, I was going to the sale, and met the prisoner about two hundred yards from the house, with the carpet on his shoulder - I thought he carried it in an awkward manner, it being merely thrown over his shoulder. He turned, and looked at me - I am sure he is the man. I saw the edge of the auction-bill on it. In about an hour inquiry was made for it, and I gave this information; in about an hour after the prisoner was taken into custody at the door.</p>

Having several times missed money from the bureau, on Friday night, the 16th of July, I counted 4 l. 7 s., and marked it, between ten and eleven o'clock at night - the prisoner slept in the house, and sat up after us. I locked the bureau, and put the key into my waistcoat-pocket. I have several young men. Next morning, about nine o'clock, I examined my bureau, found the lock not injured, but 16 s. gone. I called all the servants up, except one, who had just come. I informed them of my loss, and proposed that they should all shew the money they had about them, which they did very willingly. The prisoner produced some silver - I took hold of a half-crown that was marked, sent for a constable, and on his person, and in his box, I found all the 16 s., marked in the same way. I told him I was sure he had a key which fitted my bureau - he then gave me a key from his pocket, which fitted it - it was filed a great deal. It is a skeleton key. Mine is a patent lock.</p>

In consequence of information I applied to Mr. Wigley, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Chandos-street, and described the articles to him - he denied their being there. I applied again on the Monday morning, and left a written description of them - he still denied having any such articles. On the Tuesday the prisoner was taken, and the duplicates found on her. I applied a third time, without the duplicates - they were still denied. I went a fourth time to them with the constable, and produced the duplicates - the property was then produced. He appeared very much confused. I knew it to be mine.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Martin's. On Tuesday, the 3d of August, I apprehended the prisoner in May's-buildings. She gave me some duplicates of the property, which the prosecutor and prosecutrix claimed - they were pledged at Wigley's, in Chandos-street. I went there with M'Lennan on the Saturday, about an hour after the prisoner had left the house, in consequence of information. He described the property to Mr. Wigley, and also to his servant, Manser - I heard it. He also described the person of the prisoner - it answered exactly to the description of the prisoner. Wigley said he had no such property, and knew no such person. On Tuesday, the 3d of August, I went again with the duplicates, and produced them to him - he produced the articles stated in the indictment. One duplicate is dated the 13th, one the 16th, one the 23d, three the 26th, one the 27th, and two the 31st of July, and all pledged in the name of Holdsworth.</p>

On Thursday, the 16th of September, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I marked the money in my till in the counting-house, and locked it.

            . I am a brewer. I saw the money marked in the till, and counted it. I had sent the prisoner home to Mile End about seven o'clock - he was not to come again till next day. About twelve o'clock I found him in the counting-house, apparently asleep. I asked him what business he had there at that time? he said his father abused him, and sent him from home. I told him to go and sleep in the hayloft. I had the gates locked to prevent his going out. I examined the till - it was all correct then. I locked it, and put the key into my pocket. At five o'clock I went to the counting-house again, and found 5 s. and some copper gone - I called Mr. Barratt. We found the prisoner asleep in the hayloft; he denied having any, and told us to search him. I drew out some copper, among which was a marked shilling. I thought I felt more silver, and found two others marked - he had 10 1/2 d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master paid me the copper. Hoffman used to send me out with silver - I paid the people in copper, and kept the silver.</p>

            . I am constable of Cheshunt, where Mr. Bailey lives. Bayford pleaded guilty of stealing these things. On the 22d of April I found them in the stable of the Cock at Bow's Farm - the prisoner kept the stable. I told him I was come to search for Mr. Bailey's harness, he said I was welcome, and that he had none but what he had bought and paid for He shewed me the stable, in which I found these harness hanging up. I found a sack in the manger, with a faint mark of Mr. Bailey's name on it. I told him Bayford and Bell brought them there - he said a man, whom he did not know, brought them one morning, and left them for a few days, and had not come for them.

            . I am a gardener. On the 17th of August Mr. Streams and the hostler came to my house with a blunderbuss in their hands. I set off for London a little after three o'clock in the morning - it was just daybreak. I saw the two prisoners and another man in an open chaise-cart, at the corner of Gunnersbury-lane, about twenty-six yards on the London side of it, in the main road. I stopped opposite the cart and looked - two of them jumped out, and pretended to be doing something to the harness; they were the prisoners. I saw a large bag in the cart - it was not large enough to contain a hamper I went about a hundred and fifty yards further, and then went back; the cart remained there, it was just turning round; without calling at any house, they went up Gunnersbury-lane as hard as they could gallop - the three men were in the cart. We followed them - they turned up a place which had no thoroughfare; I followed them close. They took up a frail-basket, cut it open, took something out of it, and threw the basket into a ditch. They went about fifty yards farther, and found it was no thoroughfare. Two of them took the bag out of the cart, and went over the hedge with it, the other remained in the cart; the two returned to the cart with the bag, they then all turned, and came to the top of the lane - I tried to stop them. Wilson put his hand into his side-pocket, pulled it out, and pretended to shoot me - he thrust his hand out, but I saw no pistol. Wilson reached over, and with a large stick ripped a man's cheek open - it bled very much indeed. Those who were with me were afraid of being murdered, and would not follow them - I followed, and the two prisoners threatened to murder me; they got out of the cart, and ran after me; my two companions came to my assistance. At last I succeeded in taking them, with the assistance of eight men with reaping-hooks. Smith threatened to cut my head off. I sent Piper to the ditch for the basket; it was open, and directed to Goldsmith. The man who drove the cart was secured, but got away. The bag was found, and the prosecutor claimed the things in it. I saw the hamper a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. A gardener. I was going to town - the men were in the high road to town. The bag was not large enough to contain the hamper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word at Hatton-garden about their presenting any thing to you - A. I did; he presented his hand - I did not know but he might have a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the office, was not a charge of assault only made against them - A. That morning they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150056"/>were only charged with assaulting a man, and were committed.</p>

               <p>Q. How long after were they taken to Hatton-garden for this - A. About a fortnight or three weeks. Part of the property was found that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that part of the property was found the morning they were taken to the office on this charge - A. I do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When they were taken to the office for the assault, were any owners found for the property - A. No, my Lord; the basket I saw them open, was found the morning they were apprehended. The direction to the basket was found in the Bishop's hamper.</p>

            . I went with the last witness in pursuit of the prisoners. I live on the spot where the prisoners were taken, at Hanger-hill. I saw the two prisoners following two men, who ran up to my door for assistance. I asked them what was the matter? they said that the prisoners had nearly murdered a man at Smallborough-green. I put on my clothes, and joined in pursuit of the prisoners. When I got to the hill they had just been stopped. Tyler directed me up the lane in search of the property. I found a basket in a ditch of water - it was cut open, no direction was on it. I searched the lane farther, but found nothing more that morning. I heard that more property was concealed, and on the 26th of August I went in search again, and found a large bag on the left side of the hedge, concealed in the water-drain. It was taken before the magistrate at Brentford - Goldsmith claimed three shirts and four pair of cotton stockings that were in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has the frail been in your custody ever since - A. No; I gave it to Smith, the constable. The water-drain is a deep-cut drain in a meadow. Nothing was over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Anybody passing could see it - A. Yes, but it was out of the road or path - there were cows in the field. The lane is half a mile long.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Gaskine, May-fair. On the 21st of August, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, the prisoners came out of Ryder's-court into Cranbourn-street. They pleaded very hard - Morris said Webb was her daughter, and they wanted 2 d. to make up 6 d., to pay for a night's lodging. Morris wanted me to go with her, I declined, and gave them 2 d. to get rid of them. They followed me to the square. I went to the railings for a necessary purpose, they came up to me there. Morris kept feeling my pockets, and wanted 6 d. - I told them to leave me; Webb went away. I missed my watch from my waistcoat pocket, laid hold of Morris, and took her to the watch-house. It was safe when they came out of the court.</p>

On the 26th of July, about half-past six o'clock in the afternoon, I was at West End fair with my wife and child; five men attacked and hustled me as I came through - they jostled me, parted my wife and child from me, and pushed her into the crowd - one of them hustled me, and forced me down on my knees, and then five of them surrounded me. I got up again; they closed in upon me, and Carter took hold of my left arm, while the others took my watch from my fob. I collared the man who took my watch; Carter immediately struck me - I am certain Cameron is the man who shoved me down on my knees; I have never found my watch. I held the man, and saw Furzeman coming to my assistance. He came up, collared him, and we took him to the back of the fair, then a crowd of about fifty or sixty marched towards me with bludgeons and short sticks - Carter was the first man who came up. He struck Furzeman across the mouth with a bludgeon, they then struck me also, knocked me down, and rescued the man from us; then two or three jumped on the top of me, and cried out,</p>

On the 7th, about three o'clock in the morning, I went to my field and found my haystack down - it appeared to have fallen down: it must have been cut away underneath. The prisoner had no orders from me to cut or sell it - I meant it for my own use; I found the prisoner there binding some hay. The stack had fallen into a ditch, and part into another field. I asked him what he had done with the hay that he had bound that morning? He said he had not bound any. I repeated the question two or three times, but he said he had not bound any. I called Smith forward - he had given me information, and asked the prisoner, in his presence, if he had seen any hay bound about twelve o'clock? He said Yes, he supposed that he saw more than a load. He asked the prisoner if Tom had been there that day, for he understood that he was not coming; the prisoner said he had been there, and was gone sometime. I then asked him what was done with the hay that was bound and gone away that morning? and told him he had better tell me. In consequence of what he said I went with him to Bumpstead. He had no authority to deliver hay.</p>

            . I live in Vine-street. On the 7th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was passing the prosecutor's field - the stack was then standing, and above a load of hay bound - no one was in the field. I returned about half-past twelve; the stack was then down, the hay that had been bound was carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150058"/>away. The prisoner was in the field, and said he was going to Holloway, and that some boys had jumped on the haystack, and thrown it down. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have sent away a load of hay." He said Yes, he had. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why, Tom has not been here to day." He said Yes, he had, and had been gone long ago. I told Mr. Cossey, and returned to the field with him.</p>

On the 15th of September, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Williams, came into the shop, and asked the price of a testament - he made several excuses, and went away without buying it. As he went out I saw something under his coat. I went to the door, and saw him give the book to the prisoner, Gobby, who was about twenty yards from the door - Williams was immediately secured. I took Gobby, and he put the book down.</p>

On the 6th of August, I had information of a number of things being found in Mr. Gunn's brickfield at Limehouse, where the prisoner used to lay for the last six weeks - it was about half a mile from the prosecutor's. About seven o'clock in the morning, a moulder brought the things away; three people claimed them. I found the prisoner lying in the sack on Bow-common, with the axe under his head, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - this was on the 7th, about ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

I asked him if he wanted a job? He said he did, and I told him he might come next morning, and do Beswick's work. About six o'clock in the morning he came; I gave him the key of the stable, out of the window, then dressed myself, and found that Watson, my horse-keeper, was also come. About half-past eight o'clock Watson said the prisoner had done his work. I said he might stop, but he said he could not, as he had got a job; I gave him 2 s., and as he went out of the mews, I told Watson to go and fetch my husband's blue jacket, which I had lent to Beswick.</p>

            . On the 3d of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and said Mrs. Hughes had sent for a jacket and pair of breeches, which she had lent my husband. I was going up stairs; he went up with me, shook hands with my husband, and said,</p>
               <p>"How are you, Tom?" He then said he was sent for the breeches and jacked, and I gave them to him; he staid there about half an hour. After he was gone I missed the spurs off my husband's boots, which were by the side of the bed, where the prisoner sat. I immediately went to Mrs. Hughes, and found she had not sent him, then went in pursuit, and found him in Tottenham-court-road, about half-past twelve o'clock, with the spurs on. I followed him to the Rising Sun, public-house - I went in to him. The landlord pushed him out of the house, and refused to take him into custody, although he was a constable, as he had a staff - he said that was only to protect his own house. I followed the prisoner across the road; he said he would go and tell Tom that I had charged a constable with him. He ran into my house, which was just by, told my husband that I was a base woman for charging a constable with him, and said</p>
               <p>"Here is the spurs, I only borrowed them for half an hour to go with a horse." My husband said,</p>

               <p>"I have carried them home my boy, and given them to the old woman." I said he had not - he said,</p>

               <p>"Yes I have, and gave them to the young covey. He endeavoured to get out, but two men came to my assistance, and kept him till the constable came and took him. I saw the clothes at the office.</p>

            . I was employed to take care of some cows at Tottenham, near Steel's house. On the 31st of August, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoners Crawley and Amos, a third person was looking out on the watch about a field off. They asked me if the people were gone out? I said No (though they were out), as I thought they were after no good. They said, if I told such a lie as that they would beat me. They then went and looked in my tent, there was nothing there but an old coat - Crawley said that was not worth taking. They knocked my tent down, then went towards the house, and I lost sight of them. I afterwards saw them in custody.</p>

            . I am beadle of Tottenham. Amos and Clark were given into my custody. I took them before the magistrate. Next morning Crawley was taken and delivered to me. As I took him to the House of Correction, I told him Amos had a waistcoat on, which he said he had from him in exchange for a black one. Crawley said,</p>
               <p>"He is a fool for putting on that waistcoat, for he was sure to be known. Amos said he would put a pair of sleeves in it, and then nobody will know it - but since they have gone so far as that against me, have you examined Clark's trowsers?" I said I had not. He said,</p>
               <p>"He has now got on part of the stolen property, and the coats and breeches are pawned at Islington." I found them at a pawnbroker's at Islington. I went and found the trowsers on Clark.</p>

I stood against the gatepost, they came through the gate, and paid the toll, Henley put up his stick, struck me, and cut my hat and head, said I should not transport another man, and swore at me. He stunned me - my head bled. He and all the party jumped out of the cart, he seized me by the throat, and swore he would have my bi - dy life. I had 322 l. in my pocket-book. I kept my hand on it, and resisted. They rushed on me, one laid hold of my watch, and tried to get it out, but did not succeed. Henley held me. They had an instrument with which they cut my two fingers, as I held my pocket-book; several people came to my assistance. They all got into the cart and rode off. I am not certain that Harper was one of them.</p>

            . I am a surveyor, and live at Paddington. On the 26th of July I was coming from a public-house, I was about forty yards from the turnpike, when I heard a noise, and saw Henley strike Kelly over the head, with both hands, as hard as he could; Kelly took a whip from a carter, and returned the blow. Henley jumped out of the cart, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will serve you out for the old iron rig." He had convicted a person of stealing iron last Sessions. Henley began to beat him, the rest got out of the cart, and a scuffle ensued. I pulled Kelly from them, and kept them off - his head was hurt, and his hat cut; his two fingers were cut, and bled. I begged of them to go away, and let the passengers go through - for near fifty coaches and carts were kept from passing; they went away. I do not know whether Harper was one of them.</p>

            . I am porter at the Angel Inn, Fleet-market. I was coming from Hyde Park Corner about a quarter past twelve o'clock in the day, and saw the waggon, and a little boy feeding the horses. I saw a man come up and take the boy down Clarges-street; the boy gave the hay into the prisoner's hands to feed the horses. He pretended to feed them, and looked about. A man beckoned to him - he got on the shafts, took the bag of tea out, put it on the shafts, and took it away about twenty yards; I then secured him with it, and brought him back.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of July I was on duty nearly opposite the House of Lords, as the Prince Regent was returning from the House. I observed several gangs of pickpockets - among the rest I saw the prisoners and a third person, whom I very well knew, sounding peoples' pockets. After watching them three or four minutes, I saw them following two gentlemen very close, until they came <placeName id="t18190915-185-crimeloc988">opposite Palace-yard</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18190915-185-crimeloc988" type="placeName" value="opposite Palace-yard"/>

One of the prisoners got close behind, and tried the gentleman's right-hand pocket, but, I believe, did not succeed. The procession passed, and the gentlemen ran across, which disappointed them. The three overtook them in Great George-street. I went along on the right side, and directed Glassborough to keep on the left. A coach or two intervened, which prevented my seeing at times, but I saw them draw close round the gentlemen. The hand of the middle man went into the pocket - I think it was Lewis, but am not certain - a pocket-book was drawn out. I turned to secure them, and heard Glassborough call out,</p>

            !" I collared him, and took him back to Glassborough, who had hold of Lewis with his right-hand, and the pocket-book in his left. I called to the gentlemen, and told them they were robbed - they came back. The right-hand gentleman claimed it, and wanted me to give it up, which I refused to do until we went before a magistrate. He followed me into a public-house, where we took the prisoners to search them, and threatened me with an action if I did not give it up. He followed us to the watch-house, and said he would come forward if I would give him some papers of no consequence out of it, which I did. He took a memorandum or two, rubbed some out, then threw the book at me, and said I might keep it and be d - d, for he was not going to have the trouble of prosecuting. As we went to the office, the prisoners said, as the gentleman would not come forward, they wished they had a few pounds to make it up with me - I said I would hear nothing of the kind.</p>

            . I was with Gook, and saw the prisoners and another following the gentlemen. They crossed over to George-street, and went about six or seven yards down the street. I saw Lewis put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, take the pocket-book out, and hand it towards Cook, but before he could take it I secured Lewis and took it from him. I called to Gook to secure Cook, which he did. I had seen Cook feel several gentlemens' pockets.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On Sunday, the 26th of August, about six o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner on Limehouse-bridge, coming out of the prosecutors' dock; he had a great-coat folded up under his arm. I asked him what he had got there? he told me</p>
               <p>"He had got nothing but his great-coat." I laid hold of it, felt it, put it over the bridge, and shook it. I saw something fall out with oakum round - I laid hold of it, and took him to the office. I found 3 lbs. of nails in his hat - he dropped a piece of lead. I returned, and found a piece of copper in the dock, under where I shook his coat.</p>

He did not knock, but the dog barked, and my mistress's sister let him in - this was not the prisoner, but another man. I went up stairs, the prisoner was not in the passage then. I went away for two or three minutes; when I came back again the prisoner was in the passage. I followed him through the passage, and asked him to paint the window over again, as the cat had dirtied it, and my master would be very angry if he saw it - I left him, thinking he would paint it. In a few minutes I went into the kitchen, he was at the shutter. I asked him if he was going to paint it again? he said it was not quite dry. I left them, and went down to breakfast, expecting they would go on painting - they went away, and shut the door after them. The prisoner had a basket in his hand - I supposed they were connected together. I had left them in the passage, close to the parlour-door; the property was in the parlour closet. All the family were in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is one of them - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did you see them go out - A. Yes, I saw them through the kitchen window. They left together, and walked pretty fast up the walk. The property was safe half an hour before they came, and I missed it before anybody else came. The proper painters did not come that day.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's sister. I was in the parlour, cleaning some china, heard the dog bark, and went to the door; a tall man stood there with an oil-can in his hand; he asked if the parlour shutters were to be painted? I said I did not know. He said he would do a little about, and the other man would come soon. He began to rub the door. I went up stairs, came down, and told him the door was not to be painted yet, he said,</p>
               <p>"Very well, I will wait for the other man." While I was absent he left the door - I saw him at the back window with a brush; I found the prisoner in the back kitchen, the other man must have let him in - I thought he was the right man who had been at work for us. My sister went to the back door, and told them they might paint the door if they liked. After that I sent the servant up, she found the door open; soon after I heard a great noise and the door shut. I saw the prisoner and the other man running up the walk - the prisoner had a basket in his hand.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I came down stairs about ten minutes after eight o'clock, and saw two men in the stone kitchen; the prisoner was painting the window-frame - I know he was one of them.</p>

               <p>"My dear, where are you going?" I said I was going home and did not want her; she still kept hold of my arm, and would walk by my side. I took her into a public-house, and gave her some gin, in order to get rid of her - she would insist upon seeing me home. I told her to go about her business, and wrenched myself from her - at that moment she took my watch. I did not miss it till I got home, then ran immediately to the watchman, and described her to him; he took me to another watchman, who found her, and produced my watch.</p>

I went in pursuit of him, but could not overtake him, when I returned, the other five were gone - I informed the prosecutor. I went to Worship-street office, and the magistrate desired me to apprehend them when I saw them - the other two were part of the gang; I knew them all well before. I afterward apprehendeds them.</p>

I watched there a considerable time, at last one boy came up to the top of the vault, looked out, saw me watching, came towards me, and sat down on the ground; he went back again, and was there a considerable time. I afterwards saw three boys come out of the vaults with their clothes unbuttoned - I laid hold of them all, called for assistance; a man came and tied their hands together. I went into the vault, and there found the three prisoners, with six pieces of lead, partly covered over with bricks and dirt. I secured them also, and with assistance took them to the watch-house. On my road to the watch-house Pearce said he would tell all he knew about it. They were committed.</p>

            . I am constable of Holborn. I was in the City-road while the mob were waiting for the procession; there was a hue and cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running from a gentleman who had lost his watch - I seized him; he said he had not got the gentleman's watch, or any other watch. He made a great resistance. I said,</p>
               <p>"You need not resist, if you have no watch, you will come to no harm." I took him into the City Arms, searched him, and found three watches on him. He gave me two from his left-hand pocket - the third he pulled from his right side, and threw it under the bench, which the prosecutor claimed; he said he found them tied up in a handkerchief - I asked him where the handkerchief was? He said he did not know. When I brought him out, a gang endeavoured to rescue him. I was in great danger.</p>

            . I have been 35 years in the prosecutor's service. On the 7th of September, in consequence of what my son informed me, I went to Oxford-street, and saw the woman - she said her name was Wilson, and with some trouble I got from her, that she lived at No. 9, White Hart-yard, Drury-lane - Tilley keeps the house. I went with Perry to search that lodging about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was at the warehouse at the time. I went to the front garret, found the same woman there, and said we were come for more plates, the same as we had bought of her in Oxford-road - she said she had more. I found all this property there, and bought it of her for 12 s. 6 d.; it was the property of Messrs. Spode and Copeland, and has their name on it. I bought 48 plates of her, and found 31, and these things at her lodgings. The water-craft I know by a flaw, and the plates also - we never sold any of that pattern. I could not bring them all away at once, and on going a second time, I found them removed. We apprehended the prisoner at the warehouse, and asked him where he lived? He at first refused to tell the officer. Mr. Copeland then asked him, and he said, at No. 9, White Hart-yard, in the garret, and said he had a wife and two children - he was taken to the office. I keep the keys of the warehouse, and am always there the first and the last. The prisoner always came first, and went to work immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. How long was he in your service - A. Eleven months - we took him out of charity. We sell all our damaged goods to one man, but these are not damaged.</p>

I saw no more of him that night, but when I got up in the morning I found a truss of hay at my back-door - about ten minutes after that Talbot came up, and I delivered it to him.

On Monday morning I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150068"/>passed Ballard's house, saw the hay at the door, and kept my eye on it. He came down between five and six o'clock, and was taking it into his barn - I took it from him. In consequence of what he said I apprehended the prisoner - he said he did not bring the hay there. He escaped from me twice that morning; I then gave him to the constable, he got from him, and was not taken till this month. Ballard said he took the hay to detect the prisoner.</p>

I told the prisoner he had better come and set on my side of the room - he came and sat by my side; we drank together, with two other men. I asked the servant to change me a 1 l. note, he returned it to me, saying that he could not. I wrapped it up in a piece of paper, and put it in my pocket I fell asleep - when I awoke, my breeches-pocket was turned out, and the company and my note were gone, as also my pocket-book, containing my discharge and some duplicates. Next morning I went to Knightsbridge, and found my shirt had been redeemed by producing the duplicate, and that the prisoner had offered a man 3 s. to redeem another shirt of mine - I stopped two of the articles. I traced my note to the Grapes, at Brompton. I found my shirt, which had been redeemed, at the barracks.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Queen's Head. The prosecutor was there, and the prisoner sat by his side. On the following morning, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came, and asked me to get a shirt out of pledge for him. He gave me the duplicate of a coat, I returned it - he then gave me one of the shirt. I said I never took things out of pledge for soldiers; he went away. In about a quarter of an hour I saw him with the shirt in his hand.</p>

He said he wished to be employed by me, to conduct the business for me - I agreed to this, and was to pay him 2 l. a week to attend to the business in my absence; he was to make the bread, sell it, and account to me for the produce on demand. I was to supply the flour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there certain fixtures in the house - A. Yes; he sold them to me, and an inventory was taken in his presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the articles stated in the indictment fixed - A. Yes; the stoves, desk, and copper - the drawers were part of the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent in twelve sacks of flour - A. I did, and in about ten days after I called on him for the proceeds - he gave me 4 l. in money, and wrote on a piece of paper,</p>
               <p>"4 l. money, and 2 l. wages," and said</p>
               <p>"This is all I have to give you at present." He had consumed five or six sacks of flour. I saw three or four sacks of flour standing in the shop. I went away, telling him, if he did not go on to give better satisfaction, I should send for the remaining flour, and discharge him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not forbid him to make more bread - A. No; he and his wife came and pleaded hard, I consented to let him go on, as he promised a better account. About a week after I went to my premises, and found them shut up; I could not get admission. On the Saturday following I employed Clark to paint the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information, what did you do - A. I went to Hertford, and saw the prisoner opposite Mr. Kimpton's, the baker, door - this was the first Friday in September. I gave him in charge, and accompanied him to London. He called me every thing that was vile, and used violent expressions. I got the key of my premises, went there, and found neither the flour, sacks, nor fixtures. Three sacks and two or three bushels of flour, also some empty sacks, have been returned to me by Mr. Kimpton, of Hertford. I believe Kimpton also returned all the fixtures.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You are assignee to a person named Easton - A. Yes; I became assignee on the 10th of August last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any claim on the prisoner, except as assignee of Easton - A. No; I found him in possession of the house and fixtures, carrying on business. He said it was all to be his on the payment of 100 l., and he had paid 15 l. of it. The house belonged to Easton's estate. An agreement was signed between us, which was read over to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was read over to him - A. I will not swear the agreement was read to him, but the memorandum was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"If you don't render up the property to me which you have paid for, I shall send the messenger, and take it by force" - A. Never in my life. I produce the receipt for the eight guineas I paid.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he not liberty to sell the bread to whom he liked - A. Yes, but to give no credit. He gave me no notice of his intention to leave. Clark said he thought he was gone to Hertford. When I took him at Hertford he said he had been misled.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not say he was misled by signing an agreement with you which he ought not to have signed - A. I do not remember, it might be so. Kimpton said he held the goods for one Norman, and would not let them go without his order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner gave up possession, and became your servant - A. Yes; he was to bake the flour and sell the bread, not to sell flour in the sack. Clark told me he heard Norman, a miller at Hertford, advise the prisoner to get out of the way; he said he must look to him for protection, and Norman told him to go to Hertford, and in two or three weeks it would all be blown over.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your only contract with the prisoner was, that he should bake your flour, and you was to give him 2 l. a week - A. Yes; he was to devote all his time to my service. He was to render me no other service than to bake.</p>

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel. On Wednesday morning, the 1st of September, about one o'clock, I saw three boys running down Red Lion-street very quick, they were the prisoners - I stopped Brackenborough and Greenwood, Clark ran away. I took a corkscrew out of Brackenborough's pocket, and took him to the watch-house, and on Greenwood I found a silver-mounted cork. Brackenborough said he had had the corkscrew some months. I asked them where they had been at that time of the morning? they said,</p>
               <p>"Like other lads, spending their time in Swan-alley" - there are a number of houses of ill-fame there. I took them before a Magistrate. Greenwood would give no account how he came by the cork - they were remanded for me to discover the owner. I received information, and found Clark at his mother's house, next door to the meeting, and asked him if he knew the other two prisoners? he said he did very well. I pulled out the corkscrew, and asked him if he knew that? he was very much frightened, and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it came from next door" (meaning the chapel). I asked him what they had done with the other property? he said Greenwood had taken it to his (Clark's) mother's. I secured him, and went to his mother in Booth-street, Spitalfields. I asked her for the things which Charles had left there - she said she hoped it was all right, but she was afraid something was wrong, and therefore she took them to Mrs. Markham's, a neighbour - she accompanied me there. Markham said she brought them about seven o'clock in the morning of the robbery. I found a bundle containing two table-cloths, an inkstand, and five napkins. I took her into custody.</p>
               <p>HANNAH MARKHAM. Mrs. Clark, left the bundle at my house. I did not know a thing it contained. She asked me to let her leave them till she called.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew her - A. Yes, for ten years. She bore an excellent character.</p>

I asked her if she wanted to buy a necklace? I shewed them to her. She took up one and then another; I asked 9 s. for them. She whispered to the others, and then said she would lash and bolt - I did not know her meaning, and asked her for the beads. The other returned her's, but the prisoner kept what she had got, and offered me 7 s. for them - we agreed for 8 s. She said she had no money, but would get some at the pawnbroker's; she ran into the shop, while the others held me, and kept me outside. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150071"/>prisoner then came out, and said I must go home with her. She met a man, and they ran off together; I followed her into Essex-street, she then offered me 5 s. for the two She took me to George-street, and went into a court - I was frightened, and said I would not go there. She ran off with the property - the other woman held me the while. After she went away, the woman let me go, and the man laughed, saying, I looked like a fool. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

I was in a field adjoining the road, reading a book; when I got about halfway across the field I heard a footstep, looked back, and perceived a man holding his head down, and his hand in his bosom - I went on reading for about half a minute, then looked round, as I was in the act of turning he called out</p>

               <p>"Stop, Sir!" and immediately presented a pistol towards my breast - he was five or six yards from me - he did not say a word; but expecting every moment to be shot, I screamed, and not hearing any shot I ran away. After running a short distance, I turned, and saw him in the same place, apparently doing something to the lock of the pistol. I got to a stile, and thought myself secure, looked round, and observed nobody was with him. I held my cane up to him, he then put himself in an attitude as if to run after me. I proceeded towards Hornsey-wood House, met an officer, and described the man to him. I cannot speak with certainty to the prisoner's person.</p>

               <p>"Bill, what brought you here?" He said his mother wanted to speak to me very particularly, and that she was in the infirmary, in the prison. I said I could not go. He looked at me, and said, will you fetch me two-pennyworth of bread and cheese. I told him to go himself - I would not leave the room. My watch was safe over the mantle-piece. I stooped to take up an iron, and the cloth which concealed my watch fell down - I suppose he took it then, as I immediately missed it; he ran down stairs, I called after him, but he never returned. I have not seen it since. It was safe when he came into the room - he must have taken it. He was apprehended on the 1st of August.</p>

On Saturday the 4th of September, a little girl brought these things to me to be mangled, about half-past four o'clock the prisoner came for them; I thought she was the child's mother - she said a girl brought them, and described them all; I gave them to her, and have never seen them since. On the Monday I saw her in Calmell-buildings, but did not know her. She was afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you not say she was not the person - A. No, I said she was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You first saw her at Murphy's, did you then say she was the woman - A. I said she was like the woman, but she was dressed different then. Next morning I saw her dressed as she was at the time, and said she was the woman. She was let at large by the magistrate, because the person who owned the property did not wish her to be locked up.</p>

            . I live in Bedfordbury. I was in the Strand, and saw the prisoner catch hold of the prosecutor's coat with his left hand, and lift it up, then put his right hand into the left hand pocket, two others who were with him, at that instant closed upon him, and sheltered him from view. They kept following the prosecutor until he got to Southampton-street. One of them had a large bludgeon. I crossed to the other side of the way, they turned up Southampton-street. I informed Mr. Illingworth his pocket had been picked, and pointed to the prisoner, the prosecutor's son secured him - the others walked back into the Stand. I am sure I saw the prisoner's hand in the prosecutor's pocket.</p>

On the 4th of September, I was standing at the door of the Nag's Head public-house, Whitechapel - I was quite sober. The prisoner came up, and said there was a shipmate of mine at her house, which she said was a few doors off; I went to the door with her, and she got a light and opened it. I went into the lower room, but saw no person there - the door was closed. She blew the candle out, and pulled my watch out; I am sure she is the person - I went there for no improper purpose. I gave information, and on the 15th she was taken.</p>

             - no such person lived there; she went away. In a few minutes I saw Freeman come out of the cellar, which opens into the little passage. I passed him, thinking it might be one of the male servants going out; I then thought I would go and see who it was, and saw him go up the steps with a bundle of linen under his arm. I followed, and saw him deliver it to Cox, they both went a little way down Piccadilly. I took hold of Freeman, and asked him what he had taken out of the house? He said he had only been selling books there. I asked him if he had been into the wine-cellar to sell books. A man was coming by, and I asked his assistance; Freeman then seized me by both arms, and Cox ran away with the bundle - the man took him, I followed Cox, and secured her with the bundle, which contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>"There are two or three bits there, and they are the first I have taken." I found nine pieces in his pocket. I discovered that twenty-four pieces had been cut that morning. The tickets were kept in the Old Change.</p>

He said it would be wanted to go into the City every day, for the gentleman had something to do at the Bank. He went away, and came again about four o'clock in the afternoon - he asked if he could have the carriage sent by six o'clock that evening, as the gentleman had a brother very ill at Brighton, and wanted to go down that evening. I said I would get it ready, and asked what name I should book it to? he said to Mr. Concannon.

            . I am a coachman out of place, and live in North Harley-mews. I promiscuously went into Chandler's livery-stables, in Great York-mews, to inquire for a place, Dunton and another man were waiting there, I said I had tried to get a hackney-coach - Dunton said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want to buy a good chariot?" I said I would rather have a coach. He said,</p>
               <p>"Master is going abroad, and this will be sold very cheap;" I said I would look at it. He said,</p>
               <p>"If you will wait till I take the horse to the door I will shew it to you. I followed him with the horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150078"/>to No. 9, York-street, a gentleman came out and rode the horse. Dunton then took me to Dorset-mews, and there showed me the chariot, it was then three o'clock - he asked 30 l. for it, I offered 25 l. - he at last agreed to take it, saying that was the money his master told him to take, but if he could have got more for himself it would have been better. I said I would leave it there until Monday; he said he would take home the key of the stable, and then come back, which he did in a few minutes. I got Hill's horse, and took the chariot to my place - I paid him 25 l. for it. Mr. Taylor afterwards saw and claimed it. I saw nothing of Fitt.</p>

On the 3d of September Dunton came to me by the name of Lloyd, for the standing of a carriage, which he said he had to sell for a gentleman, at No. 53, Montague-square; he brought the chariot into the mews next morning, about half-past eight o'clock, drawn by a black horse with a short tail - he said the price was 40 l. At half-past two o'clock that day Gregory came to look at it - I lent him a horse to take it away. When Dunton brought the carriage Fitt was with him, he said nothing about it.

I shewed him one, he objected to the lining, he wished for a blue lining - I showed him one, but he preferred the first, and said he wanted it for five months - I said it would be eight guineas a month; he was to come for it at eight o'clock next morning. I asked him who it was for? he said,</p>

            , No. 63, York-buildings, New-road." I asked what place he was member for? he said he did not know. I found in the list there was such a member, which satisfied me. He came a little before six o'clock next morning, with a black horse - I asked whose horse it was? he said Mr. Vernon's. I said,</p>
               <p>"What, Vernon's, of Bond-street?" he said Yes. He said he had engaged a coach-house in Dorset-mews West for it, because it would be near to the house. He suddenly changed the conversation, and talked about a bitch which was in the shop - I delivered him the coach. Suspicion crossed my mind immediately after; I went to Vernon's, made inquiry, and then went to look for the carriage. I could neither find Mr. Concannon, nor such a number as 63, York-buildings. I went to Dorset-mews, and found the carriage. While I was talking to Hill Fitt came in, Hill pointed him out to me. I asked him if he had not brought a carriage into the mews that morning? he said he had. I asked him where he put it? he opened the coach-house door. I asked him how he obtained it? he said a friend of his met him in the street, and desired him to bring it there and put it into the coach-house. He said he was informed it was for sale, and a man was coming at ten o'clock to buy it. I said he must go with me to find his friend - he hesitated, and said he would find him, and let me know. I said I must go with him, and unless he found him, and satisfied me respecting his own conduct, he would be prosecuted himself - I got an officer. Fitt led us to Chandler's stables in Great York-mews, where we took Dunton. As we were taking him to the watch-house, Fitt went a few steps with us, and said,</p>

               <p>"I may go now" - I desired the constable to detain him.</p>

            . I belong to the Royal Humane Society, and live at Knightsbridge. I was going by the top of Sloane-street, and saw the prisoners and another man together about ten o'clock; I suspected and watched them. They attempted several shops, looking in at the doors; one went into a grocer's shop - I knew them before. Two went into Perrins's, and two kept outside. The man, who is not here, caught hold of a bonnet and threw it out of the shop, Rowley caught it. An alarm was given, and I ran up; Rowley saw me, and dropped it. I caught Burn and Shannon.</p>

            . On the 26th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I and Limbrick were going to Hampstead, and saw the prisoner driving the pigs towards town. Limbrick told me to go and ask him where he got them. I stopped him, and another man who was with him ran off. The prisoner said he was taking them to the pound, as they were straying about the heath; he said he did not know who they belonged to. I told him he was going the wrong way to the pound; he made no answer, and I took him to the watch-house. Next day Phlan saw and claimed them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of August the prosecutor applied to me. I went to Knights-bridge barracks for Bellamy, and the moment the prosecutor saw him, he said he was the man. I asked him what he had done with the watch and money? He said he knew nothing of either. I asked him where Collis was? He said he knew nothing of her. There was a general inquiry all over the barracks for the watch, but I could gain no information; the other soldier belonged to the same regiment. I took Bellamy away, and about a week after the prosecutor stopped Collis herself, one night. I asked her about the watch, but she denied all knowledge of it or the prosecutor. After that she told me the watch was in pledge, that Plant had the seals, and Brown had the duplicate. I applied to him for it and he gave it to me - the seals have not been found.</p>

               <p>COLLIS'S Defence. He went home with me, and said he had no money; Bellamy came up. He was very much in liquor, and said he had nothing but bad notes, and asked Bellamy to buy them. He gave me the watch, and said he had had a good fight to get it, for he had robbed a man at Bayswater, and it was half in and half out of his fob.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 18th of July, about ten minutes after twelve o'clock, there was a violent knocking at the door - the house was closed. I knew Fairbrother's voice, and told her it was shut up for the night. About ten minutes after I heard my shutters being forced, and on going out, I found her forcing them; the moment I went out, she seized me, and in less than a minute afterward Cook came and seized me - he is the patrol; while he held me the woman got her hand into my pocket. I told him to take her into custody. He said,</p>
               <p>"No, I will take you to the watch-house." I said,</p>
               <p>"She is robbing me, and you are holding me the while." He said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you have nothing to lose," and immediately struck me across the lip with his stick. She dropped the money, and stooped down to pick it up - Cook had seized me by the throat, and almost strangled me. A person, named Emmet, came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why are you treating the man so ill?" Cook laid hold of him, and said, I shall take you likewise to the watch-house, which I believe he did. I went in, and shut the door at the request of the other watchman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give charge of them to that watchman - A. He was on the other side of the way; I mentioned it to him, and told him that I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them in charge - A. No, I was beaten so much, that I hardly knew what I was about. There was a great mob about the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not give them in charge - A. The watchman did not pay attention to me - they did not give me in charge. On Monday, Emmet called upon me to go before the magistrate, which I did, and told him that I had been robbed. The man swore that I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he indict you for it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you prefered this indictment - A. This indictment was prefered before.</p>
               <p>Q. When - A. On the first day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150083"/>Q. Was this after you was indicted yourself - A. I do not know what I was indicted for. The magistrate discharged him, and bound me over. I was bailed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. 
               <persName id="t18190915-268-person2265">Q. </persName>
            Name any one of the persons who came to you for money - A. I do not know his name - that is the man (pointing to Jessee Williams, who was in Court). I have kept the house ever since last January. I married the widow, who held the licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not known Cook as the parish patrol ever since you lived there - A. I suppose I have known him as a patrol about five months.</p>
               <p>Q. When he attacked you, was he dressed like a watchman - A. I do not know, he came upon me suddenly - he told me he was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Cook that night make a charge against you for assaulting him - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, when you were before the Magistrate next day, was not the only charge made by the prisoners against you for assaulting them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word about the robbery - A. I did; it was at Marlborough-street Office.</p>
               <p>Q. You were committed for the assault - A. I was ordered to find bail.</p>
               <p>Q. When you presented the charge of robbery, did the Magistrate attend to you - A. He did not enter into it; he told me to find bail, and would not allow me to speak. I preferred a bill on the second day.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it returned true - A. On the last day. I do not know when the bill was found against me for the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear your name called over, as having a true bill found against you - A. No, I did not stay.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath did you not know a true bill was found against you for the assault by the prisoners, before you preferred this bill for the robbery - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you appeared to that indictment - A. Yes; it has not been tried yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear last Sessions to take your trial - A. Not knowing any thing about the method of taking out the thing for the robbery, I went to the Magistrate, and he gave me a paper representing that I was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any other persons who came to you for money - A. Several; I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man been in your house that night - A. Not to my knowledge; they had been forbid the house, as he and she had committed a robbery in the house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Fairbrother come and say, why did you keep my husband so late at your house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the child with her - A. No, she put it down by the cellar-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man get a bloody head that night - A. Not to my knowledge; I did not break his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the watchman to whom you did call, and say you was robbed - A. Dyall.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor as bar-maid at the time. About twenty minutes after twelve o'clock the house was shut up, and all quiet - there came a great rapping and knocking at the door, as if the shutters were being torn down. My master went to the door, opened it, and a woman took hold of him; it was the prisoner Fairbrother - she had been at the house three or four times before, but she was always turned out, as she always came drunk and kicked up a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out what happened - A. She was pulling him, and calling him but everything. At that moment the patrol came and collared him - it was Cook. I never saw him before, but I know his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know he was a patrol - A. He said he was, and he had a large stick in his hand. He collared him, and the woman had got tight hold of him at the time. He said to the patrol,</p>
               <p>"The woman has got her hand in my pocket, and is robbing me!"</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you looked at your master's pocket to see if it was so - A. No, I did not; it was dark. I might have just cast my eye down. The patrol made use of very bad expressions, and said he had nothing to be robbed of. At that moment the woman fell, and I heard money fall on the stones - whether she picked it up or not I cannot say. The patrol held him while the woman tore the sleeves out of his shirt. At that instant the watchman came across the way, and came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master stood by the door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the watchman did not remain on the other side of the road, but came over to the door - A. Yes; his name was Doyle, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave charge to the watchman, did you not - A. No, nor my master; no charge was given at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the parties go to the watch-house - A. Yes, but not me or my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they go for - A. Doyle said to the patrol,</p>
               <p>"Let the man alone, and let him go into his house." Then a man named Emmet and the watchman pushed him in; I laid hold of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the watchman they had been robbing your master - A. No; the door was instantly shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps they charged your master with assaulting them at the time - A. He was not taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not prevaricate. Did they make a charge against your master that night, and at that time - A. I beg your pardon. The patrol said he would mark him, and my master said,</p>
               <p>"I will mark you."</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did not either of the prisoners charge him with assaulting them - A. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your name - A. I am married.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not your name Thompson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Harris and Clements too - A. No.</p>

On the 4th of August, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my window, with several others, and made a great noise - I knew her by sight before. I got out of bed, and told them to go away. As I unbolted the door the prisoner rushed in, and set herself on the bed - I ordered her out, I left her in the room alone about two minutes, returned, and found her gone with my shawl and counterpane - I found her at the watch-house with my counterpane. Next day she sent for me to Newgate, and said she gave my shawl to another person to pledge.</p>

She asked me for some water, I said if she came into the kitchen I would give her some table beer, which I did. She said she would come after the situation next day, as my mistress was at Ramsgate. I thought she looked ill, and left her for a minute or two to get her some wine. As I returned, she met me on the kitchen stairs, drank it, and ran up. I went into the kitchen, to see what o'clock it was, and missed the watch. I and York followed and secured her in a field. I saw the watch drop from her.</p>

He slept there that night, and did not come again until the Tuesday following; he then said he had been into the country to see his father, who was dangerously ill - he went out about half-past six o'clock next morning. As soon as he was gone, I went up stairs, and missed these things, which I am certain were in the room when he went to bed the overnight. I have never found them.</p>

On the 7th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was called down, and found my daughter had been serving the prisoner with silk - she had lost a quantity; the prisoner had just left. I went with the constable to his house; he denied it, and said we might search - he pretended to turn his pockets out, but did not produce the silk. I asked him to produce that which he had bought? He said he had lost it. He afterwards produced some, which he said he had bought. He is a tailor.</p>
