On the 10th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to the table drawer and took out my keys, and found I could not unlock the drawer of my writing desk, but upon pulling it it opened. I found it was unlocked; I had left it locked. I had left three 5 l. Bank notes there, and missed one. The prisoner was my servant; I called him up stairs in five minutes, and asked if he knew the key of my writing desk - he said he did not; I said I could swear that it had been opened, and a 5 l. note taken out; he said he knew nothing at all about it. I said nothing more at that time, but went to town on business, and took the two 5 l. notes with me. I returned next day, and on the road to the barracks met him going to Hounslow - he had been sent for my luggage - he saluted me and went on, and on getting to my room Hunt stated something, and when the prisoner returned with my carpet bag, I asked if he recollected what I had told him the day before, respecting my desk having been opened, and losing a 5 l. note; he said he did - I asked if he had never opened the desk, and seen any 5 l. notes; he said he could not read; I said,</p>
               <p>"How can you tell such a falsehood, knowing as you do, that you have opened my desk, and have seen the notes" - he said he had forgotten to mention that circumstance to me the day before. I said, then probably he had forgotten something else, and had better recollect himself. He went to Hounslow that evening, and next morning, after having seen him, I went to Hester, the publican, and there saw a 5 l. note, No. 4752, which is mine, and one of the three which I had received from an agent; I know it by the number; they were not running numbers. I returned to the barracks, and told him I had discovered that he had changed a note with Hester - he seemed confused, and said nothing - he was then confined. I produce the note.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You gave me a 5 l. note to get changed - A. That was on the 9th of May. I had originally received four 5 l. notes, and on the 9th of May gave him one of them to pay Hunt 1 l. 0 s. 8 d.; he brought me back four 1 l. country notes - and on the 17th I paid another of the notes to one of the officers. Between the 17th of May and the 7th of June I received another 5 l. note from an officer of the regiment, and put it into the drawer with the other two.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before the 10th of June had you seen the three 5 l. notes - A. I cannot say my Lord. I think the third note was paid me about the 25th or 26th of May - the other two were safe then. I had no occasion to take either of them out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You gave me a second note, and I brought you four sovereigns and silver in change - Witness. I gave him only one, and received no change but what I have mentioned.</p>

One day in April, about a month or five weeks before the note was missed, I was in the room; Robinson came in; he took the bunch of keys, and opened the desk - he tried several keys before he could open it - I believe he took the keys from the table drawer, but cannot tell; he opened the desk at last, and called me to look at the notes - I saw some 5 l. notes, but how many I could not tell; there was more than one. I begged of him to put them up again; he did so, and locked the desk as I thought. I mentioned this to Mr. Dawn when the note was missed. I did not see him at the desk at any other time.</p>

            . I keep a public-house at Hounslow. The prisoner came to me on a Saturday in June - it was a day or two before I saw Mr. Dawn; he came for change for a 5 l. note; I was very busy, and said I could not give him change, not having time to go up stairs - he asked me to give him part, and he would call for the rest on Sunday; I gave him 20 s.; he left the note, and had the rest on Sunday. I put the note into my desk; I had other 5 l. notes there, and do not know that from any other, as I had given a serjeant change for a 5 l. note on the same day, and cannot distinguish the two. Mr. Dawn came and enquired about it a few days after - I fetched him down all the Bank notes I had. I put three down; he said neither of those was his; I then put down two, one of which I received from the prisoner, and the other from the serjeant. I had put these two by separate from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150004"/>the others, but I do not know which of them I had from the prisoner. Mr. Dawn claimed one of them - he had a paper with three or four numbers on it.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWN. Here is the note; it is one of those I received, and I believe it is the one taken from my drawer.</p>

I went outside, looked about, came in, and presently I saw a man's hand inside the window, taking this dozen of stockings out - I immediately told Hunt to run - I followed, got up to him in a moment, and the prisoner was then in his custody.

We missed a piece of bacon, a mortar, a pair of high shoes, a pair of stockings, a coat, and other things - the value of the whole was 20 s. or 25 s. They were taken from both the kitchens, and the passage. I went to the watch-house, found some of the property there, and told Maybank that more was missing - he had the two prisoners in custody, and shewed them to me; West had my coat on; we then went to Sheen, and he had got my shoes on. Both the coat and shoes had been stolen that night with the other property. An old pair of shoes were left in the outer wash-house - Maybank fetched them, but I did not see him fit them to Sheen.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke, Chelsea. On the 15th of June, between four and five o'clock in the morning, a man came and gave me information. - On going towards the prosecutor's house I saw West throw part of a ham, and a brass mortar over the wall from Russell's yard; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been robbing the house; where is your companion?" he made no answer, but jumped over the wall. I took him into custody, and found a pair of high shoes in his pocket; I took him to the watch-house, returned, and found Sheen concealed in Russell's privy. Russell claimed the coat which one of them had on.</p>

I examined Russell's premises, and on the border of the wall I found the marks of large nails of shoes or boots; Sheen had nails in his shoes; we took one out, and compared it with the wall, and I compared the shoe with the wall - the nails corresponded with the marks. Russell claimed the shoes Sheen wore, and the coat which West had on. Sheen had left his old shoes behind in Russell's wash-house - I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150005"/>them to him afterwards, and they fitted him. Sheen had got West's coat on, for when I took this coat off, he said,</p>

            . I am a licensed horse-slaughterer, and live in Coppice-row, and have stables on Back-hill. On the 24th of June, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the prisoner, to purchase two horses; he brought them to be slaughtered. I did not know him before. One was a young horse, between four and five years old, not fit for slaughter. He offered them both for 6 l.; I said they were too good to be killed, what was his reason for wishing them killed, and had he got any note? - he said the two horses had run away, and broken a child's leg, and were to be killed for that. He at first said they belonged to Mrs. Whittle, of Chelmsford, and then to Mrs. Wickham, of Rickle, Essex. I told him to walk down to my stables with the horses, which he did, and I called up Read, the officer, who lives opposite to my stables. I sent to the toll man at Whitechapel turnpike, who gave Poole information when he enquired about them.</p>

I saw Poole, who claimed them. I went again to fetch the prisoner before the Magistrate, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have been telling me falsehoods, for they came from Upminster, and it was there you took them from" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did; I think the devil was in me; I took them through distress." I found only 3 1/2 d. on him.</p>

I met a lady and gentleman; I had neither money or victuals - I was telling them my story; they gave me 1 s., and said if I would take these two horses to town, (and told me where to take them to,) and they would give me 6 l. I took them from Upminster-common. The gentleman told me to stop there till he fetched them. I brought them up, and the young man asked what I was to have for them; I said 6 l. I did not know what was to be done to them. I have had a hurt in my head, and am not quite so right in my mind as I ought to be.</p>

            , who lives in Moorfields, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On the 3d of July this clock was missed off a hook at the back of the warehouse - I saw it safe two or three days before. The prisoner is a stranger. Upon missing it I went to Phillips, the maker, and found that it had been advertised. I went to Worship-street office, and found it there, and am certain of it - it has a private mark, in my father's hand-writing upon it. It cost my father 3 l. 5 s. to sell again.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you the first person who missed it - A. No, Rose, the servant missed it first. I did not miss it till Friday last.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was it before you mentioned it to your master - A. Three or four days after, as I thought at first that it was gone to be cleaned, or was sold.

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke's. On the 3d of July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night I was on duty - my brother watchman, Garret, brought the prisoner up, and asked me to assist in taking him to the watch-house, which I did - he had a bag in his hand, and gave it to Garret to carry, and at the watch-house we found the clock in it. He said there that it was given to to him at the corner of Coleman-street, City, to clean, but did not say when it was given to him.</p>

            . On Saturday morning, the 3d of July, about a quarter to one o'clock I was going my rounds, as constable of the night - Grenville ran after me, and told me to make haste - when I returned I opened the bag, and found the clock in it; the prisoner was in custody there. Garret said in his hearing, that he had stopped him going into No. 11, James-street, Featherstone-street. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Whose property is this?" putting my hand on the clock - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is mine." I asked how he came by it - he said,</p>
               <p>"I am a jeweller; I have been doing a great deal of jewellery work for a person, and have taken this in part of payment;" I said, it might be so, but where did he bring it from; he said, from the Queen's-head, City-road. I asked the name of the man he had it from - he said from Delander. I asked where he lived - he said he did not know, and that his own name was

            . I asked where he himself lived - he said,</p>
               <p>"Has not the watchman already told you; they say I have been cohabiting with a common prostitute for this five or six weeks, which is false, for I have not been there above three nights." I said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?" he said at No. 7, Tavistock-street, Covent-garden, and that he was a law-stationer. I asked where the office was that he worked at - he said, within two or three doors of Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. While I was searching him I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, where did you get this clock; was you standing or sitting" - he then said,</p>
               <p>"At the corner of Coleman-street, City; I was standing." I asked what he was to do with the clock; he said he had it to repair; I said, it was already going, and did not appear to want repairing. Next day, as I took him to the office, I asked what part of it he was to repair - he said he did not know, for he was not to touch it till he met the man that evening, at the Queen's-head, public-house, City-road. I went to No. 7, Tavistock-street, which is a very respectable house; I found he was known there, and that his mother lodges there. I have not enquired at the law-stationer's. I enquired at the Queen's Head; they knew nothing of him. I found he had not been to Tavistock-street since January. The prosecutor's house is close to Broad-street-buildings, three hundred yards or more from Coleman-street. I could not find that he had ever been a clock-maker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give you an account of a person named Delander - A. No; I did not state so to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Queen's Head, City-road on the evening of the 2d of July; a person was there who I had met five or six times before, and when the house was closed we walked together as far as Finsbury; he said he was much involved, and could I lend him 2 l. to pay his rent, as he expected his goods would be seized, and would I wait there while he went and fetched me a clock - I was to bring it the following evening to the Queen's Head. I have sent there, and understand he was there, and sent in for me, but would not remain.</p>

On the 2d of July, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was standing at the further end of the shop; the prisoner came in, and took up a piece of kerseymere, which laid on a chair, three or four yards from the door - he went out, about sixty or seventy yards, and I after him; he walked leisurely, crossed the street, and went between two coaches on the stand - I followed, and lost sight of him for a moment, as he went through the coaches; I overtook him getting into the fifth coach, with the kerseymere under his arm - he struggled a little, but the waterman assisted me, and we took him back. The kerseymere is my master's property, and worth 8 l. He said it was a bad morning's work, that was all. I have no doubt of his being the man who took it out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long is your shop - A. About thirty-three feet. I did not see him come in, but saw him going out. I only saw his back in the shop, and do not swear that it was him in the shop.</p>

On Tuesday, the 6th of July, I went over to the oil-shop, leaving the door ajar - I came back and saw it open; the prisoner walked out with this cloth under his arm - he met me on the step of the door. I went in and asked my master if he had given a man any cloth; he said No, and I ran after him, and saw him down Maiden-lane. I called Stop thief! and he was stopped. I am certain that he is the man - I saw him drop the property when I called Stop thief! it was picked up and given to my master.</p>

On the 2d of July, about seven o'clock, I shut up my shop, and returned between nine and ten - I then tried the door; it was safe. I unlocked it to go in, and heard a noise inside the shop; it was then dark. I unbolted the door, and opened it about a foot, and hearing a noise in the shop I immediately pulled it too, and somebody inside tried to pull it open, and forced the latch of the door out of my hand - three men rushed out of the shop - one ran towards the Minories, and two down Princes-street, which is nearly opposite my house. I followed them as quick as possible; some persons got before me, and pursued the prisoner; I cannot positively swear that he is one of those who came out of the shop. He said that was what he got by running after the thief. Upon going into my shop I found I had lost nothing, but the goods stated in the indictment were taken off the shelves, and put into sacks, ready to be carried away. The property is worth 9 l. or 10 l.</p>

I ran to the door, and saw two men run from the pavement across the road, and up Princes-street - I followed, and never lost sight of them till I secured the prisoner; I did not see him come out of the door - he is one of the two who ran from the pavement; other people were pursuing behind me, but I was first. He asked what I took him for; I said,</p>
               <p>"For breaking into Harris's house," and at that time Harris and some neighbours came up, and took him from me.</p>

            . On the 11th of May I went out to my labour with my family, and when I came home I missed some bacon, beef, dripping, a waistcoat, a silk handkerchief, and a tobacco box. I have since seen the waistcoat, and know it by a tear. The handkerchief was marked J. B., and was twilled.</p>

            , JUN. Here is my waistcoat; I saw it on the prisoner Daniel's back one day, and tried to take him, but the constable had no warrant, and would not go into the house - it was found in a box at his father's house when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear to it - A. Yes, by a mark which is on it. I spoke to him for full twenty minutes when he had it on, but did not charge him with stealing it, as I was alone. He was in a field adjoining my father's orchard.</p>

             I found an old twilled handkerchief on his neck, with the letter B. marked in the corner - I did not know that it was the prosecutor's, and let him put it on again, and in three quarters of an hour I found that he had another handkerchief on, which had been in his hat before; I could not then find the twilled one. I found the waistcoat in a box at his father's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prosecutor with you when you apprehended him - A. No; he had been for a constable one evening, who would not take him without a warrant. It was a dark chocolate coloured silk handkerchief, and when I went to him again he had a cotton one on.</p>

On the 17th of June, about twelve o'clock at night, I was at the end of Cavendish-street, and saw the prisoner coming towards me; I suspected him, having received information - he ran away; I followed and took him in Norton-street, and before I said anything to him he said,</p>
               <p>"I will tell you where it is; I pawned it in Drury-lane;" he could not say at what house. I took him to the prosecutor, and asked what he had pawned; he said the watch which he had stolen out of the bar. I found the duplicate of a pair of breeches upon him, which he said he had bought at the shop where he had pawned it, by which means I traced it to Hedges.</p>

On Saturday the 8th of May I left my apartments about five o'clock, and did not return till one in the morning - I then missed my great coat from behind the door, and a silk handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150009"/>I was very tired, and went to bed, but in the morning I missed this chain and locket, with a number of other articles of jewellery, from my drawers. I had left the prisoner in the room when I went out; she had been in the habit of coming there for the last four months, to work for me, and go on messages, as I had been ill. I gave information at Marlborough-street, and she was absent for a month after that - I could not find her at her lodgings. I took her myself in Mary-le-bone-street, four weeks after, and asked what she had done with my property; she said she was innocent. The chain and locket were found at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Court of Chancery. On the 29th of June I saw the prisoner sitting within about two yards from the recess; he had no hat on - in about ten minutes he moved to the recess, and staid there about ten minutes; he then removed, and I followed him, and saw him go out with the hat. I asked where he got it; he said it was his own - I took it off his head; he then said he must have left his hat in the Court. I had seen him the day before with this paper cap on his head. I fetched Mr. Jellicoe, who claimed the hat.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Oxford-street. The prisoner came to my shop on the 30th of June to pawn a shawl, which he said was his sister's. I asked where she lived - he said in John-street, Fitzroy-square. He afterwards said he was in the employ of Mr. Riley, a linen-draper. I sent to him, and the statement appeared not to be true. I sent for an officer, and gave the shawl to him.</p>

I gave it to him. I did not see them till about ten on Monday night. Mail was lying on some straw, apparently drunk; Fox was drunk then, but he was sober when he came for the watch.</p>

On the 27th of June, about half-past ten o'clock at night I marked eight shillings, eight sixpences, six shillings in penny-pieces, and six shillings in halfpence. I marked a few of them, and my son marked the rest - we saw each other do it - my wife and son saw them put into the till, when I was locking-up the house. I left the key in the till. When I got up next morning, about seven o'clock, I found my bar-door open, which had been locked on the night before, and the key taken up with me. It was evident that the lock had not been picked, but pressed open. I went to the till in the bar, and missed two sixpences and one shilling. I then called my son down, and, in the presence of him, I counted the copper, and missed nineteen halfpence and seven penny-pieces. I got the officer, and then asked the prisoner what she had been doing in the bar - she denied having been there that morning. I asked her if she had not taken some money - she said she had money, but not mine, it was what her brother had given her on the night before to buy shoes - she then pulled out her money, which was one shilling and sixpence and three halfpence, not marked, and all the rest she had was marked. I said I knew them to be mine - she said she wondered how I dare say so, she could not tell how I should know one piece of money from another.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ about seven weeks; I had a good character with him; he was taken into custody on Sunday, the 20th of June - I did not examine my stock till the Thursday following, when I missed more than 4 lbs. of tea from a large cannister, which had had some taken from it for retail sale, but what had been taken out had been entered in a book. I had received information on the Saturday evening, that there was some tea in bags in the cellar; I looked, and found it there, but did not remove it. On Sunday morning I concealed myself, and saw him come down into the warehouse several times, and go up again - he came to brush his clothes, and clean his shoes. The cannister from which the tea had been taken stands in the shop. About half-past eleven o'clock he came into the cellar, and took a parcel of tea that laid on the ground in a bag, and another parcel from between the ceiling and the shop floor, in a paper, similar to what we put tea in. I let him go up stairs into the warehouse, and then heard him ask the servant to let him out. When he had got about one hundred yards from the house I pursued, and asked what he had done with my tea; he said he had got none. I sent for a constable when he got back to the shop, and asked how he could be so ungrateful. On searching him about 4 ozs. of tea was found upon him - I then asked where the other parcel of tea was, which he doubled up on the hogshead; he went into the privy, and brought it out from there - there was in the whole about 17 ozs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know whether he is a married man - A. I believe he is. Other persons have access to the cellar. The parcel on the ground laid so conspicuous that any one might see it. There was only about 4 ozs. found on his person.</p>

On the 3d of July, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to make him a pair of dancing pumps; he staid in the shop about twenty minutes; there were two pairs of boots within his reach, but I had no suspicion of him - I did not leave him alone. About two hours after he was gone I was going to carry these boots home to a customer, and they were gone; no other person had been in the shop. I went to the direction he had given me, Jones, No. 22, Great Sutton-street, which proved to be fictitious. I met him about seven hours afterwards, on Clerkenwell-green - I told him he had stolen a pair of boots; he said if I would go with him he would get them - I refused, and gave him in charge. I afterwards found the boots in Portpool-lane, exposed for sale - I knew them to be the same. The prisoner did not say he had not the boots; he said I was mistaken in the man.</p>

My garden is walled round about seven feet high. I discovered about eight o'clock the next morning that five of them were gone. I had not heard any person in the garden; but the wall had glass on the top, and there was some of it broken, by which I presume the persons had got over. I saw them next day at Worship-street, dead, and the two prisoners were in custody. I identified them by their plumage, and have no doubt of their being mine.</p>

            . I am a watchman - my beat is within half a mile of Mr. Benhote's house, in the direction towards London. I saw the prisoners about half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 30th of June, in Ball's Pond road, Brockwell had a bundle under his arm; there was another person with them, who ran away when he saw Waters and myself. I laid hold of one of the prisoners, and Waters the other; we asked what they had got - they said nothing; we looked at the top of their bag, and saw the plumage of fowls; we took them to the watch-house; there were five fowls, dead and warm; we asked how they got them - they said, the man who had ran away had given them to them. Mr. Benhote came and swore to the fowls at the office.</p>

               <p>BROCKWELL'S Defence. I got up that morning to go to bathe, but getting up sooner than I intended, I went to take a walk in Ball's Pond-road. I met a man with a round frock in his hand, and he said he had got into a place of work, and he would give me something to drink if I would hold that bag. I helped him to put his frock on, and at the same time held the bag; the other prisoner then came up, and said he was going to work at the docks.</p>

             a customer of our's?" - he said, Yes, he had been, but he had discontinued his custom, and he had not left a cask of beer there for about six months. The prisoner had never accounted for any money received from Mr. Johnson, from the 26th of December to the 11th of June; he should account for it every evening, or the first thing in the morning. It was my business to receive the money - Mr. Hilder never received any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Have you the superintendance of the concern? A. If I am not there, no one takes the money - the prisoner keeps it till I return; since I have been there no one has taken money, or entered it, but myself; there never was any deficiency in his accounts, that we know of; when he takes out beer, and receives money, he gives a receipt.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you when you saw the prisoner with the cask - A. I was in Cheapside, and saw him at Mr. Johnson's door; I settled with him that evening for 5 s. 6 d., which he said he had received of Mr.

            . I am servant to Mr. Johnson, and lived there from the 26th of December to the 11th of June last; the prisoner used to bring beer there; he called every week, and I took beer of him about once a fortnight; I used to pay him when he delivered the beer, and had a bill and receipt of him; for this cask of the 19th of March I paid him 5 s. in shillings - I am certain they were shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. DREW re-examined. Q. On your oath, on the 19th of March was Mr. Johnson indebted to you. - A. No - the prisoner had never told me of it; all that he took out to my knowledge, he accounted for. I took the account of what beer was returned, and found it tallied with the brewer's account of what went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The beer I took out was accounted for in the morning, and again at night - I was never deficient in any cask.</p>

            . My father's name is Joel Mordecai. On the 1st of July I and my sister lived at his house, in North-street, and we slept that night on the ground-floor. About half-past one o'clock I heard some person on the first floor stairs, saying</p>
               <p>"All is right." We got out of bed and called the watchman - Sampson came first, he sprang his rattle, and four others came. When they came i.e. two prisoners, (who are watchmen), Sampson and myself went into the first floor back-room, there were a pair of ear-rings and a ring in the front room on the second floor belonging to my sister - we afterwards missed them. When the prisoners came down stairs, I told them I thought the persons might have got between the bed and the mattrass - they said if I would stay down stairs they would go into the room themselves and search. They and Sampson went up; and when they came down they went away. After they had been gone about ten minutes, my sister said she was too frightened to go to bed - she would go up stairs. She went up, and said the things were gone. We waited till a watchman of the name of Cox was coming down the street, at two o'clock. I called him, and said,</p>
               <p>"What a shocking thing it is that the watchmen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150018"/>should have stolen these things;" He said, he would go and see. By that time the prisoner Francis came up and said</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to charge me with the theft;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know which of you it was, but it must have been one of you." The next morning we went to the office, and they were discharged on their own recognizances. On the Monday following I attended the magistrates on some other business - I then saw the things, and knew them to be my sister's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS.

            Was there any other jewellery in the room - A. Yes, there were two other articles, but they were covered with a silk skirt. Garrett went into the house the second time. My father is a plate-glass dealer - it is a house of good fame. I am married, but my husband has deserted me and is living with another woman. I have applied to the parish for relief, but do not now receive relief from them. After I had told the watchman I had been robbed, Garrett went up stairs and did his best to find the thieves.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 4th of July, about half-past two o'clock, the prisoner Garrett called me over to him, and said there was something in his box not altogether agreeable. I went over, and found a piece of paper screwed up on the seat of his box - it contained a pair of ear-rings and a ring. We went down to the watch-house, and gave them to the officer of the night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was he then on duty - A. Yes; some person might have put them into his box, which is in the public street, about three hundred yards from Mr. Mordecai's. It was on the 1st of July that Mr. Mordecai was robbed. Garrett said he thought there was some plot laid for him; and would I come as a witness to take them out.</p>

               <p>"What brought you here." He said, he was very dry, and was going to the pump for some water. I told him I had some beer. I forget whether I or he introduced the subject, about how he should stand to-morrow. He said,</p>

I did not complain of his being off his duty - he has been a very respectable man; he had nothing to hinder him from running away; it is not unusual for a man to go two hundred yards to get beer; I have known him some years, and he has conducted himself like a civil honest good watchman.</p>

            . I am hostler at the London Dock stables. The prisoner had a horse in our yard the winter before last, by which I knew him. On the 7th of April he asked me if I would get him a horse to go to Kingston-on-Thames, to take his wife and child, and he should be back about seven or eight o'clock in the evening - he was to have it next morning. I took him to Bates; he paid him 10 s. for the day, and next morning I put Bates's horse into harness, and put it into a chaise of Mr. Cobb's, who keeps our stables. He put his boxes in, and went away with his wife and child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He took you (who knew him) to the prosecutor - A. Yes; he went by the name of Simpson.</p>

I put the clock down - my brother followed, and caught him; I came up immediately, brought him back, and Gibbs told us to bring him to his house, which was done, and on his person was found two silver spoons, a phosphorus bottle and matches, the key of the clock, a knife, and a pair of scissars.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Globe-place, Portman-square. On the 28th of June, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was called to see the deceased at his house. I found him labouring under a violent pain in his bowels, which I considered to proceed from inflammation. He was in bed, and in extreme pain. I sent him opening medicine, not having been informed of the fight. I called again in about four hours, and was informed of the fight. I then examined his body; he had several blows on the upper part of his face and body, but none on his bowels. I found that he had a rupture, which he said he had had a long time; but I was satisfied that was not the cause of the pain. I bled him very copiously; he was extremely ill till evening, and was then getting better, till Saturday morning, when I called, he was then dressed, and wished to take a walk, which I strictly prohibited. I was sent for in the evening, and about one o'clock in the morning I found he had just expired. I examined his body, and consider that he died from inflammation and mortification of the bowels; the fight no doubt caused his death. I am perfectly satisfied that none of the blows on the upper part of his body occasioned it, for it was caused by inflammation in his bowels, which terminated in mortification. There was no blow on the stomach; he might have received one, and I not perceive it. I should have treated him the same, if I had known of the fight at first. He said he was not conscious of having received a blow in the bowels, but supposed he had received an injury from falling, while he was fighting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You could not discover that any blow he had received caused his death - A. No; after death I opened his body, and found his bowels much inflamed, and considerably mortified. I have not the slightest doubt but the inflammation existed from the Tuesday morning - if it had existed before, he would have felt great pain.</p>

            . I am a pianoforte-maker, and worked for the same master as the deceased. I was present at the three last rounds of the fight; I saw him hit the prisoner in the stomach in the second round - the prisoner struck him once and sent him down senseless, with his head against the cart-wheel, but his body came down gently; he received a blow in the left side of the cheek at the last round, and another on the right side, near the hip, and another on the left. He was at work the night before, and in good health.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150022"/>MR. NORTON re-examined. Q. Could a blow on the side of the head produce a mortification in the bowels - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. If he had been drinking over night, might not that have caused the inflammation - A. Certainly; I am certain that the marks I saw were not the cause of his death. Bleeding often relieves the inflammation, and the patient often feels better; but inflammation still goes on, and may terminate in mortification. He was very sick the two first days, which is usually the case in mortification of the bowels. What he brought up had some appearance of blood.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Might not such a blow as the witness has described produce mortification - A. Yes; it had taken place near the hip, on the right side: he said he was not conscious that he had received a blow there.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Suppose a man ruptured, and under the violent exercise of the fight was to retire and take cold porter, might not that occasion his death - A. No doubt of it: his rupture went up with ease; he was then laying down. The parts near the rupture were in a less state of mortification than the rest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from the stables; the deceased stood at the door and challenged me to fight. He struck me, and we went across to fight.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. Watkins lodged with me. He came home between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and was in liquor then; I saw him and my son go to the public-house after the fight; they drank one shilling's worth of cold gin and water together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know of the fight before it happened - A. No; he challenged me to fight, and said he would fight some of the bl - y family before he left the premises. I had distrained him for rent about three weeks before, and wanted him to leave, as I could get no rent of him.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS BUSHELL. I am a surgeon: in consequence of the deceased's family not being satisfied, they called me in. I examined his body, with Mr. Norton, the day after the inquisition: my opinion is, that he died from inflammation and mortification of the bowels.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was drunk over night, and went out to fight, and after that took cold gin and water, would it bring on an inflammation - A. Certainly, it might. He had a rupture, and if the rupture was to come down, a man in the habit of drinking would be particularly liable to inflammation in the bowels; but from Mr. Norton's statement of the rupture, that certainly would not be the cause of inflammation. The exertion of fighting might bring the rupture down, and that would increase the inflammation.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did Mr. Norton call your attention to his side - A. Yes, that part was a shade darker than the rest, but the whole of the bowels were in an extreme state of mortification: a blow there might occasion that, or it might result from the rupture. I should hesitate a long time before I attributed it to blows, but it might be the cause. I consider that there was a great deal of doubt as to the cause of inflammation - whether it was from a blow or the rupture. I have known a very bad rupture go up of its own accord.</p>

               <p>- WESTON. I saw the deceased about one o'clock, on the Sunday morning, just before he died. He pressed his hand very much to the lower part of his body. He appeared very much ruptured, and just before death I heard a rattling noise, but cannot tell from what part it proceeded.</p>
               <p>MR. BUSHESL. A guzzling noise is generally admitted as one of the chief symptoms of the return of the rupture; it had returned when I examined his body. I believe the rupture must have had a great deal to do with his death.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. I would not allow him to go out on Saturday, considering that the least exertion might have brought back the pain, and increased the inflammation.</p>

On the 22d of October, 1822, the prisoner came to my house with a picture; he asked for my brother, who had some knowledge of him, he left the picture to be framed and glazed, and went away, and called again every day till the 1st of November, and on the following day he called, and took out a letter, which he said he had received from Squire Clark, stating that his father was dead, and he had a great deal of property left him, he said there were a number of things in my shop which he should purchase, he came next day and looked out a vast number of things which were put aside for him; he called again next day, and looked out in all 100 l. worth; he said that one Mills, whom he lodged with had 22 l. of his, but it was not convenient for him to settle it, but he would accept a bill. On the 1st of November, he called and took away 14 l. worth of goods, and produced a bill on Mills. I asked if it was Mills's acceptance he said it was, he then endorsed in it my presence - he called a porter who took the goods away with him - my brother was present when he gave me the bill, it has not been paid. I did not see the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cook. When did you first see him - A. On the 26th of October; my brother lodged with me, but had been absent just then, he had been in the House of Correction for twelve months, as a bill had been filed against him, by a man who wanted to extort money. Bliss was there with him - he had a bill with the goods. I did not give him the change of the bill as he had looked out more goods. There is a man named Mills, employed as a carver and gilder in my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he gave you the bill he had looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150023"/>out other goods - A. Yes, my Lord, to the amount of 100 l., and said he would write to me when he got home about sending them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix brother, and have lived at her house eight or nine years. I have known the prisoner nearly three years. On the 25th or 26th of October, 1822, he came and requested me to get a handsome gilt frame to a picture; he called day after day, and said there were several things in the shop he should like to purchase, and produced two letters, one from Mr. Clark, and the other from Mr. Goodman, stating that his father was dead, and that he was coming into possession of a very large fortune, and wished to buy several things to take down to Daventry, for his father had lately fitted up a new room, and he should handsomely furnish it. He said Mr. Mills had drawn 50 l. from his grandfather, who was also dead, that Mr. Mills had been to Daventry, to receive a legacy of 50 l., and he had given him a warrant of attorney to receive it, and there was a balance of 22 l. due to him - that Mills had applied the money to his own use, and given him a bill at a month's date; he produced the bill unaccepted, and next day called with the acceptance to it, and said it was accepted in the presence of Mr. Bishop. He endorsed it in my presence and gave it to my sister - he then looked out a quantity of goods, and ordered me to pack them up and bring them down to Daventry myself, and I should be paid the balance. He said he had stopped too long in town, and should like to take a few of the light goods with him to satisfy his assignees, to make things pleasant as they would think he had stopped too long in town. He looked out a set of china, some jars, a caddy and other things amounting to 14 or 15 l., and told me to send them to the coach office, to go to Steventry near Daventry. Northamptonshire, for

            . He took the caddy and some plated goods away in a handkerchief, I got a porter to carry the rest with him, the porter returned without the goods. He had called at half-past five o'clock in the morning, after he had paid the bill, it was then that he took the goods away. I inquired at the coach office, and my suspicion being raised, I went to Mills. I did not see him again till this day fortnight, when I took him in Oxford Street, I went twice to Daventry after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was true he had some property - A. I know that Mills had received a legacy of 50 l. from the grandfather. I purchase goods on commission, my sister keeps this shop, the goods are her's, I have been in the House of Correction suffering for two villains who were afterwards indicted. I never gave him the copy of a bill to draw or had any conversation with him about a bill, nor ever got any one to draw the copy of one. I never told him I could put him in a way of making money. I knew there was a Mr. Mills, who had received a legacy for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any offer about destroying the bill it any money was paid to you - A. Mills said he would not have the man hung for 100 l. I said my sister only wanted the bill paid. I said nothing about burning it.</p>
               <p>The bill was here produced, but nobody being present to prove it forged, except Mills who was an interested person the prisoner was</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 3d of July, about three o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner shut in the privy of a court, which is not a thoroughfare, and within two minutes walk of Umpleby's house - he said he lodged at Mr. Johnson's, just by; that he had been out late, and they were gone to bed, but as a lodger was coming out at four o'clock, and he could then get in, he did not wish to disturb them; he begged of me to let him stop there; and his appearance being decent I did not object. I went round at half-past three, and he was gone. I saw him in custody on the same day; he was then in a different dress. I went to Johnson's and found the dress which he had on when he was in the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. Not to my knowledge. When he was in custody I recollected seeing him somewhere, but could not recollect where, his dress being altered, but remembered at last and said,</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in High-street, Bloomsbury. On the 2d of July, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner brought two table spoons to pawn for 1 l.; he said they were his own, that he lived in Well-street, Drury-lane. I had received notice of this robbery, and said I suspected they were stolen, and must detain him - he made no answer. I told my brother to look after him while I went for the street-keeper - my brother not understanding me let him go; he ran from the shop when I came back, and turned up some of the back streets - we followed, and secured him in Bosiers-court, Tottenham Court-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he is the person who came to your shop - A. Quite. I lost sight of him in turning the corners.</p>

On taking stock on the 23d of June we missed three seals among a great deal of other property; they were gold seals, and had been kept in a drawer in the warehouse. We found them in pawn. We can ascertain their description and value by our books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did Mr. Allanson come into partnership with you - A. On the 1st of April; - it was the prisoner's duty to take out goods, which were given him to dispose of, but none but what were given to him - they were always given to him - he was to shew them round the trade; he had particular directions every morning - and I or my partner always examined the stock he took out - he was only to take such goods as we gave him, and was not authorised to open a fresh account without our knowledge, unless he sold for cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not express a desire that the stock should be taken - A. Never, till I told him there were many goods missing, and must have stock taken; he might have replied that he was anxious for it, I cannot tell. He absented himself one day, but returned the next - he continued in our employ till stock was taken, and up to the Saturday following. I told him we should not want his services - I produce his daily sale book - the first entry is dated on the 8th of April, and the last on the 23d of June. I have made a few entries in it myself, having sold some goods. We were two days taking stock - he was absent one of those days - I had told him we should not want him after that week.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you take stock in the regular course of business, or under suspicion that you were robbed - A. Suspecting that we had been robbed, I mentioned these seals to him as having been missed among other things - he gave no account of them. We finished taking stock on Thursday - he came on Friday. I asked him then, and repeatedly to explain about the seals - he gave no explanation. I paid him his wages, and discharged him on Saturday - we were not then sensible of the extent of our loss. He should enter in this book what he had done with the property he took out, I never ordered him to take these seals.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Here are many entries of seals in this book - A. Yes, but not of those in question. On the day he left he said there was some money he could receive from a person I did not know - I said</p>
               <p>"Go and receive it." He returned and said he had not received it, but had lent the man the money to pay me (looking at three seals) these are them - two are worth 46 s. and the other 38 s.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>MR. SPENCER. I had seen these seals a few days before we took stock - I know them by the workmanship.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLANSON. I never authorized the prisoner to take out these seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the prisoner come into your employ - A. On the 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about the partnership - A. Not till a few days before he left us - it was on the night of the 21st of June. I had said nothing to him, but he told me he knew I had borrowed money of my sister to open an account at a banker's, and he insinuated things against my partner - he said if I would look in the books I should find false entries made, and proposed my drawing part of the stock from the concern; and said I might command him in what way I pleased. I did not propose it to him - he said he would take the stock out as usual next day, and sell it as usual, and I would meet him at the Colonial Coffee-house at five o'clock in the evening; and I might enquire in the mean time into what he had said. I never myself desired him to take part of the stock out. I know Saunders - I went with him one day to search a house near the Cobourg Theatre, after the prisoner was in custody. I never told him I had engaged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150025"/>with the prisoner to take away the most valuable part of the stock, to compel Spencer to dissolve the partnership, or any thing of the kind. I might have said I had agreed to meet him at the coffee-house, as it was publicly known then. I told him the prisoner was to wait me at the coffee-house with the stock which he had taken out to sell - he had advised me to secure the stock - I said I would consider of what he had said, and would meet him there. My partner had sent him out with the stock as well as myself. I related the circumstances to Saunders in the way I have stated.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him you had agreed to the proposition - A. I do not think that I did - I will not swear it. I called at the Colonial Coffee-house, and he was not there. I left word for him to stop, intending to call in half an hour, but did not. My father was going that way; I desired him to call and send him home. My father saw him safe into the house, and then left. I never expressed a dissatisfaction about the partnership, except from what he insinuated. I had no conversation with him at any other time about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you draw any money out of the banker's on a particular account - A. Only to pay the partnership accounts. He was absent one day while we were taking stock. Mr. Spencer told him to come at nine o'clock, but he did not; he came next day, in consequence of my going to him.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How did you meet with Saunders - A. He came to me, at our house in Red Lion-street, in consequence of my calling at his mother's; he had been in our service in May; we sent for him, thinking he might give some information about the property. I never entertained the least doubt of my partner's fidelity till the 21st of June, when the prisoner suggested this to me; he suggested every thing to me. I appeared to acquiesce, but formed no opinion about it, wishing to inquire further; I only told him to take the stock out as usual. I told Mr. Spencer what had passed on the Thursday; after the stock came home. My sister demanded the money she had 1 nt, and I withdrew it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What stock did he bring home on Thursday - A. I do not know, my Lord, it was more than usual.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th, in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. I found seven or eight sovereigns on him. He said he knew there was a quantity of property missing, and he could explain it.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK to MR. SPENCER. Q. Is there any thing in these seals to enable you to distinguish them from others of the same pattern - A. They are of a particular pattern; they were in a private drawer in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I first entered their service, I supposed I was to do the out-door business alone; I was to have thirty shillings a week at first, which was to be increased as I sold more goods. When I went on Monday, to my surprise a youth named Saunders was there to be employed in the same way at half my salary. I found from my first day's business that there was not enough employment for me, and saw this youth was there to supplant me, when I had formed a connection. It may he said I have made false entries in my book. I have done so, but I have paid the money for the goods, which my book will prove, and their cash book also, which is the case with these three seals. Saunders sold a good many seals; I entered these and paid for them. Not wishing him to get the connexion. I saw these three seals in the warehouse, and told Mr. Spencer I wanted them to shew with others. There was never an account taken of what I took out after the first fortnight; I was authorized to take any articles which I could sell, I was very unsuccessful on that day, and entered these seals - two to Mr. Rossery, and one to Campbell; fearing Saunders would do more than me, I entered Campbell's as paid, and paid for it myself, and entered Rossery payable on a certain day, and paid it myself on that day.</p>
               <p>MR. SPENCER. Here is on cash-book. The prisoner has entered in his book</p>
               <p>"One seal 17th, 42 s., and one 34 s.," making 3 l. 16 d., discount 3 s. 3 d., paid - Campbell one seal, 34 s., discount 2 s., 1 l. 12 s., paid." We received the cash for these entries, but these are not the seals in question, and the seals he states he had from the warehouse was on the 18th; this entry is on the 17th. I am quite certain that it relates to quite different seals.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How can you tell they are not the same seals - A. The price is very different, and these are three which were given to him, and accounted for, and of a different pattern. The price tells the pattern. Here is an entry in the cash-book of 1 l. 12 s. received from Campbell, on the 17th, and 3 l. 12 s. from Rossery, on the 22 d.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have the seals ever been delivered out of your stock to be offered for sale - A. Never; they are of quite a different price.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are your seals ticketed with the prices when you deliver them to him for sale - A. Yes, unless it is a common pattern, which he would have a sufficient knowledge of. I recollect his asking for the seals, which he has entered perfectly well - he did not usually take out seals, but he said he had a customer, and I gave him three, which he returned, as sold to Rossery and Campbell.</p>
               <p>- ROSSERY. Q. Did the prisoner sell any seals to you on the 17th of June - A. No.</p>

            . I entered the prosecutor's service on the same day as the prisoner. The goods were selected for him at first, but he afterwards took what he thought proper - he entered them on a slate, and in the evening accounted for them. I left on the 24th of May. I checked his accounts every night. On the 1st of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning I had some conversation with Mr. Allanson, on Blackfriars-bridge; he said he had agreed with the prisoner to take out the best part of the goods by stratagem, and he was to meet him at the Colonial coffee-house at five o'clock that evening, and the goods were to be detained, to make Mr. Spencer settle accounts; he said he had taken legal advice on the subject. He said he went to the coffee-house, but did not meet Fidler.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you lived with any one since you left the prosecutors - A. No. I know the conversation was on the 1st of July, by a memorandum I have, of having been there on that day to cast up their books.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the prosecutors - A. Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150026"/>Spencer told me on Saturday evening that he had no further occasion for my services.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 26th of June, I was at home - a young man came into the shop, and wanted to be measured for a suit of clothes - he went into the back part of the shop, and tried on a waistcoat; and while I stood behind him, tying the waistcoat behind, I saw the prisoner come in, and saw him leaving the shop directly with a piece of cloth under his arm; he was not in the shop above half a minute - he had taken the cloth off the counter, for I had seen it there shortly before he came in; he walked away with it. I ran out, and stopped him six or seven yards off with it. I asked what he was going to do with the cloth - he said it was his own. A young man stood by; I asked him to assist me; the prisoner then dropped it, and ran away, down Whetstone-park, but was taken before he got out of my sight - I am quite sure he is the man. The shopman was in the parlour, attending to the man who came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were engaged tying the waistcoat - A. Yes. My attention was directed to that till I saw him going out; several persons ran after him. He has always said that I am mistaken in his person that he was in pursuit of the thief.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say that you saw him come into the shop - A. No; I saw him go out with it, and saw him drop it. I brought it back to the shop. I only saw his back as he was going out. I am certain it was him.</p>

I missed a time-piece, a coat, and a pelisse, worth 40 s.; a shawl, worth 3 l.; six silver spoons, worth 20 s.; a pair of sugar-tongs, worth 10 s.; a hat, and thirty pairs of stockings - property worth much more than 40 s. was gone from that room. The secretary had the bottom broken open by violence, and the coat, pelisse, and shawl taken out. My brother and Finch came down; we went to the back door, where I saw my wife's bonnet and part of the time-piece. Two hats were shewn to me by my wife; I think in the first floor, where the property was taken from; they belonged to nobody in the house.

I went to his assistance, and on getting into the passage I saw two hats, which belonged to nobody in the house - I took them up to the first floor. The back door lock had been picked and a bar put in by force to open it, and the back window had been forced with a bar. We found a crow-bar on the copper in the kitchen, and I observed marks of a person having got up on the copper, by mortar being scraped off - the copper joined the window ledge; a person coming through the window would come in contact with the copper, the mortar of which was fresh, and there were marks of shoes scratching the bricks outside the window - there was the impression of a footstep on the fresh mortar of the copper. I went out into the yard, and saw a bonnet, a veil, a frill, and the feathers of the bonnet; they were taken into the home. I went into Crown-street, and found the watchman asleep - I stated the circumstances to him, but he never offered to move, and on going up the street I met the prisoner without a hat, knowing him before, I passed him, and turned after him; I followed him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150027"/>to the door which had been broken open, and saw him put his hand upon the latch, but it had been fastened - he then returned into King-street; I called a watchman, who secured him. I saw mortar on his shoe, similar to that on the copper, and that in the yard; it was fresh. I saw one of the hats put on him; it appeared to fit him. Pople said at the watch-house, in his presence, that he had not the least doubt of the hat being his, for he had particularly noticed it when he was in his custody before. The prisoner said the lining of his hat had been torn out in Tothil-fields prison, and that his hat was at home, under the counter. The lining of the hat was quite out when it was picked up. He said he was merely taking a walk without his hat (it was between three and four o'clock in the morning); I first saw him in the adjoining street, about two hundred yards from the house.</p>

            . I am a constable of Queen-square. I know the prisoner. I saw a hat on the Magistrate's table when he was examined - I have seen that hat repeatedly before, in the prisoner's possession; the last time I saw it it was on his head. I had examined it on a former occasion, and saw the inside of it, and am confident that it is the same. I was stating to the Magistrate that the lining was torn out when he was examined before; the prisoner said it was not, for it was done in Tothil-fields. I am certain it is his. I saw his shoes when he was at the office; one of them was very much covered with fresh white lime: he was endeavouring to rub it off with his feet as he stood at the bar.</p>

               <p>Witness. I have no doubt of that being the hat he wore commonly. After the examination the hat which he has now produced was brought to him, with the ends of the thread hanging to it, as if the lining had just been torn out.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th of June, I got up and went out about five o'clock in the morning, leaving him in bed - I left my things in the room. My coat was worth 20 s.; two yards of cloth, worth 30 s.; a pair of breeches, worth 5 s.; a pair of trowsers, worth 5 s.; five waistcoats, worth 20 s.; four handkerchiefs, worth 4 s., a watch, and other things, worth above 5 l. altogether, were all locked up in my chest - I laid the key on a shelf over the door, under my hat-box, whether he knew that I do not know. I returned again between eight and nine o'clock at night, and missed my things next morning; he did not sleep at home that night; he had tied up his old dirty things, and old hat, and put them in the place where he used to keep his best clothes, so that we did not think he was gone. I did not examine my trunk till the Friday morning. I found the key where I had left it, and the trunk locked, but all the property gone. I had seen them all safe between eight and nine o'clock on Wednesday morning. He never returned - I have found none of my property. I found him in custody on the Saturday week following, and asked what he had done with my piece of cloth; he said voluntarily that he had sold it. I asked what he had done with the tobacco box, which was in my waistcoat pocket; he said,</p>
               <p>"Was there one, if there was I have sold it altogether." I asked what he had done with an old half-crown, which was in the till of my box; he said he had sold it altogether to a Jew.</p>

               <p>"Don't cut me;" he was jawing me, saying I had not done my work right. No knife was found on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not say before that you snatched up a piece of wood, what sort of wood was it - A. A piece of pailing; I did not take it up, but only attempted. I took hold of it to defend myself, but did not raise it off the ground - he saw me stooping to get it, and then came up and cut at me.</p>

            . I was at the Bluegate with Wilson, I did not see him drink anything, but he was the worse for liquor. He and the prisoner were wrangling; there was high words between them. Wilson asked for his money; he said he would not pay him just then, but would when he could - several words passed, and then the prisoner struck him; I did not see the blow given, but saw Wilson bleeding; I had seen him attempt to take up a piece of wood to strike the prisoner, but he did not take it up, as the prisoner collared him - he was bleeding at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was great heat of blood between them - A. Yes. They were both in a passion. It was a sudden quarrel - one was in as great a passion as the other.</p>

            . I am a student at the London Hospital. Wilson came there on the 5th of July; he had a wound on the right cheek, about two inches long, and not above half an inch deep; it must have been made by a sharp instrument - it is now quite well. There was no danger from it; it was not a grevious bodily wound.</p>

I was not there when he left. The box was locked, and Mr. Cetti kept the key himself. He was in the habit of coming to Hitchen three weeks or a month at a time. On the 5th of April. I was at home, and my mother said,</p>
               <p>"Come up stairs;" when I went up, I found the box had been broken open. I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street. I am quite positive of his person.

The other two were standing between him and me, he went away about twelve or fourteen yards, when I followed him, and collared him - he was looking at the two half-crowns, and dropped them when I took hold of him.

               <p>"You have been robbed." I felt in my pocket and my handkerchief was gone. I saw an officer take it from the prisoner Robins - two other officers had the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>ANGELIOUS BERTRAUN. I am a special constable of St. James's. I saw the three prisoners in company in Wardour-street, and watched them - they went down Oxford-street, and towards Marlborough-street. At the corner of Poland-street, I saw the prosecutor going towards Marlborough-street from the Pantheon - they turned down Poland-street after him - a corner of his handkerchief hung out of his pocket, they followed him about five yards, and took it from him in Poland-street. I could not see which of them took it, as there was a dray in the street, and while they were passing that they took it. I was on the opposite side; just as Mr. Owen got to the head of the horses, I saw the hand of one of them lifted up above the wheel of the dray, they then walked on before the gentleman and turned down Marlborough-street, he stopped at a house, I believe No. 2. I went to him and said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, you have lost your handkerchief." He said yes, while I was speaking to him Roberts seized two of the prisoners - I ran and attempted to seize the other, he ran away and was stopped by Green. Roberts took the handkerchief from him, and I have had it ever since. They were all in company when I first saw them, but Hagan stopped to look at something in the street, and then ran and joined them.</p>

            . I was in company with Bertraun, who pointed the prisoners out to me in Wardour-street; they were together at first, but Hagan stopped to hear an organ for a short time; he then ran and joined them near the Pantheon. I saw Mr. Owen turn into Poland-street, they were behind him - they turned after him and got close behind him; there was a dray standing near Marlborough-street; while they were passing that, Bertrand said they had taken the handkerchief, but I did not see them take it; he told the gentleman of it; I took hold of Robins and Richardson, they did not ask me why I took hold of them. Hagan ran away, and was stopped by Green within four or five yards. I found the handkerchief on Robins between his waistcoat and shirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESSWELL. Q. Have you ever been in trouble yourself - A. Yes, for locking up two men - I was held to bail. I got into a row once, about ten years ago, one night in a public house, and there was a charge against me for felony, but the Grand jury threw the bill out.</p>

The prisoner, whom I had known before, called at my house on the 15th of June, about nine o'clock in the morning to see a lodger. I was then in the back room; a customer had been there a short time before for a pair of shoes, and gave me a sovereign. I had not got change, and asked my sister for change; the sovereign laid on the table when the prisoner came into the room, there were some mackerel on the table which the lodger had brought, and he said to the prisoner</p>
               <p>"Bint, you may have some mackerel if you like;" the prisoner went round the table to smell it, and I saw him take up the sovereign with one hand, and the mackerel with the other. I said</p>
               <p>"Bint, you are fond of sovereigns, are you?" he said rather; he then walked round the table to go out. I said leave the sovereign. he said if I would get the mackerel ready at one o'clock he would come and dine; he then went away, and I thought he would return the sovereign at dinner time. I called after him again, when he got into the street to leave the sovereign, he held his hand up but did not speak. I saw him no more till half past six o'clock, when he came to his lodgings, opposite to my house; he was then cleaned, and in company with a young woman; I went and asked him for the sovereign; he said he would give it to me in half an hour; I said that would not do; he said so help him God, he would bring it in half an hour, he was going to the Lion and Lamb. I did not see him again till half-past twelve o'clock at night, when the constable had charge of him. I have never got the sovereign again.</p>

            . I live at Barking, in Essex. I was at Hounslow on a visit to my sister, Mrs. Underwood. I saw her give change for a sovereign, and it laid on the table - the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, came into the room about ten minutes afterwards - I saw him take the sovereign from the table - my sister said he was fond of sovereigns; he said,</p>
               <p>"Rather so." About eleven o'clock he came in, and asked if dinner was ready; he had promised the boy to come and dine. My sister asked him in the evening if he had got the sovereign; and she said he had not given it to her. I was with the person who took him at twelve o'clock at night. I asked him to give me the sovereign, and he said he had given it to my sister - the man who was with me was not an officer - he walked with us as far as Richmond, and then said he would be taken into custody - I enquired for a constable - he then said he would go back to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The witness met me, and questioned me about the sovereign; I said I would settle it with Mrs. Underwood.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am quite sure he said he had given the sovereign to Mrs. Underwood - he said, upon his soul he had.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of him; he acknowledged that he took it, and changed it at the Cricketers, public-house, at Richmond Green - but said, that when he took it he did not intend to keep it. I had known him before - I believe his master had discharged him that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came backwards and forwards to Mrs. Underwood that day and she never said any thing about the sovereign. I met her sister in the evening, and she said part of it was her's - I said I would go back and settle it. Mrs. Underwood said, before the magistrate, that she did not think I meant to steal it, and asked if I could replace it - I said I thought I could if I wrote to a friend. I was then asked if I had a watch to leave, which I had not.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Allcroft, copper-plate printer, Oxford-market. I did not know the house which was robbed till these young men shewed it to me - I had known them before. On the 10th of June, about half-past six o'clock, I was standing at my mother's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150032"/>door, in Peter-street, near Wardour-street, when Castelow came and asked me if I had seen Cronin - while we were speaking Cronin came up, and asked Castelow if he would go with him to Upper Harley-street - he agreed to go, and I went with him - Cronin said he wanted some money, and he would go and get some lead off those houses; and asked me to go with them - I went, and we got into the house about half-past nine o'clock; Cronin took us to the back of the house, and went up the ladder first, Castelow and I followed him - when Cronin got on the second floor he saw some carpenters' tools, and said he would have some of them - we then went on the third floor, and Castelow said he did not know how we should get to the top of the house; Cronin said he would find a way, he got a little ladder, and we all got to the top of the house. Cronin then pulled the nails out of the lead, and rolled it up - I believe it was new lead. He then cut a piece off it, which might weigh 14 or 15 lbs. - we heard the watchmens' rattles sprung, and Cronin said the watchmen had got into the house, for he could see their lights, it was then dark - Cronin then got away, but I do not know how - Castelow told me to follow him, which I did, and we went along the tops of the houses to the end of the street - Castelow then pulled off his shoes, and slid down the rain water-pipe - I tried to do so, but I fell down into a gentleman's yard; I laid there a great while, I do not know how long - a gentleman's servant came and asked me if any body was in the house; I told him no - he asked me how I got there, and I told him; he called the watchman, who took me.</p>

There was a young man slept in the room, who was a visitor - the prisoner did not go to bed at all. I had a shift and a shawl in the cupboard. The patrol called me between one and two o'clock; the prisoner was then in the watch-house. In consequence of what the patrol said I looked into the cupboard, and missed them.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix going home with a young man, and in consequence of some altercation. I listened at the door - I then saw the prisoner come out, and run away: she had got five hundred yards or more when I stopped her, and asked what she had got - she said nothing. I found the shift in her lap, and the shawl round her shoulders. The prosecutrix said,</p>

               <p>"How could you rob a poor girl like me;" she said she was going to pawn them. I asked the prosecutrix if she had given her them to pawn - she said No. I am quite sure she said she was going to pawn them.</p>

I took him to the watch-house, and searched him and the bundle: I did not make him any promise or threat - he said that his wife had given him the things; that she lived at Little Chelsea, with Mr. Simpson, and that he said he was going to the Old Kent-road, which I suppose is two miles and a half from there. I went next morning to Mrs. Simpson, who identified the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he told you at once where he got them, and it turned out to be all true - A. Yes. When I opened the bundle of linen I said,</p>

               <p>"No, the old cook put that into the basket" - that he was in the habit of going to the house at all hours, and never was stopped before.</p>

            . I am the father of the child. I found. the child at the top of Rose-street, in the care of Windwood The frock and pinafore were gone. I am sure she went out with them on; I am certain of the property being mine; it is worth about 3 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out, in distressed circumstances, to sell a coat to get me some shoes; finding I could not sell it, I was taking it to pledge - I went from one pawnbroker to another, and picked these things up in the court; when I got to Drury-lane the woman stopped me, and said they were her's; I had not seen the child, and know nothing about it.</p>

There was a gentleman at the watch-house, who said he lived at the Salisbury Arms, public-house, Durham-place, who said he had seen Mr. Moon talking to some females, but I cannot think that, for I had been there just before.</p>

            . I live with my brother, who is a hatter and hosier; the prisoner came to our shop and said he wanted a hat for himself, and he looked at another which he said would fit his friend. I took them up next morning to his house, and he put the hat on which he took for himself, and said his friend was out and he did not know if the other would he large enough for him, but wished me to bring up two others to look at. I did so, and he desired me to leave them till Monday morning. On Monday morning he called, and said he neither had got the hats nor the money, but he was going into the City, and about four o'clock he should be at home, and if I called on him he would return the two hats and pay for the two be kept. I went up at four o'clock, and he said it was not convenient to give me the hats then, but he would call on my brother next morning to look out some goods, and he would return two hats, and the money for the two that were kept. He came in the morning and looked out some goods to the amount of 25 l.; these were sent in the afternoon, about five o'clock, with a bill, and the two hats he was to keep were put down in the bill, but the other two that were to be returned were not included. I heard from my brother that day that there was a warrant out against the prisoner. I went with my brother and got 20 l. worth of the goods back, but I have not seen the hats since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. COOK. Q. Did he not promise to pay for these second two hats on the 8th July - A. No, I did not leave the second two upon an understanding that he was to pay for them; he was to take two out of the four; the price of the first two was one guinea each, and the others were to be the same price. I left them from the Saturday till the Tuesday when I got back the goods; he never promised to pay on the 8th July: there were some persons present when he spoke about the hats, and promised to return two; the bill of parcels of the goods was made out on Tuesday, and the goods sent to his house.</p>

On the 7th of July, about a quarter past nine o'clock in the morning the prisoner came into the garden I served her with half a pint of beer. I went away leaving my jacket in the box she sat in. I returned in ten minutes and it was gone, and she also. I found her sitting on some steps in Baker-street with it, tied in her bundle. She was very much intoxicated - there was a shilling in my pocket.</p>
               <p>JOHN STAPLES. I took her in charge, she said she had no money - I found two sixpences on her, but no shilling.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 12th July I was working at a building in Wardour-street. I found the prisoner there at four o'clock in the morning, and asked his business at that nseasonable hour; he said he had come to sleep there - I searched him and found this lead on his person - he asked me to let him go - I gave in charge - the lead had been cut from the gutters - I compared it, it fitted exactly - I found a knife on him which appeared to have cut lead.</p>

On the 3d of July, in the morning, I missed two saddles and two coats from the coachhouse - they were safe the night before; I enquired, and one Hawkins, who has absconded gave us information, and the saddles were found in a ditch about three quarters of a mile from the house on the 5th, the prisoner was with me - I am not certain whether it was him or Hawkins that pointed them out, but he said he knew where they were; he was then in custody - the coach-house was fastened inside, they forced the bar up.</p>
               <p>LORKIN ELY. I live at Finchley, and have been a constable. I was fetched to the public-house - Hawkins there gave me charge of the prisoner - they were together - he told me that Mr. Collins's coachhouse was broken open, and the prisoner was the man who had done it - he did not deny it. Hawkins wished me to take him to Mr. Collins - I did so; the prisoner pointed out where the saddles were - he never denied being with the men who had stolen them.</p>

            . I live with my father in Regent-street, which is about five minutes walk from Great Marlborough-street. On the 26th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, my father and mother were out - I and my sister Ann were in the shop; a person came to purchase some albums.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say if you think he is the person - Q. He is the person - I have no doubt, or I would not swear it - I saw him walk by the shop about nine o'clock; he walked by more than once, and afterwards came into the shop and desired to be shewn a Ladies album which was in the window, for he wished to make a present of one to a lady. I shewed him one with a plain lock - he asked the price - I told him 1 l. 15 s. and 10 s. for the lock; it had a lock and key attached to it - I said I had one with an embossed lock, which came to 35 s., and the lock to 12 s. - he said very well. He put his hand into his right hand pocket and said</p>
               <p>"That will be 2 l. 7 s. won't it" - I said it would. I heard money rattle, and thought he was going to pay me; he had put the plain one on the counter, and the one with an embossed lock upon it; and said he wanted a purse, which was in the window - I did not exactly recollect what purses were in the window, and having some in a glass case on the counter I opened it and shewed him one. I was standing outside the counter by the side of him - he asked for a purse from the window - I had to go round the counter to get it, and my back was turned towards him, and on my turning round he was gone, and the books also. I ran round and called Watch! the watchman was not in the way, nobody heard me execept the servant of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the window did you go quite up to it - A. Yes, and just as I got to it I missed him and the books; before I opened the window - I only turned my back to him as I turned round to go behind the counter. He pointed out the place from which he wanted the purse, I could not get at it without turning my back to him.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was your sister present - A. She was in the shop, and I was just inside the door. The prisoner had been waiting some time, passing up and down - I dare say he passed the shop eight times - I noticed that to my sister before he came in. I thought he was waiting for somebody; my attention was directed to him before he came into the shop by his passing in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of noticing his features - A. Yes, there were three gas lights, two in the shop, and one opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see him - A. On the 8th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening. I was going down Cleveland-street, just by Union-street, (with my two little sisters to the mantau makers) and saw him - I left go of the children, and directly went up to him and said,</p>
               <p>"It was you who robbed me, on such a day in my father's shop," he said</p>
               <p>"You are bringing a mob round me and insulting me - quite a disgrace" and then pushed me away.</p>

                  <persName id="t18240715-100-person905">Q. </persName>
            Had you at that time seized hold of his person - A. I had - he endeavoured to get away - he went over to a butcher's shop, and said to the people assembled</p>
               <p>"Give me a coach" - he spoke of Marlborough-street, and Carburton-street; he went out of the shop - I told I would not let him go; he went out twice to go away - I ran after him and caught hold of him - a little girl came up and I asked her to fetch an officer, and directly afterwards Schofield and another person came up and took him, and when I got to the watch-house he said he would ruin my father - I said he had robbed me in my father's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his hands - A. He had a ring on the little finger of his right hand - the officer said he did not understand his name, he offered to write it himself, and when he put his hand out I saw the ring - he said his name was

             - he did not write. He took out a watch or time piece, saying, I shall remember it was such a time that you put me in, and I will make you remember it, - he had the watch in his hand when he made the observation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what day of the week was the 26th of May - A. Wednesday. It happened by candle-light - I should think he was four or five minutes in the shop - my sister was not in the shop all the time - we have only one counter - he was dressed much as he is now, except his trowsers: he had a blue<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150040"/>coat, and his trowsers were either unbleached Russia duck or light cloth, a kind of drab colour; he wore a black hat, which was on all the time; his neckcloth was something of the same kind as he has now. I have always described his dress as I have now - I never said he wore a brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any effort to get away - A. Yes, he did, three times - he pushed me away; I never said that he pushed me down, he pushed me nearly down - nobody went for a coach - he desired to be taken into some shop; I said certainly, it would be most proper - he said</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, let me go into some shop" - he went in of his own accord; I followed him - he asked somebody to go for Mr. Abraham's, of Marlborough-street, and likewise to Carburton-street, where I now know that he lodged, and that he was clerk to Mr. Abrahams.</p>

               <p>Q. When the person came to you, are you sure that it was the same person you had previously seen passing - A. Yes, he came with a square book bound in morocco with a plain brass lock and key to it, and wanted to sell it; I opened it and asked what it was for, he said it was for setting down extracts; he asked thirty or thirty-five shillings for it, which I thought too much. and did not buy it; I believe he had dark clothes on; his coat was buttoned; I think he had a black coat and blue trowsers on; I believe it to be the prisoner; our shop is at the corner of Hanway-yard, nearly opposite Russell-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did the prisoner come - A. Between three and four o'clock; our windows are filled with goods, which darkens it; I will not be positive of the colour of his coat or trowsers, I know it was a dark coat, and very fashionably made.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Messrs. Chaffers and Mills, pawnbroker's, Greek-street, Soho. On the day after these albums were stolen, a hand-bill was brought to our shop; it was on the 27th or 28th of May: A person had been to our shop a quarter of an hour before the bill was brought, and offered an album, bound in blue morocco, with a plain lock and key; he asked two guineas for it. I had seen him once before at our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner that young man - A. No; he was very much like him, and had the same coloured hair, but was not quite so fair, and was rather stouter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his general character like the prisoner - A. Yes; he was about ten minutes in the shop. I refused to take the album in: he called again in about a fortnight, and offered me two razors; I did not buy them; he was then about five minutes with me; knowing him to be the same person who had offered the album I intended to stop him - I asked him what the razors cost, meaning to get round the counter to stop him, but upon my putting my hand on the flap of the counter to lift it up, he immediately slipped out of the shop, leaving the razors behind; I produce them - I have not seen him since. I appeared at Marlborough-street when the prisoner was apprehended,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150041"/>and stated this. Mrs. Clifton claimed the razors. I am certain the prisoner is not the man.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. The person was so dissimilar that you have no hesitation in saying he is not the man - A. It was not him; I have not the least hesitation in saying so; there is a resemblance between them. Cook, a constable desired me to attend at Marlborough-street; I had given him information about the razors. Nobody but me was in the shop - both the apprentices were absent. Directly the man went out I alarmed Mr. Mills; he is not here. Cook (who had left the hand-bill) called, and said he had taken a man for stealing the albums; I said I had two razors. I went and saw the prisoner in the lock-up-room.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When the man brought the razors you intended to stop him - A. Yes. I thought if I made an alarm before I got round the counter he would make off. Immediately on seeing the prisoner I said he was not the man.</p>

            . I have been an officer in the French army. I was in Cleveland-street, at the corner of Union-street, when Miss Denham stopped this young gentleman - he conducted himself with great propriety as I thought: he did not attempt to escape - they both crossed over to me. The lady begged of me to stop him, saying he had robbed her; I asked of what; she said, of albums, which I did not understand, and asked what they were - she said two books: the prisoner denied it, and said she mistook him. I observed to her that she should be very cautious in making so serious a charge, without being perfectly satisfied. They went into a butcher's-shop; he offered to go to Marlborough-street, and desired a coach might be got, and said he would pay the butcher if he got it. I told her Marlborough-street was a respectable street, and as he appeared a respectable young man she would find who he was, and had better go; she said he would run away; he made no attempt to go away.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. She however applied to you to stop him - A. She did; I advised her to go to Marlborough-street with him, and feeling for his situation I said I would go and inform his friends.</p>

            , my servant was also at home. I think it was on a Wednesday; I have a distinct recollection of the day, from various circumstances; the servant let him in at seven o'clock in the evening - he enquired for me; I went into the back parlour to him - he wanted to speak to me on some business which I had spoken to him about in the morning - I was about ten minutes in the room with him; I then went down stairs, and sent the servant up to him with coffee. I did not go into the room again that evening; the servant took him up candles afterwards - I had heard him ring the bell, and asked what it was for, having two bells, which ring alike; I thought it was a gentleman on the second floor, and enquired why it was not answered; the reply was that Mr. Robinson had rung for a candle. I did not see him again that night, but am sure he was not out of the house; he supped about half-past nine o'clock, and had a little ham, which Susan carried him; she had to go out for it, and came up to me for the money. All the family retired to bed a little after ten. - if I do not see the door fastened the person on the first floor does. I did not see it fastened on that night. I swear he did not go out from seven o'clock that night, till after breakfast next morning. I am certain it was on the 26th.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When did they first apply to you to say where he was on the 26th - A. I attended his second examination. Mr. Fitzgerald had called to enquire about his character on the night he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at what time he came in on the 25th - A. Why he was rather late on the previous night; it was the night Harris's balloon went off - he did not sup at home. He came home to tea on the 27th about half-past six o'clock; then took a short walk, and returned - I think he had no supper that night.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in Term time - A. Yes. I have particularly considered the transactions of this day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there to fix in your mind about his having coffee and ham, and ringing the bell so often on this particular night - A. Why I can give you a reason; I was up stairs with the lady on the first floor, and spent the evening with her - I am not in the habit of going up there much; I was out the day previous, and she was to have gone with me to see my mother, but it was thought best for her to stay at home - it was on the day the balloon went off, and the first time I had taken such a walk after my confinement. I was in the habit of seeing what clothes he wore; he had no blue trowsers - I have seen him in white ones; I never saw him in a black coat; I have seen him in two blue and one green coat. I, my husband, my servant, and Ann Grissell (in whose apartment I was), were all at home on that night.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken did you not send a black<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150042"/>coat to him at the watch-house - A. I did not; I sent his best blue coat, no black coat was sent from my house. The lodgers can go out, but cannot come in without having the door opened to them; he had a blue coat on when he came in - I think he wore such a handkerchief as he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he generally board with the family - A. Yes; I had my tea before he came home that evening. He has a top room for a bed-room, and sits in the back or front parlour, which ever I happen to be in. Mr. Abrahams came to my house with my husband on the morning after he was apprehended; nothing of his was taken away but a clean shirt and handkerchief, a pair of clean white trowsers, and his blue coat, from that time to the present. Mr. Abrahams has called at my house once since - but has not been in his room. I sent him a pair of black trowsers. I opened his box with the officers. I was at Marlborough-street, but was not examined.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. If anybody goes out and shuts the door after them, they cannot get in without knocking - A. No. Susan generally attends to the door. Schofield came to my house on the morning after he was taken, and searched; nothing was found belonging to anybody. I think I have seen him in blue striped trowsers some time ago - his habits were very regular.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember one night his having coffee and ham - A. Yes, it was on the 26th of May; I let him in on that night between six and seven o'clock; he went into the front parlour - my mistress saw him there. I took him coffee almost directly, and about half-past eight took him candles into the front parlour: he had some ham for supper about half-past nine - we went to bed a little after ten that night.

               <p>Q. She did not go out on the day the balloon went up - A.

               <p>Q. On what day did your mistress go to see her sister, (your mother), after her confinement - A. On the day the balloon went up - Mr. Robinson had the coffee and ham the night after; he never went out after he came in, between six and seven o'clock - the parlours do not communicate; mistress saw him in the front parlour; I was down stairs at the time, and did not see them together; I had not seen him in the back parlour - mistress gave me the money for the ham, she had it from master.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. At what time was the money given to you - A.

            . I am a solicitor. I first knew the prisoner at Lady-day, 1821 - his mother wished me to take him into my office, but being fall he remained at school another year, and was articled to me in 1822; and has remained in my office ever since - his conduct was exemplary and good. He has an entailed estate - he is above want or necessity - he could have had money from me at any time - I made him a ward in Chancery. When this charge was made, I advertised to bring persons together, who might have charges against him. I have taken every pains to discover his innocence or guilt. I have seen several young men in our neighbourhood who might be mistaken for him - I never saw him in drab pantaloons - I have taken pains to find these albums; if he is discharged. I shall take him into my service again. He is allowed 90 l. a year by the Court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Were you not aware when you advertised that Mr. Denham had advertised - A. I had seen such advertisements - he has not worn a black coat for the last year; he had one at the death of his mother some time ago; I think he has blue trowsers - I have papers in my hand dated the 26th of May, with which he was sent to the office of the Clerk of the Rules, about six o'clock on the 26th - the rule was to be served in Staples-Inn; he did not return to the office that evening. I had given him leave to go home, after serving the rule - he had not asked leave - he generally left about six o'clock - he sometimes wanted to go to Turnham Green to his aunt. He could not obtain the rule before six o'clock or after nine; I know that he did obtain it; the latest time that I saw him was between four and five o'clock I think, I have only two clerks he did not particularly take the out-door business.</p>

On the 1st of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in my stationery shop - he held in his hand a list of numbers and titles of some periodical publications; which were then publishing He said he wished as many looked out for him as that list contained; but I was not to trouble myself to get those which I had not by me. I put the list into my desk, and did not look them out then - he said he would call again for them, but did not say when; he went away and in the evening between seven and eight o'clock, (I think nearer eight), I saw him again in the stationer's shop, his conversation was addressed to my wife - I was not within hearing. I was in the snuff shop, and went into the shop before he left, for Mrs. Dolby came to me and asked if they were looked out - the list was at that time in my desk - she took it out; I said they were not ready, for the gentleman did not say when he should call. I do not think that he heard this conversation. Mrs. Dolby took the list from me and went into the shop to him, as if to explain it - I afterwards walked into the shop - she was then looking out the things, and placing them on the counter before him; I went back to the other shop as a customer came in - but returned to the stationary shop before he left, and had an opportunity of seeing him both then and in the morning; he was not above three minutes in the shop in the morning - when I saw him in the evening I had no doubt of his being the person who left the list. He was under my observation in the evening for ten or fifteen minutes, the things took some time to look out. When I was very much engaged in the tobacco shop, Mrs. Dolby gave an alarm, and the things were gone, and the list was gone. I have not the least doubt whatever of his being the man. My house is about five hundred yards from Great Marlborough-street,</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You never found any of the property - A. No, Mrs. Dolby looked out the books in the evening, she was in the shop for about a minute in the morning - the books are worth 10 s.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 1st of May, I was at home, and saw the prisoner in the shop about eleven o'clock in the morning - he brought a list of periodical publications; I heard him say he wished for those numbers to be got ready for him; but what numbers we had not got, he did not wish Mr. Dolby to get - I looked at him the whole of the time he was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the same person in the evening - A. Yes, as near as I can guess it was between seven and eight o'clock - it might be near eight; he came into the shop and asked me if those things were ready which he had ordered in the morning; I said, I believed they were not, but would enquire - I went into the tobacco shop, and asked Mr. Dolby. Mr. Dolby had given me the list in the morning - I returned to the shop and said they were not ready - he said</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. His lodgings were pointed out to you - A. Yes, I searched his trunks but found no property claimed by any one; every facility was given me to search - he told me himself when he was taken where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, in this case as in the former, I shall be enable to clearly prove that the witnesses labour under a mistake; by proving a clear and undeniable alibi.</p>
               <p>MR. FENTON ROBINSON. I am the prisoner's brother, and have been in the army. I reside in Eberry-terrace, Pimlico. I heard of this charge on the day after he was taken; he frequently denied and drank tea with me. On Saturday, the 1st of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I met him in the Park; we parted, and I went home to dinner; he came to me about six, (before I had finished dinner,) and remained with me till nearly eleven: he was not out of my house, or out of my sight all that time; I think I walked part of the way home with him. Cheese-man, my servant was there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are you in the army now - A. No, I am on half-pay.</p>
               <p>Q. As he was frequently in the habit of coming to your house, what brings to your mind the transaction of the 1st of May - A. It was the first time he ever drank tea without dining with me; I do not recollect whether I met him accidentally or by appointment; we were together till near five o'clock; he parted with me at the bottom of Grosvenor-place; Eberry-terrace is a quarter of a mile further.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any reason assigned for his parting with you so near your house - A. No; I asked him to come to tea; I have no reason for saying it was on the 1st of May, except from it being the first time he drank tea without dining; I knew he was engaged in business; he wore a blue coat, but what trowsers, neckcloth or waistcoat, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after his apprehension was this charge made - A. At his second examination; I was not at the first examination; he frequently drank tea with me afterwards without dining, but not so often as when he dined; my female servant, Sadler, was also at home; he might have drank tea with me half a dozen times in May.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was it at Marlborough-street you first considered of his having been with you on any particular occasion - A. I believe it was; I have not the slightest doubt of what I have stated; I cannot be mistaken.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Robinson; the prisoner came there on the 1st of May, about six o'clock, and only drank tea; he did not dine there that day; he staid till about eleven; I was at home all the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. How often in May did he drink tea with your master - A. I dare say half a dozen times; I know it was on the 1st of May, because it was the first time he drank tea there without dining; that is my only reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master observe that to you - A. No; he never drank tea there in April without dining; he did after the 1st May; the first time he ever came into the house was on Easter Sunday.</p>

I found he had six pairs of shoes, and six pairs of upper leathers: the marks upon them led me to the workhouse at Norwood.</p>

            . I keep a tripe shop in Little Chapel-street, Westminster. On Saturday night, the 10th of July, at half-past twelve o'clock, I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner Robins come through Castle-court, with one or two other young men, one of whom I knew; they stood in the center of the street, consulting which way the should go - Robins had a sack on his back, which appeared very weighty: one of them said,</p>
               <p>"It won't do to go round the corner, the watchman will see us;" this induced me to watch. I walked after Robins - the others went to the right: Robins went into Orchard-street, and stopped at a house opposite Duck-lane - he took the sack into a house there, which goes up one or two steps: I noticed the house, but not the number of it. I then went to the watchman at the corner, by my own house - I informed him and Squires, and shewed them the house. I then went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. It was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150046"/>very short time from your seeing him go into the house till you called the patrol - A. They were there in less than two minutes.</p>

               <p>"Webber, dealer in marine stores." is over the door - I saw the shop door open, and went in, and saw some pipe lead rolled up, and laying on the counter; I put my hand on it, and asked Webber, who stood behind the counter, if it belonged to him; he said No - I asked who it belonged to; he nodded his head, and pointed to the prisoner Robins and one Death, who stood there, and said it belonged to them; there was nobody else in the shop. I asked Webber if they had offered it for sale - he said he did not buy such sort of lead as that. I asked him twice if they had not brought in some more lead in a sack - he did not answer - he had got a sack with the rest of the lead inside the counter, on his right side; as he made no answer, I said</p>
               <p>"Where is it;" and Davis went round the counter, laid hold of the sack, and gave it to me, with the lead in it - he had made no answer about the sack; he must have seen it there, it was not a yard from him - I instantly gave the prisoner and Death in charge; and said,</p>
               <p>"Webber, will you be so good as to go to the watch-house;" he seemed unwilling - I said, there can be no harm in his going as a witness against them - he, however, went quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say that Webber could see the lead while he was speaking to you - A. Yes, he put his head down where it was, when I asked him about it - I did not hear him tell them he would not buy it.</p>

               <p>"This is the sack," he must have touched it with his feet, it was so close to him.

            . I am an officer. In consequence of some directions, I was watching for the prisoner Hooper, and saw him on the 25th of June coming by the City-road burying-ground - I followed him to the corner of Chiswell-street, where he joined Buchanan - they then turned down Chiswell-street, and Hooper delivered a parcel to Buchanan - they walked on about thirty yards, then crossed and went half way down Finsbury-street - Hooper then went away, and Buchanan put the parcel into a bag - I followed him to White-street, and then said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there," he said</p>
               <p>"Paper to make a book" - I said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you get it" - he said</p>

               <p>"I received it from a man, a friend of mine." I said " Should you know that man again" - he said " I do not think I should" - I then took him to the Mansion-house, and Mr. Cook asked him some questions - he said he had been at a public-house (I think the Crown) on the day before and saw the man - that he was going to take the paper to some person to get it ruled - I proceeded to Alderman Keys, and Hooper was called, I took him to the Mansion-house - the prisoners there denied all knowledge of each other - I have seen Hooper before, I suppose twenty times - I went to Buchanan's house, and there saw a working bench for bookbinders.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You saw Hooper in the City-road - A. Yes, and walked ten or fifteen yards behind him all theway - I saw his face when he passed me before I followed him, in Finsbury-street, he went a few yards beyond Buchanan, and then turned round and came back to him again - I did not stop them when they were together, because I might have lost one of them - there were not many persons in that street.</p>

            , ESQ. I am one of the firm of John Key and Henry Key Garrett. Hooper had been in our employ some years; we had some information, and directed the officer to observe him - I have seen the paper, and know it to be ours, we had made it for particular customers, and no other house has such paper - on the 25th of June last Hooper had no business with any such paper - I had not seen him that morning - his work is a good deal in the part where this paper is kept - he generally leaves about eight o'clock in the morning to go to breakfast, this paper is worth about 4 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Had you been at the warehouse that morning. A. No, I was not come to town. I know the paper by a particular mark - we have manufactured it for many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150048"/>years. - it is sold perhaps to three or four persons, but not many quires are sold, except in one particular direction - those persons are stationers and sell it to anybody who may go to buy it.</p>

On the 16th of July I saw the two prisoners in Newgate-street, near Warwick-lane: they were following several persons backwards and forwards - this conduct induced me to watch them for about twenty minutes; I then saw Mr. Godwin and another gentleman close together; I could hardly tell which of them the prisoners were following: they were close to them - I stopped down, and looked under a cart, and saw them turn down Queen's Head-passage, leading to Paternoster-row: I saw Mr. Godwin clap his hand upon his pocket - I called to him, and took him down the passage; there were no other persons near enough to pick his pocket but the prisoner, and the other gentleman: it was done momentarily, and I took them within about a minute, five or six yards down the passage - I found the handkerchief in Wilkinson's small clothes; Mr. Godwin immediately claimed it.

            . On the 10th of June I found this knife and scissars in the possession of Isabella Brown - they were taken from my glass-case, and had been there about a month before.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA BROWN. I live in Well-yard. The prisoner gave me this knife and scissars about a month or five weeks before she was taken up: I have know her three or four months - I have seen her going on errands; I knew she lived with Mr. Ryley, and knew he was a cutler, but did not know that he made or sold these articles; she told me her master's brother gave her them. I heard she was taken up, and I told Mr. Ryley of it two or three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLEY. I knew this child was an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner's, and went to her house to ask her about it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you say that these articles had not been sold - A. No; but the prisoner has acknowledged before that she took them.</p>

               <p>JAMES WILLIAMS. The prisoner was in my employ for about six weeks; I employed him till he could get anything better - he was detected, on the 8th of July, leaving my house with a pair of boots, one of them in his trowsers, and one in his hat - they were mine - he was employed to clean boots and shoes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TOZER. I am a servant to Mr. Williams. On the 8th of July I went into the cellar, and saw a pair of boots there, concealed beneath a blind, which was not the place for them; I gave information of it in the house; this was about eight o'clock - the prisoner was in the shop at the time; he went down afterwards, and when he came up again he was stopped, and the boots found concealed, one in his hat, and the other in his trowsers; the boots were men's boots, they were new.</p>

I felt a snatch at my pocket, I turned short round, and saw the prisoner, who turned round also, and threw away the box, which I picked up, and cried Stop thief! - I did not lose sight of him, he passed between some coachmen, who drive the stages, and I think there was a boy in a sustian jacket near him, but I kept my eye upon him; the other boy I believe crossed the way - he did not at all attempt to stop him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The other boy was as near the box as the prisoner - A. Yes; when I looked round there where two boys, but I saw the prisoner throw it away - there might have been half a dozen coachmen - I did not lose sight of him. His friends have been with me, they appear very respectable; his mother, I believe, is a widow.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BOND. I am an officer. I heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was stopped by a young man, he fell on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

            . I saw this prisoner at their banking-house on the 26th of June; he presented a draft of 27 l. for payment; we had cash enough in hand of Captain Brown's to have paid it, but I suspected it was not Captain Brown's hand-writing, and went into one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150051"/>the offices to compare it; my suspicions were then confirmed - we detained the prisoner, and sent for Captain Brown; we stated to the prisoner our suspicions - he at first said he brought it direct from Captain Brown - he afterwards said he found it, and I believe he said in the street. Captain Brown did not come that day, but Mr. Walker, his partner did. Before the draft went out of my sight I put my initials on it; it is all in writing - it is not a banker's cheque filled up. This is the draft.</p>

Willis and Co's.; I found the prisoner there - I had seen him before, as a waiter at a Coffee-room. My opinion was asked about the hand-writing of this draft; my opinion was, and still is that it is not Captain Brown's writing. The prisoner dropped on his knees, and said,</p>
               <p>"I own I did it, but it is my first offence; I was in distress, and I have a wife and child." He appeared much distressed; his eyes were wild and haggard.</p>

I took him into a private room, and as I had not had a distinct charge against him I sent for Mr. Willis. As I was standing at the door of the room where the prisoner was talking to Mr. Willis, he attempted to make his escape out of the window. He appeared almost out of his mind.</p>

I had not got many yards further before I felt a jerk at my pocket, and found the handkerchief was gone - I turned round, and saw the prisoner, in company with another young man, who was discharged at Guildhall. They were the only persons near me - I suspected one of them - I walked after them, and charged them with it; the other man denied it, but the prisoner said nothing. I secured them myself as it was near the watch-house, and the handkerchief was found on the prisoner.</p>

I did not see him again till I met him in Cheapside; I ran past him and saw it was him - I turned round to look at him, and he looked round too. I followed him down Queen-street and he came into Cheapside again - there was a person with him, who asked me what I wanted; I said if I knew where there was a constable, I would tell him what I wanted; the prisoner was near enough to have heard that; he then went into Newgate-street, and I met a man and asked him if he could tell me where I could get a constable; he then ran down Bagnio-court; I got a constable in Butcher-hall-lane, and he was taken in Bagnio-court; he was then taken before the Lord Mayor; the person who had been with him was gone before the constable came.

               <p>"It is not eight o'clock, and probably the foreman will be angry with you to-morrow for going so soon;" he went back and we communicated the circumstance to master: he was then searched, he had long pockets inside his trowsers large enough to contain a bottle, and a breast-pocket that would contain a bottle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not uncommon to have some wine spilled - A. No, but we had not been at work in that cellar; he had a pocket inside the thigh of his trowsers - the men are not allowed to take it away; they may drink what they like.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors. Between seven and eight o'clock on Monday the 12th July, I was in the wine-cellar: in consequence of some information from 
               <persName id="t18240715-127-person1131">Milton</persName>
             I went into the left hand kitchen cellar, and concealed myself; I saw the prisoner come and put one bottle into his right, and one into his left hand pocket, he took them from some lumber on the side of the kitchen cellar - I gave Mr. Bell information of it - I saw the prisoner afterwards in the counting-house with Mr. Bell, who told him to take what wine he had from his pockets - he then took one bottle from his breast pocket, and said he had no more, but afterwards produced a bottle of wine from his right hand breeches pocket, after I had challenged him with having it there - I have not compared the wine with that in the cask, nor tasted it, but I saw it poured out, and judged from the deepness of the colour, and thickness of the body, that it was the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In this cellar where the lumber is, is any wine kept - A. No; the men help themselves to wine while they are at work - if I had seen the wine in these bottles ten miles off I could swear it come from that cask - the prisoner said it had been given him.</p>

               <p>"Are you quite certain you have nothing? he said</p>
               <p>"I am not": I said,</p>

               <p>"He has got another bottle in his breeches pocket" - it was then pulled out: he then said it was given to him by a man named Rider: I said I believed it was our property. Our corks are marked on the inside part that goes into the bottle, but in drawing the corks of these bottles at the Mansion-house, one of them had a piece cut off. and the other was broken off, both of them might have had our name on it - it was fresh-drawn wine, and the corks were not sealed: they seemed very slightly put in, and not in the regular way: I have seen the wine drawn from the cask and tasted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150053"/>it, and that in the bottles, and have not the least doubt that it is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was at the Mansion-house you tasted the wine - A. Yes, I had not broken the corks in drawing them - we have many casks of one flavour: I cannot tell the vintage of this wine, but wine of the same vintage will vary in quality in one hundred different particulars - if I went into a tavern one hundred miles off, and a bottle of wine was brought, I could swear to the taste of my own wine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told my master where I got the wine - I had it of a man named Rider - I went out to carry a dozen of wine, and he said to me</p>
               <p>"Here is two bottles of wine" - I said</p>
               <p>"I do not know where to put them" - he said said</p>

I was in Holborn, and saw the two prisoners: Smith put his hand into this gentleman's coat pocket; took out a handkerchief, and gave it to Winn - I told the gentleman; we pursued, and took them: they dropped the handkerchief in going to the watch-house. I lost sight of Smith before he was taken, but am quite sure of him; we came to the bottom of Holborn, and then met them coming back - it might be about three or four minutes after it was taken.</p>

            , JUN. I am turned twelve years of age. I was with my father in Houndsditch on Friday, the 18th of June, about nine o'clock - he had three baskets of linen in a barrow: my mother is a laundress. My father went into a house to take a basket of linen, and I was left in care of the others. A man came and asked me the way to St. Mary-axe; I told him - he then asked me the way to Aldgate; I told him: he then crossed over, and went down Cutler-street. When he was gone, there was only one basket left; there had been two.</p>

            . I was in Houndsditch on the 18th of June, about nine o'clock, and saw this little girl with the barrow and two baskets - I saw one of the prisoners talking to her, and the other took the things. I knew the persons of the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you a chimney sweeper - A. Yes. They were by the side of the girl; she was sitting upon the barrow; one of them spoke to her, and another took the basket off the barrow while she got up to show him the way. I did not see them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150054"/>again till they were in custody; I do not know how long that was. It was dark - I was sitting at my own door, opposite to the barrow.

On the 3d of May the prisoner came to our shop, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and wished to be shown some razors; I showed him several - he did not appear perfectly satisfied with them, and asked to see some others - I fetched a tray out of the window, and placed it before him on the counter; he selected a pair with ivory handles, inlaid with silver, and asked the price of them; I told him 18 s.: he appeared perfectly satisfied with them, and immediately went out of the shop with them - not offering to pay for them at all; I felt myself confused for a moment: I ran round the counter, and called Stop thief! but he was gone - I could not pursue him, being alone.</p>
               <p>Q. When you showed him the two razors where did you put them - A. I placed them before him on the counter - he took them up himself, and staid a short time, but did not offer to pay for them; I never saw him before: he was about ten minutes in the shop - he was dressed in a black coat, a pink striped fashionable waistcoat, and light coloured trowsers, I think, but will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of looking at him to say whether he was the man - A. I looked at him particularly, thinking he had very much the appearance of a gentleman - I cannot be mistaken: I am certain he is the man who entered my shop - we have three candles in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what day of the week was it - A. Monday; it was as near half-past eight o'clock as I can tell: we have a branch with two candles in the window, and one on each side of the counter; he wore a black hat.</p>
               <p>Q. From the 3d of May till six weeks after, when he was in custody, you never saw him - A. I never did. The constable came to me the morning after he was taken, and asked what kind of a young man it was who came to my shop: I described him, and he then said there was a person in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mistake a person in your life - A. I do not know that I have. I feel myself perfectly satisfied that he is the man. I may perhaps have mistaken a person in the course of my life. I went to Marlborough-street at the second or third day after he was taken - I saw him pass through the passage to go to the office: I afterwards saw him in the office, in an elevated place, distinguished from other persons.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that he was the man of whom the officer had been speaking - A. I knew he was the man who took my razors, that is all I have got to say; the officer said he was the man who had been taken on suspicion of other cases - Biles produced my razors.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw him at the office, did he answer the description you had given - A. Exactly so my Lord; he was dressed nearly the same as at my shop, except his trowsers, which were white, and at my shop he had light cloth ones.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Chaffers and Mills, pawnbrokers, Greek-street, Soho - I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Marlborough-street; I have some razors here which I produced there; I stopped them from a young man who presented himself to pawn them in the early part of June; I think it was the first week in June; the young man very much resembles the prisoner; I knew him from having seen him twice before, and should know him again if I was to see him - I intended to stop him as he had brought an album the week before which had been stolen: I put a few questions to him to keep him in parley, but on putting my hand to the counter flap, he ran out directly: he had brought something about a fortnight before, but what it was I cannot say: he was remarkably fashionably dressed: when he brought the album I thought I should not take it in, in consequence of his having asked a high price for something before: when he brought the album he had a blue coat on, but when he brought the razors he had a dark coloured coat, with covered buttons, and I think a light coloured striped waistcoat, and dark mixed trowsers, and a red silk watch guard over his waistcoat (I think) it was visible: I said the razors were very good ones; what did they cost; he said 24 s. - I asked where he bought them - he said in Great Russell-street - I am perfectly convinced that it was not the prisoner - I agreed to lend him 3 s. on the razors: he gave his address in Great Russell-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did any person come to your shop soon after he brought the album - A. Cook, the officer, came in shortly after, and left a paper, stating that two albums had been stolen the day before; this directed my attention particularly to him - I am quite sure that the same man brought the razors.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there such a resemblance between him and the prisoner that a casual observer might mistake one for the other - A. Certainly they might - I have seen two or three persons very much like him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Seeing the man bring the razors whom you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150057"/>suspected before, how came you not to detain him - A. On putting my hand to the counter he made off, and there was no one in the shop but me - I think it was on Thursday or Friday in the first week in June; I put the money on the counter, but did not intend to lend it; he left razors and money behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury - the whole case rests on a mere question of identity; I solemnly declare my entire innocence, which I shall be able to demonstrate, by proving a clear alibi, and leave my case with confidence in your hands.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's aunt, and live at Acton Green, which is about five miles from London. In May last, Miss Coates was staying with me; the prisoner came to see me two or three times a week, at Acton Green - he was in our company, at Acton Green, on Monday the 3d of May; he usually came on a Monday, and I know that on that day I went to Mr. Hoole's, on Turnham Green, after dinner, respecting some business of the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did you first see the prisoner - A. A little after six o'clock; he staid with me till twenty minutes past eight - I went with him, as I generally do, to see him to the stage, which passes the top of the terrace, and we were too late for the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that circumstance bring to your recollection that it was Monday - It does; he walked, and I took leave of him at half-past eight o'clock - he was then five miles from Hyde Park corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you have been taking pains to consider about this incident, to be quite sure of the day - A. I have, and have not the slightest doubt of it. I am certain no person deserves a better character than he does.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You usually see him into the coach - A. Always; I never omitted it, as I am very much attached to him, and wish to remain with him as long as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your attention first called to the 3d of May - A. I keep a journal, and it appears by that that he was there on the 3d of May; and he wrote to me at Manchester, requesting me to look at it - I left it at Manchester with my papers. I set off for Manchester a month ago last Friday; and returned yesterday week. The journal contains an account of every time he came. I reside at Mr. Byng's, at Acton Green; Miss Coates also resides there.</p>

            . I reside at Mr. Byng's; Mrs. Turner also lives there. I saw the prisoner on Monday the 3d of May, a little after six o'clock, at our house, in the parlour; he was there for half an hour, while I was there; I lost sight of him finally at half-past eight; he was going to ride home, but missed the coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What induced you to say it was the 3d of May - A. I had occasion to write a note to a friend, while he was in the house, and I dated it the 3d of May. I have since seen that note - he was there two or three times a week - when he did not come on Sunday, he came on Monday; and I particularly remember that she was not there on Sunday. He went away with his aunt about half-past eight o'clock; she walked to Hammersmith with him.</p>
               <p>MR. ABRAHAMS deposed as in the former case, page 427; and MR. FRAZIER a clerk Mr. Abraham's office, deposed that he never saw the prisoner with a scarlet and gold watch-guard.</p>

On the 8th June I was standing in the shop behind the counter, the prisoner was coming along, he passed and stopped short, looked in at the window, then came in, and asked me to let him look at a key, I asked if he wanted a fine gold, or a common key; he said a fine gold one; I shewed him a tray with seals and keys - he said he wanted one with a stone in it. I took out two or three sets of keys with stones - he said,</p>
               <p>"There is a key with a square stone in the window:" I said I would shew it to him if he would point it out to me. I went to the step of the door, and looked; he did not follow me - he had his right hand glove off, and had it in his left hand, on the counter - he did not follow me to the window, but came to me immediately after I had left, and said,</p>
               <p>"I see you have not got such a thing - it is a mistake:" I said,</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, I don't think I have." He bid me good day, and went away. I came into the shop immediately, and missed a fine gold stirrup-shaped seal, with a blood stone; it was chased. I immediately went to the door; I did not see him, and ran a little way down Oxford-street, but having left nobody in the shop, I ran back immediately, and then missed a brooch - some brooches laid on the counter when he came in; I heard nothing more of him till my husband brought me up the Times newspaper - in consequence of which I attended the second examination of the prisoner; I think it was on the Wednesday week following - I knew him immediately. I have not found either the brooch or seal.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did it happen - A. Between two and four o'clock; I think about three: he was dressed in white trowsers, and a kind of frock coat, which I should call a bronze or brown colour. I should think he was in my sight six or seven minutes: my back was towards him part of that time - I was about four minutes before him. The tray of seals and keys were cleaned the day before: I had placed them in the tray myself - it was filled, and none had been sold. I am sure the seal was in the tray when he came in; there were three fixed on a card, different from the others - it was marked 35 s.; the brooch was in a tray, full, which had been cleaned that morning, and laid on the counter ready to be placed on a card. Nobody but him had been in the shop after they were cleaned. I do not recollect that I ever saw him before: I particularly noticed him before he came in, by his stopping so suddenly, and am positive he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the number of your shop - A. No. 350: there is an cating-house next door but one.</p>

               <p>"Proteus or the Life of an Actor," as I understood from my lad; I told him I had not, but would procure them by the evening; he said, he would call in the evening; I said he should be sure to have them. About nine o'clock that evening, I was shaving myself in the parlour, a knock came at the door, I immediately put on my coat and went to the door and opened it; when the prisoner entered, and asked if I had now got him the books; I said, I was extremely sorry, that I was particularly busy, and had not; but if he would wait in the shop a few minutes I would send my lad for them into the next street to Mr. Arnold, who published them - I sent the boyand gave him I think 8 s.; he was gone about ten minutes, during which time I entered, into conversation with the prisoner, as to the state of the weather, or some trivial thing; my lad came back and said he wanted more money, as there were four numbers out instead of three; I then gave him 2 s. more, he went for them, and was gone full ten minutes more; the books were then brought and handed to the prisoner; when he took them in his hand, he said,</p>
               <p>"I thought there was but three numbers out, what are they a number," I said, I believed 3 s. 6 d. but the price was marked on them; he said, he thought they were but 2 s. 6 d. - I replied, I could make no mistake as the price was on them; he said,</p>
               <p>"No matter, what will they amount to;" (putting his hand into his pocket as I thought with intention of paying) I said 14 s.; he then asked if I had the tragedy of Cato; I said I had not - he then asked, if I had the tragedy of Hamlet; I said No, for I had sold it a short time before - he then said, there was something else that he wanted, and waited about half-a-minute; he then said, it was some book that he had seen in my window; he reflected a moment, and said it was the</p>
               <p>"Farce of Blue Devils," it was just behind me in a glass case in the window. I pulled the glass case to reach it, and took it in my hand; this did not occupy the space of half-a-minute; I turned round to give it to him. when I saw him deliberately walk out of the shop - I did not feel surprised, thinking he was gone for some temporary purpose, as his appearance quite set aside suspicion. but in an instant I missed the books; I directly buttoned my coat up, ran round the counter and ran out into the market, but could see nothing of him; I returned and told the watchman; I did not see him or the books afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. In a dark olive or pace coloured frock coat; a light waistcoat; a small key to his watch ribbon, and light coloured trowsers, which I think were cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You expressed a wish for him to put his hat on - A. Yes, that I might be positive, though I am positive without that - I wish him to do it as he had his hat on in my shop. I saw him the first time for about five minutes; the last time was full twenty minutes. I am positive he is the man. [The prisoner here put on his hat.] I am still positive of him, though his hair appears darker than when he came to my shop, it appears to have been oiled.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you told us all that you have said about him, on any former occasion - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not state at Marlborough-street, that he appeared to wear an artificial colouring on his cheeks - A. I did so, I had forgotten to state that to-day; I did not say it was on Thursday, the 25th of April - I said it might be on the 25th; but I could not positively state, but owing to a memorandum I made in the common day book, when I got home - I could positively state the day - I stated so at Marlborough-street, it was taken down as not a positive thing; I went to Mr. Abrahams, and told him I was mistaken and that it was on the 29th; I did not see the prisoner again till the 16th of June - I had never seen him except on this occasion; I desired him to put on his hat at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for satisfaction or what, that you desired it again to-day - A. For satisfaction, I should not like to swear to him without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it with his hat on, or from seeing him in both states that you venture to swear to him - A. By seeing him in both.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the man who said if fifty juries acquitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150059"/>him you should die believing him to be the man - A. I am not; I have said, I should die convinced of him, but never mentioned about fifty people - I think he had a light striped handkerchief on; I noticed that when he spoke he had a peculiar twitch with his mouth; I did not mention that at Marlborough-street; I saw him talking with his friends there.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. You are quite positive as to the dress he had on - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you not said to Mr. Clark, that if 50,000 persons were to swear he was not the man who robbed you, you should not believe one of them - A. I have not; I might have said something inadvertently - I cannot be positive what I said - my lad is not here; he is only eleven years old.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a perfect opportunity of distinguishing the colour of his coat at that time in the evening - A. If I had I should have said whether it was puce or olive. When he called the first time it was so short I did not take notice - there was no light in the shop except one, which I brought from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In this case it is not in my power to prove an alibi. I have, however, solemnly to declare my innocence, and call your attention to the circumstance of the dress. I can give such an account of the proceedings of that day, as to make it impossible that I could have committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. ABRAHAMS. I never in my life saw the prisoner wear an olive or puce coloured frock coat: he generally wore blue. I never saw him in a frock coat, except when he was in mourning, when I believe he had a black one. I have seen a person very similar to him near my house once, and once at Westminster - he might be mistaken for the prisoner, by persons not intimate with him.</p>
               <p>MR. FRAZIER. I never saw the prisoner wear a puce or olive frock coat.</p>
               <p>SUMMERS CLARK. Since the prisoner's committal I have had conversation with Mr. Veck; he said his opinion would be quite conclusive as to the prisoner's guilt, if 50,000 persons came to swear to the contrary. I never saw an artificial colour on his cheeks, or any alteration in his appearance, as if to conceal his identity. Since the prisoner's committal, I have seen a person so much like him that I could hardly know the difference, though I have seen him daily for months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you see that man - A. In Princes-street, about three weeks ago - I was in conversation with a lady, (who knew the prisoner) at the time, and she remarked the same to me: he was standing in conversation with very respectable persons.</p>
               <p>MR. BING. I am the prisoner's guardian. I have seen him two or three times every week; I never saw him in a brown or puce frock coat: he generally advises with me before he has new clothes - I never heard of his having such a dress.</p>

            . I am a professor of music. Last Christmas, when the prisoner was out of town, I was going along Oxford-street, and met a young gentleman - I went up to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Mr. Robinson?" he turned to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, you are mistaken, my name is not Robinson," and to convince myself I called upon Mr. Abrahams that afternoon, to ask if he was come to town or not: I found he was not expected for some time. Any person might mistake him for that young man.</p>


               <p>JURY. Q. What sort of a coat had the young man - A. I do not recollect, only it was very similar to the prisoner's stile - I looked more at his face than his dress. I have dined at Mr. Abrahams's frequently with the prisoner.</p>

I went to my drawers, in the bed-room, and missed a sheet. a pillow-case, a table-cloth, and several other things.

I was called up a little after six o'clock on that morning, and asked if we had lost any meat. I then went into the slaughter-house, where the meat was the night before, and missed a quantity. I then went to the watch-house, and saw the meat tied up in a bag in Furzman's possession - there was a fore-quarter, a shoulder, and a neck of mutton, and a fore-quarter of lamb. I knew it to be my master's by its appearance - I had cut up the lamb myself, and my master cut up the mutton - it was worth about 15 s.; it was taken to the watch-house, and then returned to my master.</p>
               <p>JESSY WILLIAMS. On Wednesday morning last, about five o'clock, I was taking a walk, and saw the two prisoners loitering about the corner of Lion-street, which joins the market. I determined to watch - I went on this side of Bloomsbury-square, and down Southampton-street, then turned to the right, and saw them again - they advanced towards the prosecutor's premises - I passed them, and got into Holborn - ran to Broad-street to look for Green, the beadle, but not finding him I returned the back way, and saw Clancy in Castle-street with a bag on his shoulder. I went up to him and asked where he was going - he said he did not know; I said he must go back with me, for he had robbed some house in the market. I took him to the watch-house - Chambers was not with him then - Clancy was about three hundred yards from Gower's when I stopped him - a girl came to the watch-house to him; we followed her to Bainbridge-street, where we found Chambers at his lodgings. I had not seen them go into Gower's house, but saw them close to the grating. Burton saw the meat at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper. About half-past five o'clock on this morning I was called up, and Clansey was brought in by Williams, with a quantity of meat - I locked him up, went up stairs and dressed myself; and Williams and I followed a girl (who had been to the watch-house) to a house in Bainbridge-street, and she called out</p>
               <p>"Chambers," as soon as she got into the passage on the stairs - I got close to her, and heard a man's voice say</p>

               <p>"He is taken." The man said</p>

               <p>"Yes, meat and all," and at that moment the man ran up stairs, hearing my voice - I followed, and took him on the top landing-place, it was Chambers. I brought him down - Williams pointed him out, and said he was the man he had seen with Clancy. I took him to the watch-house - Clancy said, as we went to the office, that he was very sorry, and that it was his first offence. I went to Bloomsbury market, and saw Burton at Mr. Gower's. I found the area rails had been wrenched up - the meat is kept in the cellar, which they call the slaughter-house.</p>

             re-examined. The slaughter-house is under the shop, even with the kitchen - I saw the meat there the night before - they got in by forcing the grating, and could then get down the steps into the area - the grating was fastened the night before. I went to bed soon after ten o'clock - my fellow servant and the maid servant slept in the house - I believe my master was gone to market at the time.</p>

The prisoner came on the 23d January and took a room, at 6 s. per week - I asked for a reference - he said he was assistant to an auctioneer, under the Piazza, Covent-garden, and lodged at Mr. Brown's, 33, Wood-street, Cheapside, to whom he referred me; and wished to come in directly. I did not go to the reference for two days, it being wet. I then told him I should go - he wished to know at what time - I said between twelve and one o'clock - he called on me at that time, and asked if his portmanteau had come - I said No. and that I had not been for his character. He staid at home till between three and four that afternoon, and then went out (he had slept there for two nights.) I went into the parlour, and missed a chain and locket from my writing-desk, and in about two hours, on going to my drawers, I missed eight spoons and the sugar-tongs. I found six of the spoons in pawn - he had the use of the front parlour, but had nothing to do with the spoons - he had breakfasted alone, in that room, both mornings. I went to Wood-street, but could find no such person, nor was he known at the auctioneer's.</p>

            . I live in Cromer-place, Somers'-town. On the 1st of July, about twenty minutes past five o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Albany-street, New-road, and saw the prisoners White and Ryan drawing a truck, Shannon was behind - and as they approached Mr. Hall's building he followed them on the footpath ten or fifteen yards off. I took particular notice of them all - the two came through the posts, and 
               <persName id="t18240715-147-person1304">drew</persName>
             the truck up near the building; whether Shannon went into the building, I cannot say but he was walking up and down, I only looked towards them occasionally, and am not positive - I saw White and Ryan go in, and come out in five or eight minutes with five window sashes, and put them on the truck, and draw it in a direction towards Norton-street; Shannon was then following them. Ebbs came up - I told him and he alarmed Mr. Hall, and went in pursuit, and at ten or eleven o'clock I saw them in custody. I am confident that all three are the men.</p>

The witness pointed the prisoners out to me - I saw two men drawing a truck, and one walking behind; I went and rung Mr. Hall's bell, then followed them and kept getting nearer - I overtook them by Wells-street, about half-a-mile from the building - they had just broken a square of glass in the sash, and were all three putting them to rights. I went up and said Mr. Hall was coming, and I would thank them to stop, one of them gave a sort of alarm, and they all started off in different directions - I followed White and secured him by the Middlesex Hospital, without his being out of my sight; and on turning round the other two were brought up.

On the morning of the 6th of March I discovered that a quantity of lead was stolen from my premises; it consisted of a pump, a cistern, and a variety of other lead: I have since seen it in Watson's possession. It cost me some hundreds of pounds to replace it.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150062"/>Dickanson. After this robbery I heard that the prisoner was in custody, and saw him - I held him out no threat or inducement to say anything: I felt desirous to render him a service, as his father was in my employ. I said I wished him to tell the truth about the business, but at the same time said I could make him no promise, as I had not seen the prosecutor. He told me voluntarily that he had been in company with Taylor, Coltman, and Somerset - that they were at the Red Lion public-house at Twickenham, on the night of the robbery, and left there about eleven o'clock, proceeded to Mr. Dickanson's premises and stole two leaden pumps, a cistern, and a large quantity of lead off the stables and out building, and that soon after twelve o'clock Philpot came with a cart to take it away - that he brought the cart into Mr. Dickanson's meadow; and loaded it with the lead, but had got more than it would carry: they threw part of it down, and left it in the meadow, and again finding that they had more than the horse could draw, they took more out, and threw it into the gravel-pits. Philpot left them with the cart - he and Coltman then retired to a barn, the property of Sir W. Walham, where they slept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What induced you to get this out of him - A. A wish to serve his father. I thought if he told the truth he might possibly be saved, but did not tell him so. He was committed to prison last Session, by this Court, and to my surprise two or three days after I heard he was at Twickenham, and finding he had escaped by accident I had him apprehended. I was informed he understood that I had obtained his discharge, and sent to him to say it was not so - he called upon me, and was detained. When he was examined here he declared that he knew nothing about it.</p>

He, Coltman, Somerset, and Taylor were there: they all four assisted in putting it into the cart: there was more than I could carry, and I threw it off the cart.

            . On the evening of the 5th of March I was at the Red Lion at Twickenham, and saw the prisoner there in company with Coltman, Somerset, and Taylor, for two hours or more. Between ten and eleven o'clock one went out, and then another - there was a good deal of whispering between them: they went towards the Duke's Head, public-house, which is half a mile from Mr. Dickanson's. I had applied to the overseers for a lodging that night, and was refused, and went into a shed belong-to Sir W. Walham, and about three o'clock Coltman, Somerset, and the prisoner came into the shed, and remained there till about nine - they then got up, and were brushing each others clothes, which appeared to have cobwebs about them. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Be d - d if it will do all to go one way" - he and Somerset went over the common fields, and they agreed to meet at the Broadway. Coltman went home to breakfast.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you get it - take care - A. A gentleman gave it to me - it was Mr. Thackrah. I was taken up once for being in company with one Facey - nothing was done to me. I was never charged with felony, or in confinement. I was working for a biscuit-baker, and took a biscuit for my tea - he took me before a Magistrate.</p>

               <p>"Carlile" is over the door: I do not know if there is any other name. I went there on Monday, the 31st of last May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner in the shop - I went there again between twelve and one: the prisoner was there then; he was alone, behind the counter each time; I asked if he had got</p>
               <p>"Palmer's principles of Nature;" he said he had, and the price was a sovereign - I said that was more than I was authorized to give: I understood it was 4 s.: he said the regular price was 2 s., but they would not sell it to any person but Mr. Carlile's friends, or some person belonging to the concern for less than a sovereign, for they had so many Bow-street officers, and what they call patroles coming in different characters, that they scarcely knew who was who: I said I hoped he did not think I was coming to lay an information - he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I don't suppose you are." I told him it was a commission I had from the country; he asked what part of the country I came from; I said, Lincolnshire - he said he had only come from Spalding a few days before - I said I knew little about Spalding:</p>
               <p>"I never was there" he said,</p>
               <p>"what part might you come from?" I told him a village near Market Raisin - he said he knew very little of Market Raisin; I said it was a village named Claxon - he said he knew Claxon very well, and had been there several times: he then said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose I must let you have it, and risk it" - he reached down the book from a shelf behind him, and gave it to me; I put it into my pocket, and put him down 2 s.: this is the book (producing it) - I marked it before it went out of my possession. He said,</p>
               <p>"If there is an information, we will immediately raise them to 5 l." I am positive the prisoner is the man who sold it to me. I wrote on it</p>

            , of Bucklersbury, were indebted to us in the sum of 24 l. 15 s. 9 d., which was paid to the prisoner on the 13th of September, and for which he never accounted: it was his duty to collect cash and bills, and to deliver them at night at the house in Wood-street, to Mr. Todd, our cashier. We had occasion on the 1st of December last, to question the prisoner - he had then been absent a week on leave. When he came to Wood-street I took him up stairs to my office, and told him I was sorry to say there were some discoveries made during his absence, reflecting upon his integrity, and I hoped he would be able to exonerate himself - he said he should be able to satisfy me that there could not be any deficiency, or a very immeterial one, which he would make good directly if I would take him up to our other office in the City-road - I got a coach and took him there: it was then about eleven o'clock. I took him into a private office, and then mentioned to him the names of partis who had shown receipts which he had given to them, and had not accounted for to us. I sent for a cash-book and some others to show him it was so: he said if he might go over to his own office, he would fetch his book and tell how it was; I was simple enough to believe him - he went away, and I saw him no more till he was apprehended, about a month ago; it was his duty to enter every night in the cash-book what money he had received. A gentleman of the name of Veal was our cashier at the wharf, and he was burnt when our premises were destroyed by fire. The books were partly burnt, but there is a part of one of them here - we have directed two of our clerks to make extracts from it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. The prisoner had had leave of absence for a week previous to the 1st of December - A. Yes. Veal was the cashier, and the prisoner was to account to him; when I took him to the wharf I did not tell him I should send to Manchester for his bond; there was no bond then in existence: there had been one on his father, who was then dead - I do not think his own name was on the bond. Mr. Veal's books were burned; the books the prisoner kept were what were copied every month, by the ledger keeper, from the ledger - he was to receive different sums of money, and then to put them down at Wood-street, in what was called the payment book, and the cashier signed it, and that released him from any further responsibility: it should be in his own writing, and signed by the cashier. The place he first occupied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150064"/>was not a place of trust. He might give a small cheque for a large one, but he had no right to give a cheque in change - he might have gone to a banker's to get change. Holland preceeded him as collector; he kept his book as Holland had done. The entries in the payment book were the day of the month, and then so much gold, silver, and copper. We have damages claimed sometimes, which it was his duty to pay after they had been ascertained. If he received a cheque he was not allowed to pay money instead of it.</p>

Yes; they were given to me and put into my desk, which was burnt at the fire: there were a great many memorandums and different papers of the prisoner's, and a great many accounts, which should have been delivered by him, as collected; if there had been any papers among them for him to have shown anything on this charge they were burnt.

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Pickford and Co. The prisoner never accounted to me for 24 l. 15 s. 9 d. received from Messrs. Dobson, on the 13th of September, which he should have done when he came home. Veal was not then in the employ, but he was afterwards, and then he should have accounted to Veal. I never directed him not to change a draft to make a payment - if he brought the collection of the day it was of no consequence is what manner. He kept the books the same as Holland had done. He has never accounted in any shape or way for this money. Mr. Veal did not come into the situation till October. In this book here is an account in the prisoner's writing on the 13th of September, but no mention of the money received from Dobson. Here is one</p>
               <p>"10 l. note and four soverigns," received that day, that is all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The book produced was never meant as a book of particulars, but only a memorandum of the money collected in the course of the day. If I had gone to any house where they had offered a 50 l. or 100 l. note, I should have given them a cheque in change if I had it, and I never had any instructions not to do so - then of course the cheque would be sunk in the payment of that bill, and could not be produced in that specific form - the book I kept was called the cash-book; I had an item there of the cash I received, but that was burnt. The book now produced contains a great number of sums in the month of September, in cheques, gold, and silver, which are not put down from whom they were received. If the collect had got the right amount, or the form in which it was paid would not be objected to - if I had paid anything in the way of damages it would not be put down in that book: it was not considered a principle book; anybody might have entered things in it.</p>

I preceeded the prisoner as collecter at this house - the payment book is intended as a check between the collector and the cashier: there are entries in it of gold and silver; it is not specified from whom they are received. I have known the prisoner about five years, and never heard anything against him before: the first thing the collector does when he has received money is to enter it with the cashier - the cash-book is made up afterwards, from the collector's portable book; the ledger is posted from the cash-book: the portable book is the book from which the cash-book is made out, and it then remains in possession of the house. I left the service twelve months before the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>MR. LAMBERT re-examined. The prisoner should make up his cash-book from the portable book - I have seen the portable book, and looked over it very minutely indeed, and it contained no entry of 24 l. 15 s. 9 d. received from Mr. Dobson - I examined it for the purpose of ascertaining this fact from the 13th of September to the 1st of October, and after that the prisoner had no right to enter anything in it. I will swear that after the 1st of October there was no entry of it: these books are continually before me - there was no entry at all of this cheque in any shape, up to the 26th of February, the day our premises were burnt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you tell in what folio of the cash-book it should have been entered - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any of the entries in September - A. No: my attention was particularly directed to those entries where Dobson's and some others occur. I do not recollect the total amount of cash received in September, nor the items which composed it. I did not compare the cash-book with the portable book; what I speak of are the cash-book and the ledger. I looked at the portable book after this was found out - the sum total of the cash-book and portable book agreed together.</p>

            . In November, 1823 the prisoner was in our employ - Veal was then the acting clerk, but the prisoner was assisting him - our business was carried on in Wood-street, and at the City-road. When the prisoner received a cheque or money, he was to enter it in the payment book, and deliver the money to the cashier every evening, who gave him a receipt for it - he was to make the entry in the cash-book: he had no further duties to perform with respect to entries there. On the 1st of December the prisoner returned after a week's absence - I then told him there had been discoveries made, which impeached his integrity; we had heard from some parties that they had got his receipts for money, for which he had not accounted - he went up to the wharf, and there he escaped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Todd was the person to whom he was to render the account of money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150065"/>collected in November - A. Todd was not the collector - Veal had been appointed: he was to account for the money to Veal, and Veal to give it to Todd. If he gave his account to Veal or Todd it would have been sufficient. My orders to him were to go round to the customers with Veal, and account to him. It would not have been a branch of his duty if he got a draft to have got it cashed. His father had given a bond when he entered our service, but I believe his name was not to it - his father was then dead.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. He might pay a cheque in change - A. Yes; if he got a cheque for 10 l, and had to take a larger cheque, he might have paid that away, and I should not have expected an account of that, but should, no doubt, of the larger one. If there had been a trifling damage to pay of a few shillings, I should not have permitted him to settle that without its being submitted to our inspection.</p>
               <p>MR. DOBSON. This is my draft (looking at it,) and this is the receipt the prisoner gave me - the draft was upon Messrs. Masterman and Co., for 14 l. 7 s. 9 d.: the receipt was written by the prisoner in my presence, about twelve o'clock on the 19th of November - I wrote the cheque in his presence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you know who brought the note, a man or a woman - A. No; but if I had not known the parties I should not have changed it.

            . I was clerk to the prosecutors'. I examined the portable book, the cash-book, and ledger, for the express purpose of seeing if this account was entered - I did this about a week before they were destroyed, in February last: I examined them diligently and no trace of this account was to be found - the portable book was partly in the prisoner's hand-writing: the payment book includes the accounts of many years. The entries of the 19th of November are in the hand-writing of Veal - the prisoner had access to that book, and could have corrected any inaccuracies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is there any one book which has been saved from the flames relative to accounts but this - A. No: the cash-book and ledger were destroyed - the ledger was made from the cash-book - and the bills, or invoices. There are entries here not made by Mr. Veal - it was not the prisoner's business to make entries here: it was Veal's duty to do it. If Veal had made a mistake he would have found it out by the cash in his pocket. If the prisoner had received in any one day 100 l., made up partly of cheques, and partly money, and brought the whole of the amount it would have been all that was required - he had no right to change a cheque for payment. The amount on the 19th of November was in eight payments, 83 l. 19 s. 3 d., all in bills or cheques except 6 l. 6 s. 8 d. Veal was there at the time of the investigation, and assisted in it. If the prisoner had received a cheque for 14 l. 7 s. 9 d., and gave it in change he should have accounted for both in the book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the practice previous to Mr. Veal's coming, to enter both the names in the book - A. It ought to have been: the credit given to the customers did not depend upon this book, but the cash-book; the ledger could not have been creditted from this book - it must have gone to the cash-book, which had the entries from the collectors portable book, which the prisoner carried about with him - it might be half a sheet of paper: it afterwards remained as a document of the house. I found several of these portable books in the prisoner's desk, which had dates to them; he should have made them out every day. I do not know that I had every one he wrote.</p>

            . I was ledger keeper to Messrs. Langton and Co. I remember the prisoner leaving on the 1st of December. I examined with the last witness the various books to see what entries were made - there was not in the cash-book any entry of this money, paid by Dobson - I cannot speak to the other books. Mr. Veal continued there till the 26th of February, and all that time there were enquiries going on - it was Veal's duty to have made the entry in November last if he had received the money - if he did not he could not have made it: if he had received the money and not made the entry, it would have been the prisoner's duty to have asked him for it.</p>
               <p>MR. TODD. The prisoner never accounted to me nor Mr. Veal for this 14 l. 7 s. 9 d. - he had an opportunity of seeing this book every day: every sum he paid me he had my signature for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. From what did Mr. Veal make his entry in the cash-book, from these memorandums - A. Yes. When he had a day's money to account for he was to give an account to Mr. Veal, but I cannot tell whether it was by word of mouth, or memorandums - but if he brought money Mr. Veal should have entered it, or if he brought it to me I should have entered it. I have been many years a book-keeper, and sometimes make mistakes. Mr. Veal was very correct, if he made a mistake of 1 d. he would have set it to rights. I think it quite impossible he should have made a mistake of 14 l. 6 s. 9 d. - he continued in his place till the fire.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of December, I searched for the prisoner under a warrant, but I did not apprehend him till the 10th of June last - when I took him I either read or suffered him to read the warrant - he said he had written a letter to his masters, to try to settle the business: I asked if the letter was gone; he said, No, it was in the hands of a friend, and he should stop it: I made no reply to that.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have very little to add, but with regard to changing the note, I think I can explain that. Though I was not to collect, I used to settle the damages up to that time, and if there was any trifling damages I was authorized to pay them, and if I had paid them out of any money of my own, I might change a note to reinburse myself - there was never any memorandums passed between Mr. Veal and me when he received money. I have paid many hundreds of pounds without receiving any memorandums, and it depended upon their entering it in the cash-book to exonerate me.</p>

Last Friday morning I saw Chitty come to our shop to ask about a violin; the prisoner came afterwards, and brought a violin which corresponded with the description he had given me; the prisoner said he had bought it from his brother, who had two or three violins; I stopped him, and sent for Chitty, and an officer.</p>

            . I am an officer - and was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; I asked where he got the violin; he first at said he did not know any thing about it and then said he had found it,</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live in Perkin's-rents, and got up about half-past seven to go out to work. I saw this violin apparently thrown in the dust hole, and from what the man said, I thought by placing it in the hands of Mr. Lloyd - I might give the man the money when I saw him; I do not see him very often, and it is not always convenient for me to carry a violin with me.</p>

            . I live at Kensington, Gravel Pits, I never went to any house in Harford-street - I bought a carpet of the prisoner and his wife for 5 s. - to the best of my recollection it was at Mr. Fielder's house - I have had it in my possession till to-day.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH - . I went into Harford-street on the 8th of June, and apprehended the prisoner. I saw these prints, which he said were given to him by Mr. Fielder, and a quantity of stained paper he said Mr. Fielder, gave him; but Mr. Fielder denied it. I then found this iron fender, this measuring chain, brass night bolt, two cabinet tops, a mahogany flap, and other things, all of which he said Mrs. Fielder had given him. I sent for her, and she denied it; he then said he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say to Mrs. Fielder's face that she had given them to him - A. No; when she came, he said,</p>

               <p>"Ma'am, I am very sorry; I thought they were all old things."</p>
               <p>MR. FIELDER. Mrs. Fielder is not here. She said she had not given him the things; he said, I am very sorry; I hope master will not prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left Mr. Fielder through some words; the property was given to my wife; I was not there at the time; his own servants helped me off with them; I did not steal them.</p>

I rang the Inn bell, and then found I had lost my watch: I had then discharged the coach, and paid 3 s. - upon missing my watch I called back the coach, which was going down Fetter-lane, and asked the coachman what he would take me back to Piccadilly for; he said 9 s.; I said it was an exorbitant demand, the fare being but 3 s.; I gave him a sovereign, and he gave me 17 s. - I intended to go back to see if I had left my watch at the Saloon, but I did not state my loss till I had got upon the box of the coach, and the captain inside - I then requested the prisoners to accompany me, as I had lost my watch: Druid immediately called me from the coach, and said,</p>
               <p>"You need not trouble yourself, I have taken care of it," and gave it to me - I had not given it to him. A watchman came up, and requested we would not disturb the people at the Bell inn - I told him I was going to sleep there. I then told the coachman to give me back my sovereign, and I gave him 1 s. or 1 s. 6 d. for his trouble. Druid then pulled down a sign-board by the side of the inn: the watchman said he would take us to the watch-house, and a scuffle ensued - the watchman sprung his rattle, and a second watchman came up. After waiting some time with them, Druid and myself were taken to the watch-house, but not M'Donough. Next morning, when I arrived at the Compter I discovered that I had lost my pocket-book, containing property to the amount of about 100 l.; it had been in my left hand coat pocket - there were four 5 l., and two 10 l. Abingdon notes; one Oxford 10 l. note; one Wallingford 10 l. note; and one 5 l. Bank of England note, with some others that I cannot swear to. There were some letters in it, addressed to myself. I mentioned my loss to Druid about seven o'clock in the morning, who replied,</p>
               <p>"We know the number of the coach, and I have no doubt we shall find it." I do not remember saying anything more about my loss till we were going to Guildhall, when I again named it to the constable, and asked if he had seen a pocket-book - Druid said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you make yourself so uneasy, we know the number of the coach, and doubt not when this affair is settled at Guildhall that we shall find it." We were taken before Mr. Alderman Thompson, and M'Donough appeared, and said he came to speak for the young man at the bar, and stated his name to be Captain M'Donough - the Alderman asked if he knew Druid; I believe the clerk took down what he said, but it was not read for the prisoner to sign; it was read to his solicitor at the second examination - he said he had known him for twelve months. The Alderman directed Druid to be searched, but I was not present - Fogg, the marshalman brought me the book in about five minutes afterwards; it was then empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What is your name - 
               <persName id="t18240715-171-person1478">A. Thomas Weaver</persName>
            . I have never gone by the name of Charles. I have never been further in France than Calais. I have lived at Abingdon twelve years - I am not married. I have been in business on my own account nearly four years. When I came to London on the 27th of June I had about 190 l. I have never said my loss was 300 l., upon my solemn oath, neither in the Compter or elsewhere. I had come to town on business, and intended to return the next day, if I had not had this loss. I had taken my place, and intended to take this money home with me. I had a letter of license from my creditors three months ago - I do not know Mr. Gibson of Newgate-street - nor that there was a bill of 20 l. of mine out in London, and unpaid: there was a bill of 20 l. returned from Leeds after my return to Abingdon, which I paid - it was not returned because it was alledged to be a forgery - but there was a bill of 97 l. returned three months ago (which I had endorsed,) because the acceptance was forged: I paid it afterwards - I did not get Mr. Baker to pay it. I did not dine at the Saloon on the 30th of June, but at the Swan, public-house in Arundel-street, between three and four o'clock. I went to the Saloon between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; I had been attending to my business in the interval. I had made some purchases; one was at Messrs. Gillman and Lucas, in Newgate-street, which was the last I made - that was about half-past nine o'clock. I must have been walking about. I was in company with some ladies at the Saloon; one female was addressed by the name of 
               <persName id="t18240715-171-person1479">

            ; I do not know her other name - it might be Clark. There were many ladies and gentlemen there. A person of the name of Westbrook was at the Saloon before the prisoners came - we were taking some champaign with some Ladies; I paid for it out of my own money, which was in my pocket: we had three bottles of champaign; there was some Bucellas drank, but I did not drink any. I retired for a short time from the Saloon with

             about one o'clock, but I will swear I had the pocket-book when I returned. I did not say I went there between eleven and twelve o'clock: I was absent with her probably half an hour, and she returned at the same time with me, but did not sit down with me. She did not leave the Saloon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not accuse you of behaving ill to her, and give you a blow on the nose - A. No; I said if the landlord did not send for an officer to take her away, I would report the house - she made my nose bleed - the place is very well lighted, there was a gas chandelier nearly opposite the box - there are boxes on each side, and seats on each side of the boxes, the back of the boxes are from three to four feet high, and there are curtains to them - I do not know what is become of Mr. Westbrook, he is now out of business - I believe I saw him at Abingdon, a few days prior to my coming to London, it was yesterday week; I did not know that the prisoners wished him to be brought here - I know an affidavit was made to postpone the trial on account of the absence of four witnesses, but I do not recollect Westbrook's name being mentioned, or that my attorney undertook to bring him here - Westbrook resides at Abingdon, he did not attend any of the examinations - I told him on Monday week that I was going to town on this trial - I did not see him last Thursday - I did say I had left my watch in possession of Westbrook, when I retired from the Saloon till my return - it was returned to me, and Westbrook retired from the Saloon before I did; he had not dined with me; he came into the Saloon while the ladies were there; I do not know that he belonged to either of them; they appeared to be the companions of the prisoners - they were not in our company before the prisoners came - when we were going from the Saloon I paid the bill - it was between two and three pounds.</p>

When you was going away with the woman did you not put your pocket-book on the table, upon one of the prisoners saying you had better - A. No. I said I was going to Oxford the next day, though I had taken my place for Abingdon - I swear I did not say I had a coach in readiness to take me down, and had relays of horses on the road; or that I was a Fellow of Brazen Nose College, that I recollect - I might have said some such thing in levity at the Compter, but do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the woman gave you the thump on the nose did you not say you was a nephew of the Lord Mayor, and would play the deuce with the Saloon and the keeper of it - A. No, I said I would report it to the Lord Mayor - I did not in the Saloon or any where else say that I was a Fellow of Brazen Nose College, a nephew to the Lord Mayor, or a man of large property; of 5000 l. a year - I never said so to my knowledge, but I will not take an oath of it - I was perfectly sober when I went to the Magistrate - I cannot recollect whether I said so or not - I was elated with wine, but I knew perfectly well what I was doing - I drove the coach - I was nearly three quarters of an hour going to the Bell - I did not when I was going away with the lady, put down my watch and request Druid to take care of it - I told them I should be happy to see them at Oxford or any where else - I do not know their motive for going to the Bell; they said they would sleep there, but I do not recollect that they said it was in consequence of my invitation - when we got to Holborn there was some disturbance between the watchmen and Druid, and I missed my watch; in consequence of that, I went to the end of Fetter-lane, and took the coach again - they had accompanied me to the coach, but it was afterwards that I told them of my loss - I had a small paper parcel in my hand - it were a part of my luggage - I dropped it, and it was picked up and put somewhere, and brought to me again at Guildhall; but I do not know who took it; we might be three quarters of an hour at the Bell; I paid the person who attended us at the Saloon - I do not know whether it was the landlord or a waiter; I paid with money which was taken from my trowsers pocket; I had some one pound Country notes there, but the five and ten pound notes were in the pocket-book; I have never said my loss was made up partly of sovereigns, and partly of notes, nor that sovereigns were in the pocket-book - I believe I said at the Compter that I lost my pocket-book containing one hundred pounds in cash, notes, and sovereigns; but there were no sovereigns in the pocket-book; if I stated so it was incorrect; I had sovereigns in my pocket when I went to the Saloon; I did not say my pocket-book had sovereigns in it; I did not pull down the board at the Inn myself; it was Druid; the watchman did not take me into custody till he had taken him - I do not think he had an opportunity of getting rid of the pocketbook, as the watchman was close at hand; the prisoner Druid sat by me; his father, who is the other prisoner, sat inside; the book was in my left inside pocket; the coachman sat behind; I sat by the fire at the Compter, and went to sleep; I was taken to Guildhall between eleven and twelve; I did not request the officers not to make the charge against me which had been made by the night officer, but only to say I was tipsy, and I would pay them for it; I asked him what was the charge, and he said</p>

               <p>"Disorderly;" I did not see the board in the coach; when we got to Guildhall, we were permitted to walk up and down the street for some time; Druid's father did not join us before we went to the Alderman; there was an examination on Wednesday and Thursday; the father attended voluntarily on the first day, and I believe the Alderman remanded him for re-examination; I believe they were ordered to be kept separate. I have never stated that my loss amounted to 300 l. or nearly that; that I repeat deliberately, and swear that I had my pocket-book when I returned with

             then read a very long defence, stating that he had not wished his name to be known, from being in pecuniary embarrassments; that if the prosecutor had ever had the notes in his pocket-book, it was very doubtful after he had been for hours in suspicious company, if they had ever reached him; and if he had taken them, it was not likely he should have kept the book; that when the prosecutor left the Saloon with the woman, he left his watch and pocket-book on the table; and it was entirely through his having forgotten the book, that he had not returned it to him with the watch.</p>
               <p>M'DONOUGH's Defence. I took the earliest opportunity of stating that this was my son, soon after we got to the watch-house; when I entered the Saloon it was from curiosity, being a depicter of the scenes of life; we were invited by Mr. Weaver to take some wine, and were introduced to the women as his old acquaintances; he stated that he was a fellow of Brazen Nose College, and being myself brought up at Oriel, it was a sort of tie to me, and I sat down with him. A crime of this nature was not likely to be perpetrated in the broad light of day, and while exposed to the gaze of suspicious watchmen.</p>

            . I am one of the watchmen of Giltspur-street Compter. I remember the prisoner and the prosecutor being brought there - the prosecutor stated that he was going down to Oxford the next day, to take out his degrees at some College, but I don't remember which; he said he was worth 5000 l. a-year: I don't know that he said he was a nephew of the Lord Mayor - I remember his sending me to the Queen's-head Tavern with a letter: I gave it to the waiter, who took it to the landlord, who was in bed - he sent word down that it should be attended to; he then sent me back there again to borrow ten sovereigns - the answer was, that the landlord would get up and wait upon him; I heard him say he had lost 300 l. in notes and sovereigns and bills; he appeared a little intoxicated; I said the notes and sovereigns he might not get back, but the bills he might, if he knew the names on them; I heard the subject of the pocket-book mentioned several times in the coach; they were not much intoxicated then; the night before they were able to talk and walk.</p>
