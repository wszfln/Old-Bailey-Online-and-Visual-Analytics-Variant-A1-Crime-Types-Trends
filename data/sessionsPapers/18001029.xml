               <p>Q. You cannot say where you put it when you went to bed? - A. No; I missed my pocket-book out of my jacket.</p>

               <p>Q. When can you speak to having had it before that? - A. I am sure I had it at six o'clock at the Black-dog; I lost a twenty pound, and a five pound note, and six half joes; in about half an hour after I awoke, the prisoner, Blake, came to bed to me; I mentioned nothing to her about it till day-light; when it was day-light, I got up and began to put my cloths on, she was in bed at that time; I asked her to get up, which she did immediately; I then asked her if she had seen any thing of my pocket-book; she said, she had not, but told me, that I put my cloths under the bed, when I went to bed; I happened to cast my eye under the bed, and saw the pocket-book lying open, about three feet from where the cloaths lay; I took the book up, and I looked into it, I missed a twenty pound and a five pound note; there were three five pound notes, and a one half joe left; I did not say any thing at that time, I was rather ashamed of myself; then we both went out, and had some purl and gin; I then went in search of my fellow-lodger; I found him in bed with another girl, I told him to get up, and we went home to our lodgings.</p>


               <p>Q. You had not then mentioned any thing to her about it? - A. I had told her I missed my money, but did not say how much, and when she saw that half joe, she said, lord, here is your money, you cannot have lost any; after we had been in our lodging sometime, I got some intelligence from Maria Hill, and I saw five half joes found, that were hid in the garden of Berry's house; Treadway was with me, and Mumford, and about five o'clock we took

               <p>Q. Which of them did that? - A. It was the elder Williams, that was the active hero, he took my watch; he then said, I require your pocket-book, sir; I told them I had no pocket-book; they searched me, but not finding a pocket-book, they took from my waistcoat pocket, a pair of spectacles, in a case, which I now hold in my hand, then they let me go; my horse's head being pointed to Highgate, and they going the reverse way, towards London; but before they had got twenty yards from me, they broke into the fields, on that side of the lane, which adjoins to Holloway; immediately as I observed this, before I had time to run round,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290008"/>a gentleman's servant came riding as hard as he could ride; with some difficulty I stopped him, he agreed to assist me, and we leaped our horses over into the fields where they were; I pointed out to him the two men a little before us; I then began to holloa after them as footpads, crying stop thief; upon hearing my voice, they turned round with their faces, and began to run; the young man on horseback and I, pursued them, but we did not get quite up to them till they got over the hedge of the next field; in the next field I got up to them, and got rather before them with my horse; I told them they had robbed me, and I would take them; they drew their pistols, and pointed them at me, and bid me keep off, or they would shoot me; I told them, I did not regard their threats, they might depend upon it I never would leave them till I had taken them, they then holding their pistols to me, and the young man, with me, broke away into an adjoining field,still we followed; then they run and got into the third field, and there we got the assistance of some men that were making of hay; we kept on pursuing them, and in the third field, at the end of it, they were pressed so close, that they fired a pistol, I was a very little way off, and they were in the hedge, but which fired it I do not know; after this pistol was fired, I saw clearly that they were desperate men, and that there would be no taking them without some fire-arms; I desired the people round to go to Holloway, or some place near, and get some fire-arms, some of the men that had come up to us, and we kept them at bay for some time, backwards and forwards, and in different parts of the field, and as frequently as I pressed upon them, they levelled their pistols at me; they then crossed the lane into the fields, leading to Kentish-town; at last there appeared a man at the top of the hill, with a gun; I cried out loudly, here is a gun, give it me, and I will blow their heads off; upon their feeling the gun, they laid down three pistols, and surrendered themselves; I had them tied together with a handkerchief, and they were searched by the people that got about me, but no part of my property was found upon them; I then took them to Bow-street early the next morning; I got up and went to the fields where this bustle had happened, a boy had picked up the spectacles and case, which I received from the boy's father, his name is Thomas Watson.</p>

               <p>Q. Are those the spectacles of which you were robbed? - A. They are positively the spectacles, I have had them many years.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you positively sure that the two men who robbed you, were the same that you afterwards found in the fields? - A. I am very positive that they are the same men; I never lost sight of them, but while they were getting from one field to another.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. There were several persons collected? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long a space of time do you think might elapse before you saw the servant? - A. I can scarcely think it was one minute.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is the field where you took them, from where you were robbed? - A. I should suppose the fifth field.</p>

               <p>Q. There are hedges which divide each field? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The persons who committed the robbery had got over one hedge before you began to pursue? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. There were five hedges-do you mean to say that you always had a constant view of the prisoners? - A. Allowing for the time of getting over the hedges.</p>

               <p>Q. None of your property was found upon them? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you at all say in what direction the pistol was fired? - A. No.</p>

               <p> Mr. Hodgson. He is certainly right in correcting that they had two brace of pistols. White. They asked me if they had hurt me; I told them, no, they had not; I said, I know that very well, but you have robbed that gentleman of his watch and money; they told me; if I did not leave them, they would shoot me; I told them, they might depend upon it I would follow them; if they did shoot me, they could not shoot that gentleman; in going over the third field hedge, one of them fired a pistol, but which way the pistol was directed. I cannot say, for I was paying attention to my horse to leap the hedge; in the next field there were some farmering men came up and surrounded them; they threatened, that the first man that touched them they would shoot him; they swore they would not suffer themselves to be taken; they got out of that field into another, they were crossing a little narrow lane, upon which one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290009"/>them that was going up the furthermost hedge from me, fired another pistol, but I did not see the direction of it; a little time after that they surrendered themselves, and put down their pistols; there were only three pistols then: they were secured, and we took them to Bow-street.</p>



               <p>Q. Are you sure that the men that you pursued till they surrendered themselves, were the same that Mr.Hodgson first pointed out to you? - A. I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they such as you would take for the current coin of this realm? - A. No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290012"/>(John Armstrong produced the paper of counterfeit money).</p>

               <p>Q.(To Lillywhite.) Look at that paper; what are the number of sixpences which appear to be of the current coin of this realm? - A. Twenty-five; the other sixpence is a bad French one; and here are four shillings of the French coin bad, and thirteen other shillings; making seventeen in all.</p>

               <p>The Court were of opinion that the indictment could not be maintained, in as much as it was necessary that the contract should be charged exactly as it was made between the parties.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any sensation at your pocket at the time you missed your handkerchief? - A. None at all, it was the running alone that caused my suspicion; I had it in my hand not two minutes before in coming down Snow-hill.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked it up at the bottom of Holborn-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it by the lamp-light that you discovered it to be a man's head? - A. There was a lamp about a yard from him; I got up and awaked Mr. Clarkson; I was not gone two minutes; Mr. Clarkson returned with me; the man was then gone; we waited a short time, and the man came again to the fan-light; that might be in about five minutes; he went away again, and returned in a few minutes, when he put his arm through the glass of the fanlight, and Mr. Clarkson seized it, while I went out at another door, and secured him outside.</p>

               <p>Q. How high is this fan-light from the ground? - A. Ten feet; he must have been assisted by somebody; I did not see any other person when I came out; the prisoner is the man that I secured; I missed a shirt which I had seen at eight o'clock the night before; it was hanging upon the line, near the fanlight; there were three hanging upon the line, but this was the only one within his reach.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any shirt upon him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of light was it? - A. It was then twilight.</p>

               <p>Q. So that you could easily distinguish the features of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - On the 27th of September, about half past seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner at the bar come to the stall of Mrs. Townsend, and take a basket; he carried it about forty yards, and gave it to two little boys that I had before observed with him; the manner in which he took them, for he ran smartly with them before him, gave me a suspicion; I went to inform Mrs. Townsend of it, and then I went after the prisoner and laid hold of him, the little boy that had the pears, threw the basket down and ran away; I am certain the prisoner is the person that took the basket; and I am certain he is the person that gave it to the little boy; I had seen him before; Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290017"/>Townsend was there, but she was standing sideways, sorting over some damsons.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Beville. Q. Was it dark or light? - A. It was dark, there were lamps lighted.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - A. Not distinctly, I saw his back.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you had not at all lost sight of him? - A. I cannot positively say whether I had or not, but I should rather think I had not, than that I had.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was he from you at the time you went after him? - A. About 60 or 70 yards; and he was near 200 yards from Mrs. Townsend's when I took him.</p>

               <p>Q. But you did not see his face at all? - A. Yes. I saw his face before he went to Mrs. Townsend's premises, and I saw his face when he was carrying the pears to the little boys.</p>

               <p>Rogers. On the 25th of September I went with Richardson and Parker to a Public-house near St. James's-street, Clerkenwell, and there, with a penknife. I marked a good half-crown and a good shilling, and gave it into the hands of Parker; Richardson and he went away together; Eibe and I went to a street leading to St. John's Gate, and waited till Parker came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290018"/>to us, and told us he had made a purchase; I do not think it was more than from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after I went to the Red Lion, and saw Richardson and the prisoner sitting in a box in the tap-room; I instantly secured the prisoner, I told him I had a warrant against him; I searched him, and in his breeches pocket I found this half-crown and this shilling, (producing them); they are the same which I had marked and given to Parker, they are good money; I found in his fob these two seven-shilling pieces.

               <p>Q. Any more what? - A. Bad gold; I told him to go and fetch three wholes, that is, business; three halves, that is, half-business; and three small ones, which were three seven-shilling pieces; he then went into the wash-house of the public-house, and took out three guineas, three half-guineas, and three seven-shillings pieces; he told me he supposed I would take them all; I told him I could not, as I had not enough about me to buy them; I then bought two half-guineas and two seven-shilling pieces; I gave two shillings and three-pence for each of the seven-shilling pieces, and three shillings and sixpence a-piece for the half-guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at those pieces? - A. These are the same.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know the money again that you gave him, if you should see it? - A. I should; Rogers, the officer, was in waiting for a signal which I gave him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. On the 10th of October a warrant was issued from the Public-office; the money I have in my hand I found upon the prisoner in his breeches pocket; the good money that I found upon him is a half-crown piece, two shillings, and a seven-shilling piece, which I had previously marked and given to Mead for the purpose of purchasing bad money, about an hour before I apprehended him.(Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Mead. This is the money that I gave the prisoner for the bad money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am entirely drawn into this snare by Rogers and Mead; they go about giving people money to trap others; I leave myself, my Lord and Gentlemen, to the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Q. What, in the street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew him to be Mr. Dames's servant? - A. Yes; the prisoner told me he had got some hogsheads, which he had purchased at the Court end of the town; I asked him whether they were grocer's hogsheads, he answered me, yes; he asked me if I would buy them of him, if he brought them to me; I told him, yes, if they were grocer's hogsheads, I would buy them of him; I saw no more of the prisoner till the third of this month, he came to the cooperage in Cable-street, and told me he had got the four hogsheads that he had informed me of; I asked him where they were, and he told me, in Church-lane, Whitechapel, that was on the Friday; he asked me if I would let the lad go with the truck to fetch them; if they were good, I was to give him five and sixpence for each cask; the lad went with him, and brought three hogsheads on the truck, and one was rolled by another lad that we employed for carrying out casks; when they came, I thought they were not grocer's hogsheads, and I saw no more of the prisoner after; I bought them for my brother, I am in his employ.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apply to Mr. Dames? - A. I meant to go to Mr. Dames, but he came to our cooperage.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after the hogsheads were left there? - A. I believe, about an hour; Mr. Dames saw the hogsheads, and had them back the next day.</p>

               <p>Q.The hogsheads that Mr. Dames had away - were they the same that you had received from the prisoner? - A. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the difference between a grocer's hogsheads, and your's? - A. In grocer's hogsheads, when sugar is turned out, there is some left in, but the refiners steam them, which makes them quite clean inside.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that there is no getting at his wood, without getting over a high wall? - A. A paling.</p>

               <p>Q. That must be worse for a drunken man to get over? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. No drunken man could get over that paling? - A. I should think not.</p>

             sworn. I am an apprentice to Mr. Sherwood.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of premises are these, where this wood was kept? - A. There is a paling, but a man might reach over, and take them out; I was called up by the watchman; I went to the watch-house, and looked at the boards; the man seemed very much in liquor; they were Mr. Sherwood's; I compared two of them the next morning with the others, and the knots and grain, and every thing matched.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any of them? - A. Yes; and some of the pegs were pulled out, by reaching over the paling.</p>

               <p>Q. What pegs? - A. Pieces of wood put in, to hold the boards up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr.Alley. Q. You did not see any body take away these boards? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How often do you take stock at your house? - A. Once a year.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not taken stock lately? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And it is only by comparison that you say these boards are your master's? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had seen one of these boards twenty miles off, you would not have known it was your master's? - A. Yes, if I had compared it.</p>

               <p>Q. But not without comparing it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sherwood. I have no doubt of their being my boards, from the appearance.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it possible for any person to reach these boards? - A. I have tried myself to-day, and cannot do it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been at a benefit club at Doctor's-commons, and had had two or three pipes of tobacco, which I am not used to, and drinking beer and punch, till I was so intoxicated, that I did not know where I went, or what I did, till I waked, and found myself in the watch-house in the morning.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290024"/>known him up to the present time for many years, and who all gave him an excellent character.</p>

            ; the prisoner was my servant, and has been a number of years; In consequence of information, I went with Mrs. Sallwood, and Mr. March, to Mr. Sabine's, the Crown and Anchor, in King's-head-court, Shoe-lane; we saw Mrs.Sabine; we went up into the prisoner's room, and on a sort of bedstead, we found a quantity of charts and maps; there was one of them that he had been at work upon, and another, that had rough edges, not in a state in which they are when they came to my shop; they were not trimmed round; they were damp, and appeared not to have been out of the warehouse two hours; these are the charts of the British channel, which are very large, and are folded up in a small compass; whereas those which come to my shop, are trimmed round the edge, and as smooth as marble, fit to show a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these charts, or any such, ever suffered by you to be taken to his lodgings? - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Would these charts, in the state before they are prepared for sale, be in that damp state? - A. No; they are always put upon the line to dry; here are live books of directions for sailing, which are printed for me, and which I believe to have been taken away from my warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not engage him to take work home for his wife and himself to do, for you? - A. Some time ago, I did, some few trisling charts; but never did I suffer any of these large charts any where, but in my own warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been in the country yourself; who conducted your business in your absence? - A. My partner, and his son.</p>

               <p>Q. What there conduct towards the prisoner might have been, you cannot say? - A. I am sure they would never suffer these sorts of charts to go out.</p>

               <p>Q. You have sold a vast number of these sort of things? - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you any doubt, from the appearance, and the view of these charts, that they are your's? - A. I am confident, in my own breast, that they are mine.</p>

            ; I keep the Crown and Anchor, in King's-head-court; the prisoner at the bar lodged in our house, and has done three months: On the 23d of October, Mr. March, Mrs Selwood, and Mr. Whittle, came to our house, and I shewed them up stairs, the prisoner had been home, and gone again; he went up, he had been gone again about a quarter of an hour; when I went up stairs, I saw these things found.</p>

               <p>Q. They were in his room? - A. Yes, upon a bed sacking, where there was no bed; and his great coat upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was what she said taken in writing? - A. I am not certain; the Magistrate granted a warrant or summons to apprehend the man; the man came, and from his appearance, answered every description she had given of him; and when he came, she said he was not the man.</p>

               <p>Pearson. These are my curtains.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I watched for a young man of the name of Thomas Johnson; he owed me six shillings; he called upon me, and asked me to lend him two shillings; he said,she could get a place in the Star printing-office; I told him, I could not; I pledged a petticoat of my own for four shillings, and I let him have the two shillings on the Saturday night; he said, he wanted some money to go to work on the Monday, and he brought me these things to pledged for him, which I did</p>

             sworn. - I keep a clothes-shop at Brenford: On Monday, the 21st of September, between nine and ten in the morning, the prisoner brought me a jacket and a coat, which I bought of him; I asked him if they were his own property, and he said his uncle had given them to him; he said, he was out of work at that time; I hung the jacket out for sale, at the door, and Mrs. Watkins came and claimed it; the prisoner came again, to ask me to buy something else, and I stopped him; he persisted in the same story, that his uncle had given them to him.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Watkins). Who left the house last, you or your wife? - A. I did; we left the house about half past nine, the night before, Sunday; it was dark then; I saw the windows all safe; we returned together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence? - A. Yes; a pane of glass was taken out, and the shutters were open; we returned on the Monday evening, between five and six o'clock.</p>

Beldam, and the Excise mark; and on the Sunday morning, the 5th, I missed one; I observed the bars of the window pulled out; then I went and got the key, and went into the kiln, and missed a whole bag, containing one hundred three quarters and ten pounds; I think they must have been cut asunder, for the bags were full big to get out at the window; there were some hops dropped under the window; and a pretty many on the out side; I traced them, by the hops, for about a mile and a half; I heard afterwards that they were at Hounslow, and I went there on Wednesday; I saw the hops at Brentford, and two of the pockets were put up in the same cloths that my hops were in; there were some bags turned inside out, and some marks upon them that I shall be able to ascertain them by.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat.(Counsel for Mills.)</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any other person concerned in the firm with you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that the hops you found were your hops? - A. By tracing them from the Kiln; and they are of the same quality and colour.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to hops? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. There were many others of the same quality and colour in your country? - A. Yes.</p>

             told me, he cut the bag in two; the first I saw of the hops was, on Fleet-pond Common, about three or four miles from Mr. Beldham's, as they told me, for I do not know where the place is; old Mr. Miles hired me, with two of my horses, to fetch them from the common; we changed the bags, and put them into others; they were not long enough to ride upon the horses; then they were put upon the horses, and we went on to old Miles's; they were all four together then; they were there all the Monday, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290032"/>on the Tuesday we took them up, and brought them in the cart to Brentford; there was a little bag sold at Staines, as nigh as I can recollect; the two prisoners sold it.</p>

               <p>Miles's defence. My father owed me three guineas, and he asked me to remove these hops; I did not know that they were stole, nor I do not now.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Fox-court, in a parallel line with the brewhouse: On the 26th of September; I saw Jones carry a great deal of timber out of the brewhouse; I have seen him and Clarke repeatedly, times without number, carrying wood away, and have reproved them many times; I did not take any particular notice when I saw them together; but I have seen Clarke on the premises on the 20th of September; they were joists, and large pieces of girders.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mr. Wade.) Mr. Wade, you have charged this as a joint taking, whereas the evidence is, that the one has taken at one time, and the other at another; you must now make your election against which you will go -</p>

               <p>Mr. Wade. I will go against Clarke, then.</p>

               <p>Evans. I saw Clarke, on the 20th of September, carrying timber out,of the brewhouse; some person inside handed it out, and he carried it away.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to have him apprehended? - A. There was nobody came forward to prosecute, nobody took notice of it; it was nobody's business.</p>

               <p>Q. The fall you speak of was accidental, was it not? - A. No; the girders were all sawed off close to the wall, and so let down by villainy.</p>

               <p>(Styles produces one of the pieces of timber found in the house in which Clarke worked.) I am certain this is one of the pieces that I marked; Clarke has claimed the horses that he cut the wood up upon; and that he tied the bundles up with; he claimed them himself at Hatton-garden, and had them from us.</p>

               <p>Clarke's defence. On the Ist of October the boys in the brewhouse were throwing stones, and to prevent their breaking my windows, I went into the brewhouse to drive them away (it is an open place and has been for these two years) when this gentleman came and laid hold of me; I have lived twenty-one years there, and never had a stain in my character.

             sworn. - I am a city-officer: On Monday the 13th of October, in consequence of a warrant, I went to the prisoner's apartments, in company with Mr. Canner, the marshal; in searching the bed-room, we found a little deal-box, which was locked; I called the wife of the prisoner; she could not find the key, and we broke the box open; on searching the box, we found a pair of silver buckles, a steel chain, a silver thimble, a gold ring, and a duplicate of a pair of silver buckles; I shewed the duplicate to Bridgen, got the buckles, and took them to Mr. Clarke, and he claimed them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How do you know they were his apartments? - A. His wife was there.</p>

             sworn. - I am a silver-manufacturer and jeweller: On the 9th of October, the prisoner brought this ring to me; he had, before the 9th, called, and told me it was a lady's ring that was pawned for a guinea and a half; it is a pearl ring; he said, he was to give half-a-guinea<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290035"/>for the ticket; and, on the 9th, he came, and said, I should have it for two guineas and a half; I told him I would give him two pounds ten shillings; on the Monday following, I went to Mr. Clarke's, and he claimed the ring.</p>



               <p>Q.(To Mr. Clarke.) Does any body know where the prisoner lived? - A. Yes, I myself.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Tipper). Where did you get these articles that you have produced? - A. From a barber's shop upon Snow-hill, opposite St. Sepulchre's-church; I do not think there is any number to it.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the City-marshals: At the time the prisoner was taken to the Compter, he told me that his lodgings were at a hair-dresser's shop, at the top of Snow-hill, and I went with Tipper, according to his directions, to the first house on the left-hand, opposite the church-yard, where I saw a woman, who answered to his name, and I understood was his wife; he told me the person's name that kept the house, but I have forgot it.</p>

               <p>(All the property was deposed to by the prosecutor, having his private shop-mark upon them, except the ring and the tumbler).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have a pretty extensive business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it, when you sell things, you do not take off the shop-mark? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Therefore, I might have a ring with your mark to it, which I might have very honestly come by? - A. You might, if you bought one at my shop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Clarke came to me at the Compter, and said, he would shew me all the lenity that he could, if I confessed every transaction, which I did; Mr. Dawson has been a great deal more to blame than me; he has asked me many times for patterns of things, and he has influenced me very much. <rs id="t18001029-51-verdict287" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a watchman belonging to the India-Company: On Saturday, the 25th of this month, I was upon my station at Cutter's-street, New-street, Bishopsgate-street, to protect a house under repair, belonging to the East-India Company; the prisoner was a labourer, working under the plaisterer to the Company; between five and six o'clock on Saturday last, in the evening, I observed the prisoner coming into the building, and suspecting that he had something about him which he ought not, I stopped him, and asked him what he had got about him; I then called for assistance, and desired him to unbutton, and he unbuttoned the bottom of his waistcoat, and there was some lead concealed, which dropped; I called for the constable; when he came, I gave him charge of the prisoner, and he was taken to the Compter, where I delivered the lead to the constable; on the Monday morning, I went with the foreman of the plumbers to the building, and found the lead fitted.</p>

               <p>- FRANCIS sworn. - I am a constable, (produces the lead); I was called to the assistance of Mr. Burgin; I took the prisoner into custody in Bishopsgate-street; Mr. Burgin had a piece of lead in his hand, which he delivered to me at the Compter; I searched the prisoner, and under his waistcoat I found another piece; he wore an apron, which helped to keep it up; the prisoner said he was very sorry for what he had done; on the Monday following, I went with the foreman, and Mr. Burgin, to the premises; we took the lead with us, and searched round the building to see where the lead was missing; there was one side like a closet, and a leaden pipe ran down by the side of it; we matched these pieces, and they fitted; it appears to have been broken off very lately.</p>

               <p>- FOSTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am foreman to the plumber, employed by the East-India Company; I went to compare this lead with the premises, and found it sit as high as possible; it was broke off, but what was taken from the prisoner is not enough to make good the deficiency.</p>

               <p>Robinson.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordship; and you Gentlemen of the Jury. At the time this happened, I was very much distressed indeed, having been seven weeks in the hospital; after my deliver ance from there, I endeavoured to get an honest situation, during which time I was under the necessity of pledging my watch and wearing apparel; and I solemnly declare, that for three days previous to this I had not eat any victuals; Mr. Born offered me to serve his Majesty by land or sea, and an application was made for that purpose, but I was found too old for service; I throw myself upon your Lordship's mercy to inflict what punishment you please upon me.</p>

I am a furniture-printer in Tavistick-street; I have supplied Mr. Snell with printed furniture for some time: On the 6th of October, in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Jones's, and there I saw a remnant in his window, a yard and three quarters of a new pattern, of which I had sold four or five pieces to Mr. Snell.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you sold any of it to any other person? - A. I had only sold one other piece, which is properly accounted for.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you mean to swear positively you had sold no more? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>- JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a piece-broker in Wych-street; Mr. Ovey applied to me; I delivered to him some pieces of furniture, which I had bought of a woman.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You do not know the prisoner? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any promises or threats made use of? - A. No; this piece of ticking I found under the bed; it is four yards of striped linen.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an upholsterer, in Hanover-street, Long-acre; the prisoner was my foreman; I trusted and reposed every thing in him; he had a guinea and a half a week, besides the liberty of making any thing at over hours, which amounted in all, I am sure, to more than a hundred guineas a year; I went to his house, and found these things, which Carpmeal has produced; they are all my property; this piece, found at Jones's, is also mine; I was present in the room when he acknowledged his guilt, and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a voluntary confession? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of these articles being your property? - A. No more than of my own existence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever suffer him, or give him authority, to take such articles home? - A. No; he did work for me at over hours, but never such things as these; I had not the smallest suspicion of him till the morning before. <rs id="t18001029-62-verdict349" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Price. I can speak to them from the pattern, having had them in the house a number of years, and likewise from the private mark; I cannot say whose mark it is, it was put on so many years ago.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, I met a young man of my acquaintance about six or seven weeks ago, near Temple-bar, and, after some conversation, he told me he wanted a pair of silver buckles, and desired me to get him a pair; he told me not to get them of my master, but of some workman; I let it elapse for some time, and, on last Wednesday evening, Mr. Price and the shop man were up stairs at tea, I went to the glass case, where I was authorized to go, and took out these two pair of buckles; I put them in my inside coat pocket; I took out one of the buckles to give it a rub with a leather, and the shopman, coming down stairs,observed me put it in my pocket again, but he took no notice of it, and, in the morning, the constable was sent for; I locked the coat up in my box, in order to keep it clean; I told him, they were to shew a young man, and if he had chosen the buckles, I should have asked Mr. Price what he would have let my friend have them for; I am extremely sorry that I did not apprize Mr. Price that the young man wanted a pair of buckles first.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Price.) Q. Before he opened his box, did he say any thing about having buckles there? - A. No, he did not; I did not understand him to have said any thing before the box was opened.</p>

               <p>Thompson. He said, before I searched his pocket, that there was something there which was not his own, but was Mr. Price's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Price. I had a very good character with him. <rs id="t18001029-63-verdict355" type="verdictDescription">

I am a labourer, servant to Mr. Summers: On Sunday, the 19th of October, I went to fetch the cows out of the field, between five and six o'clock in the morning; I saw a tall man go out of the foot-path to the other side of the field, with something under his right arm; he went to the hedge, and then he got into the ditch, and then he returned to the foot-path; he had no parcel with him then; and then he came within fifty or sixty yards of me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he near enough for you to see his face?</p>

               <p>- A. No; I went home, and milked the cows; after that, I went to the ditch, and found a goose dead, with the feathers on; I then returned to my master, and acquainted him of it; I left the goose on the same spot; then my master went to look at it, and I know no more of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What situation of life are you in? - A. A hair-dresser.</p>

               <p>Q. You were employed, I take it, to carry on this business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That is, in plain English, you laid down your trade of hair-dresser, and took up the trade of entrapping this man into the commission of a crime that he would not have committed, if you had not entrapped him? - A. I did it for the good of the public, that he might be detected, and brought to justice; I am not a common informer.</p>

               <p>Q. It was for the purpose of prosecuting, that you did this? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. Between seven and eight at night.</p>

               <p>Q. That is just about the time that poor people go to the public-house to refresh themselves with a pint of beer, after they have done work? - A. Some may.</p>

               <p>Q. How many people were in the public-house? - A. I do not know that any body was there, except Horne and me, and another man or so.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear there were not several people there? - A. I think I saw one; I was in a separate box from the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted, a waiter attends there? - A. The landlord brought in the beer.</p>



               <p>Q. How was the bar situated? - A. In the passage.</p>

               <p>Q. Commanding a view of the top-room? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that a publican would have this beer in such a situation, that he could not have a view of the tap-room? - A. He could see but a very small part of it.</p>

               <p> Q. Had you any other money in your pocket, besides the sixpence? - A. I had another.</p>

               <p> Q. Was it by accident, or design, that you pulled out that sixpence? - A. By accident.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any halfpence? - A. I had three or four pennyworth; I cannot say exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. What did your beer come to? - A. We had had three pints, and I paid for all of them, and Horne said, he would be a pints.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any boy here to prove this conversation, but yourself? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He said, he was the real maker; are you sure that was the particular expression? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, if that was the expresion you used before the Lord-Mayor? - A. It was, that he was the real maker.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any more than that he was the maker, omitting the word real-</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Where is the difference? He might have said it, and they not put it down; it certainly is not in the deposition.</p>

Yes, in Elim-court, Fetter-lane: On Monday, the 20th of October, I apprehended him at the door of the Swan public-house, in Fetter-lane;I, after that, went to his house, in company with Mason and Clarke, leaving the prisoner in custody with Armstrong and Vickery; I knocked at the door on the left, below stairs, and enquired for Horne; I received information which room he in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290044"/>habited; I went up stairs, in company with Mason and Clarke; when I got up stairs, Mrs. Horne was just coming out of the room that I had been directed to; I knew her very well; I asked her name; she told me her name was,Baresford, I think, or some such name, though I knew her person perfectly well, and knew her to be Mrs. Horne; I immediately laid hold of her, and said, we must search your apartments; says she, we have got none here; I knocked at a door fronting of her's, upon the same floor; a woman came to the door, and I asked her, in the presence of Mrs. Horne, which was Mrs. Horne's apartments; she said, why that is Mrs. Horne's apartments, which was the room I saw her coming out of; we took her into that room, and proceeded to search the chest of drawers, and, in the top-drawer, I think, I found nineteen shillings, and twenty-two sixpences; they are all base, and sit for circulation; they were wrapped up in a paper, screwed up; I opened them, Mrs. Horne stood close by; I informed her, that her husband was in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not tell us what she said? - A. In the window was a white mustard-pot, and three or four phials; while we were making a farther search, Mrs. Horne had shifted herself from the place where they were standing; I turned round, and she was gone; I ran down stairs after her, and she was then returning out of a yard from the privy; I immediately laid hold of her, and desired Clarke to come down stairs; I got a light, looked down the privy, and took up a mustard-pot, the soil being very near the top; it laid upon the surface of the soil; it was the same kind of mustard-pot I had seen in the room by the phials.</p>

               <p>Q.From this, its appearance, do you believe it to be the same? - A. I really do; when I went up stairs, I missed the mustard-pot that I had before seen; I was present when Clarke found two files, and, in the teeth of the files, were some fresh filedust, that had been apparently used for filing white metal.</p>

               <p>Q. You are acquainted a good deal with this kind of business; were those the sort of files used by persons in the business of coining? - A. They were; Mason has got the mustard-pot, and Clarke the files.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these coins in the same state now, that they were when you found them? - A. I believe they are.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. All the coin that you found, you have now produced? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.When you have apprehended persons for this sort of offence, have you not generally found some in the process, and some in perfection? - A. Sometimes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any file-dust? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you find any thing fixed upon which coiners usually work? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q.Neither did you find any grease, aqua-fortis, or corks? - A. No further than I found in the mustard-pot.</p>

               <p> Q. You do not mean to say you saw any aquafortis in that mustard-pot? - A. No; I did not see what was in the mustard-pot.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am one of the marshalmen of the City of London; I was with Ray; I was directed, by a warrant from the Lord-Mayor, to search the prisoner's apartments, in Elim-court, Fetter-lane; I was with Ray when he found the base metal that has been produced from that room; I went to another room, where there was only a door and partition divided one from the other; I searched the beds; there were two in the room; I found nothing there, but in searching a little box that stood by the wall, I found these two files, (producing them); they are now in the same state in which they were when I found them; the first that I saw of the mustard-pot, was on the table, in the middle of the room; it was a white mustard-pot.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see it in the window? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Ray. I put the mustard-pot upon the table, after I had brought it up stairs.</p>

               <p>Clarke. There was a liquid in it, that appeared to be like a thick cream; I could compare it to nothing else.(Peter Mason produced the mustard-pot).</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I went to the apartment of the prisoners, while the officers were there.</p>

               <p>Q. You have had a great deal of experience in this business; are files of this description necessary to finish base coin that is put into circulation? - A. I should believe this had been used to file the edges of the counterfeit money, or blanks, before it comes to money.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these files? - A. The dust appears to be a composition of brass and copper, and other metals mixed together, of which blanks are genenerally made.</p>


               <p>Q. Have those blanks any silver in them; or are they made of other metal? - A. Sometimes; this mustard-pot was produced before the Lord-Mayor on the 21st of October; and to shew his Lordship what it would effect, I rubbed it over that farthing,(producing it), which I have had ever since; it was a good copper farthing that I had in my pocket; it is done by the finger and thumb, without the necessity of using aqua-fortis. (The witness shewed the Jury the experiment upon a halfpenny).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that if a composition, in which there is any silver, is used, they make use of aquafortis, in order to bring that silver to the surface? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290045"/>Q. But is this mixture of that description, or not? - A. No; I should think this mixture would do it in an easier way; it produces an uncommon strong colour, is sooner done, and does not subject the hands of the people who work, to be discoloured; aqua-fortis will always make their nails yellow, and their hands, as if they had been using uncommon dye; and, if thrown down, when you go into a room, you must perceive the smell.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you whether this mixture is calculated to produce a colour resembling silver upon any blanks? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You never saw this mustard-pot, till Ray, the officer, brought it up? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. If you put your finger into aqua-fortis, you would feel it burn? - A. Yes, undoubtedly, if it was not killed; but whatever composition has been put to this, it has killed it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am one of the moniers of his Majesty's mint.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that parcel in brown paper? - A. They are all counterfeits, both the shillings and sixpences; there is not one good one among them.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Raine. (To Armstrong). Q. Look at these shillings; the monier of the Mint has told us they are counterfeits; how does it appear to you to have been done? - A.(Scrapes one of them). This appears to be of a copperish cast.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it appear to have been a blank of base metal? - A. It does.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say how that surface has been produced? - A. If you please, I will try it. (Tries it).</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that that surface has been produced upon a blank of base metal, by rubbing that composition upon it? - A. I should believe so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I take it for granted, if there is a small portion of silver in base metal, dipping it in aqua-fortis will drive that to the surface? - A. Certainly; the people who are in the habit of doing this kind of business;some make them out of a metal which costs more money, and therefore they sell them at a certain price; but these are, what are called in the trade, fig-shillings, worked by the finger and thumb.</p>

               <p>Q. You are not able to ascertain, merely by scratching off the surface, whether it is done by that mixture, or by aqua-fortis? - A. I should believe this to be a solution of silver, aqua-fortis, and salt, killed, on purpose for them to work it without putting it into that pickle, which would be too strong for this kind of metal.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man in the apartment?</p>

               <p>- A. Never; I have seen him once or twice coming down stairs, upon the stair-case.</p>

               <p>Q. How often have you met him? - A. I may have seen him as many times as three, but I was not conscious that he was my tenant; she has had in six or seven weeks; she paid me weekly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Lilly.white). Q. Did you happen to have any conversation with the man-prisoner at the bar, upon the subject of where he lived? - </p>

               <p>A. No; I never knew where he lived.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Armstrong). Q. Do you remember wiling the prisoner about his wife being taken into custody? - A. When she was brought into the Swan that same evening, where he was left, he said, don't take my wife, you have got me, she is my wife; I said, she must go; upon that, they were both taken to jail.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the man-prisoner saying any thing about the things that were found in the room? - A. Yes; he said the files were what he used in doing shoes, and the crucibles were what he put paste in.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you, or your brother officers, before him, said where the things were found? - A. He knew we were gone to his room.</p>

               <p>Ray. The landlord of the Swan directed us to his house; he said, he would go and shew the officers where he lived; the prisoner was present at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the landlord say, in the hearing of the prisoner, where the apartment was? - A. No, not in my hearing; he went with us, and shewed us the house.</p>

            's defence. Last Wednesday was a fortnight, a person came to me of the name of Jones, and asked me to be so good as to go and get him half a piece of goods; he told me, it would be of great service to him, his wife being in trouble, and he should get something by it; accordingly, I went to the White Swan, in Fetter-lane, with him; when I went in, there was a gentleman that he called his friend, who had come from Portmouth; he said, that he kept the two Blue Posts, at Portsmouth; that he was a man I could trust, and not be afraid of him; accordingly, this Portsmouth gentleman gave me half-a-guinea; they said, how long should I be gone; I told them, about an hour; I came back in that time, and brought the things, and gave them to them; then they drank,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290046"/>and paid the reckoning, and went to the King's Arms, upon Holborn-hill; there we had beer and spirituous liquors, till it got into my head; I gave Jones four shillings out of it, and had but sixpence for myself; we made an agreement to meet the next Monday, at the White Swan, in Fetter-lane; There I met the man, and he gave me half-a-guinea, and I went to fetch the goods, part I brought with me, and part I left behind, and then I was taken.</p>

             keeps the house; he lives in the house; I live in the one pair of stairs frontroom; I went out between two and three in the afternoon; my husband was at work; I left nobody in the room; I turned the key in the lock, and put the key in my pocket; I returned between five and six in the evening, and found the door safe, as I left it; I met a woman on the stairs, with a bundle in her lap; she passed me, and asked me for a strange name; my landlord stood at the door, and had some suspicion; I missed a sheet from off a large bible, on a table, in my room, a white gown, and my long red cloak; I heard no more of my things till five weeks afterwards; I heard that a woman was taken up.</p>



               <p>Q. Do you know if the woman that you passed was the prisoner? - A. I cannot say, for I took no notice of her; I had no suspicion; I went to Pancras watch- house, and there I owned my sheet, that was on Wednesday the 15th of October; and, the same evening, my landlord went with me to Marlborough-street, where I saw the prisoner with my red cloak on; I said, it was my cloak, and a young man took it from her; she said, she brought the cloak from Bristol with her; I told her it was my cloak, I could swear to it; the said, if it was my cloak, they must have changed it where she had been the night before; I attended the Monday following, and swore to my cloak; the sheet was delivered to me at the same time, (produces it); Lovett has got the cloak.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at all about your premises? - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. Was there no violence done to the door? - </p>

               <p>A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the door could only have been opened by a key? - A. I do not know how she got them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure these things were in the room when you went out? - A. I am certain of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the house when you went out?</p>

               <p>Q. Then you cannot swear how it was directed? - A. No; he told me I must put it into the wheel-barrow, and wheel it to the corner of Mrs. Froome's, near Dowgate-dock; I wheeled the barrow with the trufs in it, and then the soldier took it away, and I saw no more of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the soldier after that? - A. Not till he was in the Poultry Compter.</p>

               <p>Q.What time of the day was it taken away? - A. About four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.What was it the man touched you upon the shoulder in the public-house for? - A. There was no such thing done.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not three other soldiers in the public-house besides me? - A. No, there were not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the public-house at all? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was that before you wheeled the trufs away, or after? - A. Before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was taken to work upon Mr. Young's wharf, precisely at ten o'clock, on the 29th of September; I worked upon the wharf till two o'clock, when I requested to be paid off, on account of some business I had to do for the regiment; he paid me off, and another soldier at the same time; upon being paid off, I went to the public-house, with that identical soldier, and had some porter; I waited for my serjeant a considerable time, when a man employed me to carry a basket for him to the Saracen's-head, Snow-hill, and he himself carried a box; he gave me sixpence, and a pint of porter, it was then five o'clock; I then went from there to No. 71, Great Peter's-street, where I live, and went to bed, when I was awaked between ten and eleven o'clock, with a thundering noise at the door, and I was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him upwards of seven years, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have been eighteen years in the regiment.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they of any value? - A. No; there were twenty-four that resembled the current coin of this country; I asked him if they were of a good colour and found, and he said, they were as good as I had last, if not better; then I was for coming away; I chucked down a sixpence to pay for the reckoning; Horne said that sixpence would be a good one for a pattern; I said, yes, it was a large one; he said, it was large, but any time that I met with a sixpence, or a shilling, that I liked, to send it to him, and he would cast me the pattern; then we came out, and when we came to the door, I gave a signal, which the officers understood; Horne was immediately secured, taken back into the same house, and searched; the money that I received from the prisoner, I delivered to Armstrong, exactly as I received it from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Powell? - A. The solicitor for his Majesty's Mint; I had of the prisoner, the first time, some bad silver for a good half-guinea.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>The learned Recorder having summed up the evidence in the above case, proceeded to the following effect:</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, With respect to the kind of testimony that you have heard in this case, which differs from all others, it is of the utmost importance that you should watch it with an eagle's eye: for, as it strikes me, this crime could not have had its existence, but for a preconcerted plan laid by these witnesses, as they all acted under the direction of Mr. Powell, and were all looking to the same object, of fixing this man with this crime; it is necessary, that what they say, should be very closely examined: for indisputably you cannot but feel that, having the same view, to say no more of it, they must have a very strong bias. Upon the first transaction, you find that there was a regular information taken, and why that should be abandoned to follow up another, which has been imagined and planned by those who have carried it into execution, I am at a loss of conceive. Gentlemen, this method of prosecuting, to say the best of it, is certainly novel. I think, I can recollect persons being prosecuted without the testimony of persons sent from the Mint, for the purpose of soliciting the commission of the offence, without that sort of trap, and that sort of contrivance; however, it is for you to say, whether you can have such a reliance upon the kind of testimony that has been given, as to pronounce a verdict of guilty, which might be followed up by a counter-plea; and, in that case, the prisoner would have to answer for the offence with his life. Gentleman, it happened to me, not a long time ago, to report a prisoner to the King, exactly in that situation; that prisoner had been convicted, and afterwards, upon the counter-plea, was reported to his Majesty, but it was the King's pleasure, in Council, though that prisoner was a notorious offender, that his life should be spared; I afterwards had a conference out of the Council, with the first law-officer in the country, the Lord Chancellor, who was of opinion, that it would have been a dangerous precedent, indeed, to deprive a man of his life for an offence which would not have had an existence, if he had not been solicited to commit that offence by the persons who were the witnesses against him; the Lord Chancellor requested me to take the first opportunity of declaring, that he was of opinion with me, that prisoners ought to be prosecuted for this, as well as other offences, in the usual way, and that he did not approve of prosecuting men, by traps of this sort; upon the whole, he was of opinion, though the crime was greatly injurious to society, that this mode of prosecution had better be spared. I have, therefore, not been singular in my opinion; if I was convinced I was wrong, I would instantly give it up; but it is my duty to state, that it is his opinion, and that it is mine, and if the remedy, by the usual mode of prosecution, is not sufficient, an application may be made to the Legislature; in short, if this mode of prosecution is to be carried on in one instance, on account of the difficulty of detecting the crime, it may be considered as a proper thing to be carried on in others, and the only reason that I have heard asserted, has been the difficulty of detection. It has often been said, that these sort of cases are very much like the case of servants robbing their masters, where the money is marked before the felony is committed; but I do not think it is, at all, that case; it does not fix the offence upon any particular servant; it is only the means, after the robbery is committed, of detecting who the robber is; the circumstance of the master putting it into the till, is only the mode of detecting the offender, not an inducement to the offence. It appears to me, notwithstanding all that has been suggested, that the means may be found of prosecuting upon an original information, in the same manner, that all other prosecution are conducted; it is my bounden duty to support all prosecutions that are brought forward in the ordinary and common mode; but it is not only my opinion, but that of the first law authority in this country, that these sort of prosecutions should be spared.</p>



               <p>I have now done my duty; I leave the whole case with you; if you are satisfied that, upon this evidence, the prisoner is guilty, you will say so; if you have any reasonable doubt, you will acquit him.</p>
