I am secretary to the Park Lane Company (Limited)—it was established in 1865—it is their business to receive horses on their premises, and sell them by private contract and by auction—we charge the customers the expenses of the keep, the auction fee, and advertisement—I have been in the Company's service five years—in August, 1868, the prisoner came into the service at a salary of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week as clerk, accountant, and cashier—his salary was after increased, and, in May, 1871, there was an agreement in writing—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed by me on behalf of the Company and by the defendant—(<hi rend="italic">By this agreement the prisoner was to be clerk and accountant at a salary of </hi>3<hi rend="italic">. a-week</hi>)—the prisoner continued in the Company's service up to July last year—in June he had a three months' notice to leave—before the notice expired he was directed not to attend at the Company's premises—when a horse is sent in there is an entry made in what we call the voucher-book—this is it—I know the prisoner's writing—this entry dated 21st August is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "No. 5054 (that is the number of the voucher), 21st August, 1871,—Gentlemen, I hereby authorise you to sell for me by auction or privately, subject to conditions of sale exhibited on your premises, the following pro<lb/>perty: chestnut gelding for fifty guineas—G.

               <p>happened that he was in our debt—I don't know whether it was money that he had paid out of his own pocket; I only know it so stands in the books—the books show what those disbursements were for—there is "General expenses, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., brooms, railway fare on horse, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., police<lb/>man one day, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." and so on—here is an entry at page 258 in the handwriting of one of the clerks while I was secretary—"Ordered that the secretary exercise his discretion as regards the petty allowances usual in the trade on the sale and purchase of horses by private contract"—I don't quite understand that—it is dated March, 1868; I can only say that I never did exercise my discretion about it—I don't know what allowances it refers to; I don't at all understand what it means—I might have understood it at the time, but I don't now—I don't know what it alludes to in the slightest degree—petty allowances may mean bribes to grooms—I can only say that I never bribed anybody and never authorised it—I never acted upon any such instructions—I am not aware that it was left to Holloway's discretion, or the prisoner's; I never left it to them—they were certainly not sanctioned to carry out that minute—I don't know whether it was ever carried out; not by my authority—if it was carried out, I don't know that it would be by the prisoner—General Campbell was in the chair when that minute was passed—I am not aware whether he is here—he was at the Police Court—the other directors who were present were H. B. Garling, Esq., and L. N. Bonner, Esq.; they are not directors now—there were no usual Board days—I summoned them by a circular, not on my own mere motion, but on the approval of one or more directors who happened to be present—they called incidentally, and I asked them to come—if there was anything which the directors who called thought a Board was required for, I then summoned them, and I sometimes did it of my own accord—Hollo way is here—it is not true that the Board meet when I think it necessary to summon them—I have not sworn that—I heard after the prisoner left us that he started a rival establishment—I did not say at the Police Court that but for that I never would have prosecuted him.</p>

By cash, S.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were no payments made with the full authority of the Company and with my knowledge that were expressly directed to be kept out of the books—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which appears not to have been entered was certainly not kept out of the books with my knowledge and concur-rence—payments were not made to Holloway or to the prisoner to meet expenses they had been put to in payments for grooms which have been suppressed from the accounts, not in any one instance—payments have not been made to Holloway on that account with my knowledge; never—I mean to assert that Holloway has not been paid sums of money which are not entered in any book—I am not aware of any such payments, or any orders from myself to that effect—sums were not allowed to be deducted out of payments that otherwise ought to have been made by the servants of the establishment; certainly not—not to my knowledge or by my orders—it has not occurred 30 or 40 times with Holloway, to my knowledge—I can't give you any explanation of that minute—I only tell you what I said before, that I never acted upon that minute, and had forgotten it ever existed—I have a minute directing this prosecution—Captain Durrant is the person now interested in this concern—he is not mortgagee; his father is—Captain Durrant is not the person who instituted this prosecution—I did not go with Captain Durrant to his own private solicitors—we did not go together nor meet together—Messrs. Bailey are his solicitors—I did not go to them at all, or send for them—I had a communication with them by letter—I did see them at Mr. Poland's office—that was before the case was on—we paid our liabilities out of our bank balance—if we were overdrawn at the bank it was by a guarantee of the directors—we took the sales money because it was at our banker's—I am the secretary, and I have to guard against responsibility—I can't take upon myself to order everything of that sort.</p>

I am in the employment of this Company, and have been so about six years—during four years of that time the prisoner has been in the Company's employ—when sales of horses take place I enter them in the order-book, and they are afterwards entered in the sales-book—the amount that the horse fetched and the commission charged would be in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant at Swansea—on 11th April last I received by post a letter, of which this is a copy; it is signed "John Harvey"—(<hi rend="italic">This stated, "1 have received an inquiry from my nepheu at Dieppe for best steam coal, please favour me with your lowest prices</hi>")—In reply to that I wrote, "I am in receipt of your letter of yesterday; the price of best steam is 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; your order shall receive attention"—I wrote on 16th April, saying that I wanted cash unless the hill was approved—I was not satisfied with the way they proposed paying me—in reply to a letter saying that I wanted to he satisfied as to the means of payment, I received a reference to Messrs. Thompson &amp; Co., of 61, Watling Street—I wrote to them, and subsequently received a reply from them stating that John Harvey was a respectable man—I knew a firm of Thompson &amp; Co., and I was under the impression it was the same firm, until I came here after-wards—I then agreed to ship the cargo—I thought it would be more satis-factory to have a personal interview, and I wrote to John Harvey to make arrangements for an interview—I have since ascertained that John Harvey was John Garner—this is the letter I wrote: "Telegram received: Will meet you at Herman's Hotel on Friday"—when I got to Kennan's Hotel I met a person who called himself Johnson, the brother-in-law of John Harvey—in consequence of his own conversation, and from what he said to me, I have since found out that Johnson, who represented himself to be John Harvey's brother-in-law, was, in point of fact, John Harvey, and really John Garner—there was no such man as John Harvey—we spoke of the manner of the shipment and how payment should be made—I told him I would not part with the bills of lading until I had security or the money—he regretted very much John Harvey being from home, and he produced a letter signed "John Harvey," to show that he had full authority to act for him—the day of the appointment was the 17th May—the letter stated, "Whatever arrangements you make with my brother-in-law will be binding on my part, John Harvey"—I concluded I was dealing with Johnson, and that Johnson was the brother-in-law of Harvey—after some conversation he took out a cheque for something like 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "I have a cheque here for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is not endorsed by John Harvey; I have no authority to give it up; I can't part with it; I will tell you what I will do; I have some good bills at home, and if you like I will let you have those as collateral security," and he subsequently wrote on a piece of paper, at my request, "I hand you the following acceptances as collateral security for cargo per <hi rend="italic">Cumberland</hi>"—he signed that "John Harvey"—I expressed surprise that the writing was the same as Harvey's, and he told me that although Harvey was a most respectable man, he had had no education, and that he did all his correspondence; that it was perfectly straightforward, and I should find the whole transaction an honourable one, or words to that effect—I asked him the name of the person he wanted the coals for, and he said "John Hart, his nephew at Rouen," and I wrote the name down in the letter at the time—he said John Harvey was a respectable man, a man well off, and had heavy contracts under Government—he left me for a short time to obtain the bills he had at his house—he returned in about an hour afterwards, and handed me the acceptances, three or four in number—after</p>

               <p>looking at them, I asked him if they were legitimate bills, and he said quite so; that they were trade bills—he said that Freeman, whose name was or one of them, was a Government contractor—one of the bills was for 178<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., signed John Harvey, addressed to Mr. Henry Poore, payable at the London and County Bank, Hackney Branch; another, accepted by John Freeman, Government contractor, payable at the London and Provin-cial Bank; and the third was payable at the Bank of England—there was another bill, accepted by a man named Standing, which I received at Swansea—I took the first three to my bankers, and asked them to make inquiries before placing them to my credit—I was not satisfied with any of the bills—I wanted to see John Harvey again, and I made a second appoint-ment with him at Kennan's Hotel—I went there with Sergeant Peck, and he concealed himself—I saw a man who represented himself to be Buckley—I had some conversation with him—he regretted the absence of John Harvey, who, he said, was at Hull, and Johnson, who was at Sunderland—he said he had full authority to act—he said he was a coal merchant at Chalk Farm, and he represented Harvey to be a very respectable man, and Johnson also—we had some conversation, and the result was that I desired him to telegraph to Harvéy, and if he did not return I was to have a tele-gram from him—not receiving the telegram, and Buckley not making an appearance, I started for Dieppe that evening at 7 o'clock—I went first to the ship and saw the captain, and found there were only a few tons out of her—the same morning I went to the broker's, De la Rue, and had some conversation with him, and Hart was sent for—before that I went to Mr. Le Prate, who was the purchaser of the cargo from John Hart, and received the bills of lading and the sale-note from him—the prisoner came to Mr. De la Rue's office—this is the document that was handed to me by Le Prate, it is a sale to him by John Hart—my invoice price was 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the coals were sold to Le Prate for 202<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I showed Hart the bill of lading, and asked him what he knew about it, how he got possession of it—he said he got it from John Harvey—I said "Are you aware that that cargo is stolen?"—he said "No; I have bought the cargo of John Harvey, and the cargo is mine"—I said "I don't wish to charge you with stealing it, but I must ask you to give possession, as it was stolen"—he said "No, I shall not give possession; I cannot, because I have borrowed money on the bills of lading; I borrowed 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Spratt, who is a shoemaker in Eleanor Street, Hackney Road"—I pressed him, and Mr. De la Rue pressed him, to give possession of the bills of lading—I said, "Where is John Harvey?"—he hesitated, and said he was not in Dieppe—I asked him then where John Garner was, as I had ascertained from Mr. De la Rue that he was staying at the hotel with Hart—I asked him to fetch John Garner—he went away and came back again in a few minutes, and said that John Garner had left that morning for Rouen, and he declined to give 'me the bill of lading or the possession of the cargo—I went to Hilton's Hotel at Dieppe—I asked the landlord for the visitors' book, and found the two names of John Garner and John Hart together—John Garner was in the same handwriting as that of John Harvey—I went again to the hotel about 10 o'clock, and found John Garner in bed—that was after Hart had told me he had gone to Rouen—I had some difficulty in waking him until I put a candle to his nose—I asked him whether he knew me—I called him Johnson—he hesitated for some time, and then said he did know me—I asked him if he was going to hand me over the money for the cargo—he said he could not do that—I desired him not to move</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187303030018"/>
               <p>from there for twenty-four hours, thinking he would leave by the boat at night—I went on board, but did not find him there when we got to England, but he came two or three days afterwards, and he was taken into custody and tried—I left Hart behind—I afterwards received this letter from him: "25th January. Dear Sir,—I have been in London some time looking for a situation, which I am promised next month. Since obtaining the above, I have been informed that there is in the hands of the police a warrant for them to take me into custody, in connection with the coals; I can only say I am innocent, which I believe you know, although I am sorry for what I have done. I have lost all my money, and find my wife and children starving. I hope you will allow me to earn my living and Bupport my family; if not, I am willing to go before any Jury, but I hope you will spare me the trouble and disgrace. An answer will greatly oblige, J. Hart."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I arrived at Dieppe I saw Mr. De la Rue, the broker—he sent for John Hart, and he came at ones—I said, "Is your name John Hart?" and he said, "Yes"—he was asked where Garner was, and he said he had left that morning for Rouen—I told him that I believed he was John Harvey, and that he was a swindler, and that he had swindled me out of a cargo of coal—I also said I hoped he, John Hart, had nothing to do with it—Hart said he had purchased the coals of John Harvey—I dare say I said, "He is your uncle"—Hart said, "No, I have never seen him but twice before"—he said Garner was a friend of his, and was staying with him at Hilton's Hotel till that morning—I pointed out Freeman's signature to him on the bill of exchange, and said I believed it was his—he said it was not—I asked him who endorsed the bill of lading—he said John Harvey, and that he believed it was done in Dieppe—I told him I knew Garner as Johnson, and that Garner had admitted he wrote the letters as Harvey—he said he knew nothing of that, that he had purchased the cargo of Harvey, and had sold it to Messrs. Verdu and Le Prate—I told him he had sold the coals at 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than they cost, and I believe he said he knew nothing of that—I then went to Hilton's Hotel, where I saw Garner in bed—Hart said he had borrowed a sum of money of Mr. Spratt, on account of the cargo, before he could get possession of the bills of lading, that was in part payment of the coal—Garner's name was not used in the matter at all; it was Harvey all the time—everything the prisoner said was apparently open, and straight<lb/>forward—I went several times to Hilton's, but it was at 10 o'clock at night I found Garner in bed—it was from 8 to 10 in the morning that I saw Hart—I could not find Garner all day.</p>

I am a grocer, and live in Park Place, Kilburn, in the Parish of Willesden—on Thursday night, 24th January, about 11. 50, I went to bed leaving everything safe and shut up, as far as I can remember—about 5 o'clock in the morning I was awoke by the constable, and came down—I found that the house had been broken into through the closet window on the ground-floor—that had been all right at night, I believe—I found the front door open; that must have been opened from the inside—there was a chair in the passage, which had been taken out of the parlour, and used in unbolting the door—I missed two overcoats, a jacket, a shawl, two scarves, a pair of trousers with four copper coins in the pocket, a pouch, a meersohaum pipe, and a shirt—I have since seen the whole of the property, with the exception of an overcoat—the value of the articles is about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Buckler, of Fenchurch Street, the attorney for the prosecution—these telegrams to the prisoner may have been sent from our office, but not by me, I do not know them—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced by the prisoner</hi>) is in Mr. Buckler's writing (<hi rend="italic">this was to the prisoner, dated 25th November</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Buckler, stating that he had received the prisoner's telegram from Market Drayton that morning</hi>).</p>

They knew and gave me permis-sion to go, and they knew where I was at the time my Wife received letters from me, and they acknowledge receiving Bromby's security for 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which came to my home while I was away. They would have settled the matter if my father could have paid the money. He paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. security, and was told that if I kept out of the way no proceedings would be taken against me. I did not abscond or go away without their full permission, and these telegrams prove that they knew where I had gone to. Mr. Burn took all the money I had, and I had not enough to go home with, I am very sorry it has taken place. I cannot make restitution, but if my father had paid the money there would have been no prosecution.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, a member of the Royal College of Physicians and of the Royal College of Surgeons—I practise at Hounslow—on Sunday morning, 26th January, about 10. 30, I went to the prisoner's cottage—I found the woman lying on the sofa, quite dead and cold—I should say she had been dead about eight hours—her head was flexed forward on the left breast, slightly resting on the sofa, upon which was a mark of blood corresponding to the injury at the back part of the head—I found marks of blood on the mouth, which appeared to have been wiped—at this period I asked the prisoner how he accounted for the blood on the face of the woman—he said that she fell the night before on her face—I then made further examination, and found a slight quantity of blood oozing from the back part of the head—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for that wound at the back part of the head—he said she did not fall on her face, but she fell on her back—I asked him where she fell, and he took me outside his door, and placed himself in the position which he stated she was in when she fell—I could not possibly see how she could have fallen in that position—I don't think I said so to him—in my opinion she could not possibly have fallen in the manner in which he stated she had done to have caused the wound at the back part of the head—a small quantity of blood, which he pointed out to me as the spot where she fell, was in the middle of the brick path outside the door—that is not altogether my reason; it is part of it—I noticed several spots of blood about the room, and one large one in the middle of the room, on the floor;. that appeared to have been wiped—I asked the prisoner how he accounted for this blood—He said he put his wife on the floor when he brought her in, and when he went to Whitebread the following morning at 6.30 he had asked Whitebread to come down and wipe it up—the police-officer was present when I put these questions to him—he had not been taken into custody at that time—I then left—I don't think I took the deceased's bonnet off then—I did not at that time take a precise account of the nature of the injury at the back of the head—I returned at 3.30 in the afternoon—she appeared to be in the same position as when I left her—I then carefully examined the mouth, and found an abrasion on the right cheek, internally—I took off the bonnet—it was tied so tightly that I was obliged to cut it; the strings seemed to be tied in knots; it seemed very tight indeed under the chin—I looked at the bonnet when I took it off—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187303030032"/>
               <p>I noticed that, although the wound was on the right side, the blood on the bonnet was on the extreme left, and there was no track of blood from one side to the other—I believe this is the bonnet—I did not notice any mark or indentation upon it—the wound at the back of the head was a jagged wound, about an inch and a quarter or an inch and a half in extent; a clean wound, not a contused wound—it was right to the bone of the skull, dividing the pereostum; it had not fractured the skull—I had the body moved, and made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the couch was stained a little with blood on the upper part, but not to such an extent as to go right through to the lining; there were no clots of any kind—my opinion was that the woman had not died on the couch; if she had, in the first place, from the extensive wound on the back part of the head, there must have been a large quantity of clotted blood immediately in connection with it surrounding the wound, or we should have it at the bottom of the sofa, having run down from the same; secondly, her head would have been reclining backwards, or at one side or the other, and resting on the sofa, whereas it just barely touched the sofa, and was flexed forwards on the chest—I should imagine that she died on the floor—in all probability some-thing might have been under her head on the floor, and then, on account of being stiff and cold, when she was put on the sofa she would be in the same position; and there is another point, her bonnet was on when I saw her, but it was impossible for the wound to have been caused at the time she had it on, because the blood must have percolated through the bonnet before it got on to the stones outside—I should have expected to find a large quantity of blood on the right side, and there was not any—there was one place on the floor where a large quantity appeared to have been wiped, quite as much as I should have expected to find on the sofa—when I cut the bonnet off, I noticed that it covered the wound, because I felt the wound through the bonnet—on removing the skull I found a rupture of a blood vessel on the right side of the lesser brain, and which was on the same side as the external injury to the head—from that rupture she died—the blood had not got on to the membranes of the brain, it was at the back part of the head entirely; the brain was very much congested, but the blood had only got to the lower portion—I am satisfied that death was caused by the rupture of the vessel—the skull was not actually fractured—I should imagine death would take place perhaps in a couple of hours after the rupture, perhaps in an hour; it is impossible to say exactly—a blow of this kind on the head sometimes does not produce insensibility at the time, but it comes on afterwards—there were no bruises about the wound—she was not a particularly heavy woman; she was about 5 ft. 4 in., but not a very large woman—I should say that if she slipped from the wall, and fell backwards on her head on the brick pavement, it would not produce the wound I found, because I should expect to have had a contused wound, whereas this was a clean cut; I should have expected a contused wound in all probability, unless the head was well protected—I looked at the pavement, I saw no projections that would account for it—in my judgment a violent blow with a thick stick would have caused it, or a kick with a heavy boot; it need not have been a sharp cutting instrument; the reverse, a blunt one—I could not account for the blood on the mouth unless she fell on her mouth; a fall against the door or anything in coming out of the public-house might have produced it—all the organs of the body were perfectly healthy, the stomach was quite empty.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A violent kick would not produce a contused wound, not if done with the corner of the boot; it would have just such an appear-ance as this wound presented; there need not be any contusion—what hospital I was educated at has nothing to do with the case; I am a registered medical practitioner—I was at an hospital, where I took the first prize for surgery, Westminster—I did not tell you at first because I thought it a very irrelevant question to ask—I have been in the accident ward there some thousands of times—in the medical profession we often have things that perplex us; as a rule we can form a very fair estimate of how wounds are caused, at least those who know their profession can—I have very rarely, indeed, been surprised at wounds—another surgeon was called in in this case, Dr. Glengall—he came to the same conclusion that I did; he is not here—bleeding would cease the moment death occurred, or in a very short time—there is very rarely any convulsion before death sets in in a case of this kind; it may occur where there is irritation of the brain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 65, Minories—on Saturday after-noon, 1st March, I was in Trafalgar Square, at 4. 50, when a stranger accosted me, entered into conversation, and we both walked along the Strand and into a public-house, where he asked me to take a glass of wine—the prisoner came in and spoke to us there—we were there five or ten minutes—the prisoner said that he had had a legacy left him, and that his lawyer's idea of a gentleman was the man who could show the most money—he showed some 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and wanted me to show my money—the third party showed his money too—I did not do so, but I said "I will pay for whatever you like to ask for"—after about ten minutes we all three left together, and went into two other public-houses—I drank a little in each of them, and then we went to Anderton's Hotel, Fleet Street; that was the fourth house we went to—we sat down in the coffee-room, and the third man wanted the prisoner to lend him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at five per cent.—the prisoner said he would do it, and went out to get a Government stamp—the third man was left in the coffee-room with me—the prisoner returned in two or three minutes, and said that he could not get a stamp—he said "I have bought two bags of an old woman, and I don't know what to do with them"—the third man said "I will have one to keep my money in," and he asked me if I would have the other—I said "Yes," and then the third party put his watch and his pocket-book into his bag, and the prisoner said to me "Put your watch and chain and purse into the other bag"—that was in order to show my confidence in him—I did so—mine was a gold watch and chain,</p>

               <p>I don't know the value of it—the prisoner tied the bag, and while he wag tying it the other man put his hat before my eyes, and when it was taken away there was a tied bag before me with something in it—I put it into my pocket, and they then wanted me to go out and buy a hat—I did not want one, but they were going to make me a present of one—I accepted their offer, and they wanted me to go to the shop and get the hat myself—we came out to get it, but there was no hat shop near—the prisoner then gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and wanted me to go into a hosier's shop and buy a scarf, but I refused—he then tried to get away, but I held him by the arm and ran him into the passage of the Portugal Hotel, which is close to the hosier's shop; there were two gentlemen there, and I told them I had been robbed—the prisoner tried to get away but I kept hold of him, and during the scuffle he dropped a bag containing my watch—there were three of us, and I had to give him a blow—a policeman was sent for—I had the other bag with a watch and chain in it in my pocket—I don't know what became of the other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had come from on board a ship, and had been walking about for about an hour and a half—I had no refreshment before I met the stranger—we drank stout and bitter—at the hotel I had one Irish whisky, which the prisoner paid for, and I pitched away a second glass because I thought they were trying to get me <hi rend="italic">tight</hi>—they would not let me pay for any of the drink—we had cigars at the place we were at before going to Anderton's, which they paid for—we had nothing to eat—the bags were empty on the table, they were both alike—I knew it was a bag which the prisoner handed to me, but I did not know what was in it—we walked out together arm in arm, and I was in the middle—the bag was in my pocket—I do not know what the prisoner did with the other bag, it was not in his hand—I pushed him down in the passage of the hotel, and Í struck him once or twice—he has a black eye now—there was not much scuffling, he was made fast immediately.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—on 27th January I came home between 9 and 10 o'clock, or it might be later—I was out in the yard when the prisoner came in, and sent the child out for something for his tea—I went in, and took the warming-pan, to warm something for his supper—he was rather nasty because I had taken 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his pocket; he wanted me to give it to him, and I said that I had not got it—we had had a dispute about it in the morning—he went out; I gave him a shilling to go to his work, and then he wanted another shilling, but I said I had not got one—I did not see him afterwards till he came home at night—I then got the frying-pan, and was going to the table; as I passed him he jumped up, seized the frying-pan, and hit me over the head with it once or twice—I bled, and went down stairs <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the door—I was sent to the hospital—I know he would not have done it if he had not been in drink, for he is a very good husband when it is not for the drink, and I wish you to be merciful to him—I was three weeks and three days in the hospital—my head is well now—the frying-pan was a little bent at the side before; the handle was not broken off, but it was rather loose.</p>

I am a cashier at the London Joint Stock Bank, Princes Street, City—Mr. Jabez Tuck, a stationer of Old Broad Street, keeps an account there—on Thursday afternoon, 30th January, between 3 and 4 o'clock, the prisoner came in and presented a cheque purporting to be Mr. Jabez Tuck's for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a doubt as to the genuineness of the signature, and asked him what he would take for it, he said "Three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes"—I then compared it with the signature in our book, and showed it to our chief cashier, who sent to Mr. Tuck to ask him if it was his signa-ture—it was brought back with Mr. Tuck—the prisoner stood at the counter part of the time, but when we thought there was a chance of his escaping, we invited him into the private room, but previous to that the chief cashier asked him whether he knew the drawer or the payee, and said "Where did you get it?"—he said "From a gentleman round the corner"—he said "What do you mean by round the corner?"—the prisoner said "At the public-house"—I think he said in King Street—Mr. Tuck then returned with the messenger, and had an interview with the prisoner—Haydon, the detective, who had been sent for, asked the prisoner how he got the cheque—he said from a person whom he met at a public-house—he was then asked if he knew the person—he said that he did not know his name or address, but he had had two or three transactions with him in the way of business—he was asked what they were—he said he had made him a small table or desk as he was a cabinet-maker, but he did not know who he was or where he lived—the chief cashier told him he must consider himself in custody for presenting the cheque, as it was forged, and Haydon then went with him to a public-house, but not to the one he named—the messenger brought back Mr. Tuck's cheque-book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—this cheque is one which has been taken out of it about a dozen pages on beyond the place where the counterfoils have been used.</p>
