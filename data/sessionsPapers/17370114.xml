               <p>James Powel. On Tuesday Dec. 14, about one in the Morning, I happen'd to light on this Creature, ( Clare Dickenson ) and she asked me to give her a Dram? so we went to the Prisoner Insome's House; I don't know whether 'tis Insome's House or

             I was the Person that went into Redding's with the Prosecutor to drink a Dram, and there he lost his Watch: I saw Insome take it, and deliver it to Redding. They said, truly they wonder'd how he could pick up such a nasty black-guard Creature as I am: But we had three Quarterns of Gin, and Insome I am same took the Watch and gave it to Redding. I told the Prosecutor so in the House, but yet they stripp'd me there, and used me so improperly, that I should have had a Midwife. Then they search'd me again, in Holborn Watch-house, and used me ill there. The Prosecutor would not mind what I said, 'till he got me to the Watch-house, and the Prisoners were glad to get us out of the House, for if we were but gone, they said they should be safe enough. They call'd me a Black-guard, and wonder'd how he could have any Thing to do with such a dirty Wretch as I am.</p>
               <p>Q Where does Redding live?</p>
               <p>Dickenson. Over-against St. Giles's Church; I don't know the Sign.</p>
               <p>Insome. My Lord I did bring them their Liquor; but ask her if I sat down with them.</p>
               <p>Dickenson. Yes; you sat down by him; you took the Watch out of his Pocket; then you took the Candle and went down Stairs, and said, you wonder'd how any body could pick up such a Black-guard, dirty Bitch as I was.</p>
               <p>Insome. The Man brought the Creature into the House, and asked for a Lodging: I shew'd them up Stairs and carried them Liquour: When I call'd for the Reckoning, he said he had lost his Money and his Watch. I told him, he had not lost it in our House; why then says he, I have lost it in Drury-Lane; with that he fell upon his Creature and beat her sadly; Redding call'd the Watch, to take them out of the House; the Watchmen asked him who he could charge with the Robbery, and he said, he could charge no one, but Dickenson.</p>

            . I am a Watchman, and was call'd to take this Man and Dickenson out of Redding's House. He said he had lost a Watch, and a Guinea in Gold, and Silver; but, says he, I don't value the Money, if I could but get my Watch. We search'd Dickenson, but found nothing upon her; so we carry'd her to the Round-House, and next Morning before the Justice: there she said she saw Insome take it and give it to Redding, and so we took them up. In Redding's House, he charged the Fact on Clare Dickenson only</p>

I was crying, - past One o'Clock, - and they call'd, Watch! but please your Honour my Lord, I would not go, without the other Watchman. This Gentlewoman is a common Night Walker, she was there, and the Man told us he had lost his Watch, and he fell a beating the Creature as if he had been mad: says I, - don't beat her so, before us, but charge us with her, and take her according to Law, please your Honour my Lord. We search'd her, but found nothing: I said, do you charge any of these Women, (for there was three Women more in the Room) no, says he, I can't say whether the Prisoners were any of them that were then Present.</p>

I cry'd who's there, and knowing the Prisoner, I call'd him by his Name; but he darted his Stick at me, cut a great Gash in my Throat, and knock'd me backwards: Then he came over the Stile, and was making another Blow at me; but I slipp'd on one Side, and avoided it. He took from me all the Goods mention'd in the Indictment; so I went Home and got two Men to search after him, but they could not find him. I told my Wife how I was robb'd, and there was a great Congregation of People, who went again to his House; I tax'd him with it at his House; he was in a very great Sweat, and said (as how ) he knew nothing of it. He lives but a Mile and a half from me, and is lame of one Hand; he's the Man and no body else. I have gone in Danger of my Life on his Account before now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your Goods again?</p>
               <p>Haydon. Yes, in a Dog-house of the Duke of Bolton's, about 10 or 20 Pole from the Place where I was robb'd. My Lord, he has acted very Ugly by me before now.</p>
               <p>Q. So you think he robb'd you for robbing's sake, and out of Malice!</p>
               <p>Haydon. I don't know what he did it for, not I.</p>

            . I am a Neighbour between the two Men: When Haydon came Home, I heard he had been robb'd by the Prisoner, so I went to him (the Prisoner) and I found him in a great Heat; I asked him how he came to be in such a sweat: He said, he always sweat very much when he walk'd. The Prosecutor, my Lord, has a very good Character, and the Prisoner a very indifferent one. 'Tis true, he is lame, but he has often made use of his lame Hand: for some Time ago he got his Bread by his Labour, but now he's kept by the Parish, because he is lame of his Hand and his Leg; he is very lame indeed, at some Times, and at others, he walks better.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you know any Thing dishonest by me?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, I don't, but John, you have a very indifferent Character.</p>
               <p>Another. All the Parish will give Haydon a good Character; the other, they will not.</p>
               <p>Another. The Prisoner is a Man of a very ill Principle, and I believe he was guilty, because we never catch'd the Prosecutor in any ill demeanour. The Prisoner is often out o'Nights pretty late, and I think it looks as if he was guilty.</p>
               <p>Defence. 'Tis easy to see, that I am a lame Man: My right Hand is lame, and my right Leg and Thigh is not bigger than my Wrist: I am past my Labour and cannot work for my Bread, so I have Assistance from the Parish, and therefore they have done this out of Spite. <rs id="t17370114-9-verdict41" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Francis Smith. Yes, Ryan stood on the off Side of the Cart, and gave me several knocks as I was in it. One had a red Coat, but I can't swear to him. Ryan cry'd d - n you come down, and gave me several Blows. They took all the Money I had from me, I can't say how much that was.</p>
               <p>Ryan. What is the meaning that you can swear to one, and not to another? - Hah! How many of us were in Company?</p>
               <p>F. Smith. There were four of you in all.</p>
               <p>Ryan. And pray which of the four do you know?</p>
               <p>F. Smith. You in particular.</p>
               <p>Ryan. With humble Submission my Lord, why should he know me in particular?</p>
               <p>F. Smith. Because you gave me a great many ugly Knocks.</p>
               <p>Ryan. With humble Submission my Lord, I can't tell why he should have any Notice of me.</p>
               <p>F. Smith. Why you damn'd me, and bid me turn about, and it was you that pull'd my great Coat over my Back.</p>
               <p>Ryan. And will you swear it?</p>
               <p>F. Smith. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Ryan. With humble Submission my Lord, inform your self about that Fellow.</p>
               <p>F. Smith. They took nothing but our Money from us in the Cart, but they made us go into the Field, and they took my Great Coat, and my Wife's Cloaths from her in the Field, after they had plunder'd the Cart.</p>
               <p>Ryan. Well, I suppose you know who they were.</p>
               <p>F. Smith. I can't swear that the same Man that robb'd the Cart stripp'd us in the Field; but I can with a safe Conscience swear that Ryan was among them in the Field; they d - 'd us when they drove us up the Field and bid us go faster.</p>
               <p>Ryan. I have no Business to ask him any Questions.</p>
               <p>F. Smith. My great Coat was brought me from Justice De Veil's, and the Cloak which was brought from thence, my Maid will swear to.</p>
               <p>Ryan. My Lord with humble Submission, what's the Reason he should know particular Marks of me, before three more? with humble Submission my Lord, why does he know me?</p>
               <p>F. Smith. I know you by your Voice, your Nose, your black Hair, by your laying so violently upon me (for I was cover'd all over with Blood) I know you by your Boldness, and your strutting Manner.</p>
               <p>Ryan. My Lord, with humble Submission, that Fellow will swear that a Cow is a Jack-ass. With humble Submission, you must understand the Evidence; I don't know what they are, not I, the Thief-takers instruct them for the sake of the Reward, - and that's every Thing.</p>
               <p>F. Smith. He clapp'd a Pistol to my Head in the Field, and bid me lye down; then they bound us; they ty'd my Hands behind me with a strong penny Cord, and my Legs they fasten'd up to my Hands. Before they bound me, they pull'd off my Coat and Waistcoat and Shoes. I don't know the Day of the Month this was done, but my Wife does.</p>
               <p>S. Smith. 'Twas the 8th of this last December.</p>

             for receiving stolen Goods. Ryan was taken in Rag-Fair, in Company with others, upon him we found a Handkerchief, ('twas here produced) 'twas taken from him at Colonel Williamson's: I can't swear positively this is the very same which was then taken from him; because it was left in the Colonel's Custody all Night, but 'tis like it, and if it is the same there is the Colonel's Seal upon it.</p>
               <p>S. Smith. This very Handkerchief they took off my Neck in the Field.</p>
               <p>Griffith. It was left with Colonel Williamson, who is Governor of the Tower all Night, and I received it from him seal'd.</p>
               <p>Col. Williamson. This Handkerchief was taken from Ryan in my Presence, and these Buckles were taken out of his Shoes; this Hat was took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140007"/> from him too, in my Presence. I lock'd them up in my Scrutore all Night, then I seal'd them, and deliver'd them to the Constable.</p>
               <p>Griffith. After the Governor had committed Ryan to Newgate, I took Coleman in Custody on a different Warrant for receiving Goods stolen; so we brought her to the Round House to be examin'd. Next Day when we came to Newgate, Colonel Deacon inform'd us, that the Cloak on Coleman's Back was the same that was taken from Smith; accordingly I went to the Round House and took it from her, and here it is.</p>
               <p>Eunace Newman. This is my Cloak, the same I lent my Mistress.</p>
               <p>Ryan's Defence. With humble Submission, my Lord, 'tis all false that they have sworn about the Handkerchief and the Hat, and the Governor of the Tower. Inform your self how she lost them, and who took them from her.</p>
               <p>C. Why she says you took them from her.</p>
               <p>Ryan. 'Tis a cursed Lie, with humble Submission; my Moan is, - shall this Woman here, (meaning Coleman) answer for this? I tell you, - I don't deny but I have been a Transgressor, but that's no Reason an innocent Person should lose her Life by the Liar and the Perjuror. I don't deny but I have been a Transgressor, and by the Grace of God I shall suffer.</p>
               <p>Macmahon's Defence. When I came over from France, and got to Gravesend, I met this O'Bryan, he had Six Men with him, which he was carrying into the French Service. This was Two Days before Allhallontide, he went on toward France, and I came to London, with two young Fellows in my Company. There is one Garvey can justify that he lent half a Guinea in France or Flanders, about 14 or 15 Days after I parted with him, yet the Man swears I did these Things. Lord! see what difference there is in the Man's Talk. The Woman he lent the Money too, keeps the Horse-shoe and Magpye in Drury-Lane. I hope you'll look into his Manners, - why, and how he is striving to take my Life away, because I have no Friends to stand by me.</p>

They rifled my Pockets, and took five Penn'orth of half Pence, and 10 s. which was in a little Silk Purse. I am not positive whether there was any Silver among the Half-pence or not. One Man had a great hoarse Voice, the other was a spare Man, a low Voice, and pale Complection; the Moon was over-cast, and it was pretty dark; so I cannot be positive to the Men; but here is the Hat which was taken on O'Bryan's Head, and which they took from me when I was robb'd. They put me into a Ditch, and took my own Cloaths, and made me put on these, which I have here in this Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the Ditch from the Place where you was first assaulted?</p>
               <p>North. I was going to Highgate, and they took me over two great Fields, and thro' a Gateway, to the farther Corner of the second Field. My Money they took from me in the Road, and my Cloaths in the Ditch, at the farther end of the second Field. Two robbed me, and the third stood at a Distance, seemingly to keep Guard.</p>
               <p>Ryan. With humble Submission - keep the Prosecutor in Custody. O'Bryan is instructed in all Villainy; he has had the Opportunity of it.</p>
               <p>C. (To O'Bryan) Take care you speak nothing but the Truth, and remember you are upon your Oath to do so.</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. The Prisoners at the Bar robbed a Man near Kentish Town. Ryan and Falconer led him cross the Road, and Fitzgerald stood at some Distance. One of them took hold of him, and the other push'd him thro'a Ditch and a Hedge, into a Field on the Right Hand going to Highgate. Ryan commanded me to stand at a Distance with Arms; I follow'd, at a Distance, and saw the Man stripp'd naked, but Ryan commanded me back, to watch the Road. I can't tell which of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140008"/> them stipp'd him, but Ryan, Falconer, and Fitzgerald, were with him, and one of them went into the Ditch with him, but which of them it was I cannot tell. When they had done with the Man, they came to the Place where I stood, and Ryan gave me the Man's Hat out of his Hand; and here it is; this is the very same Hat.</p>
               <p>North. This is the Hat I lost at that Time; 'twas taken from me in the Ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was it when you went upon this Robbery?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. As near as I understand, 'twas between Eight and Nine at Night, between Kentish Town and Highgate, at the Bottom of the Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were present at the Robbery?</p>
               <p>O Bryan. There was Ryan and Falconer first; they laid Hands on the Man first. Fitzgerald went to them, but at the present Time he stood at some Distance from them.</p>
               <p>Ryan. My Lord, with humble Submission - look in that Fellow's Face, while he talks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when they went up to the Man?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. I was a little behind, and I went up to'em the same Time. They open'd his Breeches in the Road, whether they took any Money, I cannot tell; but they carry'd him thro' Hedge and Ditch, and over one Field to another, and there, in a Ditch, they chang'd Cloaths with him. Ryan, when he had done, gave me Two Shillings and Three Pence, but I had nothing of his Cloaths but the Hat. They did not tell me of the Cloaths they had given him, but they told me they had ty'd him with his own Garters.</p>
               <p>North. They made me take my Garters off my right Leg, and they ty'd my Hands prodigious hard.</p>
               <p>Ryan. Only compare his Affidavit now with what he produced before his Worship Justice De Veil, and the Governor of the Tower.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. Ryan can clear me.</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. I have known Fitzgerald these 12 Months</p>
               <p>Counsel. When was you last in France?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. About four Months before I was taken.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Don't you remember your telling any one, that you intended to go to France the 27th of October last?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. No, I don't remember any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Do you know one Mrs. Garvey?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. Yes.</p>

               <p>O'Bryan. Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Do you know Francis Allen, or Elizabeth Broughton?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Do you remember any thing of meeting Garvey's Wife in Flanders in November last?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. No; I do not. I heard that this same Woman kill'd a Man, and run away. Now she is come to swear falsly against me. She is a vile Woman, and keeps a House for Thieves, Highway Robbers, Pickpockets and Rogues.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Do you remember any thing of Mrs. Garvey's being in Flanders in November last?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. No, I don't remember I saw her at all.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Do you remember any thing of lending her Money in Flanders, and of receiving from her a Token to her Husband, within these two or three or four Months?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. No, I don't.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Were you in Company with Fitzgerald lately?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. I was in one Sherlock's House, one Night, and he was sitting at one Table, and I at another; I have been drinking in the same House, but not in his Company. The same Night that the Robery was committed, I was in one Cosgrave's House, in Princes-Street; and Ryan told me there, that Fitzgerald and Falconer were to meet him behind the Duke of Bedford's House in the Fields.</p>
               <p>Ryan. I want to know what he has to object against my Wife.</p>
               <p>- Hear his Objections. I beg the Affidavit he made before Justice De Veil, and the Governor of the Tower, may be produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Veil. This is the Examination I took, which O'Bryan sign'd after it was read over to him.</p>
               <p>Clerk Reads.</p>
               <p>Middlesex. The Information of Terence O'Bryan, taken before me Thomas De Veil, Esq; &amp;c. Jan. 9, 1736-7. Who being on Oath says, That James Ryan, Gerrard Fitzgerald, and James Falconer, were concerned with him in a Robbery committed a little beyond Kentish Town, about three Months ago, but says, he cannot swear to the Person, who then was robb'd.</p>
               <p>Falconer. He says there, the Robbery was committed three Months ago, and the Prosecutor says it was on the 9th of November. He likewise told Justice De Veil, that we went together out of Ryan's House.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140009"/>Mr. De Veil, He did say so. After I had taken the Examination he was asked from whence they set out; and he said, he went from Ryan's Room.</p>
               <p>Q. From what Place did you go when this Robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>O'Bryan. We came from Cosgrave's House in Princes Street, and Fitzgerald and Falconer were to meet as behind the Duke of Bedford's. I am a free Evidence; when I came in, there was nothing laid to my Charge - What Need have I to take away their Lives?</p>
               <p>Counsel. The Prosecutor says, he saw no more than three Men, and O'Bryan swears there were four.</p>
               <p>C. He swears that three Men went up to him, and that he stood at a Distance</p>

De Veil knows 'twas on Account of Hawkins and Brown. I left my House on the Monday, and I met O'Bryan at Arras in Flanders on Tuesday or Wednesday following; he was along with the Carravan and seeing me, he asked if I wanted Money, I told him, no; you will perhaps, says he, for you are going to a very dear Place; and he offered to lend me half a Guinea. I took it, and gave him this Pocket-Piece to give my Husband as a Token, that he was to pay him half a Guinea again; and on the 11th Day of the Month, I wrote to my Husband, and informed him, I had deliver'd O'Bryan the Pocket-Piece upon this Occasion.</p>

My Master was sitting by the Fire, and he said he was very cold, being just come off the Water, and was then return'd from France. He said he had seen my Mistress on the Way, and had lent her Half a Guinea; at the same Time giving my Master the Pocket Piece. I can't say whether my Master paid him the Half Guinea again, but they had a great deal of Discourse together, more than the Half Guinea came to. He owes 3s. 6d. upon our Score now.

That Falconer is a thick Man, about 36 Years old, wears a Wig but often a Cap: Fitzgerald is about 23 Years old a tight Man in a brown Wig.</p>

             was concerned in a Robbery at Hampstead, by robbing, stripping, and binding a Man; the said Farrel is a tall, lusty Fellow, full Face, black Hair, wears a red Coat, and is about 28 Years of Age. He farther says, that Dun and Lacey were concerned in the above Robbery, and all the rest, and likewise in enlisting Men for the Service of the French King.</p>
               <p>Farrel. I can bring a Woman to prove that I was elsewhere at the same Time, doing Work for honest Victuals. - Pray from whence did we descend to do this Robbery.</p>
               <p>O'Bryan From one Dive's House four of us went; there were two more than I have mentioned, and they are Lacey and Dun. I don't know the Prosecutor Rowbottom, but at the Robbery the 26th of November, there was Ryan, Farrel, Macmahon, and Macdonald, and my self, and one Lacey, who is gone to France, and that is the Reason he is not mark'd. Lacey went out with us, but he staid a little behind in the Road, waiting till we came back. Dives is a Soldier in the Guards, and keeps a Cook's Shop in Newtoners-Lane. Farrel I have known this 12 Months, he came over to recruit for the King of France.</p>
               <p>Farrel. I serve his Majesty, - God bless him, and that Rogue says, I serve the King of France.</p>
               <p>Ryan. With humble Submission, - this Rogue when he was apprehended, - but I can't rightly tell it you, - he had two Coats of other People's on his Back.</p>
               <p>Col. Williamson. O'Bryan was taken by the Custom-house Officers, on Tower-Hill, on Suspicion of having a Parcel of Tea. This I had from Colonel Deacon, who came to me, and said he had committed a Man the Day before, to the Gaol of the Tower Liberty, on Suspicion of being a naughty Person, for he had found a Pocket Pistol upon him, and he desir'd my Assistance to examine him. There appear'd nothing against him but his having two Coats and a loaded Pistol, made us suspect him to be a naughty Fellow. I threaten'd to commit him, and in an Advertisement to describe him, and the two Coats which were found upon him, if he would not discover his Accomplices He said he was innocent, and would make no Discovery, so we made his Mittimus, but as he was going down Stairs, he desired to be brought back again; then he told us, we had no Proof of any Thing against him, but however he would become a frank Evidence for the King, and then he declared all these Things. I found he had been a Soldier in the French King's Service.</p>
               <p>Farrel. There is nothing against me but this Man, and upon my Shoul, he would hang all the Court for the Sake of the Reward.</p>
               <p>Eliz Dorrel. Farrel came to live at my House the first of November, - the first of October I mean, and he liv'd there till the Time he was taken up, which was the 23d of December. He us'd all the while he abided in my House to go out betimes in a Morning with his Knot and Basket to Market; he always came Home about 10 or 11 o'Clock in the Forenoon, and never stirr'd out an Hour till the next Morning; he never stirr'd out of the House from the first of October to the 23d of December, after he return'd in a Morning from Market.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, if he never in all this Time stirr'd out, neither in the Afternoons nor in the Evenings, how did he spend his Time?</p>
               <p>Dorrel. In cleaning the Knives, or fetching me Water, or playing with the Children. He has never been from the Door in any Evening all this Time.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th of November, where was he then?</p>
               <p>Dorrel. At Home, as I am on my Oath, and the Virtue of it, I don't swear he was never out of the House, - I have no Occasion to suspect (inspect) into Days of the Month, but I am sure he was never out of the House to my Knowledge; 'tis true I have been out my self sometimes; but I have left him to take Care of the House.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day of the Week was the 26th of November?</p>
               <p>Dorrel. 'Twas Sunday if I can tell. No, I don't know the Day of the Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 26th of November?</p>
               <p>Dorrel. I can't say - but on the Virtue of my Oath, I never miss'd him out the 26th nor the 25th. He was never out of my House; and as for the Man that has sworn against him, he never was in his Company in his Life.</p>

               <p>John Drinkwater I liv'd six Months with Warwick; he kept the Swan in Sheer Lane, 'twas a very disorderly House, for there was scarce a Night pass'd, but Gentlemens Pockets were pick'd, and he always had a share of the Money. He invited me to come and live with him, telling me the Profits of his House would maintain me; but I did not think myself safe there, and would have come away sooner, but I was afraid of being sworn into a Goal. On the 3d, of April, 1735, I apprehended the Prisoner Wills, and one Curtis and Pritchard, and Pye and Williams, for being all concern'd in stealing my Watch. Warwick ordered me my Watch again, but he immediately enter'd an Action against me for 40 l. and I was arrested and carried to Wood street Compter directly: Then to prevent my Wife from assisting me, he arrested her in a Poultry Compter Action, at somebody's suit, - but she'd give an Account of that. Soon after I was lodged in Wood street Compter, I was detain'd by Virtue of a Warrant of Detainer, from Sir

After this I had notice, that Warwick had withdrawn his Action for Debt, and that I must remove to Chelmsford Jail in Essex; the Keeper of the Compter told me this on the 21st, of April: They call'd me up betimes in the Morning, and said they had got a Habeas Corpus, to carry me to Chelmsford Jail: I asked them who brought it; they told me one Mr. Ray.

When I came to the Jail, they told the People there, that I had broke out of several Jails already; so upon this Account I was ill used; and they staid with me, to see me loaded with the heaviest Irons that were in the Jail. I was here confin'd and iron'd from the 21st of April, till the Assizes in July following; but the Week before the Assizes, Wills and Warwick came down, and wanted to agree with me. They told me Joyce was put into the Angel Tavern by Temple bar, and that he would be glad to agree likewise; but, say'd they, you have been cruelly and wrongfully charged; but if you'll punish him, you shall be discharged. I told them, I would not agree with them 'till I had brought them to Justice. Then they told me, I should be carry'd to another Jayl, and that my Wife should be in Jayl too. Warwick say'd this, and Wills was in Company with him. Accordingly, on Sunday following, I receiv'd a Letter, informing me, That my Wife was in Prison at the Suit of one

               <p>Drinkwater. No body appear'd against me at the Assizes; but I was mov'd from Chelmsford to Hartford Jayl, by one Campbel, who calls himself an Attorney</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did you ever hear them declare what they would do?</p>
               <p>Drinkwater. When I was discharged, I came up to London, and had a long Fit of Sickness; and after I had preferr'd a Bill against Wills, and he was taken up, Warwick came into a Publick House and threaten'd me -</p>
               <p>C. They are indicted for conspiring to charge you with robbing Baws, - speak to that.</p>
               <p>Drinkwater. When I apprehended Baws, I asked him, how he could do such a cruel Thing? He said, he had never seen me in his Life, but he had heard of, and was privy to, the Conspiracy; and, says he, I did not swear it my self, - they got some body to personate me; and he inform'd me, that they threaten'd him, if he would not swear against me, they would swear against him. Since that they have often apply'd to me to make the Matter up, (tho' not in Person,) but I always shunn'd them, - I always avoided them.</p>
               <p>Counsel Def. Where had you this Discourse with Baws?</p>
               <p>Drinkwater. At one Mrs. Best's in Sheer-Lane. There was one Mr Wills present, at that Time, but he is attending the Society for Reformation of Manners at Bow Church.</p>
               <p>Warwick. I ask if he did not send me Letters from Chelmsford?</p>
               <p>Drinkwater. If I did, produce them: I did send him some Letters, to ask him how he could be so cruel, and to desire him to discharge my Wife; but never to ask him to come to me.</p>
               <p>Warwick. Was there any Company present when I talk'd to you in Chelmsford Jayl about discharging you?</p>
               <p>Drinkwater. No; every one, but your Company was put out of the room; there was none but you, and Wills, and I.</p>
               <p>Counsel Def. I would not willingly ask you any Questions, to draw you into Difficulties, - but consider, you are upon your Oath. - Have you never threaten'd to put others into this Indictment?</p>

            , came to Warwick in the Morning; I shew'd them into the Room where he lay, he had been drunk the Day before, so was a-bed. They told him they had got Drinkwater's Watch; he got up in the Bed, and call'd upon God to d - mn him, and told them they must keep it, and must keep him poor. Afterwards I heard that Drinkwater had got a Warrant for the four Men, who came together to Warwick, and he told them he had arrested Drinkwater in an Action of 40 l. I asked him how he could do such a Thing? and he said he could get People enough to swear it. After he (Drinkwater) was arrested for Debt, there was one Tibbalds the younger, informed Warwick, that Drinkwater was making an Information against him, for Robberies which had been committed in his House, and upon that Account, they all contriv'd to get him out of the Way. After many Consultations, (at which Warwick, Wills, Clark, Pritchard, Curtis, Joyce, and Williams, were all present,) Joyce brought the Prisoner Baws to them, and told them, there was the Man that would do it: I heard every thing upon this terrible Occasion. The Substance of the Discourse was to get a Robbery sworn against Drinkwater. Pritchard was not in their Company when Baws was first brought in, but all the rest of them were; and Warwick asked Baws, whether he would undertake to swear a Robbery against Drinkwater; Baws said, Yes, he would: Then they asked him how much Money he must have; he said, they must give him 20 s. Whether it was Warwick or some of the Company that ask'd the Question, I cannot remember, but it was some of the Company. They ask'd him next, where he would swear the Robbery was committed, - the whole Affair seem'd to me to be left to Warwick's Management, - Baws told them he chose to swear it somewhere about Ham in Essex, because he was best acquainted with that Part of the Country; they asked him what he would swear he lost, he told them he would swear to his Hat, Wig, a Gold Ring, and under 20 s. for, says he, if I swear to too much, they will not believe me, because I am poor in Apparel, and they will know I have not much Money to lose. At the Time they made this Agreement with Baws, there was seven of them in Company, and they collected 3 s a-piece; Warwick, Wills, Clark, Williams, Joyce, and Curtis laid down 3s. each, and Pritchard being absent, they laid down 3s. for him. I said it was a sad Thing to hang a Man wrongfully, and Warwick said, G - d D - n him it was no Sin, for if they did not hang him, he would them all. When they had agreed thus far, Baws and Joyce went down to Justice Newton, to get a Warrant of Detainer against Drinkwater, but Justice Newton would have nothing to do with them: then they went to Sir

            , and there they got it, and brought it to Warwick, he was then in Bed, but he got up and said, now G - d D - n him this will hang him. I never slept in my Bed 'till I made Oath of this, before the Lord Chief Justice Ayres, in June following, and I went down to Chelmsford at my own Expence to appear for Drinkwater upon his Trial, but no Body appearing against him, Campbel the Lawyer came down, and (as I heard afterwards) carried him to Hertford Goal.</p>
               <p>Counc. Pros. Then they never pretended that he was guilty.</p>
               <p>Sayer. No, they said they must do it to save their own Lives. They talked to Baws about his Cloaths, and told him when he went to the Assizes he should be better rigg'd, and should be well drest: There was six of them in Company, and they paid 3 s. each, round the Table, and one of them laid down 3s. for Pritchard; the odd Shilling he was to have to buy him a Dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had got the Warrant of Detainer, what happen'd next?</p>
               <p>Sayer. When they had got the Warrant to detain him, Baws said, I don't know the Man, it will be very proper I should have a Sight of the Man I am to swear against. Warwick describ'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140015"/> him, his Cloaths, his Speech, and every Thing, very particularly; but Baws said, that will not do, I must see him; then they all six agreed to send a Letter to him, and Drinkwater was to be call'd down in the Compter to receive it, but when Baws came there and asked for him, his Wife answer'd for him, and he did not see him. He came back and told them that he had not seen him; upon which they all agreed that he should see him when they remov'd him to Chelmsford. The next Business was to get an Habeas Corpus, I don't know what it cost them, but they all agreed to club for it.</p>
               <p>Counc. Pros. Pray what is Warwick?</p>
               <p>Warwick. I was an old - Acquaintance - of hers, she and I cohabited together as Man and Wife. You'll please to take Notice that all this which she swears was done in Middlesex, and we are now indicted in London.</p>
               <p>Counc. I remember a Trial in this Court some Time ago; this Woman tried Warwick for a Felony, with relation to the Goods in that House in St. Clements Church Yard.</p>
               <p>Counc. Warwick was indicted for stealing her Goods, but it came out, that they liv'd together as Man and Wife, so it prov'd to be no Felony.</p>

               <p>William Weaving I can only say I lost the Plates the 5th of Jan when I was out upon the Inquest, and I swear to them.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I went into the Yard, and saw the Prisoner there; I asked her what Business she had there, she said she only wanted to make a little Water, but I saw the Plates in her Apron, and she rattled them down in the Dust Tub, which stood in the Yard; she had brought them about 6 or 7 Yards from the Place where they stood! This was between 12 and 1 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Defence. I have nothing to say, - I never ow'd that Witness any ill Will, nor did she ever see me in the Yard: I had been out to buy some Bone to mend my old Stays, and wanting to make Water, I stepp'd up the Yard, and there I was charg'd with stealing those Plates. She has ow'd me a Grudge, for more than 12 Months. <rs id="t17370114-29-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

When I went to Bed at Night, I made all the Doors and Windows fast; but in the Morning when I came down, I found a Door open; being surpriz'd, I call'd a Neighbour and went over the House, and found two of the Chints<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140018"/> Curtains, two Quilts, and a red Sattin Mantle gone out of one Room: a little further a Box-lid broke, and the Papers which were in the Box scatter'd about the Room. I can't say any Thing to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Judith Gentry Confirm'd the above Evidence.</p>
               <p>Mary Ward. I saw the Goods in the Room the Day before. There was one Quilt cover'd the Bed, and another was doubled up and lay upon that, and covered that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Theodorick. The Prisoner brought me two Bed Curtains, and a Quilt last Summer, and offer'd them to sell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O Lord! Let her look at me, - swear her again my Lord, - swear her again.</p>
               <p>Theodorick. I agreed with her for three Guineas which she took, and told me they were a Gentlewoman's who was ill and was reduced. They were snipp'd and torn at the Top, but that she said was done by the Rats. These are the very Things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. O Lord! Lord! I never saw these Thing, 'till this Moment.</p>
               <p>Theodorick. I believe these to be the same, but they have been piec'd and made up again; there was not this Lining in them, and they are thus much lengthen'd, - here they seemed to be gnaw'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She must be a good one, to buy such Things of a Stranger.</p>
               <p>Theodorick. She told me they had lain by a great while, and the Rats had gnaw'd them, but now the Lady would sell them, for she wanted Money.</p>

            . These Things were advertised; so when I saw the Advertisement, I went to Mr. Sly's, at the Blue Boar in Whitechappel, and took a Friend with me, who happen'd to be in the Shop when my Wife bought the Goods, but this Man is now in Yorkshire . I told Mr. Sly, that my Spouse had happen'd to buy these Things; he desired me to send for them; which I did, and he Paid me the three Guineas my Love had paid for them, and treated us with two bottles of Wine. I promised him to bring the Prisoner as soon as I could light of her, and accordingly I carry'd her to him and she could not disown the Goods, neither at Mr. Sly's, nor before the Justice. She made many Protestations that she bought them in Rag-Fair, but she could not say who she bought them of. I know nothing at all of the Prisoner, nor do I know that ever I had seen her before</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Swear him, whether they ever mention'd Quilt and Curtains to me, before I was carry'd to the Justice?</p>
               <p>Theodorick. No, I believe they were not mention'd till then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She buys of 40 People in a Day, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Theodorick. Yes, I believe I do; and I have bought Things of her once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, Shirts and Shifts, and Gowns and Petticoats; we carry our Goods in our Arms publickly. These things are of a great Bulk; did any of her Neighbours see her buy them of me?</p>
               <p>Theodorick. No, There was only one Man in the Shop, and he is in the Country. I take the Prisoner to be the Person that sold them to me: I swear that I believe her to be the Person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The most Money I ever took of her, was 15 s. for Shirts and Shifts - These Things are beyond my Match to buy.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wroth. These Things are mine; I miss'd them the 11th of May. Since I recover'd them again, I have new lin'd them, and made them up. They are Chints, and not to be match'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I cry old Cloaths, and I buy honestly. I never saw these Things before, - Swear them again, swear them, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Wm. Whitehead. About 12 o'Clock last Night, I met that little one (Slater) at Temple-Bar; she asked me to give her a Glass of Wine; I told her, my Pocket would not afford it; then says she, you may give me some Beer.

The other Prisoner, and another Woman that is run away, wanted me to go into a Back Room, and I went with them, and there we had another Full Pot; then the biggest of the Prisoners (Dryberry) stood before me, and the others on each Side of me, and pick'd my Pocket, of a Three Pound Twelve Piece, a Moidore and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140019"/> a Shilling. I had all the Money in my Hand about two Minutes before - I had it when I sat down, and when I got up it was gone. The Buttons were in the Pocket with my Money, but they were gone too. One of them was found upon Slater, and I saw them in her Hands.</p>
               <p>Dryberry. Was I near you when you miss'd your Money?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. Yes; you stood before me, and pull'd up your Coats: 'Twas you that desired me to go into the Back Room.</p>
               <p>Dryberry. I was drinking a pint of Beer, and the Man and this Slater came in together, and we drank together; but when I would go home, he started up and said, he had lost his Money; I said, I had not wrong'd him, but he call'd the Watch, tho' I saw none of his Money, nor do I know the Man.</p>
               <p>Slater. He asked me to drink a pint of Beer, and then charg'd us with robbing him. Both <rs id="t17370114-32-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

I told him I must search his House; and when he found I had a search Warrant, he sent his Man to search for it, and he brought us these three Yards of Cloth. Here it is, and this is the other Part from whence it was cut; 'tis rough, and is not yet manufactur'd.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did not Mr. Allen say, he was not at Home when it was pledged at his House?</p>
               <p>Satchwell. He said his Man took it in, and blam'd him for it. I asked him why he did not advertise it; and he made no answer at all.</p>
               <p>C. You say he blam'd his Man for taking it in; on what Account did he blame him?</p>
               <p>Satchwell. He said the Goods were not manufactur'd, and any body might see they had been stole.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was his Man by, at this Time?</p>
               <p>Satchwell. Yes, and he own'd he took it in.</p>
               <p>Councel. I would ask you whether Mr. Allen was not bound over to prosecute the Principal Felon.</p>

               <p>Counsel. Did you prefer this Bill, before, or after his being bound over to prosecute?</p>
               <p>Satchwell. Afterwards I did, and I went with a Warrant to take him up, once or twice myself, and I sent several People to ask for him; but I was told he had secreted himself; he might have taken his Trial last Sessions.</p>

            . In October last I went to New-Prison to see Broughton, and I asked him if he knew any Thing of Satchwells Goods, and he told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173701140020"/> me, he had stole some from him, and that 3 Yards were pawn'd to a Pawnbroker in Smock-Alley. I told Satchwell of this, and he got a Search Warrant, and Mr. Allen read the Warrant himself. I was there at the same Time, Mr. Allen said he had no such Goods as he knew of, but when Satchwell insisted on searching, then Mr. Allen bid his Man go up and look, the Man went up Stairs, and brought down these very Goods; Satchwell own'd them immediately, and Mr. Allen said, any one might see those Goods were not honestly come by, and he told us he was not at Home when they were brought, but that his Man had taken them in, in his absence. The Man own'd he took the Goods in.</p>
               <p>- Barnes, Constable. I know nothing of these Goods, but I believe Mr Allen to be a very honest Man. There was a Watch lost some Time ago; and 'twas pawn'd with him; I had, (upon Enquiry) such a Character of him, that I only asked him about it, and he immediately deliver'd it to me.</p>

            . I liv'd with Mr. Allen at this Time, and I took in these 3 Yards of Cloth, my Master being out. I had liv'd there not half a Year, and was never in the Business before. Broughton brought it, I did not know him, nor did I ever see him before.</p>
               <p>Coun. Did you acquaint your Master with the Receipt of this Cloth.</p>
               <p>Allcock. No, upon my Oath, when Mr. Satchwell and Davis came to enquire after it, that was the first Time he knew any Thing of it. It had not been in the House above a Month. We book the Things that are receiv'd, but my Master seldom looks over the Goods that are pledg'd, 'twould be an endless Trouble to do that. I took Broughton to be a Dyers Servant, and told him, 'twas not well of him to use another's Goods, but he told me the Cloth was his own, and was sent him out of the Country. When Mr. Satchwell came to ask for it, my Master asked me if I knew of any such Thing; I said yes, and by his Order, I went up and fetch'd it.</p>
               <p>Satchwell. When I enquired after the Cloth, the Man said nothing of his remembering it, but went up Stairs and brought it down. ( Here the Record of Broughton's Conv ction was read )</p>
               <p>Counsel. We shall shew this is most inveterate Malice. When the principal Felon was taken up, Mr. Allen was desired to enter into a Recognizance to prosecute; he did so, and by this Indictment the Recognizance is forfeited.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mawson. Headborough. I went with Satchwell to search Mr. Allen's House. When we enquired for the Cloth, he hesitated a little, and asked his Man about it; he bid him go up and see if there was any such Thing, and he brought it down to us; but Mr. Allen reproved him for taking it in. <rs id="t17370114-42-verdict212" type="verdictDescription">
