                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Thos.

Carr, or that they were my sole property—he said he had a friend outside, would I be introduced to him—I said I had no objection—I went out and was introduced to Carr, but finding him anything but a gentleman I did not stop a moment—I don't think there was any heading or jurat to this affidavit when I signed it—I could not swear about the heading, but I am certain there was nothing at the bottom—on 12th June I went to Mr. Herbert's office, and had a conversa<lb/>tion with him, in consequence of which an affidavit was prepared for me—on the morning of the 13th I went to Somerset House and inspected the affidavit purporting to have been made by me—I am acquainted with the prisoner's handwriting—to the best of my belief this receipt is His writing.</p>

N. Abel 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for furniture"—I knew that the whole thing was fictitious—I did not say anything—in September, 1876, the defendant did not ask me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I swear; unfortunately I gave him my acceptance for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to buy some property for myself, not to lend him—it had nothing to do with this case—he did not ask me to lend him my acceptance for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his own benefit, nor did I do so—I did give him my acceptance for 50/. but not for his own use—I paid it in January or February—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I have accepted more than one bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I handed to the prisoner—Mr. Good discounted one bill and renewed it, and the renewal was paid—I see Good's name on the back of this bill—I presume that the proceeds of that bill went from Good to the prisoner—I was not called upon to pay this bill, because I gave another in its place—I don't know that that second bill was dis<lb/>counted by a man named Eyre—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) I suppose I received this letter and sent it to the prisoner, calling his attention to it—I have no doubt, now I see that letter, that Eyre did discount the bill and applied to me for the money, but I did not remember the name—this is another matter, quite foreign to this case—there have been two or three bills, I can't remember which was which—this letter is dated 5th May, 1877—I</p>

I have been chemist to the Mini for seven years, and have considerable experience in respect of coins—these two coins are good gold, but they have been reduced in weight by the action of a solvent, one 10 gr. 6, and the other 11 gr. 1, which is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in value respectively—the standard of a sovereign is 123.27—the estimated loss in a year on a sovereign is 0.43, so that in four years these coins ought only to have lost by legitimate wear 2/10 ths and 1/4 of a grain respectively. I have a sovereign here which I reduced by a solvent in an hour, and I produce the gold taken from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I lightened one of Her Majesty's coins by the direction of the Master of the Mint, and got off of it 10.6 of gold—there is copper in sovereigns, and I may have brought the copper to the surface—a solvent makes the surface frosted or honeycombed—the majority of sovereigns leave the Mint a fraction of a grain under 123.27, but one of these coins comes from Melbourne—it is quite possible for a light sovereign to leave the Mint—in 1866 two florins left the Mint, one worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—some sovereigns pass the best part of their lives shut up in banks—coins which are in great circulation bear evidence of being more worn than my average—I call Professor Jevons an authority—he states that coins passing from hand to hand at the East End of London wear a great deal more than those at the West End—gold varies in softness—I do not know that the gold used in 1873 was of a soft quality—I weighed these sovereigns, one weighs 112.624, and the other 112.174.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill broker, of 32, Nicolas Lane, Lombard Street—I have known the prisoner about two years—during that time I have constantly discounted bills for him—I usually charged him 5 per cent. per annum interest, with a commission of half per cent. on the amount—sometimes bills were running to the amount of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the time this happened there were more than that—about 17th May he brought me this bill of exchange, dated 10th May, with two others; the three amounted to 660<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him how it was that Mr. McLaughlin, being a shirt-manufacturer, should give acceptances to him, another shirt-manufacturer—he explained that McLaughlin could do certain makes of shirts better than he could, and it answered his purpose to buy of him, and that he sent over shirts to McLaughlin, for which he (McLaughlin) gave him his acceptance—upon that I discounted the three bills, and gave him in payment these two cheques for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 495<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they have been returned by my bankers as paid. (<hi rend="italic">The bill of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">was a four months' bill and purported to be accepted by P. McLaughlin, payable at the Omagh branch of the Belfast Bank</hi>.) On 28th August I received this bill for 154<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner—the bill of 10th May became due on 13th September—it was sent over by my bank to be collected in Ireland, and within a day or two afterwards it came back marked as a forgery—in the interval I had received a telegram from Ireland—I received this letter from McLaughlin in reply to one I wrote to him asking for payment, of the bill—about 16th September I saw the prisoner and told him that I had heard that McLaughlin said the bill was a forgery—he said it was not so, that he Would tell McLaughlin to come over to England to assure me that he had not cause for saying it was a forgery—it was after that I received the letter from McLaughlin—the prisoner called on me again, a week or 10 days after that, and produced this letter, saying he had received it from McLaughlin. (<hi rend="italic">Head:</hi> "September 15, 1877. Sir,—I did not intend to say the bill was a forgery exactly, but I had no note of a bill of that date, but I find I was mistaken. I will explain to the bank how, and do anything you wish to set it right. I will get the money together in a week or 10 days, and send it to you or the holder of the bill, as you</p>

               <p>think right.—P. McLaughlin.") I believed that letter to be McLaughlin's writing—I have never had any money in respect of either of the bills—I know the prisoner's writing—I should think this letter is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This as dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to M'Laughlin, requesting him to write a letter to the effect of the one read, and stating that the bill would be provided for</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had a good many transactions with the prisoner, extending over two years—I have very likely discounted five or six bills for him with McLaughlin's name as acceptor, prior to this bill of 10th May—I am prepared to swear that the conversation about McLaughlin's acceptance took place this year—it might have taken place in connection with other bills as well—those bills were similar in amount—at the time the prisoner showed me the letter signed P. McLaughlin I had McLaughlin's genuine letter to myself in my posses<lb/>sion—he certainly did not say that he had prepared that letter as a copy for McLaughlin to write from—the prisoner took McLaughlin's letter to me away with him—I did not compare the writing of the two letters—I gave the prisoner into custody on or about 10th November.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Omagh, county Tyrone, and am a maker of shirts and cuffs—I have known the prisoner over 10 years—the acceptance to this bill of 10th May is not my writing—I first knew of it when it was presented to me at Omagh on 13th September by a clerk from the Provincial Bank, Omagh branch—there is no branch of the Belfast Bank there—when it was presented I at once telegraphed to the bank in London—I got letter this from the prisoner the evening following, asking me to cover it—I had not had any communication with reference to it from the prisoner until then—I had received this telegram from him about an hour alter the bill was presented, and I immediately wrote to him a letter before I received his letter—I did not communicate with Mr. Shoolbred until he demanded payment, that was some time after—I wrote him this letter of 21st September telling him the facts of the case—I did not write the letter of the 15th—I attended at the police-court, and gave evidence, and then I was shown this other acceptance—I had pre<lb/>viously seen it that morning at Mr. Miller's office—it is not my writing—I did not owe the prisoner any such sum as 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think my first business transaction with the prisoner was early in 1876—I had business transactions with him early in the present year—he supplied me with goods to make—I accepted three bills for him; two in August, 1876, and the third, I believe, in December, 1876—they were not in respect of goods supplied by him to me, they were simply accommodation bills—in December, 1876, there was a bill coming due—this letter is my writing to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Dear Sir,—I dare say my hurried letter of yesterday has reached you in due time containing your bill; I have just five minutes to write and post it; it was a very close shave with the bill due, I had scarcely time to have the bank order cashed until it was presented for payment; the least hitch in remittance would have been extremely awkward. With regard to a banking account, how would it do for you to accept a bill for me for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or say for what amount of work you can give me to make, for four or five months?

               <p>perhaps it will be better to wait till then, which I presume will be this side Christmas.") The bill due in December was an accommodation bill—he asked me as an obligement to accept those bills for him—I know Charles McDaid, the prisoner's brother—I did not in his presence sanction the use of my name to acceptances by the prisoner, that I swear—I know William Haggerty—I was over here in the early part of August, 1876—I did not on that occasion say to the prisoner "You can use my name to bills"—I was over here in August this year—I remember meeting Charles McDaid and Haggerty—I did not on that occasion say that I did not mind my name being used, so long as the bills were met—what occurred was this, in what I said I referred to Charles McDaid—Haggerty was not present—I said <hi rend="italic">"</hi> Those bills that I ac<lb/>cepted for McDaid he did not accept as he intended to do—he promised to send me the money to meet those bills, and he had not done so—this one was presented before the money was forwarded, I could have seen my way to accommodate him, but when things turned out like that I could not see my way further to have any connection in that way"—that was simply referring to what was past, to those three accommodation bills—one of them, I believe, was a three months' bill, and the other two four months—two were accepted in August, 1876, one at three and the other at four months—they have been met, the prisoner provided the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> With regard to those three acceptances, I wrote them in my own proper hand writing—I never, under any circumstances, authorized the prisoner to write my name; I never thought of such a thing—those three bills were written by me; two of them I have in my possession, the third I have not got, he wrote saying it was all right, and I heard no more about it—in August, 1877, my complaint was that he had not sent the money to meet this bill, and in consequence of that I would not accept for him any further—he never mentioned anything then about a bill dated 10th May, to which he had written my name, and left with Mr. Shoolbred—this was at the latter end of August; I left about the 24th, and was here up to the 29th or 30th—neither he or his brother told me that they had signed my name to the bill of 10th August—I never gave them authority to sign my name to that bill—I never gave any authority to any one to write my name—these acceptances are not an imitation of my writing—as to the bill marked A. the drawing and acceptance seem to be in the same writing, except the signature—I have no idea whose writing the August bill is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> The men were about 10 feet from me when I first saw you on the right-hand side—there is a lamp on the other Bide of the back wall—there are two walls between our garden and the street—I do not recollect being asked at the police-court if I could swear to you—I do not remember saying I could not—I am confident you are the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the Post-office, Greek Street, Soho—on Monday morning, 19th Nov., Lacey came in and offered to sell 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of postage stamps—the Post-office receiver questioned him, and he said that he received them in payment for a concertina—he was detained till the police came.</p>

I received a telegram and went to the Greek Street Post-office, where I found Lacey—I asked him his name; he declined to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> it—I asked him how he became possessed of the stamps; he declined to say at first, but afterwards he said "I picked them up near the Oxford Music Hall"—I said "Please give me your proper name"—he said at last William Smith—I said that if he did not give his proper name I should give him in charge—he declined, and I gave him to 30 B.</p>

They came out and showed me a quantity of stamps"—on 24th November I took Crauford, and a man who was walking by his side threw down these post-cards and ran away—it was not Cunningham—I have made inquiries about Cunningham without success.</p>

I am a marine modeller, of 7, Crown Court, Went-worth Street, Whitechapel—I lived with the prisoner's wife after he deserted her—on Thursday night, 22nd November, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came rushing up the stairs and burst my door open—he had a knife open in his hand, and said he intended to commit murder—he stabbed me in the cheek—I struggled with him and tried to defend myself with a piece of iron which was lying in the fender—I made a blow at him—it must have struck him on the head—it was in the dark, for he kicked over the table with the candle on it—I then received a stab in the shoulder, and again in the muscles of the arm—I closed with him and threw him across the bed, holding him down—he then stabbed me again in the thigh—I took the knife from him, and in doing so was cut on the knuckles and wrist—I found myself getting weak from loss of blood, and I let him go—his wife ran for a policeman, and when she came back he armed himself with a pair of scissors which was lying on the table and made a thrust at her, but did not hit her—he then ran</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman now lodging at the Sailors' Home—I am a native of Providence, Rhode Island, and am 29 years of age—on 1st September last I joined the Mary E. Chapman, a British vessel sailing under the English flag—I joined her at Breeze Point in the Delaware river—on Monday morning, 3rd September, about 11, I was doing work on the forecastle splicing blocks—all the crew, except the watchman, were at work—tar was being used—one of the crew was a Chilian, known as Allis—the prisoner was the first mate—he said "The first son of a bitch that spills tar on the deck I will make him lick it up with his tongue"—Allis replied he would be d—d if he would lick it up for no man—the prisoner then took a handspike and struck the man twice on the head with both hands—he staggered to the rail, and I saw blood running down his face—the handspike is a piece of wood about 6 feet in length—it is used to heave the capstan—it was lying on the top-gallant forecastle, about 2 feet from the prisoner—Allis then went up the rigging to the top-gallant yard, and I saw him signalling to a man-of-war or a training-ship which was lying a little way off—the prisoner told him to come down, that he would not hurt him—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100020"/>
               <p>Allis said he would not—the prisoner then ordered Osborn, the second mate, to go aloft to get him down—Osborn went aloft and asked to come down—he refused to do so—the prisoner again tried to get him down by speaking to him, and he then went aloft to the fore-top-gallant-yard—the man would not come down—the prisoner then came down and ordered the fre-top-gallant-yard to be lifted to the masthead—that was the place where Allis was—and Allis said to the prisoner and to all the men on deck "If I fall from this yard you will be responsible for it"—we did pull the halyards and he would not come down—Osborn told the prisoner that he was in danger of killing the man by lifting the yards aloft—Allis still remained up there—about an hour afterwards the prisoner went on shore—Allis was up the rigging altogether about two hours—when he came down I looked at his head—there seemed to be two wounds—one seemed to be soft, and there was a clot of blood—I touched it with my finger—I thought his skull was fractured—the skin and flesh was cut; one wound was on the top of the head, and the other near the temple—one was worse than the other—the flesh of both was cut—I thought the skull was fractured from the way the man seemed to act when he came down—he did not seem to be the same man he was before—he seemed to be a sort of delirious, as if his mind was not right—he went into the forecastle and from there to the galley to get his dinner—I did not see him jump overboard; I saw him in the water—at that time the prisoner was on shore, it was after he had had his dinner; I saw him have his dinner and afterwards saw him in the water, swimming for the shore—another sailor named King was also in the water swimming away—I heard Osborn ask Allis to come back—I heard Allis sing out "I am drowning," and he was drowned—the prisoner came on board next morning—we afterwards sailed to Antwerp—the Consul there was communicated with—the prisoner left the ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I joined the ship at Philadelphia—the crew consisted of eight men before the mast; there were three officers, the captain, chief mate, and second mate—the crew were mostly foreigners—all wore knives, some with lanyards and some with sheaths—the work began at 6 o'clock in the morning—I heard the mate give orders to the crew to be careful not to spill the tar—some tar was spilt by Allis—I think the prisoner called his attention to it—Allis was very insolent—the mate did not say "You would be more careful if you had to lick it up;" I did not hear him say that—I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advance-note before joining the vessel—I have been at sea 11 years—Allis spoke in English at the time he swore at the mate; he had got his knife on him—I did not see him turn round and face the mate with the knife in his hand; I swear he did not—his manner was threatening and defiant, as well as insolent—I heard the mate say that he had had another crew, a mixed crew, on board before I joined—I did not hear him say that he had had a great deal of trouble with that crew—the work that was being done at this time was being done with the capstan-bars, one of which the mate took in his hand; he did not take it up till Allis had sworn at him—he ought to have obeyed the order to come down from the rigging—when the prisoner went up the rigging to him Allis had the knife in his hand in a threatening manner—three men set off to swim ashore, King, Langford, and Allis, while the prisoner was on shore—it was about half an hour after the prisoner left the ship that Allis came down—he went to the cook—I don't know whether the cook</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100021"/>
               <p>had charge of the rum—the prisoner told me he was going on shore to see the captain; he did not Bay it was to report the mutinous state of the crew—he spoke to me with regard to where this man lived when he was in Philadelphia—he said he must go and speak to the captain about what had taken place—when Allis came down on deck I told him that the mate had gone on shore to tell the captain of his conduct—when, he was swimming ashore Osborn called to him to come back, and he fired a pistol to frighten him, not to hurt him—the foreigners had been rather trouble<lb/>some and obstreperous since the day they joined—I did not see that Allis had been behaving badly before this; he associated with me mostly—the tide was running very fast, about five miles an hour, when he was swimming—the Delaware is about a mile and a-half across—it would not be an easy thing for a man in ordinary health to swim ashore with the tide running at that rate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Just before the prisoner went on shore he asked me where Allis lived or boarded when he was on shore, and said he was going to see the captain—I did not hear him say anything to the crew; he called me aft and spoke to me privately—Allis had his knife out of the sheath at the time he was struck, and was working at the stays—I did not see him do anything more than use the expression he would be d——d if he would lick up the tar; he said that about a minute and a half or two minutes before he was struck.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was signed Jado and Levy, ordering</hi> 248 <hi rend="italic">dozen combs marked with the "Elephant" stamp, and urged a little extra allowance, as their profit was very small, to be delivered not later than the following Thursday</hi>.)

               <p>before I sent the goods—they were to be paid for by cash, but when I called for a cheque Mr. Levy said he wanted two days, and so I ordered the goods back again—he said they must be there by 4 o'clock that after<lb/>noon for shipment, and that he gave me references, and I ought to have inquired—I said the references had nothing to do with that, as it was a cash transaction, but on a future occasion I might make use of them—he said "I shall pay for those goods after they have been checked by my packer; I must have two days until my packer returns the invoice"—I went back to my principal and he advised me to call on the references—I first went to Edwards, and the report I had there was that they knew Mr. Levy to be agent for three several first-class German houses; that he was certainly a respectable man, but they had had no business transactions with him—I asked Mr. Edwards whether he would trust him for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said "For such a sum as that I should not hesitate at all; I believe <hi rend="italic">Levy</hi> to be thoroughly respectable"—I then went to Messrs. Stern and Co., 26, Finsbury Place, and found the door closed, with a placard on it, "Return shortly"—from there I went to Mezler and Co., 4, Bow Lane, and inquired for the principal, who, I was informed, was out, and would return at 2 o'clock—I then returned to our office and saw Mr. Cornet, who, on the recommendation of Messrs. Edwards, gave me instructions to deliver the goods at Catherine Court—I went with them, accompanied by a porter—I saw Levy and Oberdorfer, who counted the packages and made 104, and Levy counted them and finally made 94—Levy signed this receipt for them—I did not go to Stern again before I delivered them—I went to Stern's the next morning about 11 o'clock and saw him—I recognise the prisoner Stern as the same person—he then wore a bushy beard; I have no doubt as to him—I presented him with a note written the day pre<lb/>viously by Mr. Cornet, and he said "I have had money transactions for about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Messrs. Jado and Levy, and I think them perfectly safe"—I asked him whether I could safely trust them for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I should not mind trusting them myself for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I thanked him and left—on the Wednesday Mr. Levy came to our office and said that his customer had objected to two numbers of insertion fronts, because he thought them too dear—the value would be about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he asked us if we would take them back—he said he was too much of a business man to force us to do so, but if we would take them back it would be of great service to him, otherwise he must bear the loss—he asked us if we could find a market in France, and we said it was quite possible—he said "There is a bill coming due for 240/., but I find three days' grace is given in England, which will make it Saturday; I should like you to delay your pay-day till Saturday next, when a cheque will be ready for the whole amount"—after some delay we consented—I called on Saturday at 12—Mr. Levy was out and I waited till he returned—I saw him and he said he had been to the bank to inquire whether the bill was met, and he thought it would be illegal to give a cheque not knowing whether the cheque was honoured, so he told me to call on Monday at 10, when a cheque would be given without asking for it—I did so and found a placard on the door, "Will return after 11"—I called again at 11 o'clock, and saw a man there waiting for Mr. Levy—he asked me if I had come for some money, because Mr. Levy had left instructions with him to say he had gone to the West End to collect some money, and he would be back at 4—I went at 4 and waited till 5, but Mr. Levy did not return—I called on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100028"/>
               <p>Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock and shortly afterwards Mr. Levy arrived—I said "I have called for the cheque I was to have without asking for it—he said "Those goods you sent me were not worth half the price and shan't pay for them; I shall see Mr. Cornet this morning at 12 and he must take them back"—I said it was useless to call at our place, for we should not hear of any such proposition, and I didn't like his shuffling ways, and should place the matter in other hands—that occurred in his own office the last time he was there—all the goods had been remove from there with the exception of one dozen collars—Mr. Levy did not calm at our office at 12, and we have not seen him since—I went there on "Wednesday and saw bills presented and many people inquiring for Mr. Levy—the office was not closed until about Friday, when I called at about 11—we have not been paid a penny for our goods—we believed they were <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> merchants, and that the goods were intended for the German, market—on a Sunday night in October, in consequence of a telegram from Sergeant Lythel, I went to Leicester, and at the police station I was shown 45 dozen of our shirt-fronts—identify these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) as a portion of those we supplied on 1st October.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister—I got an assignment* from the licensees of the publishers of some steel plates of Sir Edwin Land-seer's of the right to use the plates for the purpose of lithographing a transfer as taken from the steel plates—at the time I acquired that right there were 7,000 copies of a particular picture on hand, and I took the whole stock with the copyright—the old stock was quite unfitted for my purpose, and I took steps to get rid of it, and saw a man named Spannier with reference to them—I shortly afterwards received a visit from a man named Rock, who stated that he had formerly belonged to Christchurch, Oxford; had been a student at one of the Inns of Court; that he was a brother of a Shropshire clergyman; that he had a large acquaintance-amongst shipping agents in London, and if I paid him a commission he—would place this old stock amongst the shippers, and would be able to take the whole stock of engravings for export to the colonies. He called a second time and said that he had known some shippers of Finsbury Place, E. Stern and Co., for some time, and would give them an introduc<lb/>tion to me, and they should call upon, me and take a quantity of my goods—I said that I did not wish them published in England, and should like them if possible to be exported to the colonies, because the issue of the old stock in this country would interfere with the improved issue, and that Messrs. Stern and Co. would want them for the Cape of Good Hope—afterwards I received a visit from Stern, who brought me this letter from Rock: "4, Grove Place, Acton, W., September 28th. Dear Sir—T bearer, Mr. D. Stern, of Stern and Co., may be able to buy a quantity of your pictures, and I trust the introduction may lead to business.—Yours truly,—Rock." Stern brought with him two men, one of whom I subsequently saw in his office, who I believe was his clerk; the other I believe to be Oberdorfer—Stern said "I am a shipping agent," and he gave me to understand that he did a considerable business with Germany and the colonies, especially the Cape of Good Hope—he said, referring to the man I believe to be Oberdorfer, "This is a merchant from the Cape of Good Hope; he has a considerable business there in engravings and lithographs, and I think he will be able to take a vast number of these engravings"—the engravings were there, and samples of a large number of copyrights which had been offered to me—he took a sample of "The Challenge "and marked in the corner of it the date and his initials, and samples of other pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer—they were copyrights which had been brought me, and I had not finally decided whether I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100030"/>
               <p>would accept them—he marked them all—I said that I was not at all anxious as to the new copyrights, but the old stock, "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary," I was anxious to get rid of—he said none the less he should like to take the samples—he and Oberdorfer made a number of remarks about the pictures; some they thought particularly suited to the Cape market, especially "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary" after Stern had marked the samples he asked me the terms on which I would sell the engravings—I had previously told him the price of the old stock—viz., 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each.—the proper price in this country would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—that is what the original plates sold at—he said "We do a large business with Berlin, I suppose you will be satisfied if we give you a bill on some firm in Berlin"—I said "I know nothing about bills and business matters, the only thing I can understand is cash"—he said "I will consider the matter and write you further"—afterwards I got this letter, dated October 1st, 1877: "Dear Sir—Please forward 2,000 engravings of The Sanctuary,' and 2,000 engravings, 'The Challenge' at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 5 per cent, cash, payable on 15th insr., and oblige, dear Sir, yours respectfully, D. Stern and Co. References—Messrs. Mezler and Co., 4, Bow Lane; Jado and Levy, 4, Catherine Court, Seething Lane, E. C." I first called at Messrs. Mezler, who occupy the ground floor in Bow Lane—the premises seemed to be stocked with valuable lithographs—I saw a clerk, who said that it was very difficult to find Mr. Mezler in, as he had so many engagements—I left my card and said "Will you tell Mr. Mezler to write to me to this address and give me information as to D. Stern and Co., who have referred me to him <hi rend="italic">?"</hi>—he said he would give the card and ask for the information—I called a second time—some other persons were in the shop, one of whom I believe was Mezler—the clerk said "I gave the card to Mr. Mezler, and he said he would attend to it"—I said "Is Mr. Mezler here now?"—he said "No, he is not here"—I said "Mr. Mezler has not written to me, I will leave 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for stamps for Mr. Mezler to write"—I thought perhaps he had not written, from motives of economy—he said he would give the stamps to Mr. Mezler and ask him to write—I then said to the clerk "Stern says he has had dealings with your firm, is that the case?"—he said "Yes"—I said "He is rather pressing about this order, and do you think I can safely execute it?"—he said "I should say so, we have had considerable dealings with him"—Mr. Mezler did not reply to my letter—I called at Jado and Levy's place, 4, Catherine Court, Seething Lane, and saw a clerk—I showed him the order, and said that I had been referred to their firm, and that I wished to see Mr. Levy or Mr. Jado in reference to it—he said neither of them was in, but that if I left the name and the amount of the order he would mention the matter to Jado and Levy, and they would write to me—he asked me the exact amount of the order—he said it was important he should know that—I said "Does it make any difference whether it is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "Yes, because they might be good for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and not for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so you had better be very exact in mentioning the exact amount"—I subsequently received this letter: "4, Catherine Court, Tower Hill, London, E.C., October 3, 1877. To Mr. Shackle<lb/>ton Hallett. Dear Sir—Messrs. D. Stern and Co., of 26, Finsbury Place, we know as respectable and trustworthy, and consider them safe for the amount named. Yours truly, Jado and Levy." After receiving that, Rock called, and I mentioned to him that I had received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100031"/>
               <p>no reply from Mezler, but that I had received a satisfactory reply from Jado and Levy—he said "Mezler and Co. are, doubtless, jealous of Stern and Co., because Stern and Co. are a young firm in the same business as Mezler and Co.; they touch lithographs and Mezler and Co. deal also in lithographs, and they are doubtless anxious that you should do business with them"—I said "That may be so," and that I would consider the matter further—I subsequently received this letter: "D. Stern and Co., 26, Finsbury Place North, London, E.C. October 5, 1877. Mr. Shackleton Hallett. Dear Sir,—Please inform us by return when our order will be executed, as we are waiting for the pictures to pack with others for shipping, and oblige, yours respectfully, D. Stern and Co". There is also a receipt on this by Mr. Rock, which was written some little time afterwards—in consequence of this letter I called at Finsbury Place North, and saw Stern, who was seated at a centre table, near the window—there was a clerk, whom I now believe to be Roberts, who was counting some lithographs or chromo-lithographs—I said to Stern "I have called with reference to this order of yours; I told you that I car only understand a sale for cash"—he said "Yes, but my order is a cash order; you are not acquainted with these matters; if you were, you would know that houses doing a large business are in the habit of making payments on certain fixed days in every month, and on those days only. Our pay day is on the 15th, and a payment on that day is what we call prompt"—I said "Well, that may possibly be so; a fortnight may not make much difference"—I said again to him "Where are these goods going to?" he said "They will be shipped at once to the Cape of Good Hope, and there is a vessel waiting in the docks, and I am, therefore, anxious for their immediate delivery"—I said "I have had a satisfactory reference from Jado and Levy, but Mezler and Co. have not given me any written answer to my inquiries; the clerk there says that you have done business with them. Mr. Rock says the reason why Mezler has not answered, possibly, may be jealousy of you, as you both deal in litho<lb/>graphs and," I said, pointing to the clerk at the window, who was counting the lithographs, "I see you deal in these things"—he said "Yes," and he produced a number of receipted bills from Mezler, showing payments made by himself to Mezler to a considerable amount—this seemed to confirm his statement, and I said "You shall have the goods; I have been engaged in purchasing the copyrights, and have at present taken no warehouse. I have not commenced any business; they are on the premises of the vendors to myself, in Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn, waiting my order. If you send there to-morrow I will have them delivered to you." On October 8th I attended at Serle Street, and I found outside the door of the warehouse the prisoner Sandman in a light spring cart, and another man, J. Roberts, whom I had previously seen in Stern's place of business, counting the lithographs—Sandman at that time had light whiskers under his chin—lie subsequently dyed them with some lead dye—it was something that changed the colour, and it was obviously by artificial means—he was dressed as a countryman—they were waiting at the door, and I said "I suppose you are Mr. Stern's carman?"—Sandman said "Yes, sir"—I said to Roberts "One of you will have to come in and take these engravings out of the warehouse"—Roberts came into the warehouse and delivered to me this order.

               <p>Mr. Hallett. Dear Sir,—Please deliver to bearer 4,000 pictures, and oblige, yours truly, D. Stern and Co.") I then delivered to him 2,000 copies of "The Sanctuary," and 2,000 copies of "The Challenge"—they were packed in 16 brown-paper parcels of 250 each, as they came from the printer's—I produce this receipt written on my ordinary paper. (<hi rend="italic">This was a receipt for the engravings, and was signed by J. Roberts</hi>.) As they were leaving, I said to Roberts, in the presence of Sandman, "I suppose you will take these to Mr. Stern's office?"—he laughed, and said "No, they must be packed at the office before they can be sent to the ship"—I do not remember his mentioning the name of the packers—they then left—subsequently I received a second order. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "D. Stern and Co. 26, Finsbury Place North, London, E.C. October 10, 1877. Mr. Hallett.

Please inform us at once whether you have these pictures in stock, and when you can deliver them. Your early attention will oblige yours truly, D. Stern and Co. P.S. This order to be paid with first amount, on the 10th instant.") I called at Stern's office—I had in contemplation at the time the purchase of the copyrights of "The Huguenots" and "Black Brunswicker," and I said to Stern "I am thinking of taking these plates, and also other plates of Landseer's stock, but I am not quite decided about the purchase of them. Do you think there would be a market for these at the Cape of Good Hope?"—he entered into a discussion on the relative merits of the pictures, and he advised me to purchase one of them—he then said that he would be calling himself the next day for the other copies of "The Sanctuary" and "The Challenge"—I said "Where will they go?"—he said "They also are going to the Cape of Good Hope"—on the morning of October 11th, I saw him outside the warehouse, in Serle Street, by himself—he then had whiskers, which have been shaved off, I may say—his appearance was very different then—he appeared a much more respectable person—he was well dressed, clean shirt and collar; in fact, he appeared like a very respectable person indeed—he received 500 copies of "The Challenge" and 500 of "The Sanctuary"—I think there was some difficulty as to the packages—they were not all the same number, so he asked for 50 more copies of each—they received 550 copies of each—the receipt had been made out for 500 each, and the "50" has been added, and Stern then initialled this alteration. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Received from Mr. Shackleton Hallett 550 copies of 'The Sanctuary' and 550 copies of 'The Challenge,' at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per copy, less 5 per cent, for cash.") Stern said there was a cab to take them to the shipper's, and I then left him at the place—on the 15th instant I called at the office of Stern—the house<lb/>keeper was standing outside, and Stern was not there—a number of people were calling, asking for their money or their goods, neither of which could be found—I have seen a considerable number of prints which were found at Leicester, and recognised them as some of those I sold to Stern—they bear the marks which Stern put on them—I have also had shown to me samples of "The Sanctuary" and "The Challenge" taken from a large case at King's Cross, which I recognise as portions of the packages of 250 each, delivered on the 8th October to Sandman—I believed that Stern was carrying on a genuine business as a shipping agent, and that those goods were to be consigned to the merchants at the Cape of Good Hope, or I should not have parted with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission-agent, and live at 4, New North Street, Bloomsbury Square—I know Rock as much as Mr. Hallett knows him, through another man who sent him to me in connection with buying some pictures I had to sell for Mr. Hallett—I forget his name, it was in Long Acre—I was engaged by Mr. Hallett to sell the pictures on commission—after they had been obtained I went down to Leicester with Sergeant Lythel, and on the 28th October I went to Sandman's premises, 29, New Bond Street—we had taken lodgings opposite the house first of all—we went to Sandman's warehouse on Sunday, the 28th October, and I was present when search was made, and when 250 of the lithographs "The Challenge" were found there—subsequently another 700 were found upstairs—Sandman said in Lythel's presence something about buying them of Stern, and said he paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them, or something of that, and I said it was not half the amount they were sold for, and a great many things were said that I cannot call to mind.</p>

I knew Mr. Hallett through a gentleman living in my neighbourhood connected with my brother coming to my place and sending us to Mr. Hallett—my brother and I are in the picture line—I made the correction at the Mansion House directly I said I was clerk to Mr. Hallett—I said I was managing the sale of the pictures for him—I was at Hare Court mostly every day, sometimes two or three times a day and sometimes two or three days a week—I was in the hall on one or two occasions when Stern was there—I was not at Hare Court when Sandman was there—I saw him at Lincoln's Inn when he went for the pictures—I was not very far away—I did not go there with Mr. Hallett—I was standing close against the cart watching—I did not see Mr. Hallett there at all—he had no doubt gone on, because I called at his chambers, and the clerk told me he had gone to Lincoln's Inn, and I followed—I did not go into the house—when I said before the Magis<lb/>trate "On the 8th October the prisoner called on me at Hare Court and produced the order marked A," I meant that he called on Mr. Hallett and produced the order to him—I was under the impression that Sandman signed the receipt—Stern was not in custody then—it was well under<lb/>stood that Sandman came on behalf of Stern to fetch the 4,000 pictures away—that is what I understood I said—I believe I did say that Sandman signed the receipt, but not that he signed it in the name of Roberts, because I was not near enough to see—I swore I see him sign <hi rend="italic">a</hi> receipt—it is not a very broad street to see across—I had my suspicions about its being a genuine affair—it was signed just inside the building, I believe.</p>

               <p>knew you were a lot of swindlers—I begged of him to let me get them back for him, and I traced them myself—Mr. Hallett and I made inquiries about you at Judo and Levy's, and I told Mr. Hallett he would not get his money—they wrote a reply—I was to have 2 1/2 per cent, on the sale of the pictures—when I went down to Leicester I represented myself as manag<lb/>ing the sale of the pictures—I represented my master as being one of the prosecutors—it is not true that I said I would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and settle it.</p>

On the 22nd October I received from the Mansion House two warrants, and from information I received I went down to Leicester with Spannier, and obtained from the local magis<lb/>trates a search warrant to search the premises of Sandman—I took some lodgings opposite the house 29, New Bond Street, Leicester, and watched the premises from the window, from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday night—I saw some prints exposed in the window, and I went in about 8.30 or 9 o'clock on Sunday evening with Spannier and a Leicester police-officer—I saw Sandman in the back parlour—the stock consisted of a variety of goods, looking-glasses, clocks, vases, alarms, lustres, bird<lb/>eages, cash-boxes, &amp;c., &amp;c.—I told Sandman that the Leicester officer and myself were police-officers, and we had a warrant to search his house—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100036"/>
               <p>the Leicester officer then read the warrant to him, and explained the meaning of it—we then proceeded to search—in the shop I found a paper parcel containing lithographic prints, which I afterwards counted, and found it contained 250 prints exactly similar to those produced of "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary"—we then proceeded to the first floor front room, and on the table in the room I found a large quantity more of the prints, which I afterwards counted, and there were about 700 of them, making together about 950—I then said to Sandman "These are part of a lot of goods which have been obtained by fraud, and they have been identified by this person," meaning Spannier—he said "I am a general dealer, and bought them in the ordinary way of my trade"—I said "Then you can tell me from whom you bought them, and I have no doubt you have some receipts"—he said he bought them of a man named Stern in the City Road, London—I may say that Finsbury Place is a con<lb/>tinuation of the City Road—he said he never kept any receipts—I then saw a parcel in the back parlour which I took up, and asked him what it contained—he made no answer, and I proceeded to open it, and I found it contained a quantity of shirt-fronts, 45 dozen, as I afterwards counted—I said to the prisoner "I have no doubt this is part of a lot of goods that have been obtained by fraud, I shall take possession of them"—we then conveyed him and the goods to the Leicester police-station—I think I said the goods had been obtained by Jado and Levy—I did not then say from whom they had been obtained—he was examined before the bench of Magistrates on Monday, and remanded till Wednesday, and in the meantime I obtained a warrant from the Mansion House for his removal to London—while at Leicester, on the 29th, I called on Mr. Carnall, of the Haymarket, Leicester, and had a conversation with him, the result of which was that he gave me up nine gross of ivory combs—he previously went to the Leicester police-station, and saw the prisoner, and said he was the person he bought them of, and the prisoner said he bought them of Jado and Levy, of London—I said to the prisoner "I have heard what this gentleman says—I shall get the combs from him, and no doubt they are part of a lot of goods obtained from a house in London"—he made no answer, and I removed him to London on Wed<lb/>nesday—the prints have been identified by Mr. Hallett as well as Spannier, and the shirt-fronts by Schweizer, Mr. Cornet's clerk, and the combs by Mr. Smith, of Carter and Co., as part of the goods they had sold to Jado and Levy, and to Stern in the case of the prints—on the evening of the 8th November from information I received I went to Pres<lb/>ton, and got information respecting the movements of Levy and Stern, and in consequence of that I wont on to Glasgow, where I arrived on Monday morning, the 12th—I went to Steele's Hotel, Queen Street, but was unfortunately too late for the men—when coining out of the hotel I saw a railway van drive up—I had knowledge of a case being on its road to the north, which I heard of at Russell's, of Preston, and also what it contained—the case was marked D. S., 97 or 98—after it was delivered I took possession of it—it weighed 8 cwt.—on opening it I found it full of lithographic prints of "The Challenge" and "The Sanctuary"—the address on the case was "E. Smith," or "A. Smith, Steele's Hotel, Queen Street, Glasgow"—I returned to London on the 16th, and went to Edin<lb/>burgh on the 23rd at about 12.30—on Saturday the 24th November I saw Stern in Princes Street—I was in company with an officer, and I said to the</p>

I am one of the firm of Henry King and Co., bankers, Cornhill—we have a strong room exactly underneath my room, the only entrance to it being by a staircase which descends from one corner of my room—my room is usually swept out by the porter in charge I occupy it jointly with my father—I keep one set of keys, and my manager another set—I put mine into a patent cylinder desk which was kept locked—after the robbery I found that my desk had been opened by a person's fingers being inserted at the bottom of the cylinder—I tried and found it could be so opened "without forcing—the lock back and shut up again as if it had never been opened—I also with an expert examined the strong room, but did not find that any violence had been used, the locks being in perfectly good order—I kept in the strong room jewellery, plate, money, and securities of all kinds in chests—some of the jewellery belonged to my own relations, but the greater portion belonged to customers who deposited it for safe custody when they left the country for a short time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It required some skill to open the desk, and there must be two people to do it—I think Mr. Danks was with me when I opened it—it was done in five minutes simply by the fingers—I think Fisher was our porter about a year—the three windows of my room would look out into a court—it is en the ground floor—there are two doors to my room, nearly close together—one leads into a passage, both doors lead to the outside office—there is an ante-room, but no door from it into the passage—Fisher stayed away for his own convenience, and I told him he must leave for mine—I do not know if a character—was given him—I should have had no objection—the manager has the supervision of the porters—the robbery was first brought to my knowledge in October, 1876—we had then no suspicion that the pro<lb/>perty was taken from our premises—the prisoner left in December, 1876—we believed that the jewels had been extracted from a railway train.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 33, Tracey Street, Kennington Road—I was porter to Messrs. King and Co. prior to July, 1876—I went there is February, 1875—the prisoner was also employed as porter—I used to go at 7.30 a.m. and sweep and dust the room—the prisoner came at the same hour to sweep and dust the room opposite—there were two desks in the room, one belonging to Mr. King, the other to Mr. S. King—about Christmas, 1875, or January, 1876, the prisoner showed me a round box with a turquoise bracelet—he said "This is how I have property placed under my care," and asked me if I knew where to sell it—I told him "No"—he showed it to me the following day in the basement, and asked if I had found out where to sell it—I told him "No, I had not troubled about it"—that was about 7.30 a.m.—in the afternoon he again asked me if I knew who would buy it—I said I would try and sell it—he gave it to me then—I took it to Mr. Mosedale's, at the Golden Horse, in Aldersgate Street—Mosedale told me where to sell it, and I went to a Mr. Farnham, in Charles Street, Drury Lane, who offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I brought it back as Draper directed me, and afterwards took it to Farn<lb/>hain's and received the amount—I gave the money to Draper, who gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it—Draper afterwards showed me a gold watch—that was in the basement—he asked me to take it to Farnham's—we both went—I was not present when he sold it, but he told me that he had sold it—I do not remember the amount—in January or the beginning of February, 1876, Draper said he had heard that there was a great amount of pro<lb/>perty in the safe, and asked me if I knew where the keys were kept—he said he would not mind doing anything against Mr. King—he had a little ill-feeling against him, I believe—I told him I believed Mr. Danks took the keys away with him every night—Draper on several occasions during the day, when we went to have some beer, asked me if I could find out where the keys were kept—I told him "No"—one morning he came when I was cleaning out Mr. King's office—we talked about the safe—we noticed the desk was not fastened properly—you could see that the bolts had not gone into the catch properly at the top of Mr. Seymour King's desk—we pulled the top of the desk, and it came open—we saw the keys just inside—I said "I suppose those are the keys"—we went down and unlocked the safe—we did not take anything then—the next morning we got the keys in the same way—we took a box containing jewellery—Draper went into the safe while I listened at the door at the end of the stairs—Draper broke open the box and emptied the contents into a handkerchief—we had also fastened Mr. King's door to prevent any one coming upon us—I saw a diamond ring with three stones in it, and other things which I cannot remember—Draper did the box up again, and put it back—we locked the safe up, and put the keys back—we went to Farnharn's and arranged to meet him in the City Road, and then go to Draper's house, at 43, Nicholas Street—we met Farnham with another man whom I don't know—the things were shown to Farnham at Draper's lodgings—</p>

               <p>Draper said to Farnham "We have got a lot of stuff—we want you to price each article separately"—Farnham refused to do that—Draper said "You won't have it at all, then"—Farnham went out—we had some drink and then parted—I afterwards took the things to Mosedale Draper was not with me then, but he went in the afternoon—Mosedale said he could very likely sell it to a relation of his in the country—he would take it the following morning, and if we called in the evening he would tell us the price—we went the following day, when Mosedale offered 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—Draper said he would not take it, and took the jewellery away—in the beginning of the next week he said "I am short of money—we had better get rid of that stuff—it is dangerous to have it about"—he gave it to me, and I took it to Farnham's, and sold it for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—part of "the money was paid then and part on the following week—I met Draper, gave him half the money, and kept the other half—two or three mornings afterwards we again went to the strong room—having locked the door, the same as before, I listened at the door while Draper went to the safe—he brought out a dressing-case, broke it open, and took out some rings and a lady's watch, and did the case up again and put it back—Draper said he would not let Farnham have any more because he was chiselling us, and that he had found out a man who would buy it, and give us a better price for it—the case was taken to Draper's lodgings—I went there after I had done work, about 7 or 8 p.m.—I saw Draper and the man Mason who is here to-day—Draper said Mason knew a man named Oakley, of a public-house in Hoxton Square—he did not say the name of the house, but I think it was the Prince Albert—Draper and Mason went in first, and then came and told me it was all right, and Mason held open a side door—we went upstairs into a concert room—the public-house is near Shoreditch railway-station on the North London Railway—Draper produced the jewellery and showed it to Oakley, who offered 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and part was paid then—Mason had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and Draper gave him some—we went into Mr. King's safe four or five times altogether—on one occasion this square leather box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing a tin box was, broken open and some rings, silver bracelets, and silver brooches taken—the box has Captain Tullock's name on it—this is the bracelet—it has turquoise stones in it—Mason said "Don't let Oakley have the bracelet; I can get more money than Oakley can give you for it"—he did not say what he would do with it—I left Mr. King's employment in June, 1876—I saw the prisoner several times since—he used to come where I worked—he came once in my dinner time, and told me that a desk had been sent into the country, and that when it arrived it was discovered to be opened—he saw me again, and said that a case which he had mentioned to me was insured for l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he said "That's the one Farnham had"—he came to me day after day—he said they were all being watched, and they had to be very careful what they did.</p>

James Street, St. George's Road, Holloway, and before that at 5, John Street—after my last conviction I made a statement and gave it to the Governor, in consequence of which Sergeant Brett came and asked me questions—I know the prisoner—I became acquainted with him at a beershop in Mary Street, Hoxton, which was kept by Thomas Jackson—about April, 1876, the prisoner spoke to me about jewellery, and in consequence of what ho said I met him at the corner of a street where his lodgings were,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 2, Jerusalem Court, Clerken<lb/>well—the prisoner resided there till his apprehension—he came there in April last—he is a widower and had two children, the deceased, aged seven, and a girl about thirteen—the deceased was taken ill three or four weeks before its death—he had a cold and cough—he was confined to his bed the last fortnight, and got very much worse the last week—he would take no food; it was offered to him by the. prisoner, but he seemed quite unable to take it—no medical man was called in until the day of his death; the prisoner then sent me for one—I ought to have fetched him some hours before, but I was not very well—the prisoner knocked at my door about 8 in the morning and wished me to do so, but I did not until half-past—I then fetched Mr. Hunter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was very fond of the child—he is a cabinet-maker, and went out to work about 8 every morning, after having breakfast with his children—he came back to dinner at 1, then went to work again, and came home about 8—the children were very well fed—they used to come and play with my children during the day, and some<lb/>times brought their food and ate it with them—I have three at home—the prisoner gave the child two doses of castor-oil and a little magnesia and rhubarb—he asked my advice about it—a mustard-poultice was applied to the child twice—he gave it some fried sole, mutton broth, stewed eels, eggs and rice, sherry, and a little weak brandy and water—I told him the best thing was to keep the child up with plenty of food, and he did so—he gave the children too much rather than too little—on the day of its death it had two or three spoonfuls of weak brandy and water and a sponge-cake—he asked me while he was at work to look after the child, and frequently consulted me about it—it seemed to be getting better at one time shortly before its death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the faculty of physicians and surgeons—on 26th November, about 2 o'clock, I was called to the prisoner's house where I saw Mrs. Taylor, the deceased child, and a little girl—the child was then in a dying state, and it died within a few—, minutes—it was lying on a bed with hardly any clothing on it, simply a sheet and a very thin coverlet, and an old piece of coarse sacking—there was no fire—on a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination I found the body very badly nourished and very dirty—the internal organs were generally healthy, except the right lung, that was quite broken up, disorganised, a mass of corruption; the entire lung was in a state of gangrene—there was no trace of fat in the body—the cause of death was exhaustion from the gangrene—the gangrene was caused by inflammation of the lung which had not been attended to—it is impossible to say how long the child had been suffering from gangrene; I should say three or four days possibly;</p>

               <p>it might have set in very quickly—I think there is a very strong proba<lb/>bility if the inflammation of the lung had been treated the life would have been saved; it is a disease which is amenable to treatment—I should say the child must have suffered very much to have been in the state it was.</p>

I have known Newbury some time—he is not really deaf; he could hear very well at the police-station, and nothing had to be repeated to him at the police-court—on 24th Sep<lb/>tember, about 8 o'clock, McGrath came to me, and said "Sergeant, there has been a stabbing case down at the Strangers' Home, and they say I have got something to do with it; I struck one of them with my belt"—I said "What did you want to strike them for?"—he said "I thought they were going to stab me, one of my mates said 'Look out, Jack, he has got a knife,' and I struck one of them in self-defence"—he took off his belt, twisted it round his hand, and showed me how he used it—what I call a belt is a strap which he uses instead of braces—I took him to the Home, where the three Arabs were, who made me understand by gestures that he was one of their assailants, and McGrath went upon his knees, in an attitude of prayer, and said "So help me God I know nothing about it"—I took off his belt and examined it—there were no blood-marks on it—he made a variety of rambling incoherent statements to the effect that he knew nothing of it, and used the belt in self-defence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These books were brought to our office by a clerk who is here, and who made the search at the premises—I have had ex<lb/>perience in investigating accounts—I cannot speak to alterations in these books, I can to omissions—although certain items may be put in the day-books, they are not properly posted into the ledger—I have not found any <hi rend="italic">cooking</hi> of the figures—Madame Guigues is only debited with one sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1875—there is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the earlier part of the year with simply the name "Arnoux" against it—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in August, 1876, is simply put to the debit of "Arnoux," no application of it is shown—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen warehouseman, of 34, Golden Square—I am one of the prisoner's creditors, and was appointed trustee of his bankruptcy on 30th April—I first knew that he was in embarrassed cir<lb/>cumstances late in February—a Mr. Price came to see me, and I saw Mr. Herbert, the solicitor—he told me that the prisoner was under certain obligations to his cousin and late partner, and that a bill of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was coming due; that Arnoux was unable to meet the bill, and had been advised to consult him in reference to his affairs; that he (Mr. Herbert) had communicated at once with Messrs. Waddell, the accountants, in order to ascertain the true position of his affairs, and that as soon as the statement of affairs would be ready, he would call a meeting of creditors—at the same time he said that Arnoux had a certain sum of money at the Union Bank, but not sufficient to meet the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it was suggested that that money should be protected against any claim which might be brought against it by the holder of the bill, and Mr. Herbert agreed with. me that the account should be closed and transferred to the joint names of the two principal creditors, Mr. Bidgood and myself, for the creditors—I believe I first knew that the money had been drawn out of the bank on 28th February, the day after—I did not know at that time that any part of that sum had been retained by the bankrupt—the creditors did not authorise him to retain it—I ascertained what the amount was, by sending privately to the bank on the 28th—I was present at the first meeting of creditors. I think on 7th March—I asked for the defendant's pass-book at that meeting; it was produced by Messrs. Waddell or Mr. Herbert—after I was appointed trustee I went and searched the defendant's premises, and in one of his drawers I found this balance-sheet, made up to 31st January, 1875; also this letter from M.

I do a considerable business—mine is a wholesale house—I have had a large experience with traders of the class of the prisoner, and have had unfortunately to do with bankrupts—I was never a trustee in bankruptcy before—I have had no experience in dealing with fraudulent bankrupts—my firm had business transactions with Travers for many years, and with his predecessors—they did a fair<lb/>ish business—I knew the prisoner was their foreman previous to 1867—I know nothing about his buying out M. Arnoux, but I knew that he became a successor to M. Gautier and dealt with M. Arnoux personally from that date—I met him occasionally as one of the staff—I believe he conducted his trade with us fairly—in 1876 the prisoner was in good credit with our house—his account in 1875-6 was about as usual, and within five months of his bankruptcy he paid us 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in Decem<lb/>ber or January—there was usually a balance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more against him—we proved for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he might have increased the amount, many do before bankruptcy—Mr. Waddell took possession of his book in the first instance—the Court has continued to confide in him—I got a report, but not all the bankrupt's books—I went to his place while the man was in possession—I raised the lid of a desk and saw a pass-book and a balance-sheet—the bankrupt then came to my side and said <hi rend="italic">"</hi> What do you want with them?"—I said "I am trustee, and my duty compels me to look in that drawer," because I had begun to have a suspicion, and he was rather inclined to take these things from me—I then told the head man in, possession to remove the bankrupt and to allow me to look in this drawer, which I only found by accident, and where I found the pass-book of J. Arnoux and the balance-sheet of 1875 which has been put in, and I complained to the accountant—I cannot tell you the date of that—I suppose it would be in June—he was made a bank<lb/>rupt in April, I think—a man appointed by Mr. Waddell, the receiver, went into possession—this desk was unlocked—I do not know if the key was in it—a friend first, and then Mr. Herbert, told me of the prisoner being in difficulty—I was his largest creditor—twenty is more than the number of other creditors—I believe 483<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the return of the stock—I believe these figures were taken from the stock-book—165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been realised—the goods were not sacrificed, because in a bankrupt's stock there are old accumulations, and they are of less value—I do not think they would have fetched more if sold by auction—I cannot tell you how much of the goods was supplied by our own house within a year or fifteen months, not much—I went through the stock myself and saw what was from our firm—I sold some furniture as trustee—the list is in the receiver's possession—I sold the furniture and fittings in Regent Street in June—proceedings were instituted by the creditors—I am their representative—it was my duty to swear the affidavit stating that the prisoner was arrested</p>

               <p>on 31st October—I did not charge him then with removing furniture—I did not know of it—I heard about the piano, that was the only thing—a fellow-creditor told me about it and complained that Arnoux was surreptitiously removing it—I understood it was removed by daylight—we found so many things against the prisoner that we felt it our duty to have him arrested—we believed the bankrupt had assets in bonds or securities, and finding we could get nothing without force we ordered his arrest, hoping we should get some assistance in the investigation—I applied for an increase of bail on finding a letter after his arrest saying that Guigues and his sister were expecting him in France, and that they had prepared his house and received his furniture—it was then believed that the prisoner intended to decamp—I knew I had sold his furniture, but as the prisoner had assets without my knowledge I though the would have furniture without my knowledge—he was made a bankrupt on his own solicitation—it was very much opposed to our wishes—we would have accepted a reasonable composition provided the bankrupt had given us security—not being able to give that security, the creditors requested that he would make an assignment of his estate for the benefit of his creditors—the prisoner was in an adjoining room, he agreed to make an assignment, and the creditors left in the belief that he would do so—I am trusting to my memory—the nest day the prisoner declared that he preferred bank<lb/>ruptcy, and my impression was that after paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would be clear—any paper that he signed was in the presence of Mr. Herbert—I never saw him sign any—if he had consulted his creditors we would have arranged to stave off this debt of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have given him a reason<lb/>able time to meet his liabilities, and he would have come round—I com<lb/>plained to Mr. Herbert of the prisoner's having withdrawn the balance at the bank, and Mr. Herbert told me that that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be placed in my name and that of Mr. Bidgood, pending the meeting, which had not then taken place—I heard of the withdrawal from a creditor—most likely I consented to the prisoner keeping some of the money to go on with, because then we thought that the man's embarrassment was only tem<lb/>porary, and that when we saw a statement of affairs, we should be able to arrange for his going on, since he had a business which we thought good, and it was reasonable not to object to it at that stage, but he wilfully threw himself into bankruptcy—the arrangement was this: Mr. Herbert promised to protect the estate, and gave us his word that he believed in the statement of the bankrupt, and that he would do nothing to the prejudice of the creditors, and we gave no opposition to his retaining the balance for the payment of the rent and rates and carrying on the business—the withdrawal of the 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on the 27th of February—he consulted his creditors through his solicitor on 23rd February—nothing passed between me and Mr. Herbert to justify the withdrawal—if Mr. Herbert says so he is not accurate—2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing, and 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due, I say is not a fair proportion to be considered solvent on.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Cheques put in</hi>.) I have seen Mr. Charles Guigues sometimes—he is the defendant's brother-in-law—I first saw him in October, 1875—I then cashed a cheque for M. Arnoux for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and took him the notes—Mr. Guigues was in London—I could not say if he was present—I saw Mr. Guigues in February, 1877, and again in April or May—I met him in Great Portland Street accidentally—I saw Madame Guigues first in London, in July, 1876, and I have not seen her since—I had a conversation with her—I got change for the prisoner on 29th August, 1876, for a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was just before Madame Guigues' departure for Paris—the prisoner went with her—I got a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 6th February, 1877, which I changed and handed to the bankrupt—these cheques were not used for the business—in January and February I cashed other cheques, all payable to self, and gave the money to the prisoner about the middle of last year—the prisoner had a debtor named Dangnoire living at Buenos Ayres—one sum was 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Blanco undertook to get it—I remember Mr. Blanco coming back from Buenos Ayres in January, and telling the prisoner he had received the money—he produced bankers' drafts for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable after 60 days—the prisoner told me not to credit it on that day, but wait for the cash—I said it would be better to credit it at once—he said it was not my business—it was never credited nor paid into the bankers—this is Arnoux's endorse<lb/>ment on this Bank of Ireland cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated March 21, 1877—I do not remember that cheque—on 27th February, 1877, an interview took place between Mr. Herbert, the bankrupt's solicitor, the bankrupt, and myself, in the bankrupt's drawing-room—Mr. Herbert said he was authorised by Mr. Coleman and Mr. Bidgood to draw a cheque out in favour of the defendant for 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lls. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the cheque to the bank received the money and took it back and gave it to the bankrupt, who was still with Mr. Herbert in the drawing-room—Mr. Herbert asked for it—the bankrupt said he could not go on without money, and that ho must keep the best part of it to go on with—Mr. Her<lb/>bert said "You cannot do that, because I am instructed to take the whole sum with me"—the prisoner insisted on keeping the whole sum, which he held in his hand, and Mr. Herbert still objected—the prisoner said "I cannot pay my rent; it is very nearly due, and my working wages and my board, and my brother-in-law's travelling expenses. "The brother-in-law was in London, but I cannot say if he was at that interview—he had travelled iron Gap—the prisoner wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the travelling expenses—Mr. Herbert said it was too much for coming from Gap, and the creditors would protect against it, and besides the prisoner had no right to keep a penny, and if he did he should be responsible for it at last—I think Mr. Herbert went away with 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he protested—I saw 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes handed to Mr. Guigues by the prisoner—on the 27th March, 1877, the bankrupt had a piano—on 20th February, 1877, wrote this letter at his request to the carrier of George Yard: "Will you be so</p>

"The carman came, I saw it packed, and some boxes, and taken away—the declaration of value is signed by the prisoner—the prisoner's wife died in September, 1875—he has a son aged about nine or ten—he was staying at Mrs. Guigues in March last—in March I wrote to the Marchioness Fourton, and subsequently, by the prisoner's directions, to Mr. Silver, in Paris, to obtain payment of a debt, and to request Mr. Silver to send it to the prisoner's son at Gap—these are the press copies—I also wrote to Mr. Herbert at the prisoner's request.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I now live in Cornelia Street, and have lived there six years—I have recently been in Belgium for two and a half months, since July till the middle of October—I was not sent for to come back, I came over of my own free will—I was book-keeper to the defendant from 14th August, 1875, till the end of February, 1877—he had no other book<lb/>keeper, everything relating to the books was under my hands, as far as he told me—I was not a friend of the family—I did not know them before—he understands book-keeping a little—I kept all necessary books, a ledger, journal, and day-book—there was no cash-book, for I never had any money belonging to Mr. Arnoux—he was his own cashier—he told me what books to keep—I was never a book-keeper before—I have not been one since—the books disclosed a true record of the business accord<lb/>ing to what Mr. Arnoux told me—I kept them according to his instructions—he looked after the practical part of the business, the tailoring—he gave more attention to that than to his books—he seemed to know book-keeping, but not so well as I did—he told me what entries to make—I did not inquire whether it was honest or not—it never struck me that they were not honestly kept—I never saw the bank pass-book except during the bankruptcy—I saw it in the Court of Lincoln's Inn—I never made a balance-sheet—I saw one of 1874, not of 1875 or 1876—I had no time and instructions to prepare one—the books would show how the business stood—there was a profit and loss account—I was there when the prisoner's wife was alive—he has on little boy—I should say he was not very much attached to his wife, and child—I was fond of the boy—the wife had been ill for a long time, but as I came in August 1875 and she died in September I had no great time to make her acquaintance—the boy went to his aunt's in France after some months—I did not correspond with him except once—I know that the defendant corresponded with his sister about the boy; of course he kept him in pocket-money, a few pence a week, I mean, when he was in London—I could not say that he sent money to him in France from time to time—if I wrote making him a Christmas box of a debt of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due to the prisoner in France, it was at the prisoner's representation—I did what he told me to do, without interfering in the matter—he drew out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time while I was with him, and I simply went to the bank, cashed the cheque, and gave him the money—the piano was his boy's, he was just beginning to play—I wrote to the carrier's to remove it—that was at his direction, in March last—all letters were copied into the letter-book—that letter was accidentally not copied, because it had nothing to do with the business—the piano was taken away quite openly in the day—some boxes and pictures were also removed—there were some portraits and photograph?, looking-glass and clock—I filled up the declara<lb/>tion</p>

I am senior physician of the Hospital for Epileptics—I have known the defendant seven or eight years—I have attended him for epilepsy—he was subject to epileptic fits—loss of memory is one of the consequences attending these fits, more or less, according to the badness of the attack—the degree of epilepsy from which he suffered would be a very great impairment of memory; it is what we call specific epilepsy—I know of no case of prolonged epilepsy where memory has been retained in perfection—the fits the defendant suffers from vary in degree, sometimes very slight, sometimes very severe; for the last twelve months very bad—I did not see these that he suffered from here—a severe one is measured by results—if he received a sum of money immediately after one of these fits he would certainly not be able to account for it—if he received it in February I think he ought to be able to account for it in March, if he had been free from fits—the effect of epilepsy would be to make his memory always defective—he is a man of excitable disposition—this is a form of epilepsy brought on by syphilis probably acquired 30 years ago—he has been getting worse from year to year because of his irritability—he has been subjected to a great many annoyances which have militated against his recovery—he is lit to be a good servant, but not by any means fit to be a master, nor has he been for years—I should say, from his state of health, it would be perfectly impossible for him to collect his ideas on any subject for any length of time—it is one of the characteristics that he cannot keep himself together for any length of time—I don't think he has been in a reasonable businesslike state of mind for some time, indeed I think he has hardly been fit to be about for the last six months—he is certainly not capable of taking are of his own affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has been to see me once or twice a month, some<lb/>times twice a week—I attended his wife once in consultation with Dr. Ayling—I don't know whether he was their regular medical attendant—I think the prisoner might be quite capable of calculating the interest of his property if free from fits for some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I first entered into defendant's service in March, 1867, and remained in his employment years—I remember his being subject to fits—he had sometimes one, two, three or four in a day—he remained in them from a quarter to half an hour—I have seen him on the floor half an hour many times—when he recovered from these fits he was perfectly vacant for a long time, an hour or two—I was book-keeper, he used to go out and see customers and attend to the cutting—he never looked at the books—I left in January, 1875.</p>

I am a clerk in the service of the Credit Lyonnaise Banking Company, carrying on business at 39, Lombard Street, City—that is the London agency, the chief office is at Lyons—we have been in the habit of giving the prisoner drafts on our London house in exchange for his cheques—on 12th November Hughes brought this cheque and memorandum, and in consequence of what he said I got a draft drawn out for the amount in French money, and had it signed by the manager about an hour afterwards—that is one of our ordinary forms—I then gave it to Hughes—that was about 2.30—at that time I believed that the open cheque of the Consolidated Bank was good, and that there were funds to meet it—I found that the cheque was dishonoured and telegraphed to our Lyons house to stop payment of the draft—we are now being sued for the amount—after the cheque was dishonoured I Saw Mr. Hughes, but did not speak to him—we took up a bill of 3rd October, which our house had endorsed at Lyons, and we looked to the prisoner for payment of it—he paid us 530<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next day, and we gave I him time to pay the rest—he ultimately took up the bill—we had given him change for a cheque in August last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We used to change foreign drafts for the prisoner for large amounts, and his cheques up to that time have always been paid—there have been about a dozen drafts varying in amount from 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not speak to Mr. Hughes on the 14th, it may be that he saw some one else on that day—I knew that an application had been made to hold the draft over—we held the prisoner's acceptance over for 11 days, and he met it—we are now being sued on that draft in Lyods, and are I believe defending the action—at all events we have not paid; Mr. Abrahams has the writ—the defence is that the holder of the bill is affected by the fraud.</p>

I work for Mr. Lindley, my cousin, a print-colourer, of Judd Street, and live with my mother at 47, Portpool Lane—on the night the prisoner was arrested I saw the prisoner outside Collett's, in Gray's Inn Road, at 9.20—I had made an arrangement <hi rend="italic">to meet him</hi> there—I left work at 9.10—I know that because I looked at the clock at <hi rend="italic">the</hi> doctor's shop, and it takes me 10 minutes to walk the distance—I went with the prisoner to my mother's, and left him at the top of Port<lb/>pool Lane to get my waterproof; I was gone about three minutes—during the time I was gone I heard the young man whistle, and turned back and asked what he wanted—he said that the police would not let him stand there, he had better move on—there were not people in the street then—I had only gone to the first flight of stairs, because a person told me that my mother was not at home, and I came down again—he was then standing at the same place, at the street-door—he did not appear to have been running—we then stood there about a quarter of an hour talking, and went to the top of the lane and saw a crowd—I went and asked what was the matter—I had taken the prisoner's arm, and was holding it when he was taken in custody—I said to a gentleman in the prisoner's presence "You saw us come," did not you?"—he said "Yes"—I told the policeman that he had made a mistake, and my mother went to speak for him, but they nearly pushed her under a cab—I did not go before the Magistrate</p>

               <p>the first time, but on the second occasion I heard Mr. Peckett offer to call witnesses, but the Magistrate said that he intended to commit, and he reserved his defence—the prisoner is a printer at the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, and is employed at night—the passage is very dark; we cannot see the door till it is opened, and then the light shines in the yard.</p>

Andrews what he was waiting there for—he said he was going to market presently—knowing that the two Winslows lived there I went away satisfied—I saw them again the next time I went round the beat, about 2.15, but Andrews was not there then—about 3.20 I saw him with the others at the corner of Wakefield Place—they had a barrow with a costermonger's board on it, and two baskets and two trestles—as I was walking by they pulled the barrow back into the court to allow me to pass, and Andrews said "Well, George, I think it is about time we started to go to market now"—about 7.20, in cones<lb/>quence of directions from the inspector, I went with Randall, and took the Winslows into custody—I told them it was for being concerned in a robbery at the White Hart—William said "I don't know anything about it, I was at work at the brewery"—at the station he said he had left a man named Andrews wheeling the barrow towards the City Road.</p>

On 23rd November at 6 o'clock I was on duty at Lewisham High Road, at the corner of Brockley Road, and saw four men standing opposite Mr. Grundy's house, 8, Brockley Road—these four men are in Court—I walked towards them, and they walked away, but returned to the same place—I walked towards them again, and they came towards me, two on one side, and two on the same side as I was—when I got opposite where they were watching, No. 8, I looked into the front garden and saw a cask standing at the front door—I knocked at the door and asked if it was the gentleman's property—I saw the wit-ness Grundy—I then went into the churchyard opposite and concealed myself and taw the four men walking to and fro—they afterwards stopped opposite the gate, and one man posted himself at a distance off, and another man at another distance, and two went in where the cask was—McCann and Hutchings went in for the cask—they raised it from the ground and I stepped over out of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> churchyard and rushed across the road, when the two who were keeping a look-out cried out "Look out;" but I secured Hutchings and McCann, and asked who the cask belonged to—they said that they did not know—I took them to the station with the assistance of another constable—Mr. Linnell afterwards brought the cask to the station.</p>

I am a sergeant in the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Queen's Foot—I was sergeant of the guard on November 17th.—I saw the prisoners come home to barracks—Dowsell came first—I opened the gate, and he told me I need not close it, as Privates Baker and French were coming up—the sentry then challenged the other two, and they went to the barrack-room, as they were over time—it was 11.15 when they came in—they were confined to barracks on Monday—coming out of the Two Brewers, Peiley Hill is in the opposite direction to the barracks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable of the Guildford Borough Police—on the evening of November 20th I went to the Stoughton barracks with the prosecutor, and saw the watch now produced handed to the adjutant by Private New—the prosecutor identified it—the adjutant then asked Baker how he got possession of the watch; he said that he bought it at the Rose and Crown, Guildford, of a militiaman, for 10.—the prisoners were given in custody—the watch produced is the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate. French says</hi>, "I went into a public-house with my two comrades and the other man, that was the last public-house we went into, and after we were in there about 10 minutes in all, came out. I said I should see about getting home, and I left my two comrades here along with the man. About five minutes after Dowsell came running down the road and caught me up. I said, 'Where is Baker?' he said "He is coming on, and after we had gone a little way Baker came up. I asked him where he had been and what he had been doing. He said 'Nothing much.' I knew nothing about the watch being stolen till I was put in the guard-room yesterday." <hi rend="italic">Baiter says</hi>, "I wish to say that I and Dowsell came out of the Rose and Crown. French went home. Arrow came out with us through being turned out, and said 'Let's come into the Two Brewers, we can get some more beer now;' so we went there and Dowsell paid for a pot of four-half ale. Then we was going home; as we was going along this man said we had stolen his sugar. Dowsell said 'Why, who stole your sugar?' he said 'Why, you did;' with that Dowsell struck him in the face, and he fell down in the road on the back of his head. I said to Dowsell "You had better go home, or else</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100112"/>
               <p>you will get into trouble.' Dowsell then went on the road for home. I lifted the man up and saw that his watch was hanging from his pocket. with that I was tempted to take it. I did not strike the man." <hi rend="italic">Doir sell says</hi>, "On Saturday evening last, about the time specified, 9.30 or 10 o'clock, we was in the Rose and Crown drinking together. The prosecutor came in and began singing and dancing; he was drunk. We stopped in there for about a quarter of an hour afterwards; and the pro<lb/>secutor wanted some more beer, but, the landlord would not serve him, and he was turned out of the house.' When we got outside he said 'Let's come to another house and we can get some more beer.' We went to another public-house, I suppose the Two Brewers; we had some more beer there, stopped about live minutes, and then came out again. Just then French left us; we went to the corner of the street, where there is another public-house; we stopped at the corner of the street, and he said 'One of you has stolen my sugar.' I says 'Do you mean to say I stole it?' he said something and meant me; in the excitement of the moment I struck him. Baker told me I had better get home or I should get into trouble; from that I ran up the road and overtook French. French said 'Where is Baker?' I said 'He is behind, I expect he'll be up directly;' shortly afterwards Baker came running up and overtook us. I said 'What did you want to stop behind for?' he said 'Oh, nothing much.' We then walked up the road together till we got nearly to the barracks. I walked on a little quicker, and went into barracks by myself. I will swear I did not know anything about the watch or money being stolen till I was put into the guard-room."</p>

He wanted more beer, and the landlord would not serve him. We went to another house, I do not know the sign, and had some beer, which I paid for. When we came out French left us, and as we were going along there was a street about two minutes past the public-house, and we stood at the corner, and the prosecutor began blackguarding me, and accused me of stealing some sugar. I am very sorry that in the excitement of the moment I struck him and he fell down. Baker told me I had better go home, or I should get into trouble, and I went home, and Baker stopped behind. If I am convicted I shall be disgraced, and have to leave the service. There is a draft going out abroad next month, and I must ask you to allow me to go with them. It is very hard to stand at the corner of a street and be called a thief by a man, but I am very sorry that I struck him.</p>

I live at 8, Globe Street—some time previous to this Carley had been living with me—on 21st November I was with her at the Guy's Arms—I went out and returned with Ellison; we had no sooner got inside the door than the prisoner deliberately came and rushed at Ellison and hit him over the temple with the sharp part of this hammer; a second blow hit him on the shoulder; at the third blow Ellison put up his hand to save his face, and it struck him on the finger—the prisoner then made towards Carley, and struck her seven or eight times over the head with the hammer—I kept screaming all the time for assistance—after he had hit her the eighth blow I hit him on the back of the wrist and he let the hammer fall—he then deliberately put his hand to his side pocket and pulled the knife out—I screamed, "Oh, Bill, he has got a knife"—he rushed towards Carley, and she put up her hand to save her face, and he stabbed her in the back of the hand—a man named Tooney got the knife away from him while he and Ellison were <hi rend="italic">tangled</hi> together—the prisoner never spoke a word while his was going on.</p>

I live at 6, Union Place, and am a skinner—on 21st November, about 1.20, I saw the prisoner in a milk-yard—he had this hammer underneath his coat—I saw him run into the Guy's Arms; I stood for a minute, and then I rushed in, and I was in such confusion that I knocked the four of them down; the prisoner, a tall chap, and the two women all went down, and I on the top of them—I knocked the hammer out of the prisoner's hand—I did not see what he did with it—the landlord turned me out; I went in again and took the knife away from one of them, I don't know which.</p>

I am junior house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on 21st November, between 1 and 2, Carley was brought there—she had five wounds in different parts of the scalp, and one on the back of the right hand—these on the scalp might have been caused by the hammer, and the other by the knife—the scalp wounds were not very severe, ordinary scalp wounds; they were not dangerous; the bone was exposed in some parts, but not to any great extent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If the blow on the hand was caused by the knife there must have been blood on the blade—there is none on it now—I did not see it that night—it was an ordinary incised wound; if she had fallen on broken glass I should think the palm would have been wounded; it is possible it might have been caused in that way.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as an Italian warehouseman in Long Lane, Bermondsey—I have also an establishment at Liverpool, of which the prisoner has been manager for about five years—he was paid by a salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and expenses—all orders for goods were to be sent to London—many of the goods were in London and were sent from London—as to the goods in Liverpool, an order was made out from the warehouse at Liverpool, and that was forwarded to Liverpool—the prisoner's duty then was to deliver the goods and to return the delivery-order by the first post to London—the entry was to be made of the delivery in the stock-book, which was kept at Liverpool—it was his duty each week to send a list of the stock-takings of the previous week, showing what was delivered in the week and the balance at the end of the week—that was called a stock-sheet—it was his duty to pay the moneys that he received at Liverpool into the North and South Wales Bank at Liverpool, where I had an account, unless they were cheques requiring endorsement, and they would be sent to London direct—he would advise us in London the same day that he paid into the bank—he was authorised to retain 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand to pay expenses that might be incurred for carriage, freight, and such-like—he was not to exceed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he sent up a list of his expenses each week, and I sent him down a cheque for them and his salary—the cheques were always drawn on my account at the Liverpool Bank—on the 8th of November, in consequence of something that came to my knowledge, I wrote to the prisoner and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had cash in hand to the amount of</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.) On the 9th November I sent my son down to Liverpool, and on the 10th he returned to London with the prisoner—I said to him "Where is the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" showing him the letter. He said "I have not got it; that is a false statement." I showed him the deficiency in the ledger, and asked him to explain it—the amount that stood in the ledger against him was between 700/. and 800/., but the accounts were not completely made up—my son was present at the interview—not getting a satisfactory answer from the prisoner, I said that any statement</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100116"/>
               <p>he chose to make to me should not be to his prejudice—the result of the interview was that I gave him into custody—this account marked A is in the prisoner's writing—it is his daily sheet to moneys received by him upon the 30th and 31st of October—he also sent every day an account of moneys paid by him into the bank—this B is an account of moneys received on 31st October and 1st November—C is an account for the 2nd and 3rd November, D for the 4th November, E for the 6th and 7th, F for the 8th, and G for the 9th—this account of the 8th the prisoner brought with him on the 10th—he gave this in as a further account of moneys he had received which he had not previously advised—I have added up the totals of these receipts and they amount to 602<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this marked I is an account of moneys paid into the bank by him on the 1st November, and K is an account of money paid on the 3rd of November—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are accounts of the moneys paid in by him between the 30th of October and the 9th of November—the last sheet, dated the 9th, was not paid in until the 10th—the totals of these payments amount to 505/.—there is a deficiency between the moneys received by him and the moneys paid into the bank of 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an account of expenses sent up by the prisoner on the previous week of 3rd of November—I sent him down a cheque for that account—there is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down for salary—that is not his salary—it was my practice to add his salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to the cheque—this 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. includes the salary—he did not bring with him his weekly account of expenses when he came on the 10th—I have not received it at all—I have not received any account from him of goods sold to Mr. Dawson to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—none of these accounts contain it—there is no entry in the stock-book of it or on the stock-sheet, nor is there any entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Kearns on the 23rd of October—I knew nothing of this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) until after the prisoner was in custody—I do not think any of it is in his handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was arrested on the day on which he ought to have made up his stuck-sheet—he has been about seven years in my service altogether; two years in London before he went to Liverpool—I sent him to Liverpool to work this trade for me—I was very much pleased with the business he was making—he has more than once asked me for a rise in his salary—he has had an advance—I expressed myself in the middle of the year that I would think about his salary, and that he was to try and make all the profit he could for me—I also said I should make him a present at Christmas instead of an advance of salary—I also said "You are considerably improving your connection, and I will back you up both in supply of goods and in your remuneration"—I cannot say that I have personally audited the accounts during the five years he has been there—it is more than likely that I have, but I cannot tell you that I have at any special time—he has not often requested me to do so—my son is not here (<hi rend="italic">he was sent for</hi>)—I said at the police-court that I showed him the deficiency in the ledger of between 700/. and 800/., not on the first occa<lb/>sion, but the second—there was only one other person besides himself permanently employed at Liverpool to my knowledge—that was French—he was simply a warehouseman—the prisoner was buyer, salesman, traveller, correspondent, and cashier—he should have kept all the books, but I found that they are not all in his handwriting—the stock-books and stock-sheets are not, and this book is not—there was no ledger kept at</p>

               <p>Liverpool—I did not instruct my counsel to call this a surreptitious book—I am told that it was known as a scrap-book in Liverpool—I believe it was written by French and Alefounder, another person in the employ at Liverpool—this may be called an order-book—it does not appear to be anything else—the 30/. a week that he retained was for expenses—he was not at liberty to exceed that—he has done so to my knowledge and accounted for it without complaint from me—I think the week before he was taken into custody he paid 50/. in one amount in one week—he did not have a running account with me—his account was not cleared up every week—the books were kept open so as to show uncertain balances at different times, and that was allowed to continue so for a period of years—sometimes the balance was largely against him, sometimes it was decreased—there was no large balance against him till June, 1876—it was a very small balance, only a few pounds—it began to be large about December, 1876—I have not made up the prisoner's cash-book to the present date—I believe it is in Court—I believe it has been added up in pencil—I have not gone through it—the balance against him when he was arrested was not 218/.—I swear that—I believe it appears so by this book, but there are a number of false entries in it—this is not a book which I provided for it—he bought what books were necessary for his purpose and charged me with them—he would buy this book in the ordi<lb/>nary course of business under my authority—I had about 500 or 600 customers in Liverpool and that district—the prisoner was answerable for the increase of that connection, and I frequently urged him to increase it—when he came up on the 10th November I did not tell him that I was going to give him into custody—I wanted to get information from him—I told him that what he said should not be used to his prejudice—he came to my employment with an excellent character—I had a connection at Liverpool, but no warehouse, when he went there—I had a traveller visiting Liverpool, as other places, not residing there—I sent the prisoner there to make a business—very likely I had then about 58 customers—the increase has been partly due to the prisoner's perseverance and in<lb/>dustry, not entirely, for my business has increased in other districts in like proportions—his takings have been about 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The extension of the business depends upon the quality of the articles sold—in his last charge-sheet he charges expenses 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for salary to French 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., extra help 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and labour 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he made charges every year for extra help—he never complained that his duties were too onerous or that he had not sufficient hands—I allowed him with<lb/>out question every expense he charged me—no cash-book was kept at Liverpool by me or for me—I had no account with the prisoner on the basis of this scrap-book—I never saw it or examined it till he was in custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of my ledger-account made by my principal clerk, who is here—this scrap-book does not contain entries of all the orders that were executed—independent of that there is a deficiency of stock at Liverpool—I have never been through the stock there myself—the advice-notes forwarded to London were written in manifold by the prisoner—I had no ground to suspect the prisoner till a day or two before the 9th November.</p>

I live at Hitchin with my sister—I have known the prisoner as a teacher of languages—he has been in the habit of giving me lessons for the last two years or thereabouts, with one or two interregnums—on Wednesday, 7th November, he came as usual about 11.30, to give me a lesson—two days prior to that he had proposed to marry me—he had told me he liked me three or four months before—I declined his proposal on the Monday—I did not see him between then and the Wednesday—almost directly after he came in on the Wednesday he asked me to marry him—I refused—he asked me again, and urged it rather—I still declined, and then he seized me and asked me to kiss him—he seized me with both hands, and then held me with his left arm whilst with his right he drew a knife out of his pocket by his side; it was open when he drew it out—he tried to stab me on the head—I tried to escape and fell down on the floor—he stabbed me several times on the head while I was on the floor—I then got the knife away from him, either by his help or by my own; I don't know whether I got it by myself, or whether he <hi rend="italic">let</hi> me take it—I used my hands to protect my head, and in doing so my hands were injured—after getting the knife away he attacked me with his fist; he twisted his fist round in my eyes as if he wished to put my eyes out—he then left off and stood at a little distance and shook a tuft of hair in front of me, which he had either pulled or cut off my head—he then walked out of the room—I got up before he left the room and stood, and then I laid down the knife on the hall table—I walked upstairs and the doctor came and attended to me.</p>
