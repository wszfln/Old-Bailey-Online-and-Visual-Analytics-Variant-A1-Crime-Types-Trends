                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Owen, and live in Wormwood-street, London-wall, in the parish, of All hallows; we keep the Ship public-house. On Thursday, the 3rd of December, I was sitting with my husband in the bar, at tea, and heard a noise over my head—It was a little after six o'clock in the evening—It was dark—I could not see a person's countenance in the open air, without some light—I heard the noise a second time; I took a candle, and went up stairs; and was astonished at finding my bed-room door unlocked—I had left it locked—I cannot say exactly the time, but I think it was about an hour before—I went up, in about two minutes after I heard the first noise—I opened the door, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of my bed, with a light proceeding just by the side of the bed, where he was—I did not know him before—I am sure he is the person—he rushed towards me—I took him by the collar, and held him; and screamed, till the people in the tap-room heard my screams, and came to my assistance—I never lost sight of him till I and said, "That is the thief; hold him safe," and he was secured by the men in the tap-room, and a officer sent for immediately—I found the lock of one of the drawers forced open, which contained property; but I lost nothing—I always kept that drawer locked, because I keep property in it—there was a mark on the wood-work of the drawer, something like a</p>

On Saturday evening, the 5th of Decem<lb/>ber—I was in the shop, about six o'clock—I saw the prisoner come in, and pull a shawl down, which hung up, and make off with it—I jumped over the counter, and called, "Halloo, you have stolen a shawl"—I got to the door nearly as soon as him, and the moment he got out he threw the shawl back again, part outside the door and part in—I caught hold of him a few yards, from the door—he turned round—I said, "You have stolen a shawl"—he said, "Do you mean to say I have stolen a shawl?"—I said, "Yes," and brought him into the shop, and called the young man up.</p>

               <p>evening, the 26th of November, I went to Stoney-school, and returned home at a little eight o'clock (perhaps ten minutes or a quarter of an hour)—It rained very much indeed—the prisoner opened the door—she took my um<lb/>brlla from me at the door, and gave me a candle to go up stairs to take my bonnet and cloak off—when I came down I asked her where my um<lb/>brella was put—she told me, in the coal-hole to drain—I came into the kitchen, and asked if she had finished a cap, and she showed me a cap she was working—I said, "Have you done any more?"—she held her work up, and there was a small bit done—I said, "Well, now I will sit down, and do a little work too before my supper"—I sat down, and worked for about ten minutes—not exceeding that—she sat facing me by the kitchen-table—she then went round the table to the back of me, by the dresser—when she got to the dresser, she immediately laid hold of the back of my head, and came round my shoulder, and put the carving knife into my mouth—she had got the knife out of the wash-house—I did not see her get it—must have been before I came home—she must have taken it from the dresser—she could not have taken it from any other place—I did not see where she got it form, before she put it into my mouth—I cannot tell any thing further, till I was on the ground, crying, "Murder"—I cried "Murder" very loud, and the neighbours heard, me on each side—the carving-knife cut me very much indeed in the mouth, at the side of my lip inside the cheek—I dare say in extended as long as an inch and a half, from the commencement—It appeared to me a deep cut, but the doctor can tell better than I can—I was on the floor, perhaps, two minutes, or more; but I remember scream<lb/>ing loud, "Murder"—how I came on the floor, it is not in my power to tell—I can only remember crying "Murder," and scuffling till I got to the street door, and her pulling me back; but I had suficient presence of mind. both to unbolt the door, and unlock it—the prisoner was pulling me back by the hair of my head, as I went to the passage to open the street door—she pulld me back—I opened the street door myself—she was pulling my hair at the time—the neighbours on each side were at the door—she tried to push the door too, and some man passing by put his knee in, and opened it—the prisoner tried to shut it—when I opened it, I unbolted it and unlocked it—my next door neighbour, Mrs. pulling, was standing there; and I said, "Mrs. Pulling, my servant has murdered me"—I had observed that the prisoner had brought the carving-knife in at tea time, with two of my best knives; and I said; "There is two of my best knives out of the case, Susan"—this was in the parlour—she said they had been in a very bad condition, and she had cleaned them all—I said, "Oh, very well;" but I knew they had not been cleaned—she brought them to me to show me that they were cleaned; and I said, "What does the carver do here?"—the carving-knife was in the kitchen at that time—she made no answer, but wiped it through her apron, and took it immediately into the wash-house—this conversation was between five and six o'clock—I never heard her say any thing about any will I had made—I never knew she knew of it—I never she her look at any paper, not ever heard her name it—she has lived with me and my mother upwards of twelve years—for the last two years, I have observed a good deal of bad conduct about her—I consider her mind had been very different from what it used to be—If I may judge by her actions, I consider she has not been right in her mind for the last two years.</p>

This will prove that I am in very deed the same person whom my lord hath, with the joint consent of his lady, Mrs. Georgiana Gagen, been graciously pleased to give his power, first to put into his lady's hands her own private property, and the remainder for my own use. I have therefore presented my own person as a witness to my lord's will.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not say, on that occasion, that the first thing for you to do would be to go immediately to Keyton's premises, and make a thorough search? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No such observation at any time—he did not say the best plan would be to go to Keyton's immediately and make a thorough search—he did not propose it—I have no recollection of it—I swear positively it did not happen at any time—I have no knowledge of saying there was no occasion, as I was quite satisfied of what had been done, and there were others I suspected much more than Keyton—I will not swear I did not say so, it is so long ago—I cannot say that I did or did not—I believe I was not asked, I should say I would not go—I cannot say whether I was asked or not—I might be, and I might not—I I cannot say that I said so—the only doubt is if I was asked the ques<lb/>tion, I am sure I should not accept the offer—I had the things mis<lb/>sing, and suspected my other servants—I did not know who to suspect at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 25th of November I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, and heard him ask the prisoner for the key of his granary—the prisoner said he had not got it, and knew nothing about it—Ashton asked him to go with him to the Macclesfield Arms—the prisoner said he would go with him any where he liked; and we all three went over—Mr. Ashton called M'Dougal out, and asked him whether he did not give the prisoner the key of his granary—M'Dougal said he did—the prisoner said he did not—Ash ton then gave the prisoner into my custody—M'Dougal said he gave the prisoner the key as he was sitting on the end of a bench in a shed, and I do not remember any thing more—I asked him about the key of Mr. Ashton's granary—he said there was the key or a key belonging to Mr. Ashton's granary hanging behind the door in a shed under some heads—Mr. Ashton and I went to the shed, and saw some plaster of Paris heads, but found no key—M'Dougal went with us—I saw Ashton take a sample of oats from the prisoner's stable, and I have kept some myself—I have kept it safe ever since—here is a sample—I got it from the prisoner's pocket—here is a sample Mr. Ashton gave me—It is part of the sample I saw him find in the stable, and here is the sample from Mr. Ashton's bulk in his granary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Tarling; we are hay salesman in Smithfield. I know the prisoner—he became embarrassed in his affairs in October last; and being unable to make up a composition, he arranged with his creditors—we lent him about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that purpose—I always considered him a highly respectable honest man—In consequence of an arrangement between us, his household furniture and horses were assigned to me and my partner, as trustees for the creditors—he had six</p>

               <p>horses at that time—we took possession of all he had—we allowed him the use of his furniture and horses—he received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from us, and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each of his journeymen-carmen, which was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he accounted to us every week, from the 13th of October, up to the time thin charge was preferred, for the proceeds of his business—we were to find fodder for his horses; and did so—we allowed him quite sufficient—he conducted himself to our entire satisfaction—Mr. Ashton called on me on Wednesday, the 24th of November; and we had a conversation—I explained to him the situation the prisoner was in, and that he could have no interest in stealing corn for his horses—I told him the quantity we allowed him for his horses, and I produced a bill of parcels, from Ellis—I said I had that moment purchased 10 quarters of oats, and 5 quaters of beans; the whole intended for him—I told him we allowed the prisoner a quarter of oats, and 3 cwt. of split-beans, making together 18 bushels; and an unlimited quantity of clover, cut and chaff, for the six horses; and that it was at the rate of 3 bushels of corn per week, for each horse; which was amply sufficient, and as much as they could eat—I said, if he pleased, I would go with him, and see the corn I had ordered for the prisoner that morning, delivered at the premises; and make a thorough search of them, before the prisoner knew he charged him with any thing, to see if he had any corn on the premises—he declined going—while we were talking the cart came up—I sent for the cart—there were four quarters of oats, and one of split beans in it—I de<lb/>sired the carman in the presence of Mr. Ashton, to bring one quarter into the counting house, out of the cart, and to take the remainder to the pri<lb/>soners—I did not tell him to take only two quarters to the prisoners—I directed the carman to search the prisoner's stable carefully, and if he found say corn there besides what he was taking, to be sure to bring me a sample of it—that was in Mr. Ashton's presence—I cannot charge my memory, whether I did, or did not request Mr. Ashton to wait till the man returned—I saw Mr. Ashton again at his own house about two o'clock—the first meeting was between twelve and one o'clock—I went to him at two o'clock by appointment—I told him that carman had returned, and told me he had examined the prisoner's premises, and there was not corn there except what he took—I particularly preased on him twice before I left him, to go immediately with me to the prisoner's premises, and make a further search, as he was unconscious of any charge against him—this was before he had made any charge against the prisoner—he declined to go, and said he was quite satisfied with what had been done, and there were others he suspected much more than he did the prisoner—he told me in the counting-house, when I named about the search, that if he saw the oats he could not swear to them—I have known the prisoner about three years—he has lived all that time at the basin, respectably, as far as I ever heard—I never heard his character impeached by any body—his conduct was to the entire satisfaction of myself, and his creditors—I believe he has two children.</p>

On the 28th of November I shut my shop up about twelve o'clock at night, when the prisoner knocked at the door, and said he had something to sell—he had a piece of canvass, and an old pair of trowsers—I offered him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, which he agreed to take—I had a gas-light burning—I had no change, and knocked at the partition of my landlord's house, to bring me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—In the mean time I missed my key—I looked round, and happened to go to six waistcoats which I had put in the shelves, thinking I had put the key there—I replaced them, and then the landlord came to the door to give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave to the prisoner, who went away; and when I came into the shop again, I missed two waistcoats from the shelf—I went out, and found him about four doors off at the corner of Angel-gardens—I charged him with stealing the two waist<lb/>coats—he said he had not—I said, "I will give you in charge"—he said, "I must go and ease myself"—he ran into a court by the side of a wall, and I lost sight of him for about three minutes—when he came out of the court I gave him in charge of the policeman—the court is no thoroughfare—I found the waistcoats concealed on the top of the palings, up the court, about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>

I went to Mrs. Harris, in Norfolk-street, Islington, on the 7th of March—the pri<lb/>soner was there—about ten o'clock, I meant to go away, and missed my shawl and veil—this is the shawl—when it was bought it was worth 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw the prisoner again the same evening at Mrs. Harris's—I did not see her after it was found, till she was in custody at Worship-street—she said she had lost them, and if I would not prosecute her they should be returned.</p>

On Friday, the 27th of November, I hear him send the prisoner out with a pair of shoes, about five o'clock, or a little after—I was in the room when she returned—she seemed a little the worse for liquor—she ordered the bed to be let down, and laid down on it—she used all the abusive language that ever came out of a woman's mouth—she laid down for about twenty minutes, using this abusive language, then got up deli<lb/>berately, took the poker from the fire-place, and used it on the pro<lb/>secutor—he received the blow on his arm in stopping it from his head—he then got up and went to resent it—I parted them, and took him into my room—a scuffle ensued between them—I parted them, to prevent fur<lb/>there mischief—he was in my room for twenty minutes, or half an hour and then the prisoner was going to take some things out of the place to sell—we overhead her speaking to my wife—the prosecutor then went into the prisoner's room, and I followed him—a scuffle ensued between them, close to the seat that he works by—the prosecutor wanted to stop his things from going out—she went to strike him, and he wanted to guard to blow off—I did not notice her take any thing off the seat, till the wound was inflicted—not till I saw the knife in her hand, and I rescued it—I saw her strike him, but did not see what it was done with till the blow was done, and then I saw the knife in her hand—I saw blood flow—I rescued the knife from her hand, and went to assist the prosecutor, who fainted away in the corner—they were both scuffling together when she plunged the knife—the prosecutor was standing up at the time the blow was inflicted—I did not see the prisoner at that moment, as I went to assist him as he fall into the corner, with his neck up—the prisoner seized another knife off the seat directly, and swore she would stab we as well—I immediately left the pro<lb/>secutor and ran up to her, seized the other knife, and succeded in getting that from her—I went to the prosecutor, and said to the prisoner, "See, are not you ashamed of yourself. seeing you have stabbed the man"—her answer was, "B—him, I wil; cut his b—throut before the night is over—directly afterwards, while I was assisting the prosecutor, she put on her bonnet and shawl, and ran down stairs—I instantly pursued her—the</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">THOMAS HAMBER</hi>. I am one of the messengers of the Court of Bank<lb/>ruptcy. I produce the proceedings under a fiat against Samuel Strong, and a certificate of the appointment of the official assignees, George Gibson, Thomas Boyd, and two others—on the 18th of November I took the prisoner and put him in possession of the premises, at Nos. 337 and 339. Oxford-street—I found the doors sealed up by the Sheriff's officers, who had been previously there—I broke the seals, and placed the prisoner in charge of the whole of the property—on the 30th of November, in con<lb/>sequence of information, I went to the premises with Mr. Parrington—Mr. Ashurat was with me some part of the time—I asked the prisoner if he could account for the robbery—he denied any knowledge of it—I asked him if he had used due precaution in keeping the place secured at night—he told me he had, and that no person had access but himself—I went with Mr. Ashurst the next day and the same questions were repeated—the prisoner still denied all knowledge of the robbery—he said, his wife and two persons were the only visitors that he saw—one was a person whose name he did not recollect—he did not state where he had been while the visitors were there—he was asked how many times his wife had visited him, and he said, three times, and that the other persons were merely casual visitors, as they passed—Mr. Ashrust questioned him very particularly as to the pro<lb/>perty—he still denied all knowledge of it—Mr. Ashurst cautioned him, that if he found any thing, however trifling, in his lodgings, he should con<lb/>sider him guilty of the whole, and he should be punished—he said he wads quite contened that it should be so, and he gave directions, in a written note to his wife, to permit us to see every place belonging to him, at his lodgings—we went to his lodgings in Nelson-street, Commercial-road—he was asked id any one else could have taken any thing while he was there—he said, "Certainly not," because he had secured the place with a seal, placed by himself—he told us his lodgings were at No. 5, New Nelson-street—I went there in company with Mr. Parrington, Mr. Strong, the bankrupt, and Mr. Wooley, his foreman—the lodgings were searched, and we found a remnant of a piece of linen, which is now in Court—It is about eight yards—It was found in a drawer in the room, at his lodgings, Mrs. Atherways's, who, I believe, is the prisoner's sister-in-law—those lodgings were searched in my presence—a box was found, containing silk and mercery goods; and a portmanten, containing rib ands—It was found just as they are produced—after that, I went back to Oxford-street, and gave the prisoner into custody—I examined the seals, and they were broken—from the inventory and the cost price which I saw marked, I should think the property produced is worth from 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I desired the prisoner to turn out his pockets, and found about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver—I found a letter at his lodging—I know his handwriting; this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "19th of November, 1835, 337, Oxford-street.

I became a bankrupt, and the prisoner was put into possession, at my premises—I and my family were excluded from the part where the property was—I was in the shops three or four times afterwards—the prisoner was always there—this piece of cloth was in my stock where I became bankrupt, and this piece of velvet was mine, I am certain of it—I had seen it previously to the Sheriff coming to take possession—It had not been sold, to my knowledge—I don't know Mrs. Waterway—she is a poor woman, and not likely to buy velvet of this description—when my property was seized the doors were fastened up, and sents put upon then—I went into the counting-house, I believe, twice afterwards, and the seals were taken off the door, that I might get my books out—Mr. Mason was with me at those times—he saw the seals broken for me to get in, and he sealed them up again—to the best of my belief, the whole of the pro<lb/>perty is mine—I did not take any article away, nor did Mr. Mason.</p>

On Friday afternoon, between four and five o'clock, the pri<lb/>soner Healey came to my shop, to offer me a glad watch—he said it cost him 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he wanted 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and said he was a decayed farmer, which made him want to sell it—In consequence of the price he asked, I was well convinced he did not know the value of it, and asked if he had any person who knew that it was his—he said he had a man at the door—he opened the door, and called in Saunders (but before that Healey said his name was Walker)—I told Saunders to come into my parlour, and asked him if he knew the other man had a gold watch—he said, "Yes, he found it in Oxford-road"—I went to Healey again, and said, "What, did you my you gave for it 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes, but there was a chain and seals to it, which made it come to that price"—he then fainted away—I took him in, and gave him a glass of water—he recovered, and I asked him if he could bring any other person—he said yes, and named a butcher—he went away after I had taken a description of his person, and brought a butcher—I took him into my parlour and he prevaricated—I said I should give them into custody—they all ran out of the shop—I ran, and brought them back.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Messrs. Ridgway. I am now a prisoner in Newgate.

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live in Fann-street, Goswell-street. I know the prisoner Balls—I first knew him about the 16th of September, 1834—he applied to me to know the price per 1000 of impress<lb/>sions from a plate, which he brought with him—I told him what they would cost—he did not tell me what they were—he went away, haring heard my estimate on one plate—he returned the same day, and brought me a little plate—I do not remember what letters were engraved on to—I should know it again if I saw it—(<hi rend="italic">Ruthven here produce some plates</hi>)—this is the plate he brought me first, and this is the smiler one, which he brought afterwards, with two little ovals for embossing—5000 impressions were taken from one—as near as I could imagine, six or seven trails were taken off at first—I belive six or seven were taken also from the smaller plate; and the small plate made a mark at the back, which was an object<lb/>tion made by the party who brought it, and he asked me how it could be remedied—I said by having a back plate of the size of the front plate—Balls asked me what it would come to—I said the letter part would come to about half-a-crown—I specified that I could not do the whole of it my<lb/>self it rested with an ornamental engraver, likewise the machiner to do the ground-work of it—he went with me to Mr. Froman, who is my orns<lb/>mental</p>

               <p>engraver, who agreed to do it—my letters were first done—I out<lb/>lined the letters, and then took the plate to Forman, who laid the ground, and Mr. Bacon, with his machine, made the ground—I applied to Forman for it afterwards, and received it, and paid him for it—I had no occasion to do any thing else to the plate—this is the plate I had to do, with the ex<lb/>ception of this fac-simile—there is a name engraved above it, which I knew nothing for the reverse—the front plate while this was being prepared for the reverse—the front plate never went to Forman's—the paper was brought to me by Balls—when there were 500 worked from the front was brought to me have 500 finished from the back—he wished 5000 altogather—I completed them 500 at a time—500 front, then 500 beck—he took them away 500 at a time—on the reverse plate there is the autograph of a signature—that was not on the impressions which I took.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you what these engravings were for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He called them "Mining tickets"—I never asked the least explanation, but that is what he termed them—I did not not understand hem, not being able to read them—on one occasion he brought two oval pieces of copper—they were produced with the backing plate, the first say I saw him—the ovals were to be used to make an emboss on the blue paper, upon which they were impressed—I was paid for them as I delivered them—I received half-a-crown for the backing plate—I was paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1000 for the impressions—taking 5000, they were 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1000—Balls came to my house to make an alteration, in the course of my taking off the impres<lb/>sions—I cannot say how many had been taken off at the time as I kept no account—I belive I altered the plate twice—the figures—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a plate</hi>) here are my marks, made by the hammer and my anvil—when I erased the front, I had to knock the surface up, and replace it, making a dent in the front—he which to have the number altered, but assigned no reason to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that plate; can you form a judgment whether it has been used since you parted with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two figures on the plate which I have naver seen before—they are two nought—a plate wears won<lb/>derfully in taking impressions—this plate has been used a great deal since I parted with it—I am positive of that, and the backing plate also.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now was Kerschbaum always with you when you went to the public-houses you have spoken of—the Flying Horse, and Eagle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was there, but he did not go with me—I found him there—I expected to find him there every time I went—I expected to find Flaum, Balls, and Harris—I only went once to the Eagle—when I went to the Star coffee-house, Flaum was there—I did not expect to find him there—I followed him there—I had not appointed with Flaum to go there—or to meet any<lb/>where else—It was appointed by Mr. Saltzmaun that I should see Flaum,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ball's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) My lord, and Gentleman of the Jury.—It is at all times a hard task for a plain-dealing tradesman, who has not enjoyed a libe<lb/>ral education and is not accustomed to public speaking, to address a nume<lb/>rous assembly, and so to frame his address, as to carry conviction home to the minds of his heares; but hard as such a task is, under any circumstances, it becomes almost insuperable to the guiltless man; who arrigned as a criminal, has to plead in his own defence, and feels that his liberty, his honour, his standing in society, his own welfare, and what must be far more precious to him, the honour and welfare of his deatr fmily, in short all that can rendar life desirable is at stake; and must be lost or preserved, according to the impression he makes on his juddges; accoding to the more or less plain and lucid manner in which he is able to state the facts as they really occured, and demonstrate his innocnce. No wonder if he feels the awful natures of his position. No wonder if he is overwhelmed by the consiciousness of his own utter inablity, and if confused at being placed in a situation so entirely new to him, and called upon to perform a duty to which he is altogether unaccustomed; no wonder, I say it is—If under such trying circumtances he should lose his courge, his presence of mind—nay, every hope, save in an uprighteous and omniscient Judge. Suchgentleman of the Jury, is my case now; I cannot I dare not rely on my own efforts to prove how wrongfully I am accused; but there is a God who protects the innocent, who knoweth the secret workings of the heart. May he enlighten yours, and I shall have no cause to dread the result of this trial.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140114"/>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, I am accused of havinf engraved plates, for the purpose of forging notes, purporting to be issued by the Bank of Vienna, in Austria, but I do not know any foreign language; I have never occu<lb/>pied myself with studying the custom and istitutions of foreign countries, and I can with truth most solemnly over, that until I found myself, most unexpectually and to my great surprise, apprehended on this charge, I never knew there was any bank at Vienna, much les that the Bank of Vienna issued notes. Pursuing the public excreise of my trade as an agent, I was accustomed to take orders for engravings, I was accused by my fellow prisoner, Mr. harris, who introduced to me a Mr. Kerschbaum, a foreigner. They told me they wished me to engrave a plate for some tickets, to be used as shares for a mining company abroad. They produced a specimen in a foreigen language, a precise fac-simile, of which they required me to engrave. we agreed as to price, they paid me a deposit, and I set to work. I had no doubt nor hesitation on my own mind, nor the slightest misgiving as to the truth of their representaion, for the specimen did not at all look lik any bank-note I had ever seen or heard of. The language it is true, I could not read nor understand; but that gave me no uneasiness; nor was I indeed acquinted with any person who could have translated the purport of the ticket to me. I set to work publicly. I gave the work to workmen. I did not caution them to keep the work secret. I did not attempt at all to conceal what I was doing; with that candour and fearlessness which can only spring from a good conscience, I would rather have exhibited to al men, than con<lb/>cealed from any one, an order so creditable to my skill as a workman. When the plate was finished, I went to the coffee-shop where my employ<lb/>ers had directed me to meet them—and there, in a public room, in which dozens or men might have been present, I openly produced the plates which had been ordered of me. Nay, when the officers came and took me into custody, I still perserved in the same open and candid line of conduct. I made no attempt at concealment, but told them at once where they might find the specimen, after which I had engraved. And mark, I pray you, Gentlemen of the Jury, in what part of my house I kept this document, so dangerous to any one acquainted with its real nature, and intending to use it for future forgeries—It was kept in an open trunk in my parlour, to which my wife and my children could at all times have access.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, this is my simple statement. It is true—your own common sense will tell you it is so; and the inference is a plain one. A man who is about committing a serious crime, which the laws punish with severity, will use every precaution in his power to hide what he is about; but if, on the countrary, a man is concerned in doing that, which the laws of his country visit with a severe punishment, but which, nevertheless, he does so openly, without fear, and without any attempt at concealment, the presumption must be, that he is ignorant of the criminal nature of the action in which he is concerned. I put it to you, Gentlemen of the Jury. You yourselves are tradesmen; perhaps blessed with greater aflluence than has fallen to my share. But still you are tradesmen—you have wives and children to maintain, rents and taxes to pay. You depend upon your trade, upon the honest exercise of your industry, as the means of meeting your many wants. If one of you were an engraver; if he had been caled upon by a man of whom he had some previous knowledge, and who, as a friend, introduced a wealthy foreigner, who came to give him employment in his trade; what would he have done under those circum<lb/>stances?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140115"/>
               <p>Would he have hesitated to accept the order? Would he have said to himself? "This man, introduced by a person whom I know, and who appears so respectable, is a scoundrel, who wants to make a tool of me; is a villain, who wishes to entagle a barmiess and unoffending man—and to destroy the happiness of an innocent family; I wil have nothing to do with him; I will not execute his order?" I ask you, Gentlemen of the Jury, would any one of you, were he placed as I then was, have come to such a conclusion, as the one just mentoned; or, would you not rather have acted as I did, and taken the order? And if you had done so, if perfectly unconscious of any wrong, you had executed that order, in what would your conduct have differed from mine? what could have saved you from standing at this bar, as I do this day? I put the question to you, sad I appeal to your sense as men, to your feelings as fathers of families, to your duty as British jurymen, to answer that question, as you will once have to answer it before your God.</p>
               <p>If the mere fact of having these plates in my possession is sufficient to render me guilty in the eye of the law, I neither can nor will deny that fact. But if it is the intention which consitutes the crime, if it is <hi rend="italic">the guilty knowledge</hi> which rendes an action criminal, I can, and do most solemnly over before God and man, that I am not guilty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell us yesterday that you knew nothing of him till he was introduced to you to come to England? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard that Koerner was taken, and then by an untoward mistake, I dare say Flaum was taken, and afterwards it appeared that he was the person who gave the information, on the 29th of August, 1834, that koerner had forged notes in his posses<lb/>sion—I know the whole transaction, by communication of the authorities to the Government at Vienna.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you introduce this man to us yesterday, as a respectable man in Cracow, when you knew he was in prison six months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was an honest man—It was not a condition of hs discharge that he should come here—Koerner is continually on trial, and continually in custody, and his trial is not over yet—I do not know what house Flaum lived at—I have never been there I do not care to know whether he has any mer<lb/>cantile transactions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> have you any knowledge of his being a respectable merchant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no knowledge of him, but his being called by the Government, and intrusted to come here—because they call him so at Vienna—I call every man a respectable man, till I find the reverse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engravor, and live in Fann-street, Cripple<lb/>gate. In September, 1834, the prisoner came to my house, and brought a plate with him, and wished to know how much I could print them at per thousand—he called them "Mining Tickets"—I told him the price, and he went away—he came back the same day, and brought with him a small backing plate, and two oval pieces of copper—a backing plate is for printing the back of the ticket—this is the backing plate he brought—I believe six or seven were printed from it—an objection was then made to a mark at the back—Balls stated that he must have a new plate for the back, in lieu of that one, and asked me the price of it—I told him my part of it, which was the outlining the letter part, would be about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him when I had outlined it, I could proceed no further without taking it to the ornamental engraver—the new plate, which I outlined, I took to David Forman, in Fetter-lane, to have the engine part done; which is laying the ground, that it might afterwards go to the machiner—I took it to Forman to be done, in company with Balls, and received it back from Forman, in a few days—this is the plate—It is the larger plate which I did the outlining on; the back plate—the front plate was already engraved when I received it—this is the front plate I received—I took off five thou<lb/>sand impressions from the front and the back plate—one is the back and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183512140126"/>
               <p>the other is the front plate—I took off five thousand impressions from the front plate, and the corresponding impressions from the back plate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ornamental engraver, and live in Fetter-lane. I remember Labon and Balls calling on me on the 12th of September, 1834—they brought this plate—the letters <hi rend="italic">pieo</hi> were outlined, and the square—Labon said he wished it machining—I said I did not do the machinery, and</p>

               <p>recommended them to Bacon, as he kept a machine, and I was busy at the time—he said they were in a hurry to get it done, and would feel ob<lb/>liged to me to take it to Bacon, and get it done for them—I consented, and took it to Bacon, and gave him instructions what to do with it—he put in the ground-work of the machine; but previous to that they could not go on with the machine-work without the ovals were prepared—Bacon did the work, and returned it to me—I gave it to Labon—I believe it was on Monday, the 12th of September, that I received it—I returned it to him on the Friday or Saturday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Accountant-General of the National Bank of Austria. I was sent over to England by the Austrian government to make inquiries respecting forgeries—Samuel Flaum came with me—I when I first knew Flaum, he was at Vienna, and at liberty—I never knew him in confinement—Ihave heard he was, by official communication from the authorities—when I first came to this country, I applied to Sir Frede<lb/>rick Roe, at Bow-street, on the subject of my business—he gave me advice,</p>

               <p>and directed George Ruthven, a Bow-street officer, to assist me—In what I did afterwards, I acted under the direction of Sir Fredrick Roe—I em<lb/>ployed Flaum here on the business on which I came over—I gave him money for his expenses, both abroad and here—he had on the Continent four florins, or about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in England—that was for his support, not for his expenses in travelling—he constantly accounted to me for the money he received from me—he had other money of me for payments, in conse<lb/>quence of the business he had to perform, and for that money he accounted in the same way as he did for the other—he gave an account to me almost every day of what he did in the business, and I took down memo<lb/>randums instantly, at the time, of what he told me—I have them here—besides the reports I heard from Flaum I went about myself to watch him and the parties—I saw them many times—Ruthven sometimes went with me—I saw Flaum with Balls, Harris, and Mordecai Moses—the first time I saw them was about the 21st of August—I then saw him with Harris only, on the Royal Exchange—I saw him with Balls about the beginning of September, Harris was with them—after that I saw Flaum, Harris, and Balls together—I saw them at the Flower Pot Public-house—at the Eagle, and other places—several times at public-houses, and in the street—I was present when Balls was taken, at the Star coffee-house, in Crown-street, Finsbury, on the 9th of November—Harris and Balls were together—I had before that seen Harris and Flaum at the Auction Mart coffee-house, but not Balls—on the 1st of September, Flaum brought me a Polish note—I made a memorandum of the note at the time—this is the note—Flaum only showed me the note that day, but he gave it me afterwards—I think the last day before the prisoner's apprehension, or the same day.</p>

The King of Poland is the Emperor Nicolas the First—this note is drawn for five zlotych—I think the translation of zlotylch is golden or florin—I think it is quite the same—florin and gulden is always zlotych—It is always thirty Polish groschen.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What we want to know is, what is the English word—did you ever hear any person in England call the zlotych a florin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think where I live I heard it in counting the Polish money, at Leicester'-place—If a person in Poland had an estate of fifty thousand zlotych a year, I should say in England, he was worth fifty thousand guldens, or florins—I think florin is most often used.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now as to the forgery, will you venture to say that this is not a genuine note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, surely—I have a genuine note here—I do not know the gentleman whose name is in the corner—I know his writing—this is similar to it—this is not his writing, because the note is forged—I do not remember that I ever saw the gentleman write his name—I have seen his writing—I know several gentleman named M----.—I have seen the Gentleman, but I do not remember his person—I am not certain whether he is dead or alive—I know Mr. Szymanowski well—I have seen him write signature only that this note is forged—I can see a difference between these and the genuine signature—It is not so perfectly made as it should be—I have seen several forged notes here, and several at Warsaw—I never saw a forged note abroad, with the water-mark to it—the water<lb/>mark is, assuredly, one of the great distinctions between a genuine note and a forged one; but this has the water-mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what do you judge of the note being forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Beside the signatures not being so perfect as they ought to be, I have observed it a long time, and have found that there are difference that assure me it is forged—I can see that the squares are larger in this note than in my genuine note—the colour of his note is the same, but it is not the same kinds of paper as our notes are—our notes are all on one sort of paper—there should not be any difference in them—a person in England, not understanding the Polish language, might take this to be a genuine note—the word "<hi rend="italic">Roku</hi>," signifies the year—I persist in saying there is a dif<lb/>ference in the size of these squares.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furrier. In November I lived in the prisoner's house, and live there still—I remember Monday night, the 23rd of No<lb/>vember, perfectly well—there were four beds in the room, I slept in that night—O'Neil and his wife occupied one bed—I went to bed at nine o'clock of a few minutes before—there was a girl asleep in bed with Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil—to the best of my remembrance she was between fourteen and fifteen years old—I slept in the first bed, on the left hand side, at the entrance from the stair-case—Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil in the first bed on the right hand side—two strangers in another, and Gollocker and his wife in the bed along side Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil—I was not well that night, and was awake in great pain till midnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now could any one have got out of Mr. O'Neil's bed, thrown up the window, and locked at people out of the window at eleven o'clock, or about the time, without your seeing or hearing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am confident they could not—no one did so—Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil were both very much in<lb/>toxicated that night—the man more so than the woman—I got up in the morning at half-past seven o'clock—my illness obliged me to go down stairs twice that night—I consider the first time was about half-past nine o'clock, and second about a quarter past ten o'clock—the prisoner was very ill indeed that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella maker. On the 23rd of No<lb/>vember I lodged at Mr. Jackson's, and have lodged there about six weeks—I have a wife and child—I went to bed about half-past nine o'clock, on Monday, the 23rd of November—my room was on the first floor—there were four beds in the room—Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil slept in the same room, and Jones and two strangers slept in the same room that night—my child was very bad, cutting her teeth—that kept me awake a good deal—I went to sleep about twelve o'clock—I am certain I heard twelve strike before I went to sleep—Mrs. O'Neil did not leave her bed between my going to bad and twelve o'clock—she went to bed at half-past eight—If she had got out of bed, opened the window, and talked to anybody, I must have heard</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Jones, and live at the George public-house, Stoney-street, Borough-market. There were two indict<lb/>ments against the prisoners—one was tried at the Surrey Sessions, last week; and this indictment has been sent here—on the 20th of November, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, Snooks and Lane came into my house, and called for two three-halfpenny's worth of gin and spruce—Snooks, gave me half-a-sovereign; and I gave him three half-crowns, one shilling, two sixpences, and three-pence in copper in change—Lane then said, "What have you changed?"—Snooks said, "Half-a-sovereign"—Lane</p>

               <p>said, "You need not have done that, I have halfpence enough;" and laid down 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—Snooks said, "I will have my half-sovereign again, if it makes no difference"—I said, "None at all;" and gave it to him—he laid the copper on counter, put the silver into my hand, and went out immediately—I expected it to be the same as I had given him—they both left the house immediately—as they were in the act of leaving the house, Malloy came in—I had not seen him before—he was looking through the window, while I was in the set of giving them change—he could see me give the change—he came in, and called for a halfpenny pipe of tobacco—my niece served him—I observed Snooks had given me a bad half-crown between two good ones—Malloy saw it in my hand—he was close by me, and said what a shame it was for them to give me a bad half-crown, and assisted my husband to fetch one of them back—my husband brought Snooks back, and Malloy assisted in bringing Lane back—I accused Snooks of giving me a bad half-crown—he said it was the same as I gave him—I said it was not, and I would send for a policeman—while I was waiting for the policeman's coming, Snocks said he would give me the half-sovereign back, if I would give him the obange, and let them go—I said I would not let them go till the policeman came—when he came, I stated the case, and gave the bad half-crown into the policeman's hand; but be<lb/>fore he came, Malloy requested me to let him look at it, but he refused also—Malloy then said, "Oh, what a rascally bad half-crown that is; any body may see that is a bad one;" and he knocked it out of the policeman's hand on the floor—they all stooped together, and Malloy slipped the half-crown up, put it into his month, and slipped a good half-crown into the policeman's hand, with his right hand.</p>

I had been on an errand, and on coming up the street I saw Mallow looking through the window—I went in—he followed me and asked me for a pipe of tobacco, when Malloy came in they were against the bar—Malloy saw the bad half-crown and said what a had one it was, that it was a rascally bad one—It was in my aunt's hand, he said, "Allow me to look at it," and pretended to be my aunt's friend—my aunt refused to let him look at it, and said it should not go out of her hands till the policeman came—when the policeman came my aunt gave the half-crown into his hand, and Malloy asked the policeman to let him look at it—the policeman said nothing, and he knocked it out of the policeman's hand—he said it had dropped, he stooped to pick it up, and said, "Here it is"—I did not see it fall, I heard it—he picked it up, and gave one into the policeman's hand—the policeman said it was not the same as he had looked at—Malloy said it was the same—the policeman said it was not, that it was a bad one he had knocked out of his hand, and</p>

The prisoner has been in my service about seven months—I gave him warning to quit last Mon<lb/>day-week, I think it was the 7th of December—he was employed last Satur<lb/>day-week in clipping a gelding belonging to me—he was generally employed about my horses during the whole month—I did not myself set him to clip the gelding—he left my service last Saturday, but he said he had be<lb/>gan to clip the gelding, and should like to finish it, if it was agreeable to me—I said, "Well, you may come on Monday, and I will pay you"—he did not come on Monday, but on Tuesday I saw him clipping the gelding about twelve o'clock, and I saw the gelding dead about five o'clock that after<lb/>noon—no person was employed in clipping it besides the prisoner—two lads were employed to hold it—I saw the prisoner the same afternoon with the officer—I used no threat or promise to induce him to confess—I asked how he came to do it—he said he had killed my house, and he was ex<lb/>tremely sorry for it, and that he had done it in agitation of passion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old is he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe about nineteen years—he worked for me seven months—I found him a very quiet lad till within the last three or four weeks, and then he did not come to work as usual—that was the reason I parted with him—I asked why he neglected his business, he gave me no answer—I said, "I am afraid you have given way to a party"—he said, "I have, to a singing party"—I said, "If that is the case, you cannot attend to my business"—I liked him very much—he was a very quiet lad—It was an omnibus gelding—I gave sixteen guineas for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Clipping a horse's belly it is a very delicate operation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than clipping the hoof—he told me he had clipped horses before—he never did one for me before—I do not think he was there was there on Monday—he was constantly about the horses.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the boy state that he was clipping the belly of the horse, when the horse reared, and plunged on the scissors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard such a thing—I never said I did not believe he stabbed it maliciously, but that he might have hurt it with the scissors, thinking he was using one end of the scissors instead of the other—I did not say any thing of the sort—I do not know that he clipped the belly—It certainly is about the most delicaate part of the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier. I was sent for last Tuesday week, and saw the house dead—I saw it opened afterwards—there was a hole between two ribs, which went through the skirts, and caused a deal of blood—the wound was four of five inches deep, and about an inch or an inch and a half wide—I think that wound was the cause of its death, as it was perfectly sound in its inside—It had the appearance of being made with sharp scissors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I went with the prisoner Atkins into Old-street, on Tuesday, the 8th of December, to Clark's, the pawn<lb/>broker's, and inquired if there had been any springs pawned there—the man said there had—I asked if her could, so many people pawn springs here"—at the instant a boy in the shop said, "Yes, I recollect three per<lb/>sons coming here, and if you recollect, they wanted too much"—the foreman pushed the boy aside, and would not let him speak about it—I found some springs and axletrees there, and brought them away, by order of the Magistrate.</p>

I was on duty on Monday, the 16th of November, in the Cornwall-road, about eight o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—it is about half a mile from the prosecutor's premises—I saw both the prisoners—Atkins had his donkey-cart there, standing still, and another person, not in custody, was there, and a glass and a measure in his hand—Snelling was standing by the cart, and talking with the man with the measure, about Atkins not receiving enough for the time of his cart—I believe he keeps a donkey-cart, and works about the New-cut—I have known him there a long time—knowing the other parties with him to be bad characters, made me notice him—there were others besides Atkins.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Eyers dealt with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think twelve months; he had made many purchases—Norman had no authority to let any one take any thing without letting me know—Eyers did not any money—I saw a half-sovereign, some silver, and a halfpenny taken from him—he has had things on trust, but I had the order and booked it myself—he has paid Norman for goods had on trust, but that I knew of—he has never paid Norman for goods which see Norman, he was not on the premise at the time—Eyers came up to the door and pushed it open softly a little way, then waited a moment, then pushed the door further, and it made a noise—he waited a minute or two, and then went in, and brought out the hay—he lives in Church-street, fifty yards from my house—that was at half-past five o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable R</hi> 99) On Monday last, I made a communication to the prosecutor—I was in the street, about forty yards off, on the look out—I observed Norman leave the house—I crossed—he had not got far before he met Eyers—he turned back, and they were in conversation,—Eyers then went to the warehouse and pushed the door open—he went in, and in a few minutes came out with a truss of hay on his back—he walked towards me, and Norman got before him, I then crossed over—I took hold of him, and before I had turned him round, Mr. Runch<lb/>man came up—we returned back and opened Mr. Runchman's warehouse, he there threw the hay down, and said, "Do not, Mr. Runchman, I am going to pay you for it"—he said to me, "Do not collar me," I let go of him, and he made his escape—Norman was taken afterwards—Eyers said to Norman, "Did not you give your master the money?" "No," said he, "I gave him no money"—when I went up to Norman, I said, "I want you"—he said, "What for?"—his master said, "I have preferred a charge against you at the station-house"—he said, "I know nothing about the hay"—the hay had not been mentioned to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from them when they met? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than fourteen yards—Eyers was going in a direction from his own house to the prosecutor's, and Norman was going from his master towards him—I had my police dress on, but a plain great-coat over it—I had been nearly six years on that beat—the prosecutor's parlour window is directly opposite—there were plenty of gas-lights—they both knew me—any body might have seen the prosecutor if they had looked over—when the other went into the warehouse, Norman placed himself nearer to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Eyers</hi>. When I wanted a truss of hay I always went to the warehouse</p>

               <p>for it myself—I have done nearly the same thing before, but there was the money—as I was going along I met Norman—I said, "I want a truss of hay"—He said, "Come on"—he opened the door, and I took one—he said, "Make haste"—I said, "I want change for half-a-sovereign"—he knows that I like to go to pick out a truss myself—I have even sold a truss in the shop.</p>
               <p>(Sarah Thorne, and John Griffiths, Church-street, Rotherhithe, gave Eyers a good character.)</p>
