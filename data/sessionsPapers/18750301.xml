I am counter clerk at the District Post Office, Charging Cross—on 26th January, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I sold the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps; he gave me a florin and a shi<lb/>lling, and left before I could examine the coins—I then found that he had given me a bad florin and covered it with a good shilling—I ran after him, overtook him in Trafalgar Square, and he stopped suddenly when I was behind him and said "What is the matter?"—I said "You must come back to the office and see"—he went back, and I told him he had given me a bad florin—he said "I was not aware of it; I should not have done it if I had known it"—he said that he came from Mr. Poole, of Great Smith Street, Westminster, a mason, and was going to their yard in" Berkeley Mews, Berkeley Square—he was detained while I went to Scot land Yard and brought back a constable—inquiries were then made about his address, which were not satisfactory, and he was given in custody about 5 p.m.</p>

I live at North Street, Stepney—about 9.30 on 31st January I was with Emma English in Baker's Row, Whitechapel—we met the prisoner—I knew him well—he asked me to go and have some drink with him, and I and English and the prisoner went to a beer-house together—we had some drink—the prisoner seemed as if he had had a lotto drink—he seemed the worse for liquor when he met us—we came out, and he asked me where I was going to—I said I was going to Emma English's sister's—he said "You shan't go"—I said "Why?"and he made a job in my arm with a knife—I saw the point of the knife—I did not see the handle—I felt the knife go in my arm—it just cut it—it did not hurt me much—I told him he had more control over me than my own father, and with that he made a blow at me with his fist, but did not strike me—I ran across the road and he followed—I stopped, and asked him to have a glass of ale—he did not make any' answer, and as we were going along towards the public-house he stuck the knife in my hip—he was behind me—I did not see the knife—I felt it go in—I said to a young man "Would you be so kind as to pull the knife out?"and he tried to pull it out and could not—the prisoner said "I can put it in, and I can pull it out and stick it into her again," and when he pulled it out I fell senseless in the young <hi rend="italic">chap's</hi> arms—I was taken to the hospital, and was there a fortnight—I feel the place now, because it keeps on gathering.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of St. Pancreas Workhouse—on Saturday night the 30th January, about 11 o'clock I examined the child shortly after its admission; I did not see the person who brought it—it was suffering from the effects of cold; the limbs were cold, and it had a bruise on the back of the head, a bruise on the forehead, and a distinct mark of a ligature round the neck—there was a blue mark on the bridge of the nose, the eyes also were slightly blackened and swollen; the mark on the nose was simply a slight abrasion—the abrasions on the forehead and back of the head appeared to have been done at the same time—I have heard the circumstances under which the child was' found—the fact of its having been thrown over the wall would be a very likely cause for those abrasions—the mark round the neck lasted three or four days—I treated the child during that time—it was in danger for some days; it had considerable irr<lb/>itation of the brain, was slightly convulsed, and also had a slight cough—it was a cold night—if the child had been allowed to remain out all night I believe it would have proved fatal to it in a few hours—it was fairly out' of danger at the end of four or five days, but—it has never entirely recovered its health; it is still suffering from the exposure—I account for the irrita<lb/>tion of the brain by the fall on the' head, and to a-certain extent increased* by the effect of the strangulation—I have no doubt, apart from these injuries, the child was very fairly nourished; it appeared" to have been a healthy child—it was between eight and nine months old.</p>

               <p>child has been taken from here this evening"—Mrs. Andrews then told one that one had been taken away from there by Mrs. Wells—Jane Reeves said Yes, she has been taken to Roxburgh Grove to be taken care of there"—I asked "What number and whose house"—Jane said the name was Mrs. Cutler, but she did not know the number—I then asked her who had been keeping the child—Jane said that she had, and as she had one of her own to keep she could not afford to do that any longer—I then asked her to go with me and show me where the person lived to whom she had given the child—she also told me that on the night in question she had washed the child and dressed it, and kissed it, and given it to Mrs. Wells—she said she had put on its hat, a white hat, a cape and a pink pinafore—I had previously told her that the child had been found, and that it was not dressed—she then went with me to Dalby Street—she appeared to be very reluctant to go—she took me to 25, Dalby Street, that is about 700 yards from Mrs. Andrews—you would not pass through Franklin Street in going, it is is another direction—you would pass Dalby Street in going to Franklin street,—Franklin Street is beyond Dalby Street—when I got to 25, Dalby Street I asked for Mrs. Wells and she came; I found that she lived there—she is the wife of a railway shunter—when in the passage I asked Jane Reeves it that was the woman she Had given the child to—she did not answer—I then the said "You have stated to me that you gave the child to Mrs. Wells, why don't you say the same in her presence?"—she replied "You can't make me say anything unless I like"—I said "You can explain if you like what you have stated about Mrs. Wells"—she made no answer to that—I then asked Mrs. Wells what she had done with the child that she had taken from 7, Harmood Street that evening—she said "I took it and gave it to a little girl to take it to the police-station"—I asked her whether she knew where the girl liyed, or whether she knew who she was, or whether if she saw her eh would know her he again—her answer was "No" to each of the questions—I then went into her room and told her that a child had been found, and that it was supposed to be the same child she had taken away from Haratcled Street, and that the child when she took it away was properly dressed, list when it was found it had on no hat or cape—"Now I want to find those things"—I commenced to turn over some things in her room to see if I could find the things—she was sitting down on a chair at the time; without saying anything she got up, took a bunch of keys, unlocked the bottons drawer of a chest of drawers in the room, and took out these things, the white hat, this drab cape or pelisse, and this pink pinafore (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—june Reeves said "Those are the things I dressed the child in before it was taken away"—I then told Wells that I should have to take her into custody, that she would be charged with attempting to murder the child—she made no answer—I took Wells to the station, and told Jane Reeves that I should want her to go to the station with me—I took them both to the station—I had previously ascertained from Jane Reeves who the mother of the child was—she said that the mother had made arrangements for the child to be taken away from 7, Harmood Street, to some other place to be taken care of, that her sister, Mary Ann, had told her so on the Wednesday previous—I first heard from Jane who the mother was at Harmood Street, but when I got to Mrs. Wells I asked where Mary Ann lived—she had told me the child was Mary Ann's—I asked where Mary Ann lived, and she said at 50, Fitzroy Street—after Wells had been taken to the station, I went to 50, Fitzroy Street, with detective constable Dalton—the Rev. Mr. Perry</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Wells' Defence.</hi> On the Thursday evening, when Mary Ann came to my place, she said I was not to take the child to the police-station at all, she would be found out; she said the policeman might say there had been so many children brought in that way "Leave it on a door step.". I could not leave the child there, I gave it to a girl, and asked her would she take it to the police-station. She said she would. I have seen the girl lots of times. I should know her again if I was to see her. I never had any intention of hurting the child or murdering it.</p>

The second statement was read in part only; it referred to her inter<lb/>course with the alleged father of the child, but having no bearing upon the charge in question, at the suggestion of the Court, <hi rend="italic">it was not continued.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010036"/>
               <p>the landing stage—I missed that cask from the tun-room about an hour and a quarter before I saw it come on the stage—that would be about 6 o'clock—Poulter would not have any instructions to get a cask ready without any orders—I did not give him any orders to get that cask ready on that day—the empty casks would be delivered in the yard, and the landing stage is about fifty yards from that place round the corner—the draymen should deliver their returns first and then the empties—I saw Bailey's initials put on the cask afterwards when he unloaded it—the night man put it on in his presence—there was no other cask of that same number and size on the premises that day—I am quite positive of that—I said to Bailey "Did you bring this home," in the presence of the night man—Bailey said "Yes"—I said to the night man "Put his initials on it"—I was on the watch—I have never known the same cask to have two distinct numbers on it—this cask was very nearly new, it had' never been coopered—I did not see Poulter do anything with that cask on the day in question—Poulter was under me and took his orders from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were a great many casks in the tun-room where 5, 953 stood—I am foreman of the tun-room—there are about ten me under me, sometimes more and sometimes less—at this time there might have been about ten—I had seen this cask in the tun-room before, at 5 o'clock the same evening—Bailey had been out all day—I missed the cask between 5 and 6 o'clock—I don't know anything about 5, 993—this is the piece of paper I wrote—you will find "Bailey" at the bottom—there is a good deal written on the paper—it was not all written at the same time—Bome is in ink—I wrote the word "caught" at the top—that is in ink—I wrote that after I had taken the number—I did not write that in triumph—that was when I had made up my mind I had caught when I found the cask—I wrote the number 5, 953 at my desk, which was about 10 ft. from the cask—I left the cask and went to my desk—I mean to say that no cask on my master's premises has had two different numbers to my know<lb/>ledge—they all run in rotation—I don't know of any casks having two different numbers, one on the top and one on the bottom—I never knew of such a thing—it has not happened to my knowledge, it has no business to happen—the tun-room is separated from the rest of the warehouse by a wall—the empties would be delivered at the door leading into the yard—there are four doors into the yard—the empties are put in front of the cask washing-shed to be washed—the man ought to deliver his returns first that is to say, casks full of beer which have not been sold or delivered, and if there are any empties he ought to bring them round, so that they might be washed before they were re-filled, and they were then brought into the tun-room to be filled again—this cask was close to a column and about 20 yards from the door where the empty casks are placed—carts bringing in empty casks would pass that door—I last saw the cask about 6 o'clock in the tun-room—there is a slide to run the casks in—Bailey has been in the employ about five or six years, and Poulter a little longer than that.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010037"/>
               <p>about two minutes before that—it was done as soon as I got the things—I left it against the drain in the new tun-room where it was—that is the tun-room which has a door which opens opposite where the empties are.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sure it was at 4 o'clock that he gave me that order—I don't recollect stating that it was after 10 o'clock and before dinner—I did not take any notice of the kilderk in—I don't know what number it was—I had orders to get it ready, and I got it ready—I thought it was not right to get it ready in that place—I should think there are about ten men at work in the tun-room—I shrived some porter and some single perhaps the same day.</p>

I live at 56, Hellicar Road, Stratford—on the afternoon of Tuesday the 9th February I saw Wren getting a kilderk in of beer ready in the tun-room between 4 and 5 o'clock—I went and examined it after he had done it—I looked at the number and. took a note of it at the time—it was 5, 953—the cask is here; that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I called Berry's attention to it—I am sure it was 5, 953 XK—after Bailey came book I saw it was gone from the tun-room, and it was then on the landing-stage—I did not see anything of it after 5 o'clock till I saw it on the stage about 6.45, after Bailey had come back—I looked at it then—I did not see Bailey leave in the morning—he was supposed to leave the yard at 8 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I wrote the number on this piece of paper in the tun-room in ink against the column—I had the ink in my pocket—Wren had then gone round the corner to take some tubs—I did not show him my piece of paper—I have never shown it to him—I called Berry's attention to the cask, and I showed him the piece of paper—he wrote on a piece of paper too at his desk—my master had told me to look out—I was on the watch.</p>

I am a fishmonger of 32, White Square, Clapham—on 30th January I was in the Freemasons Arms, between 8 and 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoners there—Fitten was asleep for twenty minutes, more or less—I heard a disturbance outside and he rose up and went out, and the woman swore to him and he was taken into custody—I heard no disturbance before that—there were fifteen or sixteen people in the house, some were coming in and some going out the whole time—I was there when he was given in custody, and also during the time he was asleep.</p>

I am single, and live at 4, Saunders Street, Lambeth—I have been living with the prisoner since June last—I had a child in No<lb/>vember, which was registered as Eliza Williams—on 23rd June I went to the Fountain public-house where the prisoner was talking to a young man—I gave him twelve shillings, and said "Take it and spend it with other girls"—I went out directly and he followed me and said "What is the matter, Suite, come in here and have something to drink"—we went in and he called for a glass of rum and hot water for me—we stopped there till about 8.30, and then left and got some meat for supper—we then went home to<lb/>gether, and were at home by 9 o'clock—we then had some words, and I said "Go and spend your money with other girls"—he said "Come and have supper," and I said "Go and get other girls to have supper with you"</p>

               <p>—I repeated that several times, and at last he got in a temper and stood up to give me a blow—he went to hit me, but the blow fell on the baby, which was in my arms, on the side of its head—I did not know that he had hurt the baby then, but he went to give me another blow, and struck the baby in the eye, and I fell down—after the first blow, I called out "Oh, my baby!"—Mary Taylor, who lodges upstairs with her husband, came down, but the prisoner did not do anything after that, though he remained quarrelling—I had been drinking from 6 to 8.30, and I had been drinking before that—I was not sober, and the prisoner was very drunk indeed—the baby seemed all right that night; it took the breast all right—the pri<lb/>soner took me round the neck and said "Come into bed, Susie," and I did so—he stopped there that night, and in the morning I saw a bruise on the baby's eye—it seemed very queer in the afternoon, and the prisoner said "Take it to a doctor"—I took it to Dr. Oswald between 2 and 3 o'clock, and he gave it some medicine—it had a fit in the evening—the doctor came next day, Monday, and it was still in fits, and the same on Tuesday, till about 9 o'clock, when the fits left it, and it died at 12.55, in the middle of the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Palliser &amp; Co., army and navy contractors, 154, Minories—in July last I was introduced by Mr. Coathupe to the defendant, and he introduced to my notice a patent of his own for improving trowsers—I examined it with some care, and found it to be a clever invention—he told me that he was unable to bring it out himself for want of means—he did not tell me that he had been at Messrs.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010043"/>
               <p>Turner's at Bristol, and that they had used the invention—he asked me to find the means for taking out this patent and working it—I put myself in communication with a patent agent, and provisional protection was ulti<lb/>mately registered for the patent in his name—a letter was written on the 9th July by the defendant to me, which embodied the terms of the arrange<lb/>ment under which I was to take out the patent and work it—at that time the defendant was residing at No. 29, Nelson Square, Blackfriars—it was arranged that I should take certain rooms at his house for the purpose of working the patent; the rooms were taken, and I paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for them—the defendant was much in want of money at that time, and I found him some for the purposes of his immediate requirements—he was placed in charge of the manufacturing department in Nelson Square, and Mr. Coat<lb/>hupe was the clerk—it was his business to look after the books; they were a day-book, a pay-book, and an outward and general invoice-book—this was a temporary arrangement for the purpose of testing this patent—the defen<lb/>dant was to be paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week as subsistence money on account of royalty, Mr. Coathupe 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and the employe's were to be paid by the week—when the amount earned was ascertained, we were first of all to deduct 6 per cent, for working expenses; after that Captain Coathupe was to have 10 per cent., and the defendant was to divide the remainder with us—in September certain information was given me in reference to the buying of cloth—I saw the prisoner in reference to that information—I found that he had purchased quantities of cloth much in excess of what he ought to have purchased; he had only authority to buy a small quantity for a test—I told him that he was not to buy any more cloth, and I sent a circular to all the manufacturers of cloth and advertised in the newspapers, warning them not to supply it—after the cloth had been manufactured into trowsers, the prisoner had no authority to dispose of them direct from Nelson Square—this is a notice that I gave to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th September</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">stating that the amount of cloth ordered by the defendant was</hi> 1.279<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d. and directing him not to order a yard more, as they should not pay for it</hi>). The course of business was for the orders to be received at the Minories, transmitted to Nelson Square, and the goods sent through the Minories to the customer, who would be debited in our books there—the Nelson Square premises were simply our manufactory—on Thursday 3rd December 1 had some conversation with the defendant in reference to the transfer of this pa<lb/>tent to some one else—he said he had a friend, a rich manufacturer of Leeds, who had gone to Bristol, who was prepared to buy all the cloth and trowsers—he would not give me the name, he said he was to be back the next day—he did not make any communication to me at that time about his having been sending goods on direct from Nelson Square to any persons; I was quite unaware of it—these two* documents marked C and D were drawn up on that occasion—prior to 3rd December I had received D in a letter from the defendant, and that document D with the letter was considered at the interview of 3rd December—C is a copy of it made by myself with one exception—the defendant took that away with him. (<hi rend="italic">The defendants letter enclosing paper D proposed to take the entire stock, paying</hi> 335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cash for it, together with the book debts</hi>, 553<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) The document D contains the terms upon which he said his rich friend was going to take over the whole thing—the addition to C is the date, December 8, 1874—that is in the defendant's handwriting—I gave him till the following Monday to com<lb/>plete the arrangement—the document says "open till Monday"—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010044"/>
               <p>was no stamp on it at the time it was taken away—the rich friend was to have come back on the Friday, then he asked till Saturday, and then I advanced it to Monday—he did not come on any of those days and the proposal was at an end on the Monday—there had been some talk prior to this interview about forming a company for the purpose of working this patent—I had prospectuses printed at the defendant's request and had them issued to him; it was proposed that this patent should be worked in that way—in document C I find "Cash by book debts 434<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—in D it is 505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—there is no mention in either of a sale to Walton—on 10th December I received some information from a man in our employ named Game, and I went with Mr. Coathupe to Nelson Square—I had previously written to the defendant this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th December, hoping the defendant would make it convenient to see him</hi>) I wrote that because I had been unable to find or to see him—in cones<lb/>quence of what Game told me I went with Mr. Coathupe to the premises of Messrs. Pewtress, the packers, but I did not go in—the following days I went upon receiving a memorandum from Messrs. Pewtress, and I there saw 30 dozen pairs of trowsers belonging to us—I was also shown this invoice in the defendant's handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi>10<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1874. <hi rend="italic">Messrs. Pewtress &amp; Co.—Please to receive from E. Symes to pack on account of Thomas J.

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated December</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th. From the defendant to the witness stating that he should be out by</hi> 9.30 <hi rend="italic">in the morning, having to attend Court, co., and suggesting that Coathupe should have notice, as after the present week there would be nothing for him to do.</hi>) If Coathupe had been taken away from the premises there would have been on one there to supervise or overlook the prisoner—after inquiring I found that twenty-one and a half dozen pairs of trousers had also gone to Mr. Walton—until the defendant was taken into custody I knew nothing of any bill of exchange drawn by Symes and accepted by Walton in respect of goods supplied direct from Nelson Square—until December 10 I knew nothing of Mr. Walton—the reason of the selling through the Minories was that we might make enquiry into the solvency of persons to whom goods were to be supplied—from what I have since heard of Mr. Walton I should not have supplied goods to him. (<hi rend="italic">A letter marked YY dated 11th December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">from Palliser Co. to the prisoner was rend stating that they had decided upon removing the goods from Nelson Square to the Minories at once, and requesting him to hand them all over to the bearer</hi>) We removed the goods after this discovery—we did not get the books; the first time they were produced was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You engaged the rooms in Nelson Square and we paid the rent—we commenced to pay the rent at the end of July—I did not engage you as a servant; you had been occupied in the develop<lb/>ment of this patent, as a test—you were engaged with me in developing this patent, not as a servant, as the manager of the works—you were neither a servant or a partner—well, you were as a partner, if you wish, in the patent—I paid you 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week on account of royalty: that was a verbal ar<lb/>rangement—the arrangement was that we should divide the profits equally between us, whatever was over after paying the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week royalty, 6 per. cent on the gross sales, and 10 per cent. to Mr. Coathupe, we should divide</p>

               <p>whatever was the result of this little test—that arrangement was made about the end of July, about the time the patent was taken out—it was not in writing, it was a verbal arrangement; it was made in the presence of my brother and Mr. Coathupe—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week was paid to you regularly every week, that was on account of the royalty as far as I recollect, or on account of the half share of the profits, it does not signify which, it is quite im<lb/>material—I purchased 6 yards of cloth for you to make a test with—you purchased all the cloth except that, up to the time we advertised and stopped it on 3rd December—all the cloth was sent to the Minories to be properly examined, entered in the books, and forwarded to Nelson Square—all the invoices came to us—this produced is an invoice for some of the cloths ordered by you, it is dated September 1st and is made out to you—you had authority to order small quintiles—when I called at Nelson Square, on 10th December, I saw Mrs. Symes—she said you were gone to the City of London Court to answer a summons from one of the workmen—I don't recollect her saying the same on another day; she may have done so—I re<lb/>marked that there seemed a diminution of stock—she said some goods had gone out—I ascertained upstairs that they had gone to Walton, and I said I hoped he was a sound good customer—previous to 3rd December I had conversation with you relative to taking over the whole stock; you said a friend, who is now in Court, Mr. Faulkner, had offered you 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and was going to pay you—there was no agreement beyond my saying that I should be very happy to see the gentleman and arrange terms—I called on you on Saturday night, 28th November, and at your request brought a statement of the stock and the money that had been paid—you said you would make out the statement and send it to me by post—I assented to that—I received it on the Monday, the 30th—I called on you three times on the Monday—I said I would consult my brother on the subject—the ar<lb/>rangement was made that if you paid me 1, 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you would take over the book debts and that 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to you as half profits was to remain against any debts, or anything; that was the time Mr. Faulkner was going to purchase it for 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—what I agreed to was reduced into writing, all the rest was mere conversation; nothing was drawn up until 3rd December—I would have accepted the money—when you travelled you had authority to take orders but not to part with the good—all the goods were sent from Nelson Square to be examined—the goods were packed in Nelson Square—they were put into boxes and forwarded by our packers—there was a ticket printed at first by mistake, "Palliser's patent," that was never used; it should have been "Symes' patent"—I was aware that you were getting up a company, I had nothing to say against that; I printed the prospectus for you and gave you every possible encouragement—I did not arrange the prospectus—you wanted me to become a director, I distinctly declined to have anything to say to it; one ground was the absurd amount of the capital, half a million—I think you wished to be managing director—I pro<lb/>posed myself to get up a company, when you had failed, among my own friends—you sent a letter to the War Office in your own name, I think Mr. Coathupe drew it up, I did not—I refused to have anything to do with the prospectus. (<hi rend="italic">Letters dated 9th, 16th, 19th, 25th, and 30th September, 7th November, and llth December, were read.</hi>) I knew of those letters afterwards.</p>
               <p>Henry Coathope. I live at Stamford, Road, Fulham—in July last year I introduced the prisoner to Mr. Palliser, and the prisoner and myself com<lb/>menced to conduct the business in Nelson Square, as Mr. Palliser has stated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010046"/>
               <p>—I kept the books and the prisoner attended to the manufacturing—Mr. Palliser rightly told you that the orders would go through the Minories, so that the credit might be tested, and so on, and the goods were sent to the Minories for delivery, and the money for the goods was paid at the Mino<lb/>ries always—I do not know of any goods being sent on the 2nd December to Mr. Walton, nor on the 10th December—I did not know of any bill being received from Mr. Walton for 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until it was found out—I never saw any entry in the books of those transactions—I last saw the day-book on the 29th or 30th November—I don't know what became of it—I could not find it between the 30th November and the 11th December; it was missing—I inquired about it—I asked the prisoner, and he said "It will turn up," and I thought it would—there was nothing to put down, so it was not very important; that was the book in which the transaction should have been entered to Walton—we had not a bill-book there—all financial transact<lb/>tions were done at the Minories—I had nothing to do with them—I saw no entry in the day-book until the matter was investigated at the Police Court—I was present on the 3rd December when a conversation took place about a negotiation for the sale of the business—I saw those two documents which have been put in as to the 1, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. plus 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think for the bills to remain over till the following morning—I did not give the prisoner any authority to sell goods in his own Dame and send them off to Walton, and I had no suspicion of it—I never got to the place of business earlier then 10.30, generally about 11 o'clock—it depended on the trains—if goods went out before that I should not see them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoners</hi> I took the rooms at Nelson Square in the name of Palliser Co. from you, a fortnight previous to the 22nd August—you have the agreement; it is on the first page of the rent-book, and then come the first two months' payments, both together—it was my busi<lb/>ness to look after the books, and I did so—they were kept at Nelson Square—we used the two rooms on the upper floor, the front room on the ground floor, and we used the front room on the first floor as an office—we had three rooms, and the one on the first floor we used for convenience, because I should have been rather in your way downstairs—two or three of the books were kept on the ground floor, the remainder were usually on the first floor front room; that makes four rooms—we engaged three rooms, but we. used the other room for your own convenience—the first rent was paid on or about 22nd August—rent was credited to you every week, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—you had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and subsistence money—the ordinary weekly estimate is signed by you and also by myself—this is how it is put down: "Estimate for week ending 20th September, 1874; rent, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; weekly advance, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. amount of work out and cutting, 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; total, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the actual amount for wages is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the remainder is an estimate of the work out—this book is my account with you—I called at your house on the 10th December with Captain Palliser—I first saw Mrs. Symes—Captain Palliser was there before I arrived—we had a conversation, and Mrs. Symes was present, and she remarked "Do you know anything about the goods sent away this morning?"and then we followed up the idea we had obtained, and found it all out—I called on Walton on Friday, the 11th, at 2 o'clock—I did not call there by Pewtress' instructions—I called at Pewtress' at 1 o'clock on the same day, and from what I heard there, I went to call at Walton's—my instructions from Captain Palliser were to inquire of Messrs.

Palliser, or rather say since last July—I had known them before that; I was at Staff College with Captain Palliser and his brother—I wrote a letter to you on the 13th of December for an explanation—I wrote that of my own authority—I said I hoped that for your own credit you would be able to explain this transaction—I called there, but I could not find you—I was not at Nelson Square on Monday the 30th November, I am quite certain of that; nor on Tuesday the 1st December—I was ill on those days—I was there all subsequent days up to the 10th December—I was there on the 2nd, and saw Captain Palliser—I did not see him in the evening: it was on the evening of the 3rd I saw him, when the stamped agreement was made out—I was most likely there on the 28th and 29th, I could not say positively—I remember the fact of two gentle<lb/>men being downstairs when Captain Palliser called; I could not say the date—the arrangement on the 3rd between you and Captain Palliser was that you should pay them 1, 209<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they taking up the book debts, you taking up the bills owing and taking over the business—that arrangement was cer<lb/>tamly not made before the 3rd, because the arrangement with Mr. Palliser did not expire till the 2nd December—I know of a company being formed, I drew up the prospectus—the Pallisers had a proof of it; they did not ap-prove of it, they declined to be responsible for a single statement in it—you told us you had arranged with Mr. Faulkner that he was to buy the business for 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but it was all moonshine—I did not know you were negotiating a sale until the 3rd December, as far as regards that particular arrangement—I wrote this post-card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to you, it is dated the 10th November:" All right, if your solicitor acts for them, no need of leaving here—they</p>

                  </hi>. I am an export merchant—I saw the goods that were lodged at Pewtress'—I saw Mr. Symes about them on the 26th November—he called on me and represented himself as the manufacturer of trowsers under a new patent and asked me to buy them—he said he had them in stock and he wanted me to come to see them; he brought his patent with him—I went the next day to see them—I bought twenty-one and a half dozen first, and subsequently thirty dozen—he was introduced to me by a gentlemen named Baker, a twine manufacturer in Old Ford—I bought them on export terms—the amount charged for the first lot is 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the invoice I received from Mr. Symes, and that says: "terms, four months from the first of the following month"—that means a four months' bill—a bill was not given on that lot—it has not been drawn yet—there has been no payment—a bill for 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was given on the 10th—I can explain that—the first lot were bought at four months' from the first of the following month; the goods were delivered on 2nd of December and the bill was to be drawn on 1st January—that was the first transaction I had with Mr. Symes, that was five months' credit—the second lot I brought off direct, and that bill was drawn from the date of the invoice, the day after the goods were delivered—Mr. Symes called up at my office with the bill already drawn for me to accept—I directed the goods to go to Pewtress—Mr. Spiers is an old friend of mine; he is a shipping agent and export merchant—he is agent for a house in Sydney; Mr. Moore, who is a merchant there—I really don't know that he is an auctioneer—I have not been there—I ship all my goods to Messrs. Moore—I arranged with Mr. Spiers about these two parcels of goods—the arrangement was the goods were to be shipped to Messrs. Moore and I was to draw an advance against the goods—I drew an advance of 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first, and on the second lot I drew 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the net amount—I did not give any of that money to Mr. Symes—I told him what I was going to do with the goods, but he had nothing to do with my business?—I have one room on the fourth floor, some-where up near Heaven—I think that it was in 1866 that I was bankrupt, as near as I can recollect, and also in July, 1869; I was abroad at that time and never had any notice of that bankruptcy—I don't know that they made mean outlaw—I was bankrupt in 1866; I really don't recollect that it was for 14, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know the amount—I believe there was something paid—In 1862 I made an arrangement—I don't recollect being bankrupt in 1860; you are going too far back; you will go right to my infancy—I had</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I never heard or saw of you until you called on me on 26th November with Mr. Baker—you did not show me any trowsers then—you showed me your patent—I think it was the next day or the day after that I came to see the trowsers—I saw a large quantity of them—all that I saw in the place were stamped with your name—I think it was on the 2nd December the goods were delivered—the arrangement between us for the payment was a four months' bill from the 1st January—you never did draw that bill—the second tran<lb/>saction was a four months' bill from the date of invoice—you drew upon me—I wrote out an order for those goods on the 6th or 7th December and they were sent to Pewtress' on the 10th—I gave you a bill on the 11th dated the 10th; the date of the invoice—you said you wanted to make me of the bill—I saw the first lot of goods at Pewtress' as well as at your house—it was a regular sale in the ordinary way of business.</p>
               <p>Stephen Joseph Spiers. I am a merchant and commission agent at 10, Union Court, Old Broad Street—I was in Great St. Helen's but never in the same building with Mr. Walton—I have known him about at fifteen or eighteen years at least, probably more—he gave the delivered orders for these goods to Pewtress—I sent the goods to the London Docks I think—I made an advance of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first lot—the next amount is 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the other amounts are paid to the packers and the insurance office—my share is 10 per cent.—I should like you to find out more—the carriage was paid—the 10 per cent. charge is for the exchange between this country and Australia—they were sent for sale on arrival without reserve by Messrs. Charles Moore Co.—they are auctioneers and mer<lb/>chants—my usual commission is 7 1/2 per cent. on the gross proceeds—I never refused to show the goods—an injunction was obtained against me—I was not to part with the goods until this trial was over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a financial agent—I have known you about eighteen months—I was aware you had a patent for cutting trowsers, you told me of it yourself about last June—I was aware your patent was about being sold—I negociated in the first instance with Messrs. Eaton James Co., of Moorgate Street, for the sale of it, and through them I was introduced to Cornelius Downs, of Gresham Street, who has made an arrangement that as soon as this trial is over he would engage to pay 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this patent—he agreed to that on 5th January last the first was made on the 5th December last year with Messrs. Eaton James Co., and they introduced me to Mr. Cornelius Downs, and he made that first arrange<lb/>ment on 5th December—he made a second arrangement afterwards de<lb/>pending on the result of his trial, on the 5th January—that would have been carried out if this prosecution had not been instituted—the money would have been paid on the 5th January—the arrangement for payment was made on 5th December and one month was the time given for payment—I have been in the habit of coming to your house—I have seen your day-book—I have extended entries for you in the day-book—I called one evening and you said could I extend some figures for you which I readily did—that was on 2nd December—I should know my own figures if I saw them—(<hi rend="italic">day-book produced</hi>)—this extension is mine—the prices of the trowsers were put down, and the number of pairs there were, and I made the calculation and carried the amount out—that entry was certainly made before you were in custody—I made two entries—you told me that Messrs. Palliser had told you verbally that they were willing to be paid out—I said it was advisable that they should be because a company could be formed, but its prospects have been somewhat injured by this trial—you told me that arrangements had been made verbally, and I said you must get it in writing—that would be about a fortnight or three weeks before the 2nd December—I saw the proposal in writing afterwards—I should know it if I was to see it—I have seen this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before—I saw it before it was stamped—it was through an effort that I made that the money was raised to pay Pallisers out—I went to Mr. Miller and he was willing to advance 2, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and afterwards he lessened the sum to 1, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was ultimately the sum decided to be advanced—I saw some writing in pencil on a blank page in the day-book—I saw the inventory of the stock of trowsers-and ex-tended the figures—the amount was somewhere about 1, 880<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as far as I recollect, the first arrangement with Eaton James was about September.</p>
