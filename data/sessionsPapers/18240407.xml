            . I am a widow. The female prisoner has lived sixteen or seventeen years with me. I missed my property in October last, from a room adjoining my bed-room, and communicating with a room where she and her husband slept - she has been married to the other prisoner six years, and he lived in the house with my permission; I gave him leave to occupy one of the parlours, and he always kept it locked, which I thought a great liberty. I do not think that I saw him above four or five times. When I left town for my health, I put my jewels into a small deal box, which I put in my portfolio, and when I was in town, they were kept in a drawer in the middle room. I saw them last about July twelve months - I had seen the box often after that. When I missed them, which was in October last, I called the female prisoner up, and interrogated her - I asked her how they could be taken, and said I supposed somebody must have false keys; but I had such confidence in her, I did not suspect her. I then thought proper to look after my plate, which was kept in the same room - I opened the closet and the plate drawer, and found the paper it had been in, but all the plate was gone - she said she wished she had her health, for she would go and seek after them. She remained in the house a very few days after this; I had given them warning to leave, but they left suddenly before the notice expired, and without giving me any intimation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The communication you made for them to leave, was by writing the man a note - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not expect that they were going, in consequence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070004"/>of some communication made to you - A. No; on the contrary, when I was going to bed I sent to enquire for her. I had not seen my jewels for a year and a quarter - I had seen the plate frequently, whenever I went to the drawer, but never opened it; I might not have gone to the drawer for three or four months. I have no butler. I keep the key of the plate myself, and the female prisoner went for it when I wanted it. I very seldom saw the man, but can speak positively to his person. I spoke to the female prisoner about the parlour door being locked, and remonstrated with her about it from the very first of his coming, and continually afterwards, but not latterly. I cannot say when I last remonstrated about it, I did it so frequently.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The female prisoner has been many years in your service - A. Yes, and deserved the character of a very honest person. I missed nothing previous to her marriage. The property was deposited in a room, next to that they occupied, and they had to pass through it. I believe the male prisoner was scarcely ever out of the house. She was particularly under his influence and controul; there were dreadful disturbances in the house. I have begged him to leave the house frequently - his usage to her was barbarous. I missed my keys on one occasion, and they were found in the parlour, which he kept locked; they were the keys which I had occasionally entrusted the female prisoner with - I used to put them in my couch, and in the morning when I came down, they were missing - she was in that room every morning.</p>

            . In October last. I was employed as washerwoman in the prosecutrix's house; my daughter Margaret was servant there at the time. I can read but very little. I was making the prisoner Elizabeth's bed one day (they sometimes slept separate,) in the front attic, not on the same floor as the prosecutrix; it was when she slept alone. As I made the bed, I saw a dirty petticoat between the bed and mattress, and as I was going to wash, I threw it out, and as I threw it down, I heard papers rattle - curiosity induced me to see what it was; I found the petticoat had a pocket in it, and in it I found two duplicates of property pawned at Dobree's - I took them to my daughter, and gave them to her. The male prisoner never made his appearance in the kitchen till between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, when I was there. On the morning after the duplicates were found, I saw him come down into the kitchen in a flannel jacket, a little after six o'clock. I saw him again on the following morning, at the same time; I was washing, and had some linen of his, and missed it on the third day after I found the duplicates. I had washed it on Tuesday, hung it up on Wednesday and Thursday, and missed it on Friday morning - he had gone away on the Thursday, and on that day he wanted a pair of stockings to put on; I said I had none of his; he said,</p>
               <p>"It does not matter, I will take these," which were the prosecutrix's; he took them out of my hand - this was about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning. I said they were Mrs. Keighly's; he said it did not matter; he dined at home that day, and I did not see him after. He gave me no reason to suppose that he was going away. He and the female prisoner dined with us that day, which was not usual; the female prisoner seemed very ill; she was quite frightened and was crying, and was almost in steric fits and said, Oh! Thomas, what have you brought me to" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you fret, don't mind Mrs. Keighly, she won't fret for you." About half-past five o'clock, she had her tea, and went out, saying she would not be gone ten minutes, and told my daughter that if she was asked for, to say she was gone to lay down - she never returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard anything from them about any foreign country - A. On the Wednesday night she said to my daughter,</p>
               <p>"I must go out, for Thomas has gone and left me;" my daughter said,</p>
               <p>"Don't go out to night, it is so wet" - she said,</p>
               <p>"I must go, for I miss his passport, he is gone and left me;" she went out, and wanted me to go with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. They were both at dinner on Thursday, so that he had not left her - A. No. When I found the duplicates, I told my daughter; there was no other servant in the house. My daughter gave them to the female prisoner on Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The room the duplicates were found in was more apart from the prosecutrix's bed-room than where they slept - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Baxter, pawnbroker, Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. I produce two diamond rings, pawned by the prisoner Elizabeth, on the 25th of June, 1823; also a pair of diamond ear-rings, pawned on the 7th of October, 1822, by a female, in the name of Creed, but I do not know who. I have a diamond cross; I do not know who pawned it, but it was renewed by the female prisoner - 31 l. 12 s. 6 d., was lent on it. I produce a diamond ring, necklace, and sprig, pawned for 25 l.; I do not know who by, but the female prisoner renewed them - also a muslin dress and shawl; I cannot say who pawned them; they were not renewed. I have also a diamond locket, ear-rings, and sprig, pawned by a female, but I do not know who.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you receive these things without enquiring about them - A. They were pawned before I came into Mr. Baxter's service, all except two of them, but were renewed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You only speak to two articles - A. I speak of others being renewed. I have been in the service nearly three years. The two articles I took in, were pawned in June, 1823; it was two rings for 7 l. - the other was a pledge for 17 l. I am positive of the woman's person; I have not seen her for the last eight or nine months. I swear positively to her pawning the two rings for 7 l. I know her by a scar in her face. I have seen her at the shop several times in June, and before, but not since.</p>

            . I went into the prosecutrix's service the beginning of September last. The male prisoner used to lock himself in the back parlour. I was never in the parlour but once, and then I waited at the door while he opened it; he took his meals down stairs, but by himself, except dinner, which he took with us. When I first went there, he used to come down stairs between ten and eleven o'clock, for a fortnight or three weeks, but afterwards sooner, and sometimes later. I remember my mother bringing me some duplicates, and next morning I saw the female prisoner, and gave them to her, and she seemed very much confused - she put them into her pocket, and said they were some which she had by her; she did not ask how I got them, but a few hours after she asked if I had told my mother that I had the duplicates; I said not, and she told me not to tell her. My mother was washing there on the Tuesday morning. I did not see the male prisoner take anything away, but saw him drying some stockings by the kitchen fire. I dined with them on the day they left; the female prisoner could eat nothing; she was in tears the whole of the time - my mother and myself were at the table with them; she went off into hysterics, and when she came to, the man said how foolish she was to cry - she turned to him, and said she could not help it, that she had to thank him for the whole of it; he said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind;" she clapped her hands together, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you brought me to;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you fret about Mrs. Keighly, if anything ailed you, she would not fret about you." About four o'clock, while I was taking up dinner, she came and asked if I had seen her husband since dinner - I said I had not; he was not in the house; I had seen him but once after dinner; she was then in conversation with him in the back parlour. She went out about half-past six o'clock; it rained hard - she said a gentleman in High-street owed her some money; that she wanted money very bad, and she would not be gone above ten minutes, and would go to the doctor's in Great Mary-le-bone-street, to get something for her eyes, which were very bad - I begged of her not to go; she said she would, and if mistress asked for her, I was to say she was gone to lay down, and I did so when my mistress asked for her. I was present when the rooms they occupied were opened; there was nothing in them, and nothing in their boxes of any value. There was something wrapped in a letter in the box, with</p>
               <p>"Sugar of lead" written on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. It was on Wednesday morning you made the communication to her about the duplicate - A. Yes. They did not leave till Thursday evening. I have heard the man say that he was educated at Brussells, but born in England. I know nothing about his endeavouring to get pupils. He was not in my mistress's service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the woman complain at dinner that she had had some dispute with her mistress about a turban - A. No; she said she was sorry that she was going, and her husband said, never mind. I cannot swear that she did not say her mistress had found fault with her, but I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was the male prisoner in the habit of keeping in-doors - A. Yes. While I was there I do not think he went out above twice.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he go out the day before he went away - A. I hear that he was out a good deal.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. In consequence of this transaction, I was employed to go to Mrs. Keighly's house. I found nothing in the parlour, and only papers and rubbish in the prisoners' boxes. I had a common warrant, and went to the Hague, but finding my warrant of no use, I returned, and went again in a few days with a Judges' warrant; it was about the middle of February. I went to the Hague, and then to Brussells, and found the female prisoner at a lodging, washing; she seemed very poor indeed; the Commissariat of the Police was there with an interpreter - she asked him what was the matter; they gave no answer, but searched, and found nothing except a book, which was in a box in the room - this was on the 28th of February. She was put into gaol at Brussells; she was brought to Ostend - I then took her to an English Hotel there, and at night I found the male prisoner there, in bed; I asked his name - he said it was Stevens; I asked where he came from; he said from Brussells; I asked if he knew any one at Brussells; he said he knew Simmons, a coach-maker there. I said,</p>

               <p>"I am inclined to think your name is Crees;" he said, No, it was Stevens. I desired him to dress, and come down, which he did; it was nearly one o'clock in the morning - I remained with him till daylight, about seven o'clock, and then sent Smith for the woman - he brought her; she went up to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Thomas;" he then said to me,</p>
               <p>"My name is Crees, I am the person you are looking for." I found nothing but his own property. He had a five-franc piece.</p>

I left about 2 l. 10 s. in halfpence and pence in my desk, tied up in an apron; there was at least 15 s. in silver in the till, consisting of sixpences, shillings, and a crown piece - a bag, containing 7 s. or 8 s. worth of farthings was in or on the desk. I got up about ten minutes past six o'clock on the 1st of March, and received information, went down into the parlour behind the shop, and found that door locked, but a door which opens into the shop from the cellar had the staple wrenched off. I went into the cellar, and found the flap outside, under the window in the yard, had been lifted up, they could get down there, and then into the shop; the flap was down the night before, but I cannot say whether it was fastened; there had been some things on the flap overnight, which were removed in the morning, and there appeared footmarks on the wall. About eleven o'clock that morning I went with Attfield and Garton to Providence-place, Novascotia-gardens, Bethnal-green, and found the prisoners sitting together in the same room; it is a mile and a quarter from my house. The officers said they had come about a robbery, and asked if there was any money in the house which they owned - Evans said there was; they asked if there was any copper; he said Yes, there were ten papers of copper. Garton handed my apron to me. The officers asked if there were any farthings; Evans said Yes, there was, and pointed to a hat-box on the mantle piece in the next room. When we had found all the property, Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"You need not go any further, Mr. Knights must know what he has lost." Evans's wife was in the room. My shop door was found open in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Evans said the papers of copper were there - A. Yes. I am not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070007"/>sure that Taylor said anything about the money - he said I must know what I had lost.</p>

            . I am a constable. I examined the prosecutor's premises, and saw chips on the wall, as if it had been done by the toes of a person getting over. I went with Mr. Knights to No. 5, Providence-place - the prisoners and Evans's wife were sitting by the fire-side, drinking rum; Mr. Knights gave them in charge on suspicion of robbing his house. I searched Taylor, and found a crown piece, 11 s. 6 d. in silver, and 1 s. 5 d. in copper; the prosecutor produced a bottle of blacking from the mantle piece or the table. Garton and the prosecutor looked round, and handed me two more bottles of blacking. I went into the adjoining room, and behind a door-way found ten 5 s. papers of copper on the window-ledge, and under the bed I found 6 s. 9 1/2 d. in copper, in a basket. I found a crow-bar in the room. The prisoners were tied together - Garton asked them if there were any farthings, and I think Evans pointed to a band-box over the mantle piece; I went there, and found 6 s. 9 d. in farthings. Garton asked if there was anything else in the house which they owned; Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Knights ought to know best what he has lost;" Evans said to him,</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, for it is all my property." I compared the crowbar with some dents in the door post of the cellar; it tallied with them, and with some dents on the desk.</p>

On the evening of the 27th of February I went on an errand, and returned about half-past six o'clock; it was just dusk; I saw two persons at the door; Pearson was one of them; I cannot speak to the other. Pearson asked me if my master was married, or whether he could see him, or if he was at home. I said he was not. He asked me the name of the street; I said Tavistock-place; he said it was Tavistock-street, and said that must be the place, and then he went up to look at the number, and asked if I lived with master; I said yes. He went away; I rang the bell and was let in, and the door shut. I went down into the kitchen. There were wine-glasses, tumblers, and a pair of silver cruet-stands in the parlour, and a spoon in the cruet. About five minutes after I got down stairs I heard the door shut violently. My aunt, who is the servant, went up, and called to me; I went into the parlour; found the table moved, and the middle door open; the cruet-stand and nine glasses were gone; one wine-glass was much smaller than the others; I have seen some of them since at Bow-street; they correspond in size and pattern; and the spoon.</p>

On the 27th of February I let my nephew in, about half-past six o'clock; it was rather dusk; I do not know whether the lamps were lighted. I shut the door after my nephew, and tried it, and went down stairs; and in about ten minutes, as I was going to tea, I thought I heard footsteps, and said I thought master was coming down stairs; I listened, and heard footsteps again, and as I went up stairs I heard the street-door bang, and on getting into the passage I found the parlour-door open, and the table removed; I missed the castors, which I had seen safe about half-past three o'clock; the spoon was in them; mistress had one wineglass smaller than the rest, which she frequently drank out of; I saw that one at Bow-street.</p>

Mason searched Lock, and found a small wineglass in his breeches pocket. Mason brought a silver spoon up from the area, and upon Lock I found another glass. Mason tried the skeleton key to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it. I know that the house is in St. Pancras' parish.</p>

On the 1st of March I was the last person up, and went to bed about twelve o'clock - I fastened the doors. I got up at seven o'clock in the morning - it was light then; I found my shed in the yard had been opened - it is enclosed in the same fence as the dwelling-house, and was shut up at night; the fence is a seven-foot rail. I came down stairs and found the door of the dwelling-house tied. I could not open it - it was done to prevent my going into the yard. I broke it away and got into the yard, and found part of the fence broken down, the shed door opened, and the hen roost broken open; the shed had been latched the night before, and there was a secret latch to the hen roost, which was also fastened, eight fowls were gone, and fifteen rabbits. I went and found some of the rabbits in possession of Smith, of Brick-lane, and the cock I found on the Tuesday following in Quaker-street. I found the remainder of the rabbits in possession of Thomas and Oakes, who were in a room in the act of picking two fowls, and one laid in a basket between them, ready picked. I sent for an officer and had them taken. The shed is built of wood, and tiled over - we use it as a washhouse.</p>

Thomas and Oakes were each picking a fowl, and one laid in a basket before them, and some rabbits were running about the room, and some were in a basket near the bed; I asked how they came by them; they said they found them in a sack near North-green - I cannot say which spoke. I asked if they had a black-bird in a cage; one of them said it was up stairs - the prosecutor went up and brought it down. I took them to the office. I apprehended Castle in bed at that house a fortnight afterwards; I had been there several times, but could not find him before. He said he was sure the boys would state sufficient here to clear him, that he had nothing to do in it himself. I produce the black-bird and cage.</p>

Castle came in and asked whose they were; we said we had found them - he said if we did not take them out, he would throw them out.

I desired him to give me up the key of the stable; he sent it to me by another man. I went there, and found a ream of brown paper in the manger, and asked how it came there; he said he had brought it from a customer, but it being late at night, he put it there instead of bringing it to the premises. I asked if there was any more paper in the stable; he said No. I got on the ladder leading into the loft, and he ran away; I did not see him till a fortnight afterwards, when he was apprehended. I owed him five days' wages, which were 1 l. I found all the property stated in the indictment concealed under the hay in the loft, and some in a box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who took care of the horse - A. He did. We had seven or eight persons in our employ, but he kept the key of the stable. He was never ordered to put goods in the stable when he came home late. I had told him that I should discharge to-morrow, which was Saturday. We dissolved partnership on the 25th of February.</p>

            . I am a night patrol. On the 1st of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with two others, standing opposite the White Horse Inn, Cripplegate. I watched, and saw one go towards Fore-street; one crossed, and went up the inn-yard - the prisoner stood there a few minutes, then went down London-wall, and presently the other came from the yard up to him, and gave him a cask; he went down London-wall with it, and the man who gave it to him went towards the White Horse again. I went after the prisoner, stopped him, and asked where he got the cask; he said a man gave it to him to carry to the City-road - I asked where to; he said he did not know, but expected the man was after him - that he was to have something to drink for carrying it. I secured him, and gave information at the White Horse. When the man came from him he was opening a paper, what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. On receiving the cask, he went off with a direction in his hand - A. No; the other had a paper, not him.</p>

On the 28th of February, after breakfast, my son went into the barn, and gave me information. I then went to the barn, where I had a large heap of oats, and considered that two bushels or more were taken - this was soon after eight o'clock. I had seen them the day before. I charged Nevill, who was at work close to the barn, with taking them while the barnman was at breakfast. I asked what he had been meddling with the heap of oats for - he said he had not. We searched different sheds, and at last went into the stable, where there is a large chaff bin. I saw footsteps in the bin - my son found a sack there with two bushels of oats in it, and found a sack buried deeper in the same bin, containing four bushels. We deliver oats from the granary cleaned and mixed with other corn; these were not clean, and correspond with the heap in the barn. Littleford returned from where he had been, I asked why he stole the corn - he denied it. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use to deny it, for I have found it in a place where you must know of its being put." He then said,</p>
               <p>"We did not steal them - they are oats I have saved out of my allowance for my horses." (Nevill was not present.) I said, that could not be, for they were not cleaned, and endeavoured to convince him of the consequence of such conduct, I had him into my room, endeavouring to get an acknowledgment from him, but am sorry to say I could not. The conduct of Nevill was shameful.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Not withstanding all you said, he had nothing to confess - A. He would not confess. I give the horses food in proportion to their work. I gave him five bushels of oats for his team, and as much chaff as he liked - they mix it together; this was not cleaned, but it had no chaff with it. They would have been seen if they had carried it off the premises before the men were gone. Littleford was not near the barn - he could not take it that morning, for he was not there.</p>

I did not hear the conversation with the prisoners.</p>

I then looked at my window and found a square of glass taken entirely out. I had observed it before on that day, it was sound and whole. - about 20 l. worth of clothes were taken out. I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found part of them at Balfour's, Chandos-street, and some more at Lazarus's shop. The prisoner was taken about a month after, and a waistcoat taken off his back which was mine.</p>

I heard a noise about twenty minutes or half-past one o'clock, like footsteps on the stairs leading from the kitchen into the parlour; I only heard it for a few minutes, and then heard Turner open the window of the adjoining room, and call the watchman - I did not leave my room. Turner came to me; I gave him a light, and know nothing more. No property was taken. Clutterbuck has been an occasional servant in the house. I keep the Duke of York public-house. I cannot say whether the kitchen was made fast.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Smith, and saw every thing safe when I went to bed. I did not see whether the kitchen was safe - the front of the house was fastened. A little after one o'clock I heard a noise, as if somebody was breaking, or had broken into the house; I cannot say whether I heard them in the house. I alarmed the watchman, and asked him to look round to see if all was safe, and saw him go round; he went for more watchmen. The noise continued for about five minutes. I got a light from my mistress, went down, and let the watchmen in at the front door - we went into the skettle-ground to see if we could see anybody - we found a small window in the back kitchen broken, and marks of its having been wrenched; it swings open, and there were marks between the sash and frame, as if it had been forced - the kitchen door was open. There were footmarks on the kitchen floor, of more than one person having been there; it appeared as if their shoes had been off, for there were prints of their toes, as if their feet were wet, which made the marks; there was a jar broken in the yard. I saw nothing of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 6th of March I heard Turner call to a watchman to look round. I went to the back door, and was in Nottingham-place, and another watchman went into the house - in three or four minutes I heard the prisoners coming towards me; I immediately sprang my rattle, and Dennis came to my assistance. I opened the door leading into the skettle-ground of the house; it was unfastened. I found Brimmell and Wales there, behind the door in the passage leading into the skettle-ground; they might be fifty yards from the house, but within the same fence as the house is in; it is a private passage belonging to the house. I secured them, and asked how many more there were of them; Wales said there was another one, but he had made his escape over the wall. I took them to the watch-house; they were searched, but nothing found on them.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. In consequence of information I went in pursuit of Clutterbuck, and took him in the Commercial-road, about seven o'clock that morning (the 6th of March). He had only one shoe on. I neither threatened or promised him. I did not mention to him what I took him for. I asked him why he was guilty of a crime of that description, after living with Mrs. Smith - he said it was Brimmell's fault, that Brimmell had advised him to do it, that he (Brimmell) had got hold of the pot-boy who usually lived there, and wanted him to be one of the party, but he refused, but told him where the keys were kept, and where the copper and silver were kept. He said that Wales brought a chisel, and that he himself (Clutterbuck) broke the window open, and got in himself first, and Brimmell followed him, without their shoes, that Wales stopped in the skettleground the while, and that he went into the skettle-ground in the evening, and secreted himself there.

             told us what part of the room the silver lay in, and where the halfpence were put at Mrs. Smith's. Wales was with me and Brimmell at the time. We went to the house between nine and ten o'clock, and went through the house and down into back-yard. We remained there till one o'clock; we then made an attempt to get into the house. I forced open the kitchen window with a small chisel that Wales brought with him. Brimmell stood by me at the time, and Wales was in the skettle-ground. I then got into the kitchen through the window, and Brimmell got in with me. I went up stairs, and then returned to the kitchen, and Brimmell and I went out by the door. I afterwards got away over the garden wall, leaving Brimmell and Wales in the alley. - The prisoner Wales declines saying anything."</p>
               <p>CLUTTERBUCK's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, suffer me respectfully to state to your honourable Court, that when Stone, the constable took me into custody in the Commercial-road, he accused me of breaking into the house, telling me to inform him all I knew, for he would clear me, and shew me mercy, if I did but tell him the truth. I very naturally felt shocked at so dreadful and foul an accusation - under such particular embarrasment, I was not sensible of what I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070014"/>did say. But it becomes me now as a man, to speak the truth candidly, and not endeavour to justify myself in any manner by falsehoods or prevarication. I know the two prisoners at the bar, and was in their company the same night, but I left them about nine o'clock, to return home. Respecting what has been deduced in evidence, I most humbly protest my innocence, and beg leave to repeat again, that my being taken into custody on a charge so dreadful, the threat of Stone, and his offering to clear me and shew me mercy, put me in that distressed state of mind, that I neither knew what I said or did. Should you consider me as guilty. I supplicate for mercy; but, fully on the other hand anticipate that you will find me innocent.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 4th of March, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, as I came from Clapton, and was crossing the fields, I met the prisoner running, and presently I heard the lady had lost her watch. I returned and overtook him; he was still running - and just before I got to him I saw him take the watch from his right-hand side and throw it into the shrubbery. Dimond was coming towards him, and I called to him to stop him, while I got the watch. I saw him throw it away - it appeared like a gold watch. Dimond followed and secured him. I had been over the pails and found the watch - (looking at it) - this is it. I am sure he is the man who threw it away. I gave it to Mrs. Davis, and saw the prisoner delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DIMOND. I am a labourer. I met the prisoner running, and Slatter pursuing him. I saw him go to the pailing, and put his hand over as if to throw something over, but I did not see it in his hand. There was a cry of Stop him, when he came up to me, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, nonsense, they do not mean me." I passed him, but afterwards pursued him and saw him getting over a high gate; I followed him across a field, and over a hedge, and took him at last nearly up to his middle in water, in a ditch; he said,</p>
               <p>"Pray do forgive me, pray let me go;" and as we went along, he said voluntarily,</p>
               <p>"I went into the kitchen, and took the watch."</p>
               <p>MRS. DAVIS. The watch is mine; it is gold, and worth 5 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a poor man, have a wife and seven children, and beg for mercy.</p>

            . My brother married the prisoner's aunt; he used to come to my lodging; I left him in care of my lodging several times. On Saturday evening, the 28th of February, I left him there alone, while I went to Drury-lane Theatre - I told him to wash the tea things up, and make my bed, double lock the door, and to put the key under a pail which stood in the passage. I came home at half-past twelve o'clock, and found the door open; the key laid in the passage. I got a light and found the place all in confusion, and missed the property stated in the indictment. The purse had 1 l. 16 s. 6 d in it. I found a ring at Turner's, and saw a handkerchief taken from his person at Bow-street. I did not see him again till he was taken, which was a fortnight after - we could not find him before.</p>

On the 17th of February, I went with my father to the Bank of England, where he received a 30 l. note, and got it changed into six of 5 l.; they were given to me, and I put them into a drawer, in my bed-room, in my father's house, in a pocket-book. The prisoner had left our house in October, but visited me after that, and was at the house on the 17th of February. I went to my drawer on the 25th, and the notes were gone; the pocket-book was left, and I think it was open. I saw two of the notes at Bow-street, in the possession of Duke.

            . I am a constable. I received Welch in charge at Dobree's with the fork; she said it was her own property. I found a cap in her pocket, which she said was her own. I asked if she had children small enough to wear it; she said, Yes, and that they were at her lodging, somewhere in Crown-street, St. Giles's, and her name was Jones. Next day, as I took her to the office I saw the male prisoner speaking to her, and asked if she was his wife; he said not. I took him into the office, sent him out while she was examined, and after that she said she was his wife, and that the fork was her property, and she had told him she had had it with her former husband. He said at first that he had seen the fork, and knew it was in pawn, and afterwards that he had only heard that it was in pawn, and had not seen it. On the day she was first examined, he said he knew she had had it a long time. On the Saturday following, when I apprehended him, he said she was not his wife, and he had never seen the fork till he saw it in the pawnbroker's hands. He refused to tell where he lodged; he at first said he lived in Golden-lane, and then that he had no lodging. I asked where he took the bundles to - he said he had taken no bundles.</p>

               <p>WELCH's Defence. I have been employed at this house several years, and trusted with a deal of property. I attended his wife till she died, and was then told I had no more business in the room, as he is of a different persuasion to me. I was told to call on Monday for the things to wash, which I did, and his daughter told me to bundle up the clothes - I did so, and this fork was among them; I found it on sorting the clothes, and being short of money I went to pawn it, met Furlong, and asked him to go with me; I pawned it in my own name, and took up the 9 s., and when I came out he asked how I got it; I said it was my own - he left me. I took it out again, and offered it for 5 s., intending to take it back.</p>
               <p>FURLONG's Defence. I met her in Mortimore-street - we went and pawned the fork; she promised me that she would take it out. Next morning a watchman informed me she was in confinement, and I went to the watch-house.</p>

            . I live in Broad-street-buildings. In November, 1822, I owed Messrs. Coopers eight guineas, and paid a cheque for that sum to some person; I cannot swear to the prisoner.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear that very cheque was returned, or do you speak of it in common with others - A. I cannot recollect the particular cheque, but I have checked off every payment, and this among them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is there not an alteration in the figures of the receipt - A. Yes; it brings to my mind that the bill was made out for nine guineas; I begged him to get it corrected, which was done, and on returning I gave him the money. I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Coopers. On the 27th of February last, I had some conversation with the prisoner about some deficiences in the cash account - I did not threaten or promise him anything. We went over a book in which a list of outstanding debts are kept, to ascertain the names and amounts of what he had received; he admitted the receipt of this among several other sums; he read them from the book. He requested me to take a letter to the prosecutors, and read me a copy of what he intended to write; he asked what I expected they would do - I said I could not tell, for the amount was very large.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the prosecutors' employ - A. About a year and a quarter. I was very intimate with the prisoner; I went to him by the direction of the prosecutors - he had been seriously ill, but was considerably better. I saw him in his bed-room, and took the book to him at his request; he read from it himself what he had received, and I wrote it down; the amount was 218 l. 7 s. 0 d. I held him out no inducement. I went to him in consequence of a letter he had written to them; I produced the letter to him; it was in his handwriting. I told him the letter would explain my business.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If there are deficiences it must arise from the inaccuracy of the books, or from the number of persons continually in the receipt of money; in the multiciplity of business, it is very possible that I might have forgotten sums of money, or paid it in trifling disbursements.</p>

On the 23d of March, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner put his hand through the window, and take something out - a person passed, and he went away; then crossed again, and put three of his fingers through the broken glass, and took out another knife - I ran and secured him, took him into the shop, the knives were found in his apron. Another boy was taken, but nothing was found on him.</p>

            . I have twelve knives and twelve forks, which I bought of the prisoner on the 14th of February, for 20 s.; I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was on the 14th. - A. I believe so, they are not worth more than I gave. I consider it a very handsome price. I had seen him three times before. I put them in the window for sale, Mr. Reeves keeps the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you buy any thing else of him - A. I bought another set of him on the 7th of February, for 38 s., and sold them to Mr. Cook for 32 s.; they are in the possession of Honey. I know his face, and swear to him.</p>

            . I bought these knives and forks of Payne. I left them at a cutler's in Newgate-street, to be set, and called on Mr. Allies, whose name is on them, to know what he would make me desert knives to match them for. I shewed him the forks; he went with me to the cutlers, and gave me another set for them, a quarter of an hour after I had left them there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear that the cutler gave back the same knives that you left - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLIES. Mr. Cook brought me the forks to have desert ones to match. I went with him to the cutler's, and got the knives which I produced; they are marked with my name, and were made at Sheffield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your name is stamped on them to persuade the public that they are town-made - A. No, I wish persons to know that they are bought at my house. I had five dozen of this pattern. I sold two dozen in the country, two dozen are at the cutlers, and one at home.</p>

I gave an alarm, and the watchman stopped him about sixty yards off, without my losing sight of him. I do not know what became of the others. I suppose he let the watch fall, as I heard something fall ten or twelve yards from him - it sounded like the case.</p>

We found some fried and raw liver upon a rack in his cottage, and a pail of bloody water upon the floor. Churn lodged there; we found both the prisoners and another man sitting round the fire. Churn's breeches were spotted with blood; he attempted to run away; one of the officers fetched him back. I put him into a cart; he said,</p>

               <p>"I can tell you where one of your pigs are; it is in a meadow about a hundred yards from where you found it had been stuck, covered up by the hedge." I went there, and found the pig stuck and covered with rubbish. Lawrence came to me on Monday the 15th; he said he came about poor Will. I said,</p>
               <p>"What is it" - he said,</p>

               <p>"I will give a 1 l. note with his father sooner than he shall be sent away." I said,</p>
               <p>"You are a very civil fellow, but if you had nothing to do with it, what makes you want to give a pound-note." I gave him in charge.</p>

There was another person standing on the other side, but he took no notice. I jumped up and followed him all through the lane, calling, Stop thief! There were plenty of people who could have stopped him, but nobody interfered. It was nearly such a person as the prisoner, but I cannot swear to him; he is about the height and figure of the person. I found three of the articles at Queen-square on the Thursday.

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of February I apprehended the prisoner, but found nothing on him relative to this business; I asked where he lived; he said over the water. I asked where there, he said he did not know the name of the street, he had only lived there a week. I asked where he lived before that; he said at Westminster, but could not tell me where there. I said I should go and find out. Next morning, as I was taking him from the watchhouse I had a bundle under my arm and told him I had soon found out where he lived; he said I was lucky; I said</p>
               <p>"This bundle came from there" - he said there was nothing there but what was his own. I do not know that he could tell what was in the bundle, but he could see the yellow handkerchief it was wrapped in. Pace and I had found it in the back parlour, next door to the One Tun public-house, Perkin's-rents, Westminster, having been informed that he lodged there. I directed his attention to the bundle at the time, he said there was nothing there but what was his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The bundle was tied up - A. Yes, he could not see the contents; he saw nothing but the handkerchief it was in - I did not tell him the place I found it at, but said at his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in reference to the bundle, and not to his lodging, that he said there was nothing there but what belonged to him - No, I pointed to the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his answer follow immediately after you said you had found where he lodged - A. Yes; but he looked at the bundle and nodded at it, and gave that answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you find at that lodging - A. I found a silk-handkerchief hanging on a line to dry, a waistcoat and shirt in the drawer, rolled up damp; two picklock-keys, a crow-bar, and two padlocks.</p>

            . I am a piano-forte maker, and live at Hanworth. On the 2d of March I was at Twickenham, and went into Mrs. Scurr's, the pawnbroker's shop, and saw the prisoner there pawning a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, and a handkerchief, and heard him ask her to lend 10 s. on them; she could only lend 5 s.; he said he would take 5 s., that he was going down to the brewhouse, and would call as he returned - he left the articles there - he knew me. He called again, and Mrs. Scurr would not take them in, in consequence of what I told her; this was on Tuesday; he was apprehended next day. As I returned home I called on the constable, who lives next door to the prosecutor, and we found out in the evening that the house was broken open. Foothead was unloading his cart in the field - we called to him, and I told him what I had seen. I went into the house, and saw the clothes, which appeared to be the same I had seen him with at the pawnbroker's. When he was apprehended I saw a pair of shoes taken off his feet.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Twickenham. On the 2d of March the prisoner brought a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, and a handkerchief to pawn - the waistcoat produced is what he brought, I am positive; I cannot swear to the breeches, but have every reason to belive them to be the same. I was going to lend him 5 s., but in consequence of what Kendon said when he called, I said I would not take them in; he had left them with me, and called in an hour - he took them away. I asked him his name; he said it was Collyer, and that he came from Hampton - I told him his name was not Collyer, but Beeks, and that he came from Hanwell; he said it was not, and took the things away. The prosecutor called, and shewed me the things next morning - I knew the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You asked what name I wanted to pawn them in; I said Collyer - Witness. I asked what his name was, and if they were his own; he said they were.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Twickenham. I went into a public-house, and a man there asked if there was a pawnbroker's near, and asked me to pawn the breeches - he pulled his waistcoat off his back, and gave it to me with them, and told me to pawn them in the name of Collyer, for 15 s.; she would only give 5 s. - I said I would call as I returned, and then she would not take them in, and asked what name I was to pawn them in; I said Collyer - she said that was not my name - that I came from Hanwell; I said I did not. I took them to the man, and went away.</p>

            . I live next door to Hendley. On Saturday, the 6th of March, about a quarter to two o'clock I saw the prisoners Holloway and Jermaine - Jermaine went down into Hendley's kitchen; Holloway did not go further than the passage leading to the kitchen - Boswell was with them, but he went down the town to a grocer's-shop, ten or twelve yards off, for some cheese. I saw Holloway come out of the passage about a minute before Jermaine. I heard Boswell say when he left them, that he would go and get some cheese, and asked the others were they were going - they said they would go next door and get some onions; this was before they went into the house. Jermaine came to my door; I told him I did not sell onions - that he could get them next door; they did not go into the shop. Jermaine went down into the kitchen I am certain; there is only a thin partition between that and my house, and I heard him go into the kitchen, and seeing him come out without onions I went and called Mrs. Hendley.</p>

            . I live at Acton. In consequence of what I heard from Hendley, I went in pursuit towards Ealing-common, and just as I got on the common I saw the three prisoners walking along; I was walking - they turned round, and seeing me, they turned short to the right, and ran into a lane. I lost sight of them; I got on a butcher's horse, and rode till I got up to them in Ilangerhill-lane, and said,</p>
               <p>"Stop" - Boswell said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You have stolen a watch." Boswell then got over a ditch, and Holloway did the same. I followed them on foot, and as I got over the ditch Boswell dropped the watch papers into the ditch, out of his breeches pocket. I followed them both across two fields, and then collared Boswell; Holloway turned back, as if to shew fight; they wanted to know what I wanted with them; I said they had stolen a watch - Holloway said he had not; I asked what they ran for; he said,</p>
               <p>"I ran, I thought you was after me for stealing turnips." I secured them both, brought them back to the ditch, and picked up the watch papers, which I produce.</p>

I heard footsteps in the shop, turned my head, and saw a tall man going out with two rolls of flannel under his arm. I jumped up, hallooed very loud, and followed him; he threw it down and ran up a gateway close to the house, which is no thoroughfare. I went up there with a crowd of people, and saw him turn up to the wall, as if for a necessary purpose, but his dress was not unbuttoned. I took him back - it was the prisoner.</p>

I turned round, and saw the prisoner walking out of the chapel - and missing my handkerchief, I followed him, and saw him put it into his hat on the steps. - He crossed the road - I followed and secured him. He denied it, and said he had nothing in his pocket. I told him to take off his hat. He did so, and gave the handkerchief to me, and said he could not tell how it came there, he thought it must have been by accident.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you miss your handkerchief yourself - A. Yes, I felt it taken - nobody stood near me except some children.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the chapel, where I generally attend, and after some time I came out. The prosecutor followed, and asked if I had not a handkerchief of his - I said, No, for I had come out without one. One of the young chaps who stood behind the gentleman must have put it into my hat.</p>

He was stopped, and I came up immediately.</p>

I heard a tremendous blow, as if a head was knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070026"/>against the shutter, as I was in the passage, and then I heard her cry out,</p>

               <p>Q. If you lost sight of him, she must have done the same - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe that it was some other man who took it, and not the prisoner - A. I thought so when I came to see him with the bundle, as he had an apron on, and I did not think that the man I saw running had an apron on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What coloured apron was it - A. A blue butcher's apron. He said he had picked it up, and went quietly to the Compter; the prosecutrix fainted the moment he was taken; she was much agitated, and cried out</p>

I found all the gutters stripped of the lead, and eighty-four feet of water-pipe gone. I found some of it on the attic stairs, rolled up ready to be carried away. I compared it to the place and it fitted. I bought the house of William Ashworth - <rs id="t18240407-61-viclabel348" type="occupation">John Howell is assignee of a bankrupt</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You have not completed the purchase - it has never been conveyed to you - A. No, the key was delivered to me - I could have lived in it if I liked; the key was not given to me as possession of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why was not the conveyance completed - A. Some deeds were not in their possession, but they are now; the title was not made good till after the robbery. Howell and Ashworth both joined in the conveyance.</p>

            , I am an officer. On the 20th of February I went with the prosecutor to this house, and found the lead and copper stripped, and some on the garret stairs, and while he was gone to find a place where we could watch I heard a noise in the kitchen. I waited about ten minutes, and saw a light come up stairs, and

             the prisoner went into the front parlour; he had a dark lantern. I caught hold of him, we scuffled - I got him into the back yard - rose an alarm - and sent another officer down stairs, and he brought Myers out of the coal-hole - the lantern was thrown down in the scuffle, and I found a box of matches on the floor, and a latch key on Jones.</p>
               <p>MR. QUARRILL. I was at the house a fortnight before, and every thing was safe, The key was lent to me by the auctioneer. I mended the roof myself, and had some glass put in previous to the robbery.</p>

I found another dark lantern, a can of oil, and a phosphorous bottle there.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On the 2d of March, in consequence of directions, I watched the prosecutors' premises; and about ten minutes to seven o'clock I saw the prisoner coming along Thames-street; I said, Coleman you are suspected of robbing your employers; he said he had not. I said, you have property about you now; he said he had not, and agreed to go with me to the stables. I attempted to search him; he dragged me to a dark part of the stables, gave me a violent kick, and we both fell, and then he got rid of what he had. I could feel something under his apron in the scuffle, and when he had got rid of it he got up, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want of me;" and down the cellar stairs, at that place, I found these raisins, a bag of currants, and a bag of plumbs; they were Mr. Hancock's stables, opposite to his house; a picklock key was produced to me, which I tried to the warehouse door - it opens it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you attempted to search him he began the struggle - A. Yes, I did not see him throw any thing away, it was so dark; he had something bulky under his apron, in the street.</p>

On this day, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I stood at the warehouse door, and saw the prisoner go into Thames-street; my master lives on Bread-street-hill - he returned with Marchant, who took him into the stable; I heard a scuffle, and on going in it was nearly over.

            . I am groom to Mr. Hancock. I was in the next stable, heard a noise, came out, and the officer called me to help him, but I was frightened - they were struggling close at the top of the cellar stairs; I got a light, and found two bags close to the stairs. I had been in the stable a quarter of an hour before. I fetched the keys out of my master's room - nobody else could have put the property there. There were several trusses of hay close to where he was taken, and about nine days after, when I used the hay, I found a picklock-key among it - I saw it tried to the warehouse door; it unlocked it. The door leads from the place the prisoner occupied in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the hay packed pretty tight - A. One or two trusses were apart from the others.</p>

            . The prisoner was our servant, and occupied a room in our house, which communicates with the warehouse by a door which we kept locked; he had no key to it with our permission, and had no authority to touch any of the property. I know some of this sugar, it being chippings, and a quality we use very little of; it corresponds with the bulk in the cask; we have such currants in our warehouse, and here is a package of Sultana raisins; we miss exactly this quantity. The boxes were broken and left empty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If your servant stole raisins he would not leave empty boxes to be seen - A. He could not take them out. The sugar is broken to pieces for samples.</p>

We talked about a settlement of the rent, and my getting possession. Mrs. Greig and he said they could not pay the money then, but were ready to give security. I asked them if the 20 l. bill, due on Thursday, was paid - and both assured me that it was. I said if that was the case I would accommodate them, and take a bill or any thing. He said he would accept a bill. It was agreed that I was to have 8 l. on Tuesday, and take a bill for 10 l. A stamp was sent for, and a bill drawn, which he offered to accept.

There is a communication between his dwelling-house and this building. I sleep in the depot with the men. I have a room there for myself, and always keep it locked in the day-time, and keep the key in my pocket. On the 5th of March there was nobody but the prisoner and one more man there, and about seven o'clock that morning I missed from my room a blue great coat, two coats, two pairs of trowsers, four waistcoats, a pair of breeches and gaiters, a towel, two black silk handkerchiefs, two pairs of white cotton stockings, five leather gloves, two sovereigns, and six shillings. I had seen them all safe the morning before, about twelve o'clock. I locked my door then, and found it locked in the evening when I went to bed, but the key went very hard. I did not then miss the things, as I did not look for them. About eight o'clock on the morning after I missed them, I saw the prisoner in the depot washing himself.</p>

I returned with the officer, and found him still with Richards, who stated in his presence, all that he had said. I went to different pawnbrokers, by the prisoner's direction, and at each of them found property which was stolen while he was in my service.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Did you miss it while he lived with you - A. Yes, and suspected him. I missed it three or four days before he left. I did not charge him with it. I sent my clerk round to all the pawnbrokers, but he found nothing; and a few days after the prisoner asked leave to go home to his friends; he went. I told my clerk that if he returned, to discharge him, which was done.

Mr. Walker's account of the conversation is correct; I heard it; he went out for an officer; he had not desired me to question the prisoner, or to make him any threat or promise; he left me in the counting-house with him, and as soon as he was gone the prisoner, was standing by the fire, he came up to the desk and asked me to let him go; I said, I certainly should do nothing of the kind; he burst into tears, and said he would tell the truth; he then leant on the desk. I took up a piece of paper and wrote down what he said; (reads,) he said he had taken a silk shawl. I asked what he had done with it, he said he had pledged it at Parson's, in Hounsditch; and had taken four lengths of lace, and pawned it in the name of Hart, at Flemming's, Whitechapel; and had also pawned a silk scarf or shawl there for 12 s., and four pairs of silk stockings, at Barker's; and six yards of sarsnet for 17 s., in the name of Hart, at Matthew's, in the Minories; he said nothing more; upon Mr. Walker's returning he was taken into custody. I went to the pawnbrokers' next morning, and found property corresponding with the account he gave me.</p>

               <p>MR. WALKER. I believe the silk shawl to be mine, but the mark is taken off. I missed one exactly like this; the sixty-six yards of lace I believe to be mine. I missed this very pattern, and know I had not sold it; it is worth eight or nine pounds; a single piece is worth 3 l. 10 s.; it cost more than 3 l.; the handkerchiefs and stockings are mine, the marks are taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are thousands of yards of lace of this pattern - A. No doubt of it, I swear to the best of my belief. I have several handkerchiefs of the same pattern, and miss some; the shawl is rather an uncommon one.</p>

            . I live at Kensington. On the 21st of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was coming from Shepherd's-bush, into the Hammersmith-road; the prisoner met me coming off Brook-green, and asked me to give her something to drink; I said the houses were all shut; she said no, they were not, that there was one open further on; she followed by my side to <placeName id="t18240407-75-crimeloc426">Hammersmith turnpike</placeName>

               <p>"You see the house is shut." I immediately crossed to the opposite side, and as I came through the posts, she pushed against me several times; she said there was a house further on, and when I got about two hundred yards from the gate, she turned down <placeName id="t18240407-75-crimeloc427">William-street</placeName>

I put my hand into my breeches pocket, and my bag, containing four sovereigns and some silver, was gone. I immediately ran back to the turnpike to look for the watchman; he was not there. I stoped a few minutes; two watchmen came; I described her to a watchman, who took me to a house; we stopped there, and she came up to the door. I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was it quite dark - A. Yes; she had a bonnet on. I meant to give her something to get rid of her if the house had been opened. There are gas-lights on the opposite side of the road. I am sure of her person; I had an opportunity of seeing her face, and if I had not I could have described her person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How could she got your money without your perceiving it - A. I suppose it was done as I went through the posts. I do not remember whether my pocket was buttoned. My money was safe when I was on the green - I met nobody else.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Dixon came to me just after. I had called twelve o'clock; he said he had been robbed, and described the person - but before that I had met him with the prisoner; she was rather before him. I went with him to her house; she came up. I went to her, and charged her with robbing Mr. Dixon; she said she had not; I was ten minutes before I could get her from the door, and in the meantime her husband came up - she wanted to get in doors; I would not let her - she said to he husband,</p>
               <p>"You take the key," and put something out of her hand into his; I suspected that it was the money, and collared him, and immediately saw him throw something out of his right-hand, it sounded like money in falling. I told the watchman to get a light; and, where I thought, the money was all found in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had not searched him before - A. No. I was hustling to get her to the watch-house; I saw her pass something to her husband, and saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070032"/>clench his hand up. I saw no key; the door was locked.</p>

Mr. Ryan, a perfumer, has the other shop. I have a back door, leading into Goodwin's-court, St. Martin's-lane, which I open on Sundays, and he goes in at his shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you go from your shop to your neighbour's without going into the street - A. Yes, my Lord. There is a partition between the two shops, but there is a door to each shop leading into the passage and stair-case of the house - these doors are both locked at night; the dwelling-house is common to us both; we have one landlord; I pay 100 l. a-year rent, and he pays 80 l. we have separate rooms, and separate kitchens. On the 23d of March, at seven o'clock in the morning, the servant came up; I went down stairs, and found the parlour in a state of great confusion - the parlour is within my shop, and looks into Goodwin's-court. I was the last person up the night before, and saw every thing secure; the window looking into Goodwin's-court was secure. I found the box of the lock on the door leading from the shop to the parlour was taken off; it appeared that they had got in at the stair-case window. The back parlour has been built since the house; they had got on the roof of that, and opened the landing-place window, which was shut at night, and is generally fastened by a padlock; they could then walk down stairs. There is a small kitchen behind the parlour; they had gone through there, taken off the box of the lock, and got into the shop. I was not disturbed in the night. I missed between ten and twenty pounds of snuff, about thirty pounds of tobacco, and about thirty snuff-boxes, which were worth 3 l.; they cost more - also five hundred segars, and five amber segar-tubes. The prisoner is my landlord - I had been his tenant about six or seven weeks; he lodged with his father and mother, in Brook-street, Holborn. I knew him by the name of M'Craw - I was never at his father's before house the robbery. I get Avis and Smith, who went there with a search-warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you pay the taxes - A. I pay the taxes of the whole premises. Ryan is not my lessee, but a lessee of the landlord's, as well as myself.</p>
               <p>EMLY CHOICE. I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner is our landlord - I knew him by the name of M'Craw. On Monday, the day before the robbery, he came to the house; I was in the shop; the stair-case window was padlocked; he asked for the key of the padlock, to go out there, pointing to the window; I did not hesitate in giving it to him, being the landlord. I do not know whether he went out, but he went up stairs, came down again, threw the key into the scales, and went away; it was the same key. When I went to bed I looked at the padlock - it appeared to be fast. Next morning, when the robbery was discovered, the padlock appeared to have been opened with a key - it was not wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did he not come on that day for Mr. Ryan's rent - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to a lodger for rent - A. He went up stairs, and staid about three minutes - I do not know where he went; we have a lodger named Gale.</p>
               <p>MR. CHOICE re-examined. There was no agreement who was to do the repairs. Ryan came to the house since me. There was rent due to the prisoner by Gale, a lodger; he pays rent to me now, but owed the prisoner a balance for rent due before I came, as I understand.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Sunday, the 24th, I had a search-warrant, and went to No. 36, Brook-street, Holborn - the house of the prisoner's father; the prisoner opened the street door for me; I asked if Mr. M'Craw was within - he said Yes; I walked up stairs after him with Smith and the prosecutor, to the two pair front room, where his father was living; he took us up there. I produced my warrant, and said the gentleman present had been robbed, and in the table-drawer in that room I found two bundles of Spanish segars, and two amber segar-tubes, and in a cupboard in the room I found about a quarter of a pound of tobacco. I asked him where he got them; he said he bought the Spanish segars at Mr. Gordon's, a tobacconist, in Holborn, and bought the tobacco of a smuggler.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Choice. I was the first person up on this morning, and found the stair-case window open; it was shut when I went to bed. I found the back door leading into Goodwin's-court open, and the padlock laying on the window cill.</p>
               <p>MR. CHOICE. I know this tobacco by having prepared it myself a few days before; I did not prepare it from the leaf, but it is a mixture which I made for an experiment; I am as sure of it as if my name was on it. The value of the property lost is 12 l. as I have given it, but that is not a third of the real value. I can speak to one of the amber tubes particularly, it being a milky amber - I remember offering it to a gentleman a few days before. I am not so certain of the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070033"/>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You lost a large quantity of tobacco - A. Not of this description, not above half a pound - it is mixed with a particular bark, and different things; it is a secret of trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not Cascarilla bark bought at a low price - A. Yes; that mixed with tobacco gives it a perfume; it must be smoked to ascertain the perfume.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak from the quantity lost - A. No, the quality; it is a preparation of my own. Amber tubes vary much in appearance, make, and shape; a milky appearance is common in them, but two are seldom a-like; I only lost five. They are sold by most tobacconists - I do not swear to the tubes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was desired by my father-in-law to go and receive 5 l. 10 s. from a lodger at this house. I went, and saw the lodger's wife - and it was agreed that I should come in the evening and see the husband - and as I came down stairs, I saw a quantity of dirt on the tiles. I went down to Mrs. Choice, and said,</p>
               <p>"Have the goodness to lend me the key - there is a quantity of dirt on the tiles, and I will sweep it away." I went up and swept the tiles, as they complained of the rain coming in. Three people in the court saw me sweeping the tiles. I went down threw the key into the scales, and said I had been sweeping them - but she had a customer, and I did not disturb her. I believe the servant saw me throw the broom down stairs. I was at home in bed at the time of the robbery. As to the tobacco, I have smoked it myself, and have witnesses who have seen me smoke it. I buy a quarter of a pound at Gordon's, and put an ounce of Cascarilla back into it, as a fume arises from it exactly like musk.</p>

            . I keep the Skinner's Arms public-house, Coburg-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner eight months. I heard of his apprehension a few days after it happened - I think at the latter end of the week. On the night of Monday, the 22d of March, he was at my house, and left before twelve o'clock at night - he had been there about three hours. He always smoked his own tobacco in my parlour. I have had part of a pipe with him several times. I have bought tobacco of the prosecutor both before and since this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a flavour was it, as to what he lent you - A. It is the same sort and flavour as what the prisoner lent me - it is called returns, and is scented. I have some here which I bought of Choice about three weeks ago. There is a flavour in mine which there is not in that produced;</p>

            . I live at No. 29, George's-place, St. John-street-road, and have known the prisoner some years. I heard of his apprehension on the Sunday following. On the Monday before, I called at his father's house, to consult him about some repairs, and while I stood at the door he came; that was at half-past two o'clock, and he met me at Matthewson's at seven in the evening. I went home about half-past seven, returned in an hour and a half to him, and remained there till half past eleven, and left him there. I have often had tobacco of his - there is something of a musky flavour in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since tried any tobacco bought at Choice's - A. Yes, I have smoked some that Matthewson bought. I think it is the same sort as the prisoner used, but cannot swear it; I thought it as nearly alike as possible; the prisoner's was mixed with Cascarilla bark, which is bought at the chemist's. I know Gordon's shop, King-street, Holborn - he is a large tobacconist; a customer could go there without a person being able to speak to them; there were three or four customers there when I went.</p>

            . I am acquainted with the prisoner. I did not hear of his apprehension till he was committed, which was on Saturday the 27th. I was in company with him on the preceding Monday at Matthewson's till nearly twelve o'clock. It is a mile and a half from Covent-garden. We came out together, and walked as far as Bowling-green-row, Leather-lane, which leads up to Brook-street, and left him about twenty minutes after twelve. I have smoked his tobacco, and have since smoked some bought at Choice's - they are both of the same flavour in my judgment. I can get the same at any other shop in London; it is prepared with Cascarilla bark.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you - A. A coppersmith and brazier. Matthewson's house is not generally open so late - there was a party of friends there.</p>

            . I rented a room in Mrs. M'Craw's house, No. 36, Brook-street. The prisoner lived there. I let him in on Monday night, the 22d of March, about half-past twelve o'clock. I did not go to bed for two or three hours after. I work at the fancy trimming business, and am frequently at work all night. I think I must have heard him if he had gone out, as the door goes hard. He sleeps in the same room with his father and mother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What trade is the father - A. A clerk in some office. I have frequently seen him in bed in their room. I live in the attic, and they on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What does the prisoner do - A. I never knew him do any thing. I believe his father is independent - he has property I know. I believe he goes by his mother's maiden name.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH M'CRAW. I am the prisoner's mother. My present husband is his father - my maiden name was Bailey. On the Monday night in question. I went to bed about half-past ten or eleven o'clock. The prisoner sleeps in the same room - we have no other bed-room. I awoke when he came into the room, about half-past twelve. I heard the watchman go, and laid awake till our clock struck one. We have a clock in the room which strikes. I remained awake till near two. He went to bed directly he came in, and remained in bed all the time. I was awake, and got up about eight o'clock - he was in bed then. I am sure he had not got up in the night, for I do not sleep very sound when I am disturbed. My husband is clerk to Rosser and Sons, and has been so for twenty-five years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the prisoner - A. He is nothing particular - his father employs him; he has a sufficiency to keep him; he gets little bills, and collects money for his father.</p>
               <p>Q. What bills has your husband to collect - A. I never enquire his business.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, is the prisoner engaged in any occupation whatever - A. No: he comes home sometimes at twelve and one o'clock - he was always out till twelve or one. He is nineteen years old in June.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not put him up a bed elsewhere - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070034"/>That we may know what time he comes in: we advise him to come home early. We have three floors in the house, and two rooms on each. We have a man, his wife, and two female lodgers, besides the witness; the females sleep together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son landlord of the house in New-street - A. His father is - he employs him to look after that and two other houses.</p>
               <p>DONALD M'CRAW. I am writing clerk to Messrs. Rosser and Co., Bartlett's-buildings, and have been there twenty-five years. The prisoner is my son. He slept at my house on the 22d of March. I left him in bed between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, when I went to the office. I employ him to collect the rents, and look after the repairs of my house in New-street, and two others which I have, one in King-street, Covent-garden, and another in the City-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many days does that occupy him - A. Not many - he was three weeks or a month letting this one in New-street. I have 32 s. a week. He has been clerk to two attornies, and left them three or four years ago, and since that (two or three years ago) he lived with Mr. White, a chemist, for some months. He has been in no employ for two years. He was often out at night, but always accounted for being in good company. He was out three or four nights every week.</p>
               <p>MRS. CHOICE. The prisoner said nothing to me about wanting a broom - he had none in his hand. I gave him the key because he was the landlord.</p>

            . I know these combs. I had cleaned my window on the Monday, and saw them. I know them to be mine, one in particular is marked in a particular spot. I had not another marked like it. I will not speak to the oil, as the cover is off it; it was in bottles like these when I lost it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. All the 3 s. 6 d. bottles are like that - A. Yes, the combs I lost were new. I lost six or eight pocket combs; the one I speak to is made out of the top of the horn, and is a new one; I can tell by the teeth that it has never been used in any head of hair; there is dirt in it, but it is not from the human hair; the dirt from hair would be more at the end of the comb.</p>

               <p>JOHN M'ALLISTER. I lodge at Somer's-town. I came from Bromley, Kent; last Saturday night I was in Fleet-market; I had mistaken my way from London-bridge - I met a set of men and girls at the corner of Fleet-market, they said,</p>
               <p>"Old codger will give us some gin," I said,</p>

               <p>"I want nothing to do with you, I want to go to Somer's-town, let me get to the bottom of Holborn, and I can find the way;" Varlow said,</p>
               <p>"Old gentleman, you are out of your way, we are going to Battle-bridge, and will go with you; come up this lane and we will go together;" I said</p>
               <p>"I did not care, so that I went the right way;" Varlow said</p>
               <p>"Come in here, and we will soon go" - she took me up stairs into a room - I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want me to stop all night," -</p>
               <p>"to be sure," said she; I said I would not; I wanted to get out - my pocket was open - she came up close to me, and my money was gone in an instant; she made her escape - I missed my Scotch mull and tobacco-pouch; I made a disturbance at the door, and at that time she escaped - I came down stairs talking to the girls there, and was disgusted with their conversation; Day was in the passage - I said,</p>
               <p>"What a house you keep, I am robbed of all;" she said,</p>
               <p>"No, not all," and gave me my pouch and mull, which I put into my pocket, and went down stairs; I had not got far when the girls followed me and robbed me of my watch.</p>

               <p>"Come, old gentleman, let me take hold of your hand." I saw Foster whip my watch out of my fob; I turned to catch hold of her, but fell down, and was kicked about shamefully - I have not been able to walk without a crutch since; I have not recovered my watch. I am positive of them; I saw them in the room - I pointed them out at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You would not have known them if you had only seen them in the street - A. No, but I saw them first in the house. The mull was my grandfather's; he had it at the battle of Culloden. My eye-sight is not bad; I am sixty-five years old. I use glasses to read small print. There is a gas-light in the alley where they attacked me, I think, but am not sure, I was so agitated.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Trump-street, King-street. On the the 7th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, Owdlgate came and bought half a quire of foolscap paper, which came to 8d. He gave me a half-crown; I gave him change - and afterwards doubted about its being good. On the 1st of March Smith came and bought a sheet of brown paper, and tendered me a shilling, which I suspected, but was not certain about it. I kept it separated from any other, and gave him 11 1/2 d.; and in about an hour Owdlgate came for a penny-worth of whitey-brown paper, and paid me a shilling, which appeared very much like the other; and at eight o'clock Smith came for another sheet of brown paper, saying that the other was not sufficient; he gave me a sixpence; I took the shears and cut it - it appeared to be made of base metal. I told him he had passed bad money, and so had the old man from whom he came; he said he had not. I asked where he lived - he said at No. 7, King-street. I questioned him, and then he said his father lived in the neighbourhood of Wellclose-square, and was a shew-maker, and that he had been to Evans's in Long-lane for some pictures for his father. As he would not give his father's name I sent for a constable and detained him. He denied that his father was near the house; and, in consequence of what my boy said, I went out and saw Owdlgate about two hundred yards off. I told him he had passed bad money at my house that day - he denied it. I said,</p>
               <p>"There is a boy at my shop belonging to you" - he said he never had a boy. We took him to the shop. He said he was a shew-maker, and had been to Evans's in Long-lane for some pictures.</p>
               <p>Q. The man said so - A. Yes; the boy had said so before; the officer said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know this boy?" he said he did not, but soon after, he said he believed he recollected him, and afterwards, that they lived in the same house, he was searched, and a bad sixpence fell from his clothes on the floor; he had two good sixpences in his fob, and a basket with some pictures, some brown and whitey-brown paper in it. Smith acknowledged at the Compter, that the two good sixpences which I had given to him and Owdlgate in change, were paid to Evaos for the pictures, and that he was in the habit of passing bad money for this man, who gave him 2 d. or 3 d. for himself; that he had been employed by him about a week. I produced the money I received from them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce two shillings and two sixpences; I received one sixpence from the prosecutor, and the other the man dropped from his waistcoat pocket and tried to put his foot on it. I found two good sixpences in his fob, and found the pictures and paper in his basket; the paper which was bought at Bruce's, and two shillings-worth of copper; when I took Smith, I asked him if the man had a basket, he said he had; I said then I had passed him in the street; I sent Bruce to look at him; he gave me a signal and I took him, and asked if any body was waiting for him, he said not, and denied knowing the boy, but afterwards said that they lived in the same house near Wellclose-square; the boy gave the account Mr. Bruce has stated.</p>

            . I lived with my brother Edward in Carthusian-street. He keeps a confectioner's shop there; he has a customer named Rawley, who lives at Bethnal-green. On the 22d of March the prisoner came to the shop, and said Rawley had taken a shop in South Audley-street, and that he had come from him, and wanted 7 lbs. of stone blue, a can of barley-sugar, and 2 lbs. of refined juice. I gave them to him in consequence of this statement, and on the 24th he came again with this written order (producing it, read): -</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wilkins, - I should like you to send by bearer 7 lbs barley-sugar, 7 lbs Spanish juice, 7 lbs. sugar-candy, and charge the lowest price, and when you call I will pay you.</p>
               <p>"W. RAWLEY."</p>

I asked how he wished them to be packed, he said he could not inform me then, but he was going to Hull next day, and should probably take them with him; but having a good many parcels to take, he had not made up his mind whether he would take them or have them sent. I asked for a reference; he referred me to Messrs. Fry's, bankers, and Mr. Nalder's, Cheapside. I enquired, and next morning he called and got the goods. I told him they were entered to Robinson, he said he had several parcels to collect, and would call in a coach, in about twenty minutes, as the Hull coach passed his door; he did so, and took them.</p>

I never desired the prisoner to order these articles; I had given him some commissions some time ago; he was recommended to me as a clever man, likely to select goods for me; all my orders to him were in writing; I did not know that there was such a person as Mr. Hunt - I have not employed him for two or three months; the last order I gave him was in November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He was recommended to you as an agent - A. As a man likely to buy for me, as he bought goods on his own account, and therefore I could buy of him; when I have sent him an order he has enclosed other things on approbation, which I had not ordered in one or two instances, and I have kept some of them; he had no orders at this time; I always bought for cash - I did not direct him where to apply for goods - he has had orders to buy in his own name for me, he once had orders to buy in my name; Messrs. Fry and Co. are persons to whom I should have referred; he has bought in my name since I ordered him not.</p>

He did not say what he wanted the porter for. I took Burt to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and say if the prisoner is the man who employed you - A. I cannot say, for when I saw the man he was naked; I cannot say whether he is the person or not. I went up with Burt, opened the door, and said that was the gentleman who wanted him, but I did not see the gentleman. I shewed him into the same room. I only enquired of Burt for Hopkinson.</p>

            . I am a Temple porter. On Saturday, the 20th of March, the last witness came for me at the Temple, and took me to the Old Hummums. I followed him to the top of the house; he knocked at the door, and said he could not find Hopkinson, but had brought me. I went into the room - the gentleman was not dressed; he asked what o'clock it was; I said half-past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man he introduced you to - A. Yes, he is. He gave me 2 s., and told me to get him a 1 s. 6 d. bill-stamp; he said I was to get it at Pounce's in Long-are - I came back with it, and gave him 4 d. change. He wrote me a direction to go to the Bull-inn, Leadenhall-street, to take a place by the Brighton three o'clock coach, to take him up at the Elephant and Castle (looking at a direction;) this is what he gave me, and at the same time gave me this cheque (looking at it;) I can swear to it, because here is his hand-writing on the back; he wished me to get the money. He said he was going to Charing-cross to breakfast, and if I came back before he returned, I was not to go up stairs, but to wait outside the door till he came to me; he told me to take the cheque to Messrs. Pattisall and Bond, No. 2, Change-alley.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say why you were to wait outside the door - A. No; he only told me to wait for him outside the door. I got him to write down on the back of the cheque what I was to get for it, in case I should forget; (looking at the back) - he said four 50 l. notes, and fifty sovereigns. I went to Messrs. Pattisall and Bond, and presented it to Mr. Pearson - he looked at it for a few minutes, and then went backwards, returned to me, and asked who I brought it from; I told him. I was then handed into a back room, where I saw Mr. Pattisall, who went back with me to the Hummums; I went up stairs and the prisoner was gone. I stopped there till two or three o'clock in the afternoon, went again at four, but saw no more of him till I saw him on the Monday at Bow-street. I left the cheque at the banking-house, in the clerk's hands, with the direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the bedroom light, or was the window curtain down - A. I did not notice; it was light enough for me to see him; he was writing at a table - he had no coat, boots, or hat on; there was daylight enough for me to see him, and to have a full view of him - I was close to him at the table; he was sitting down; I stood at his side. I am sure that I know him again. I know all the Temple porters: there is no one of the name of Hopkinson. I belong to the Inner Temple - there are six of us, and three at the Middle Temple.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at the cheque and see if you have written anything on it to know it again - A. Yes; I wrote my initials J. B. on it at the banking-house. I know all the badge porters by sight; I do not know such a name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went to the hotel, he was in his shirt - without coat, hat, or boots on - A. Yes, I was about ten minutes in his company. I was gone about ten minutes for the stamp, and did not observe, when I returned, whether he was any further dressed. I am quite sure that the prisoner is the person. I never had a doubt of it. I did not see him again till the Monday, and then knew him directly - he had a white great coat on at the office.</p>
               <p>The direction was here read, and was as follows.</p>

We generally have more cheques presented on a Saturday than on any other day, and twelve o'clock is a very busy hour with us. Burt is the man who presented it. I immediately saw that it was a forgery, the hand-writing being a little different to Mr. Ridley's, and it not bearing a private mark, which we had agreed upon with Ridley about fifteen or sixteen months ago. I gave the cheque to Mr. Pattisall. I wrote my initials, J. P., on it at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a man named Pullen - Yes, he has kept cash at our house. I am not aware that there was any suspicion upon him. Mr. Pattisall was up stairs when the cheque was presented. I saw him on the subject. I did not hear him say any thing about Pullen.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you look for the private mark on the cheque - A. Not for five or ten minutes after I had declared it a forgery. I detected the forgery by the handwriting, and looked for the mark afterward - that confirmed my opinion, but I should not have paid it from the writing. It is like Ridley's writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From the first moment you saw it had you any doubt whether it was his hand-writing or not - A. None.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How do you know that Ridley has no partner - A. We have only his signature as drawer, and I know there was a dissolution some time ago, and he has never given us any intimation of his having a partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Pullen's cheques have been paid into your house on account of Ridley - A. Not that I am aware of.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 20th of March, about a quarter to ten o'clock at night, I apprehended the prisoner at the Old Hummums, Covent-garden. I had been waiting at the house all day for him. When he came into the parlour I asked what his name was - he said

            . I said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you live" - he said next door but one to the White Hart at Reigate. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have sent a porter into the City this morning with a cheque for 250 l." - he said he had. I replied that that cheque was a forgery - he said he had taken it of Mr. Smith in the Strand. I said,</p>
               <p>"I will accompany you to Mr. Smith" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, it is of no consequence." I searched him, and found some oxalic acid in a phial, and a small quantity in a paper not mixed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the effect of that - A. I have taken it to a chemist, but did not see him try any experiment. I took him to Bow-street - he gave his name there as John Hill Wagstaff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he got it from Smith - A. Yes, and said Smith lived in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he lived in the Strand, or that he got it from him - A. He said he got it from Smith in the Strand. I said I would go to Smith with him; he paused for a moment, and then said it was of no consequence.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in and read. See indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - A man placed at this bar, conscious of guilt, and forced to hear its detail in evidence, with a knowledge of the awful punishment that awaits his crime, has indeed a painful and afflicting task to support; but a man placed in my position, conscious of innocence, and forced to listen to a detail of evidence, intended to implicate him in a crime of which he is not guilty, has a part to support, infinitely more painful, infinitely more distressing - a part indeed insupportable! That, Gentlemen, is my position! Gentlemen, were I to take leave of you with this my simple assertion, feeling as I do that it will have its proper weight with you; and feeling, too, that the case laid before you has in it so many doubts and so little of positive proof or confirmation; were I thus to take leave of you, I have a sentiment in my breast which not alone gives me hopes, but that confidently assures me of your verdict of acquittal. My mind, agitated and disturbed as it is; my feelings, harassed and goaded as they are; my wretchedness altogether, does not admit of my calmly and dispassionately sifting, and observing on the evidence; but I have a confidence the Learned Judge will do so on my behalf, at once with humanity and discrimination; and I have firm reliance that you, my Jury, will do me justice. In contemplating an address to you, Gentlemen, I have not collected the various topics likely to bias your judgment through the medium of your feelings; yet that you may know on whose fate you are to decide, I cannot refrain from telling you, that, like some of yourselves, I have been a tradesman - but I have been an unfortunate one; that I now occupy the important relations of husband, father, brother, and, to my aged parents, an only son; that from my earliest age I have been taught habits of honest industry, and that if ever I deviated transiently from that path of honour, it has been occasioned more by the force of untoward and unfortunate circumstances, than from any lack of principle. In the case which has been stated to you, and attempted to be proved, I am sure that you will unhesitatingly decide, that either I must have been confident that I was acting no guilty part, or that I must have been acting the part of a lunatic. And although it is not possible that I can be prepared to produce evidence on oath, to rebut testimony which I could not beforehand know would be set up, yet I may give explanation sufficient to destroy all insinuation, and which I know ought also to repel all accusation. It has transpired in evidence, and an air of importance given to the fact, that there was found on my person, when taken into custody, a small bottle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070040"/>containing oxalic acid. Now had there happened to have been found on my person a needle and a thread, the very same consequences, by construction, might have attached to these implements. I could not commit forgery with acid, but, on the contrary, it is an article peculiarly calculated to destroy or detect such a scheme on a coloured cheque. But, however awkward or far-fetched the explanation may be, when that explanation is the fact, I venture to make it, fearless of any bad consequences. On reading Bell's Weekly Messenger of the 25th of January last, which fell into my hands, I found the following paragraph, which I shall read to you from the Paper itself. [Here the prisoner read from the paper the paragraph, stating that oxalic acid, in small quantities, was good for punch], and to make the experiments alluded to, I bought the acid. It has been insinuated that I might have had this acid as an immediate and destructive poison, but that idea will vanish when it is known that the bottle was so sealed up that without much trouble it could not be got at. Some stress may be placed on my giving another name than my real one of Wagstaff, but when the Jury are told that I did not appear to an adjourned meeting of my bankruptcy, and that a reward of 100 l. was, in consequence, offered for my apprehension, I am sure that will sufficiently account for my using another name, without looking for the crime of forgery to account for it. You all know, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the expence a ticket porter is not more than that of an ordinary porter at an inn; and that the security is much greater; and, if fraud had been intended, you also know that a ticket porter is more likely to be the cause of its being detected, than any other ordinary porter, inasmuch as the name and address of a ticket porter is more easily traced and obtained. It has been stated in evidence, that part of my instructions to the porter were, that when he returned with the money, he should stop at the door, if I was not in room. It will probably known to the Gentlemen of the Jury, that at the Old Hummums there is no coffee-room; that Gentlemen occasionally sleeping there, as was my case, pay for their bed and leave the house, so that, in fact, the only place I could appoint to meet this porter, was at the door, and I had the less difficulty in doing this, as his name and address were known to me. It is my misfortune, Gentlemen of the Jury, not to be able to place witnesses before you to show you through whom I became possessed of this checque of 250 l.; but there will be no difficulty in satisfying you that it bears no similarity to my hand-writing in any of its parts - and were it necessary, every one who ever saw me write could testify to that. Mr. Smith, from whom I received it, who represented himself as the messenger of Mr. D. Pullen, and who indubitably was so, delivered the checque to me at the door of the New Exchange Coffee-house, in the Strand, on account of Mr. Pullen. With this Mr. Pullen, who was a bill-broker, I had various dealings previous to my leaving London, but availing himself of the circumstances of my being obliged to be out of the way, he took advantage of me, and amongst other bills, which he kept from me, besides money I lent to him, was one for about 240 l., drawn by the very Messrs. 
               <persName id="t18240407-89-person840">Wm. Ridley</persName>
             and Co., who purport to be the drawers of the cheque in question, and for which I never got any value; but lately, I intimated, that, at any personal risk to myself, I would expose him, if he did not pay me something on account, and it was in consequence of this threat of mine, that I received the cheque in question by the hands of Mr. Smith. I never had any address from Mr. Smith, nor do I know him otherwise than as the accredited clerk of Mr. Pullen; I have made every enquiry for him, but in vain. I am sure Gentlemen of the Jury, you will not fail to remark that it is an extraordinary coincidence of circumstances, that this same Mr. Pullen, who sent me the cheque, possessed the bill of 240 l. the signature and hand-writing of Messrs. Ridley and Co. - and Messrs. Ridley and Co. knew that he did so possess that hill - and it is also to be observed by you, that Mr. D. Pullen kept a banking account with Messrs. Bond and Co. These two incidents will account for he or his clerk having the means of obtaining a coloured cheque of Messrs. Bond, Sons, and Co., and the means of imitating the hand-writing of Messrs. Ridley and Co., and added to all this, it is, if possible, more extraordinary that something or other about the cheque should have excited the suspicion both of Messrs. Bond and Co., and Messrs. Ridley and Co., so as to cause them to say as soon as it was presented, that the cheque emanated from Mr. Pullen. Here is Mr. Pullen owing me money; here is a cheque given to me in a hand-writing I was familiar with, and therefore could not doubt its being geniune. Here, then, in the absence of this Mr. Smith, whom I have tried in vain to find, here then is, as I trust you will consider, enough to satisfy you that I had no knowledge of the cheque being a forgery, nor were any of the circumstances under which I received it, or about the cheque itself, calculated to excite in my mind a suspicion that it was a forgery. Gentlemen of the Jury, I would not willingly tire you by needless detail. It must be unnecessary to ask you to divest your minds of anything that has transpired to my prejudice, unconnected with the matter at issue. I confidently repose in your dispasionate decision. My life is in your hands. If you have no doubt of my innocence you will at once relieve me from suspense. Do by me as you think you yourselves would be entitled to be done with in my situation, and I make sure of a favourable determination.</p>

               <p>Q. When was the first time you received that direction - A. Yesterday; I went to No. 24, Hutchin-lane, and asked there for a person named Smith, who had been clerk to a Mr. Pullen; the answer I had was that the person did not know the name of Smith, and as for Pullen they knew nothing of him, for he had not lived there for three years. I then went to Mr. Faucett, No. 21, Little St. Thomas Apostle, by Mr. Cope's direction. Faucett was not there; a woman answered me; I asked her where Faucett lived - she said she did not know. I then went to No. 10, Water-lane, and enquired for Mr. Hughes, but did not find him; I asked a woman for him. I made no further enquiry for Smith. I did not know him or Pullen myself.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 5th or 6th of April did you make any enquiry for Smith or Pullen - A. I enquired of a Mr. Ridley about Pullen. I did not tell him what I wanted of him. I was informed that Faucett very likely could inform me, and in consequence of which I went in search of Faucett. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070041"/>not been able to learn anything of Smith, Pullen, or Paucett.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to take so long time before you enquired - A. I had enquired before; I was first asked about enquiring for Smith.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you been clerk to Cope - A. Nearly four months. I do not know when he was first employed for Wagstaff.</p>
               <p>Q. The 6th was on Tuesday, you made no further enquiry from that time till Sunday - A. No; I was not desired.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Hercules-buildings, Westminster-road. I do not know Pullen; I know a man named Smith - I do not know in whose employ he was; he was a man who professed to discount bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time about the beginning of last March see a bill in Smith's hands - A. I did; a bill and cheque; the amount of the cheque was 250 l. - it was drawn by Messrs. Ridley and Co., on Messrs. Bond, Sons, and Pattisall; it was on a coloured paper, with yellow bars. I saw it; but did not take any very particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see the cheque - A. Smith was indebted to me in the sum of 30 l. on a cheque, and had been so indebted since the middle of September last. I had repeatedly applied to him for payment, and he had as frequently promised to pay, but always excused himself when I asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the cheque - A. In the middle of March, in the evening, I was sitting at the Bay-tree tavern, St. Swithin's-lane, kept by one Philpot; I had to meet a gentleman there on business. I was reading the newspaper, Smith came in accidentally, and sat himself down in the same box; I asked for my money, but did not get it. He produced a bill of exchange, and a cheque for 250 l.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In the early part of March you first saw the cheque in his possession - A. About the middle; it was the latter end of the week, certainly, either on Thursday or Friday in the week previous to my seeing in the paper a report of the arrest of Wagstaff - I will swear that it was either Thursday or Friday; my impression is that it was on Thursday evening - I had known Smith for two or three years; I do not know where he lived in March or February, but can give a very good reason why I did not. I never knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any note of his for the 30 l. - A. I had a cheque of another person's, which I had from him, and on which he owed me 30 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal a good deal in bills and cheques - A. I do. I have lived but three weeks in Hercules-buildings, before that I lived at No. 8, Waterloo-road, and lived there about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you lived in a much larger house than either of those - A. I was four months in the House of Correction, Clerkenwell; that ended in October, 1822; it was about some bills of Sir

            . I went there by sentence of the Court of King's Bench. Smith had given me a cheque which was not paid. Waterloo-road and Hercules-buildings are not in the rules.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you put to hard labour at the House of Correction - A. No. I think the cheque I saw Smith with was payable to a number - I do not remember what the number was; I noticed the banker's name, as I had a cheque on the same banker myself, and have it here (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the prisoner - A. I have known him two or three years; I never saw him write. I never knew where Smith lived.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have dealings with a man to the amount of 30 l., and not know where to call on him or to enquire after him - A. I usually found him at the Commercial Coffee-house, Skinner-street. Mr. Cope did not apply to me to know where he was to be found.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he apply to you - A. I met him on Saturday by accident; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you had known the prisoner two or three years, and heard he had been taken up for forgery, had you never the kindness to go to him and tell him all this - A. I went to him at the House of Correction, but could not get admittance; I never went to Cope. I have seen the prisoner every day since he has been in Newgate; he told me who his attorney would be, but I did not go, as Cope held a judgment against me, and had a writ against me. I told the prisoner of the dealing I had with Smith, and put this cheque into his hands, to make what use he thought proper with it. I told him a fortnight ago that I had been accustomed to meet Smith at the Colonial Coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is the cheque you have produced, now look at the one for 250 l. - A. I have no hesitation in saying it is like it; the writing is not the same. The writing I remember appeared in a tremulous hand; the front of the paper I remember was the same. I did not see the back of it.</p>

            . I am a carpet manufacturer, and live in Tottenhan-court-road. I have known the prisoner thirty years, and am acquainted with his hand-writing, (looking at the cheque;) I never saw him write like this. I believe it is not his hand-writing. I always thought him as respectable a man as any body in this town.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old is he - A. I believe thirty-one. I knew his father before he was married.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Be so good as to look at the figures on the back of this cheque. Whose hand-writing do you believe them to be - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not believe them to be Wagstaff's do you - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at this paper - (the direction given to Burt by the prisoner) - A. I know nothing of it, it is not like any of the prisoner's writing which I have seen.</p>
               <p>Q. On the back of the cheque there are</p>
               <p>"four 50 l. and fifty sovereigns;" do you know that hand-writing - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Six witnesses gave the prisoner a most excellent character till within the last fifteen months, since which time they had not seen him.</p>
               <p>A JUROR to BURT. Q. Did you see him write the direction to the Bull Inn - A. Yes, and saw him write on the back of the cheque.</p>

Taylor and Lloyd, at Birmingham. I put it into my pocket handkerchief, and carried it in my hand, to the Magpie and Pewter-platter public-house, where I lodge, and gave it into the care of Graves the landlord, to lock up, while I went to bed, and when I got up he gave it to me in the same state as before. I carried it in my handkerchief to the Swan and Two-necks, Lad-lane, and put it in the bottom of the coach, between the seats, on the floor of the coach. I then assisted in loading the coach, and went into the office for a few things, and on going to the coach in two or three minutes it was gone. I went and gave information at the bankers.</p>

            , No. 23, Edmund-street, Battle-bridge. I said it was not regular to take country notes of strangers, and if he would leave it, I would send him his parcel and change down, he said there was no occasion for that, he would get it changed in Covent-garden, where he was known; and while he was speaking he took the note off the counter, before I was aware of it; he seemed very much embarrassed, and began asking for patterns of furniture, and said he should be glad to have them sent down in the parcel; he went out of the shop in five or ten minutes, and did not go towards Covent-garden, so I followed him; he saw me when he had gone about twenty yards, and then went in another direction; he was going in quite a contrary direction. I followed him to Portland-place; he saw me there again, and crossed over in a crowd, to avoid me, and altered his direction again. Mr. Corder, jun., was with me; we went up and told him he must come back with us; he seemed very much frightened; he had a piece of paper in his hand, and was squezing it up, he put it into his mouth, and appeared to swallow it, we endeavoured to take him; but he fell back, and ran away about fifty yards; we followed, and took him to the shop, and kept him two hours, till master came home; while he was in the shop he said,</p>
               <p>"You have made me loose the note, you knocked it out of my hand." I said,</p>
               <p>"You know where the note is gone." he said nothing more, but that he had just found it in the New-road, that he was a poor man, and was willing to leave his coat if I would let him go.</p>

            's canteen, as my son had missed it. I asked him whether it was a single plate - he said he believed it was. I noticed that he appeared agitated, and said I should be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070044"/>there presently, and that it was all right, thinking that he would then go back to my son, which he did. I followed him - I called him into the counting-house, and asked him if he knew any thing about it, as I missed a great number of things. My son told him it was only three weeks ago since he had ordered that canteen to be locked up in the warehouse; he said he had never seen the canteen open. I said I should endeavour to find it out. I went for an officer, who came and apprehended him. He denied every thing. We searched his lodgings, and found a waistcoat. We took him before a magistrate, and he was committed - and on the 20th I received a letter from him, and in consequence of that letter, I went to him in Tothill-fields, with my wife. I asked what he had sent for me for - I did not threaten or promise him at all. He said he had sent for me to ask if I would forgive him, and that if I would, he would tell me all the truth, and keep nothing back. (I had found two of the spoons then.) I began to tell him what I had found, and said, I wondered that he could ask me to forgive him. I asked what he had done with the rest of the plate, saying, that we had found a portion of it, and it was of no use to deny it; he said he had every reason to believe that the rest of the plate was melted - that he had met a man in the street who took him to a jew named Philips, in a court in Poulteney-street, where he had sold it in small parcels - that he at first took six large table-forks, for which the man gave him 2 l. 7 s. I wrote down in pencil what he said, and my son copied it.</p>

             continued. He said he sold the six forks on one day for 2 l. 7 s., on another day a waiter, four tea, two salt, and four egg-spoons, for which the Jew gave him 1 l. 19 s.; the next lot he said he had taken was six desert orks, for which they gave him 18 s.; that he afterwards took sugar-tongs and tea-spoons, not mentioning how many, and he did not recollect the price they gave him. I asked what he had done with the five duplicates which we had traced to different pawnbrokers', where the plate had been taken out the week before - he said, that on being introduced to this Jew, he made him a present of the duplicates to give to a friend of his, who was to use them - that his own wife had pawned the things, and said one of the duplicates was lost; he told me where one of the whips was. He sent for me again on the Wednesday following; I then told him we had found a quantity of other things, and did he mean to tell me who took him to the receiver's - he directed me to Vine-street, but we did not find the man.</p>

I missed a quantity of plate from two canteens, and told the prisoner it was very singular that plate should be taken from them without being missed; he said he had never seen the canteens opened, and did not know that there was any silver in them. I missed a plated toasting-fork, a rose-wood inkstand, a small pair of scissars, three whips, and a brush.</p>

I do not exactly know what he said, but heard the agreement - my brother gave him 4 l. 19 s. for them. He paid him 5 s. earnest, and the prisoner gave his address at No. 9, Bainbridge-street, St. Giles's; and in the afternoon my brother ascertained that to be correct, and paid him the rest, and took his receipt. My brother is not here he was in the country, when his summons was left. The horse was put into our stable, and the cart stood in the yard. Mr. Gough came on Monday and claimed them.</p>

My husband and I sleep in the shop. We keep our property there in a box.

               <p>Q. Did she go to bed on Saturday night - A. Yes, she went to bed before us, and slept on the second floor that night - she was in the habit of doing little things for us, and lighting my fire. The box was on the top of my bureau bedstead, and was safe when we went to bed. I heard her come into our room about seven o'clock in the morning - she set about lighting the fire, but I did not hear her go out. I and my husband were in bed, and when we got up at ten o'clock we missed this property, and she had left the house. I had not heard her go out of the room. She had been nine days with us, and had given no warning. I had no reason to suppose that she was going, I am sure that the box was on the top of our bedstead when we went to bed, There was a lamp burning in the room when she was there, We let the house out in lodgings - some of the lodgers are single women.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take them in without a character - A. Yes. I fell asleep while she was in the room, and did not see what she did. I did not awake till near ten o'clock - the trunk was a paper one, it contained the property stated in the indictment, (enumerating it) It was locked and I kept the key. I had opened it on the Saturday, night to put the money into it. The property was worth 9 l. 5 s. altogether. I have since seen my bonnet and feathers, the skirt of a gown, and another gown cut up into aprons, on the 22d of February, when she was taken.</p>

            . I rent this house, and let lodgings to single women. The last witness is my wife. A band-box, with the bonnet and feathers, and another with the clothes, were both on the top of the bedstead, over our heads. The prisoner came into the room about seven o'clock on Sunday morning - she made herself useful about the house - I was half asleep and half awake when she came in - she left the room before I went to sleep. I awoke rather before ten, and found the trunks gone, and went in pursuit of her. She was taken ten or twelve days after. She was brought to our house by a female, and said she came from Brighton, and wanted a lodging; two other females lodged with me at the time, and are there now; they did not go away. I took the prisoner myself, drinking with a gentleman at a public-house in the Old Bailey, with my wife's beaver bonnet, feathers, and gown on. I produce them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of March, the prisoner was given into my custody - and after she was committed for re-examination, the prosecutor and prosecutrix identified the bonnet, feathers, and gown on her back. I asked where she lived, and at last ascertained that it was at Mrs. Shields's, No. 3, Queen's Gardens, Brompton. I searched her apartment there, and found a hat-box, and some pieces which the prosecutrix says have been cut off her gown, and here is an apron which Mrs. Shields gave me. She appeared in distress.</p>
               <p>RUTH BAMBER. This is my band-box; the apron is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070046"/>made out of my gown, and here is the body of it. My trunk and all were taken.</p>

There is a private-door leading to the dwelling-house, and another from the shop, which is generally open, the street door is kept shut. I heard some words on the stairs, looked up, and saw the prisoner behind the cook, who was coming down stairs - she asked him what he did there; he said he was sent there by a gentleman; she then asked what he had in his apron; he said</p>
               <p>"What is that to you?" she said she insisted upon knowing, and put her hand on his shoulder to stop him from going out - he gave himself a twist, I directly collared him, and insisted on knowing what he had got; I put my hand to his apron, which was tied up round him, something rattled, he said,</p>
               <p>"Well, come, I will shew you, do not hold me in this way." I took him into the counting-house, and found a sugar-bason, two table-spoons, a fish-slice, a gravy-spoon, a fork, and two salt-spoons on him; he afterwards sat down by the side of the desk, and there I found a seal.</p>

I was going down stairs, and saw the drawing-room door open; I went in, (as I knew it was shut not an hour before) and saw the prisoner coming out of the adjoining room, where part of this plate was kept. I asked him how he came there - he said a gentleman below had sent him up. He asked if some gentleman lived there; I do not recollect the name. I went down stairs before him, keeping him behind. I stopped him at the bottom of the stairs. Summers came - he has stated what passed correctly. Part of the plate was kept in the adjoining room too that in which I saw him, and the other locked up in the room where I saw him. I knew it all to be my masters'. I missed it from where it was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say which boy it was - A. It was the prisoner; I had a full view of him by the moon-light as he came up to me, I am certain of him - it was moon-light, there was a lamp within a few yards of us; I do not think that it was a gas one.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner ran against you what happened - A. The man ran up to me immediately, and snatched my watch from my pocket; my seals hung out, but the chain was hardly to be seen. He ran away immediately that he got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your watch come out of your pocket without any force - A. Yes, it came right out. I caught it in my hand, but had no power to hold it, he got it; from the blow I received I had hardly power to protect it - I could hardly keep myself on my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. The man ran away, what became of the boys - A. They all ran together a considerable way, and then separated. I pursued them, and called Stop thief! I did not lose sight of one, but lost sight of the two who separated; they threw the watch under my feet when I had pursued about ten yards; I do not know which threw it down; it was the man, who took it out of my pocket when the prisoner had shoved me; I could not see which threw it down, as I was running very swift - I never lost sight of the prisoner at all I am certain, for when I stooped to pick up the watch, I kept him in view, and finding the others had escaped, I kept following him; he ran two or three hundred yards before he was taken by the witness - I am certain of him. I have the watch here.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel. On the 12th of February, both the prisoners were at my house in company with another man - they all three came in together, and called for a pint of beer; I saw Bounce offering to sell some silver spoons to the other man, who came in with them - I took them out of the other man's hands, and said I would buy them; I took them to the bar, and asked what he wanted for them - he said 20 s. I said if he would sit down I would send for change. I immediately sent to Lambeth-street for an officer, and before he came the other man absconded, and I detained the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to get away - A. They were in the tap-room; I told him to wait in the tap-room, and while I was in the bar, he went out at the back door. I then stopped in the tap-room with the prisoners till the officer came - they did not know that I was detaining them; they never offered to go. I am sure that Bounce first produced the spoons; he offered them to the other men for sale. I gave them to the officer, and pointed to the prisoners; he took them.</p>

            . I am an officer, stationed at Southgate. On Tuesday night, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner wheeling an empty barrow, about one hundred yards from his own house; he said,</p>
               <p>"Good morning Mr. Fitch;" he left the barrow about twenty yards from his house. Next morning I accompanied the prosecutor to where the barrow was, and found a mark in it, which the mouth of the bell, being heavy, had made. I found the bell at his house, covered with sacks. I knew him before.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of March, at Bows-farm, he asked what he had done; I said it was about the bell, stolen from Mr. Gladwin, and which had been found on his premises; he said he left the Cherry-tree public-house, about eleven o'clock, and found the bell in the street, and if he found any thing he thought he had a right to it. The Cherry-tree is about a mile from Southgate.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Handyman. On the 28th of February, at five o'clock in the morning, he sent me down to Kennington-lane, with the cart and horses. I there met the prisoner, who told me to make haste. I said I could not come faster. He asked me to give him the whip, and he drove the horses into a field near the hay-rick. The gate was open - his brother Will was waiting there. They set the cart all ready for loading. The prisoner got into the cart and loaded the hay, and Will pitched it. They told me to move three large trusses into a place from where they took four trusses. The prisoner then got off the load, took the whip, and drove off, and I left Will Gaskin in the rick-yard. I drove the hay to Paddington - Will went with me. The prisoner joined us at Paddington, and then they tried to sell it, but could not, and brought it to town. They sold it in New York-place, near the New-road. The prisoner gave me 10 s. to give my master for the cartage. I did not know that any thing was wrong.</p>

On the morning of the 6th of March, about five o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner sitting in a cart at Brentford, driving it - a person was with him - he was about three miles from Twickenham. I stopped the cart, and asked what he had in his possession; he said, nothing that he need to be ashamed or afraid of - but on my coming up and putting my hand to the horse, he set off, and left the cart. I found it contained a leaden cistern and pump, and other pieces of lead. It was shewn to the witnesses.</p>

He was brought to me afterwards, and begged of me to forgive him. I said I would not, as I suspected that he had robbed me many times before. I gave him in charge. He afterwards sent for me, and said he had been in the habit of taking chaff, and selling it at the Weaver's Arms public-house, for 1 s. a sack.</p>

            . I am Walker's son-in-law. I watched the prisoner at four o'clock in the morning, and when he had got about thirty yards from the premises, I told him to stop, and found a sack of chaff in his cart put between two sacks, concealed under a great coat - and another sack under the cloth. I took the chaff away. He went to town with his team, returned at night, and next morning absconded.</p>

One M'Keal was in the act of rising to strike Parteridge, who was in liquor; he turned round and behaved very indecent to Stokes, then jumped about, and knocked the prisoner's beer over. Stokes slapped his face, and he struck her. A man jumped up and struck him, and just as the prisoner was rising, Parteridge turned and struck him on the side of the neck.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner up at her own house, and told her some plate had been stolen, and she said she had heard something had been stolen, but knew nothing of it. I asked what she had to say to the plate she had offered to Mr. Smart, she said that plate she found on the top of Theobald's night-cart; that as she went home she saw a man like a footman, throw something on the night-cart - that her husband was in Theobald's employ, and in the morning she went to the cart, and found the plate on the soil, tied in a handkerchief.</p>

On the 26th March, about twelve o'clock, I was wheeling gravel, nearly opposite his house, and observed Donahu and two others at play. I watched them for a few minutes, and then saw one, less than either of the prisoners, go from them, and walk by Harris's house, then return, and go into the shop, he came out in a minute or two, with something bulky under his coat, he joined the other two, who were fifty or sixty yards off, and all turned out of the road. I gave an alarm - Harris's son joined in the pursuit; I fetched Larkin, and took Donahu in ten minutes; I am certain he was one of them; he was in company with the boy. I saw a decanter in his bosom as I followed him, saw him take it out, and put it on the coping of a wall. I took it up, followed, and never lost sight of him afterwards.</p>

I took the pipe and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070051"/>carried it to Mr. Eld, and knocked him; the prisoner walked backwards and forwards in the road the while - he could not have escaped without my observing him.

            . I am a glazier, and live in Bird Cage-walk, Hackney. On the 21st of March. I was coming from Leather-lane down Old-street-road, and saw the boy Williams with this bag in his hand, and the prisoner following close behind him - he tapped him on the shoulder and stopped him as I passed; he leaned down to him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070052"/>said,</p>
               <p>"What did they say to you;" the boy made no answer. I then walked on a few paces, turned up for a necessary purpose, and saw the boy give the prisoner this parcel out of his bag - they crossed the road to go up a turning, and suspecting something I went up to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"You will excuse me, but is this your boy?" - and in the interim, he said,</p>
               <p>"No, Sir;" and gave the parcel back to the boy. I asked the boy if his master told him to give it to anybody; he said, No. I took them into a public-house, and said to the landlord,</p>
               <p>"I suspect something between this man and boy, and have brought them here to investigate the business." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"It is perfectly correct, I have come from Mr. Luke, for the parcel back again;" I said I should not be satisfied till he went to the boy's master. The boy told me readily where he lived, and on the road there, the prisoner met a man; who asked him to go and drink; the prisoner asked me to stop a few minutes, and he would be back again - I said No; and on the way he said,</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I may be mistaken in the boy; I hope you will not attempt to injure me if it is so." I took him to Mr. Scott, who said he knew nothing of him, and gave him in charge; he said a man told him to meet a boy of that kind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you go by the name of Fuller - A. Never. I was never tried here.</p>

            . I sent my boy to Mr. Luke's with a watch case, to get a morrocco case. Fell brought him and the prisoner back, and asked if I knew him, and said I might thank him for saving me from being robbed - the prisoner said he had been sent by a young man after the boy. My boy has since lost a gold case, and given two different accounts of it; I took him to the office.

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Tottenham Court-road. Last Saturday week I observed that the pin of the window was out, and on Monday, when the prisoner came I asked if he had taken it out; he said,</p>
               <p>"I recollect that I took it out after you put it in, because I thought the shutter was not closed, and I forgot to put it in again." I left work about seven o'clock on Monday; it was dark; he agreed to go meet me at the Plough, public-house, in Carey-street, to drink. He said he was going to his brother's in Cavendish-square; he owed me 5 s. 4 d., and asked if I would have 5 s.; I said No; he put 4 s. into my hand, and said it was to get something to drink - we went about two hundred yards down Tottenham Court-road; he turned to the right as if to go to Cavendish-square, and I returned to the house - I had the key of the shop door. I went in, and sat by the fire, and in about half an hour heard somebody come to the door - I went on the stairs opposite the street door; the door was unlocked; it was locked before; I heard the lock go. The prisoner came in, and went into the shop, then returned, and bolted the street door, and called out Tom three times (master calls me Tom) he then took a chisel off the bed-rack, and broke open the parlour door at the back of the shop, which was full of beds, mattresses, and cloth; he had told me that he had carried a piece of cloth out of the cart into that room one morning; and when he got into the parlour he brought something heavy out, which I thought was cloth; he tied some cord round it, put it under his arm, and went out; I went to the door, but was so confused I could not open it; he had shut it. When I did get out I saw that he had just crossed the street - I called after him, but he had got too far. I went next morning with Dixon in Bishopsgate-street, and saw him, pointed him out, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He knew that you slept in the shop - A. I sleep on the first floor. It happened at eight o'clock; he could not see me for the door hid me. I was put into the house to look after the house, and repair it. I might have stopped after I had finished the repairs, but I did not intend it. The goods belong to Mr. Dixon. I gave an alarm directly I got out; the watchmen were not on duty; the lamps were lighted; I could not see his face out of doors.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If there had been no lamps could you have seen a man's face at eight o'clock - A. I could not. He could not see me on the stairs. I had been fitting up the house, and if any porter's job was to be done, I should do it. I had been porter at the old house in Barbican, and continued the same engagement.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what capacity were you engaged at Barbican - A. I carried out goods, and had 15 s. a-week. No new engagement was made when I went to this house, but he paid me 20 s. a week then.</p>

            . I am a book-binder. About the latter end of January, I met the prisoner near East Smithfield. I had known him four or five years, living with Messrs. Jones and Wiggin's, wholesale stationers, of Leadenhall-street; he said</p>
               <p>"I have left my place, and am out of employ, will you buy any pieces of pasteboard,"</p>
               <p>"I said</p>

               <p>"No, I buy it whole and cut it out," he said he should have something else for me another time; I said he could let me see it, and about a week after he brought me a sheet of paper, and said he had two reams of it at 18 s. I asked what was the trade price, he said he believed it was 28 s. 6 d. I took the sample sheet to Mr. Wiggin's, who gave me money to buy it; he called in an hour for an answer - I told him to bring it to the

I am a wholesale stationer, and live at Aldgate; two parcels of paper were sent to me by Mercury; they are these which are now produced; the prisoner had been five years in our service, and left three months ago.

I kept it in my possession till it was taken to the Mansion-house; we traced it to Mr. Gye's.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of March, I apprehended the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. GYE. I can swear to this paper being ours', all except one ream which I will not be positive of. I believe the cartridge paper to be mine; we lost it from our warehouse in Pudding-lane; we lost thirty or forty reams. A man was convicted here of stealing it - I do not know the prisoner, we found the warehouse unlocked about a week before; the door was broken open.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not recognise any of this paper. I shewed Mercury samples of paper which I received from a person in bad circumstances, who was in the paper line.</p>

I was carrying it myself about six o'clock in the evening, and seeing the prisoner at a public-house door in Whitechapel I employed him to carry it; he walked by my side with it, but was continually stopping behind. I turned round to him in Whitechapel, and said</p>

               <p>"I will take it the rest of the way," I turned round and saw that one piece was gone - I seized the other. They had been tied together with two strong strings, and it is impossible that the strings could be cut without his knowledge; it must have been done by his associates. I turned round and laid hold of one piece; three or four men surrounded me directly, and said,</p>
               <p>"Bill, run," and he did run pretty quick. I kept the piece of cloth, went to Lambeth-street, and gave information; it was worth 22 l. I saw him on the following Saturday, and am certain of him; I have not found the cloth.</p>

            . I work for a bricklayer. On the 29th of March I saw the prisoner come out of Peacock's shop with a leg of veal; he gave it to another lad who ran out with it - the prisoner then put on his shoes, and walked as if he was lame. I went in, and told Peacock; then followed, and found him at the back of the buildings.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 6th of March, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, the prisoner ran by me in Gloster-court, Whitecross-street, with something bulky under his arm; he was about fifteen yards from Chalkley's shop. I called to him to stop; he hastened his pace, and ran into Pump-row - I came up to him, and he dropped it; I caught hold of him; he got from me, and ran away. I overtook him again in Chequer-alley, and took him; I had not lost sight of him. I returned to Pump-row, and found the beef where he had dropped it, and took him to the watch-house with it. I went to the prosecutor, who claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in Blue Anchor-alley - he came up and asked for my bundle; I said I had none. He said at the watch-house that I resisted; the constable would not take the charge, as he said if I had resisted and fallen down I should be dirty.</p>
               <p>Witness. The constable of the night said if I locked him up he would let him out, as he complained of my keeping possession of the meat. I thought it right to keep it till it was sworn to; he was locked up at last.</p>

I got up, and saw the prisoner going to the door - the till was wide open. I ran and took hold of him in the shop, charged him with robbing the till; he denied it; I missed half-a crown from it, there being only one there. I sent for an officer; he then entreated me to forgive him, and said he would do so no more; a person came in, and I got her to fasten the door, but he contrived to open it and get out - I followed him for two hundred yards, crying Stop thief! and he was stopped.</p>

            . I am a Thames police constable. On the 26th of February, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner offering a brass cock for sale, at the shop of a dealer in marine stores, in Crown-street, Soho. I found the articles stated in the indictment on him; he said he got them from his father, who is a smith; that he was distressed, and took them from his father to get his shoes mended. I went to his father, who directed me to Burgess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in a public-house, and asked a man about a ship - he said I should find it difficult to get one, but he could put me in the way of getting one, if I could get some old metal, and take it to the shop in Crown-street - there were men looking out there, and if I gave them an incorrect account of them, I should be sent on board the tender - and this man I have since learnt is a police officer. I saw him at the office, but could not get to speak to him.</p>

I shewed her a drawer - as I took up one piece she took up a second. I shewed her a remnant which she approved of, and gave me a half-crown. I went to the till for change, and saw her drop her handkerchief over a piece which she had laid on the counter. She then asked for bonnet trimmings. I went into the back room for it, turned my head, and saw her covering the handkerchief over the ribbon - the trimming did not suit her. I followed her out, took her basket from her hand, and took the ribbon out of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Her handkerchief was in the basket as well - A. Yes - she made two attempts to put her handkerchief more over it to conceal it; it was only six or seven yards, but there is a block of wood inside it; she said she did not know that she had it.</p>

On the 24th of February, having missed calico I marked some, and some brown Holland with a pencil mark, locked the shop up at night, and in the morning gave the servant the key to give to the prisoner. I went into the shop about half-past seven o'clock, and found him cutting some shalloon - the shutters were not open; he said he was cutting it for a wrapper, and afterwards that it was to cover over some things. I looked and found about a yard and a half was cut off the brown Holland. I searched him, but did not find it - I gave him in charge. The coat was stolen a year ago.</p>

               <p>JOHN O'BRIEN. I am fifteen years old. The prisoner and another man came into the parlour, and told me to bring 3 s. worth of copper for silver; he took half of it into the parlour, put some into his pocket, and some in his apron; he said there was but 2 s. 6 d. - I said he had put 6 d. into his pocket. He said,</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Saturday night the 13th of March, I saw the prisoner and another man, about a mile and a-half from Mr. Harrison's; the prisoner had some lead in a bag, and the other had some in a basket. I asked what he had got - Hill said he did not know what it was, the other threw down his basket and ran. Hill said he had employed him to carry it - he attempted to escape, but I kept him. I had seen him in company with the same person on Wednesday and Thursday night, with the same basket and bag. I saw the lead compared with the slips. I found a knife in his posession.</p>

            . I have some boats off the London-docks. On the 2d of April I was on the pier-head, and saw the prisoner bringing a bag ashore. He said a person named Dixon sent him for the things - I said I would go to Dixon with him; he then said they did not belong to Dixon, but to a person whom he would fetch. I went with him - he ran off twice - I secured him a third time, and he escaped. I met him in Mordan's-rents afterwards, and asked him to go to the person who sent him for the sail - he took me to a house, and said the person was not at home. He ran away again - I at last secured him.</p>

I gave the key to King - he never brought anything in. I did not see him again till the Friday following, about three o'clock, when I looked through the key-hole and saw them both on their knees, pulling up the floor and earth which covered the pipe. I went and told Hellyer, and in an hour looked through again, and saw them pulling up the pipe. We got an officer, went into the house, and found one up-stairs and the other below, and the water-pipe was up-stairs, tied in one of their aprons.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of April I apprehended the prisoner in Chandler-street, and said it was on suspicion of a robbery. He said,</p>
               <p>"What for a ham?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." he said he picked it up.</p>

I called the servant, who told him he had been up - he still denied it. I gave him in charge - Sampson said he had been up in the front-room, and he had seen some leather in his hat. Sampson brought it from the room, and I was convinced that it had been in his hat, for it was squeezed, and we keep it quite smooth. He was taken to the watchhouse - the officer brought him back to me - he said voluntarily then that he had taken the leather from the front-room, and put it into his hat. I found some of my goods at his lodgings next morning, and took them to him - he said he took them from behind my counter; and in consequence of what he told me I went to Collett's house - he is a shoemaker. I told him I had come on unpleasant business, that he had some leather of mine - he turned to a box and said,</p>

On the 3d of March, about half-past four or five o'clock in the afternoon I was at home, and heard a noise in the adjoining house, which belongs to me, and is unoccupied. I went round to the back of the house, and in the kitchen found two rolls of lead. A friend who was with me watched outside while I examined the house; I found the prisoners on the roof, and asked what they were doing there; they made no answer. I gave an alarm. Branson said he came up to see what the other was about. I brought him down, and gave him in charge. I compared the lead next day with the roof - it tallied exactly, and measured eight feet; it had been ripped and cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You found the lead in the kitchen - A. Yes; they had thrown it from the roof into the kitchen, as the floors were not boarded.</p>

             lodges there. On the 3d of April, at two o'clock I was sitting in my room, and heard a strange foot overhead, in an empty room where these clothes hung to dry. I went up, and saw some things taken off the line, and thrown into a corner; they were on the line ten minutes before. I found the prisoner, (who is a stranger,) standing in the corner of the next room. A shift, two handkerchiefs, and an apron laid there, which belong to Jones.</p>

On the 25th of March, about half-past five o'clock the prisoner came to the shop with three other women - the prisoner produced the duplicate of a shawl, pawned for 12 s. I suspected, and watched them; one of the others handed me a cloak, which she pretended she had picked off the floor. The prisoner proposed giving me 9 s., and leaving another shawl in pawn for 3 s. I went round the corner, and missed a piece of cotton, and said,</p>
               <p>"One of you have got a piece of cotton." I saw the prisoner move - she shifted her clothes, and the cotton fell at her feet; it could not fall from the others. All three were in company. I was attending to a customer part of the time. I am sure that she dropped it.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor brought these boys to the office; they said he had been robbed by a girl with one eye, in consequence of which I took the prisoner in a quarter of an hour, and they identified her directly. The prosecutor did not appear drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Are there not several girls about there with bad eyes - A. There is one who has a patch over her eye.</p>

             re-examined. I know that the prisoner is the girl. I cannot say whether she had but one eye.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the man, or the boys.</p>
               <p>- WEBB. I live in Angel-alley. I was standing at my door on this day. Two girls ran up the alley - one said to the other,</p>
               <p>"Run on;" they ran very hard, and never stopped till they got to the end of the alley. I thought they had done a robbery, and presently Gentry came to my door with these boys - his pocket was turned inside out, and he said he had been robbed. One of the boys said that one was a one-eyed girl. I said,</p>
               <p>"No, do not say that the one-eyed girl did it - she is a bad girl," but she is neither of the two girls. One of them has a cast in her eye, and the other a black patch over her eye - she is not either of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know the prisoner - A. Yes, any one may know her she is so remarkable. I did not see Gentry talking to either of the girls, but as they were running, I suspected they had committed the robbery. I heard, that the prisoner was taken up for it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, she is a bad girl, but she is free from that."</p>

On the 22d of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 38, Edward-street, relative to a burglary. I believe it to be the prisoner's house - it is within thirty yards of my own. I had missed six beer casks from my yard on the 2d of December, which were safe the night before. On going to the prisoner's house, the headborough, Gillen, went into the yard, put his staff into the water-butt, and found one of my casks - it was sunk being full of water. I went up stairs, and found another one in the back room, which is a bed-room - it was a nine gallon cask, and the one in the water-butt held twelve gallons. I also found thirty staves of casks, which I know to be mine by the marks on them; they would make more than two casks - they were different sizes, and might belong to four - there were more than hoops for two casks. The prisoner kept threatening me with an action; I replied that he need not talk, for I had found some of my casks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You missed them on the 2d of December - A. Yes - a man named Walker was in bed in the room where I found one. The prisoner threatened me with an action for breaking into his house, and said he would blow our brains out, if he had a pistol.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOND. I am constable of St. Ann's. I went with Blabey. I was in the back room when the cask was found up stairs. We took Walker into custody - he did not claim it - he was liberated before the Justice. I found a bunch of keys, a stock, and centre bit, in a cupboard in the front room, where the prisoner's wife was in bed - a crow-bar was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You found the staves in a room where a man was in bed - A. Yes, I saw no cask found there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you search the room alone - A. Blabey searched as well. He might have found it, but I did not see him; I was in the front room most of the time. I only saw one cask.</p>

I was quite sober - I had not been drinking. I saw nobody but her in the house. I shewed her the money, and told her that if I lost it I should blame her for it. I found my watch in pawn. I saw Carty again in two hours, and knew her.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On Friday morning Leden described this girl to me. Carty was in the house at the time; I took her, and found sixpence halfpenny on her, a person said in her presence, that he had found the watch in pawn. I asked what she had done with the money, she made no answer. I took her to the pawnbroker's, he said she was not the person who pawned it. she said if the prosecutor would forgive her she would get him his watch back, and return part of his money, but that she had only taken two sovereigns and four half-crowns.</p>

               <p>"No, I thank you, I will do it for you and welcome." She told me to go up a little court in Church-lane, to ask for two or three shirts for Williams, and said she did not like to go herself, as she had a shirt to mark, and had not done it, and that she must hold my basket the while. I went, and when I had got to the steps I thought I had done wrong, and went back to see for her, and she was gone. I went into the Commercial-road, and saw her walking away with the bundle. I pointed her out, and a gentleman followed her, calling Stop thief! She threw the basket down, and ran up a carpenter's yard, where she was taken.</p>
