Yes; in consequence of information I received from Ladbury, I searched the prisoner, I found four pound and a half of indigo in a skirt pocket in his waistcoat, that went down into his breeches; part of the indigo was in his breeches and in the body of his waistcoat besides; he begged for forgiveness, I said it was not in my power; I produce the indigo; it is the same sort of indigo that was in the warehouse; there is about four pound and a half. It is worth five shillings and sixpence or six shillings a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you robbed last month. - A. Yes, on the 13th of January, just about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going. - A. I was going home from town.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking. - A. I drank part of three pints of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intoxicated with liquor. - A. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. Very moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell your story how you was accosted. - A. About half way from Pentonville and my house, I had turned out of the foot path into a grass field, it being the cleaner way to walk; I saw a man step over the rail just before me, and he says rather politely, have you got any money.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by rather politely. - A. He spoke so pleasant; I was surprised at the question, and I said, money! He said give me your money; I said give you my money; he said, yes, give me your money; I put both my hands in my breeches pockets and pulled out a penny from one pocket and sixpence from the other; I rather fumbled with the other, I took them out and held them to him, and he took them; we looked one another full in the face some little time, and he said how much is it; I was terrified at the question, and I saw his eyes recline downwards to the money that he held in his hand; when I perceived his eyes rather bent downwards I struck him on the side of his head, he had like to have fell, but did not; he staggered very much, he was very near falling; I then rushed on him and we grappled a great while, and at last he came down under me; I perceived his face as he lay under me unguarded; I struck him a very large blow on the nose. I struck him once or twice more but it had no effect, and I believe when his face was most unguarded he was pulling a bayonet from before him, I saw the bayonet and he was making towards me; I catched it in my hand; he had got the bayonet in his right hand and I catched it with my left; when I saw the bayonet I cried out very loudly murder, many times; and I held him down; he struggled very hard; I held him down a great while; he then got with his back upwards, each of us holding the bayonet; I was on his back, and when he offered to rise with his hands off the ground I tipped him down again; he immediately gets on his belly, and rose up in spite of me, and we had a long struggle; he was on his back, and when he offered to rise I tipped him down again; we laid looking at one another, and I said, have you met with your match; he says, will you let me up, I have not hurt you; I said you could not deliver your bayonet; he says I will, if you will let me up; I answered I will not; we were pretty still a bit longer; I said deliver your bayonet, he said again, I will if you will let me up; no, I wont, I said again, why do you not deliver your bayonet; he says, will you give it me again; I says I will - upon your honuor - upon my honour - you will give it me again upon your honour; I will give it you again upon my honour; he laid his hands down and was rather flat on his back; he says I have let go, and instantly I saw his hands unclasped; I then went to get up and he laid quite still; I got up and said, you are a dead man if you come near me, I thought he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170004"/>come and rush on me; he says give me the bayonet, it will betray me; I walked backwards some yards, I thought I heard a noise behind me; I looked and my son was coming as hard as he could; I said seize him, he has robbed me; I turned my head the other way, he was gone off, running very fast. I believe my son would have catched him but he fell down and so he got away; he ran one hundred yards after him, he did not get him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your delivering your money. - A. He demanded it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew his bayonet at that time. - A. No, I saw the round of the bayonet; I thought it was a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. So then under that apprehension you delivered your money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, is that the same man. - A That is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this take up. - A. Near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. He was very agreeable at first I understood you. - A. The first question was very pleasant, the next question was very rough.</p>
               <p>Q. At first you were not alarmed. - A. I knew what he meant, I was alarmed and frightend sadly, I thought I saw a pistol about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You knocked him about pretty much. - A. I knocked him when he was down one blow.</p>
               <p>Q. That was rather cowardly. - A. I think if you were down with a man, and a drawn bayonet, you would have done the best you could.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been of opinion that he is the man. - A. I know that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at the magistrate's you said you thought he was the man. - A. You are wrong sir.</p>

            , there can be very little doubt of, after you have heard what the witnesses have said; and I think there can be little doubt of the person, of the prisoner; there can be no mistake in that. He tells you it was a clear moon light night, there was a tussel between the prisoner and him; that he got possession of the bayonet, and that his son came up to his assistance. It appears by the evidence on the next day, the prisoner appeared on the drill with his face bruised, as if he had been struck in fighting; the prosecutor has told you he gave him some strokes upon his face when he was down and he can swear to his person; this continued about a quarter of an hour, here further by the bayonei that i<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170005"/>proved to be a bayonet belonging to a private of the same company, No. 38; the firelock is produced belonging to it, and when Bell went with the prosecutor to Lane, the prisoner saw him; he was going out on seeing Lane coming in; his comrade advised him to stand his ground. There seems to me very little doubt of the prisoner's guilt. The prisoner has called several witnesses, who has said that he was a hard working man till the time of his committing the robbery; that ought not to operate upon your verdict. We can only lament that a person who bore a good character, up to the time of committing such an offence as this, by doing this he had forfeited that good character.</p>

The prosecutor; Mr. Robin's; in his box I found a small piece of silver, which is in this little box I have now in my hand; I found this box in the prisoners box; the prosecutor and the prisoner were both present, they both said it was the prisoners box.

At half past eight I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner run up Southampton-street, and the boy after him; the prisoner had a bundle under his arm; he got into Silver-street - leading into Bloomsbury-market. I ran after him; just as the prisoner got into Bloomsbury-market, I saw the prisoner throw the bundle away; he was stopped by the boy, just as he got into Bloomsbury-market; I laid hold of him, and the butcher's boy brought the bundle up and gave it to the young lad; I took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not been to the prosecutrix's house for upwards of two months; I was taken up wrong for a bit of fish; she offered me money if I would own to this; I said, I had found some duplicates; I saw her about half past two o'clock in the day; she had a piece bread and two plates, with her sons dinner; after that she came to me very much intoxicated with liquor; I saw her home.</p>
               <p>COURT. The capital part of the charge you may dismiss; that in this case the prosecutrix says she received the shirts and handkerchiefs on Tuesday; she missed some of them on Friday night and some on Saturday morning; so that they may have been stolen in the intermediate time for any thing the prosecutrix knows, when some person may have been at home, she not having seen them since the Tuesday. The prisoner confessed to the constable that she had pawned the property. It is proved they were lost; she has confessed that she pawned them herself, and has given no account how she came by them.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of the police. - A. I am, of Marlborough-street office. I took the prisoner in custody, and then I went with him to the Golden Horse livery stables in Oxford-street; the prisoner went with us to the ostler's room, and pointed out the trunk, he said it was his; the prisoner opened the trunk with this key; this is the trunk. These things were in the trunk at the time it was opened, and at the trunk at his master's we found the other articles.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The things have been in my box ever since last May, just as they were removed from the cottage. They were in the same room with my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Had you removed your place of abode from a cottage. - A. I had a place at a cottage, a few miles from town, from which I arrived last May; I kept them locked up while I was in possession of a cottage; I gave him the key of the place where the things were, for him to put them in trunks to be brought to town. At that time I suppose the linen must have been stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you order him to put the linen into his trunks. A. No; that trunk he bought a little time before he was taken up; some of the articles I have worn since I came to town; such as shirts and stockings; but the table linen I had not used.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you had not ordered them to be removed to the livery stables. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Not having room in the box to put it in, I put it in the trunk; I have had the care of it ever since last May. I was charged by Mr. Burton of stealing a pair of boots; on which he informed me I should be discharged without my wages; I never parted with any thing, I was going to take them back; Mr. Ross knows the gentleman I lived with before; he had a good character with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The gentleman gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gentleman. - A. No, I never saw him before or since, except the day I went and enquired his character; he was a gentleman in the Custom house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Foy. At the time you apprehended the prisoner, and on your asking him to shew you where the box was, he took you to the livery stables - did he go willingly with you. - A. Yes; he gave us the key of the box, and said, as his master took the things out, his master had given him them; his master said he had not. After that he said he hoped his master would forgive him, and not go any further in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. - The prisoner is charged with stealing the articles in the indictment in the dwelling house of 
               <persName id="t18080217-6-person104">
                  Henry

            . - I a person, while things are under the protection of a dwelling house, is found guilty of stealing to the value of forty shillings and upwards, the law makes it a capital felony. It is necessary to make particular enquiry, to know the value of the articles stolen, where the value of the articles are above forty shillings, and the articles are not proved to be taken at one time; in that case it is necessary to have the value of each article separate, especially when they are not taken at one time. You will have to determine, from the evidence, whether the prisoner did steal these articles or not; if you are satisfied he did - the next question will be, whether he took them in the dwelling house, and whether you can fix your mind so as to say that he took away any quantity at one time, because many articles taken at different times will not constitute a capital felony. Mr. Ross cannot fix upon any of the articles, so as to be positive that they were taken at once, neither can he ascertain that any one article is of the value of forty shillings. It is not likely any one article is worth that value; therefore in favour of the prisoner it is reasonable to suppose that he stole not any article at one time of the value of forty shillings, so as to make it a capital offence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your shop at any time. A. On the 19th of January she came in my shop about two o'clock. When she came in I was engaged with a customer in the back shop; I supposed she was in a hurry, she went out; there was no person in the shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to you. - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay. - A. I suppose not more than a minute, and then went away; I did not speak to her, she did not come into the back shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was gone, did you miss any thing. - A. About a minute and a half after she was gone, I went forward to the counter, and missed a dozen of stockings I had on the counter; they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cotton stockings were they. - A. White cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put them. - A. They were laying on the counter when she came in; upon missing them I put on my hat and went after her, I observed her to turn to the left of the door; I perfectly recollected the colour of the gown; I turned down Brick-lane, I saw her walking as fast as she could; when I came up to her I observed her looking into her apron; I did not say any thing to her at the time, but let her go on till I saw some person that I thought would be a witness; she turned down Church-street towards Spital fields church; I saw a gentlemen of the name of Austin coming along; I observed to him that she had robbed me of a dozen pair of stockings, and had them in her apron, we let her walk on till she came into Crispin street; I observed that we had better lay hold of her, I then went up to her and asked her what she had got in her apron; she said, nothing; I asked her how she could say such a falsity, and pulled down the apron; there was the stooking then in her apron; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170008"/>took her to Worship-street office and gave her in charge to Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these stockings. - A. They are invoiced at fifty shillings; the net value is forty-seven and sixpence, taking off the five per cent.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her take them. - A. No, I did not see her take them. I was certain she had taken them because no other person could; they were on the counter two minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of your dwelling house. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the occupier of the house. - A. Yes; no other person occupies the house, nor have I any partner.</p>

Mr. White said how could she assert such a falsehood, and took a dozen pair of cotton stockings from her apron; we took her to the office in Worship street.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to Worship street office. I received a dozen pair of cotton stockings of Mr. White on the 19th of January; I took charge of the prisoner at the same time; I searched the prisoner. I found a few halfpence in her pocket.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this gentleman's shop to buy a yard of ribbon; I went out again to see if my eyes deceived me; a woman came up in a black gown; she says carry this parcel for me. I am going after my child; I walked on softly, I went to the corner of the street; I then stopped, I looked into my apron; the gentlemen said that is my property; I said, it is not your property; it is property of the woman that gave it me; I have not stolen it. if I had been guilty of stealing it; I should have concealed it. I stood still, thinking the woman would come up. I did not thieve it.</p>
               <p>COURT. The fact of the woman taking the goods seems pretty well established; it is a capital offence in law to steal in a dwelling house to the value of forty shillings; you are to be fully satisfied that they are worth forty shillings; you find the prosecutor says they are of the value of forty seven shillings, that is running pretty nigh the value; you will have to say whether you find the woman guilty of the capital offence, or guilty of simple larceny.</p>

             said when he came near the prosecutor's shop, he saw the prisoner drop the silk on the ground; it came from some part of her clothes; that created a suspicion in his mind; he took it up and asked her how she came by it; she said what is that to you; upon which he very properly gave the alarm to the prosecutor, and immediately she was taken. Mr. South tells you it is his property, it was stolen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170009"/>out of his shop. In order to constitute it a capital offence it must be of the value of five shillings; according to the evidence the prime cost was much more. If you have any doubt about it, you will give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt.</p>

I found in that box two pieces of cotton velvet; Mrs. Newberry was with me, she claimed these; the prisoner was present, she said she had these about two years, she bought them for a bonnet or a spencer; they were taken to Mr. Newberry's house to match with the piece he had at his house; it is a fawn colour, it seemed to match in colour, and as near as possible it could do where it was cut off the piece.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say whether it is yours or not. - A. I compared it with what I have in my pocket, they are exactly alike in colour, I have the piece here; I laid them strait; it matched as to form or shape to that it had been cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as you suppose. - A. Yes.</p>

On the next day I found the eighteen inch glass; I could not find the fourteen and a quarter. I went to Mr. Drings on the Monday following; I found two other glasses that I knew to be ours. My partner found the fourteen inch glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find on the Monday, when you went to Mr. Dring's, any of the glasses that are now in the indictment. - A. Two of them that are in the indictment. This fifteen inch glass I know to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of these glasses purchased of the prisoner, or were they other glasses that you knew to be your property. - A. These were two others that we know to be our property. This glass I found at Mr. Drings; I know it to be mine by a private mark.</p>
               <p>Court. These are the two. - A. Yes, there are two private marks on each, having a stone in the middle, and a figure of 2.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Are the glasses now produced, the glass that was bought of the prisoner Botfield. - A. The first two that I produced is not; the other one is the glass that was bought of Botfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that these glasses were your property. - A. I am sure as to one: I leave my partner to speak to the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170010"/>Q. to Mr. Oakey. Is that the plate that you bargained with the prisoner. - A. This is the plate he brought me to cut, this is the glass that I cut away; it was an eighteen; I was present when it was found at Mr. Dring's; the prisoner owned to the magistrate that he took this one and that was all.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a mirror maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these plates and tell me whether you have seen them before. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive them. - A. From the prisoner Botfield, about the 12th or 13th of January; he brought me a twelve inch; he asked me if I would silver it for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that either of these. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Confine yourself to these. - A. I do not know that I could go on with my story without mentioning that; I silvered it for him; he took that away on the 14th; Botfield's wife brought me an eighteen inch, and two of them there; I think that was about the 15th of January. I was to silver them. On Thursday afterwards I met Botfield in Fleet-street, he wanted to know if he could not have the eighteen inch on Friday; I told him he had better let it be till Saturday, the silver would be dry and more fit to take away. I went to Mr. Oakey and told him, knowing he worked there. In consequence of that, they came, they found those two glasses in my possession; they owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean all the three. - A. No, the two fifteens in my possession; Botfield came on the Saturday and fetched the eighteen inch glass that was silvered; he was apprehended on the 19th, he then seemed terrified, it was in Mr. Oakey's house; he said he had done nothing that he was afraid of; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. How long have you known Botfield. - A. Two years; I never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. This is laid as a capital offence, stealing in the dwelling house to the value of four pounds and upwards. The first thing for you to consider, is, whether these glasses were all taken away alone and at the same time, for if they were all taken away at one time, certainly it would be a capital crime; but supposing they were taken away at different times, then it does not appear that either of them are worth forty shillings; if you think they were taken at different times, the capital part of the indictment is done away; the next question will be whether you conceive that this man took them with a view to convert them to his own use. In a case that is doubtful, character ought to have great weight; on the other hand where the case is so clear that you cannot have a doubt then character cannot have any weight.</p>

            . Q. Do you recollect at any time seeing the prisoner at the bar at Mr. Ash's shop. - A. Yes, on Friday the 5th of this month, between one and two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner standing by Mr. Ash's window; I saw him cut down a pair of gaiters that was hanging outside of the window, he cut them off with a knife, put them inside of his jacket and walked off; I informed Mr. Ash, he went to him, took the gaiters away from him, and sent him about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man - A. I am clear of it.</p>

I counted it over again, I said it was right; then she wished me to make a bill, I said what a bill for half a pound of tobacco and a quarter of a pound of snuff; my little boy made a bill, she said it is right enough, she took the tobacco and snuff under her arm and was going out of the shop; I observed to her when I came out of the parlour with the silver, and said madam you know you have not given me the note, when she was going out with the tobacco and snuff; she said she had; I told her she must be mistaken, she said she was not; I said feel in your pocket, she did not; I asked her what she saw me do with it when I had taken it, she said that I had taken it into the parlour when I went for the change; says I that cannot be, because when I come out of the parlour, I told her she had not given me the note; she said, I have given you the note; I went and looked and she followed me; I took out the bowl where I put my change; I said look, you see your note is not here, you see there is only two notes and they lay considerably under the silver; she would insist on my taking the notes out of the silver; I did it to gratify her; she said there were spots of ink on the note she gave me; when she saw the notes, I observed to her where is the spots of ink, here is no spots of ink upon these; she said no; we walked into the shop, she then said she should know her note if she was to see it, her note was torn at the corner; I went and looked again and there was one of the two torn at the corner; I said you took more notice than I did. I did not observe it was torn, she said she was sure that was her note, she had taken it of Mr. Townsend; she asked me to let my little boy go along with her to Mr. Townsend with the note; to gratify her I let him go; after my little boy was gone out with her, I then thought she was not an honest woman; my husband come up, I desired him to run after her; I was confident she would not come back with the tobacco and snuff and the change; the change was sixteen shillings and sevenpence halfpenny.</p>

Yes, as I thought; we went along till we came to Mr. Jones's facing of Houndsditch, she went in there, she asked Mr. Jones if he had not given her a note on the Saturday, he said there were so many notes he could not tell; then she came out, I asked her if she was not going to Mr. Townshend; she said her name was Townshend; I asked her for the change, she said she had not got the change; then we went down Houndsditch; as we were going along I kept asking her for the change, she said she had not got it, and if she was not in the state she was, she would thump my head against the wall; I asked her again for the change, she said she had not got the change; then I went home.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. You are to consider the conduct and demeanour of the prisoner. In the course of this transaction, when she got this change, she quarrelled with it a long time, not having given the note. When she is asked for the note, then she said that she had given the note, when in fact and truth she knew she had not. How does her innocence and demeanour consist with her conduct; when she is asked for the change, she said Mrs. Benningfield had not given her the change, when in truth she had.</p>

In the evening from information I sent for an officer and had him searched; the officer found some metal in an inside pocket of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it type metal. - A. Yes; the same that we received from Mr. Nicholls; his apron was tied over his coat, and before the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was produced had it the appearance of metal that was taken from the fire. - A. Yes, burned paper was attached to it.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, some time back you had the misfortune to have your premisses burned by a fire. - A. On Monday the 8th instant; all that was dug out of the ruins was intended to be sent to Mr. Figgins.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the metal that was taken from this man. - A. Yes. I have not the least doubt that it came from our premises, by its appearance.</p>

               <p>Q. He only comes in the house for the purpose of business. - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Q Did you at any time lose a truss containing three hundred dozen of printed cotton handkerchiefs. - A. Yes, on Friday the 5th of February, between six and seven in the evening, from the house in Walbrook; they were enclosed in a canvas wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know from what circumstance they were lost. - A. Yes; this truss was delivered at my house, after the warehouse was closed; our warehouse is at this time of the year closed at dusk; this truss was deivered about six o'clock; it was delivered into my dwelling house, but not in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in your dwelling house before it was taken away. - A. I did not. About twenty minutes or half after six o'clock, my servant was called to the house door in consequence of a knock; the prisoner at the bar said, I hear that your master wants a porter; in consequence of this my servant came up into the dining room to me and said a man wanted me; he said he heard I wanted a porter; I said it is a mistake, I do not want any porter. When she had got half way down stairs she screamed out, observing the man absent and the truss missing; that moment I run out of the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch sight of the prisoner. - A. No; the moment I got out of the street door, I called out stop thief; I ran to the corner of Cannon-street, but did not see any thing particular; finding things quiet, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170013"/>returned and found a terrible scuffle at that end of Walbrook that comes into Bucklersbury, and as I came gently up I found a man a running very fast indeed, coming towards me, with several others following of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that man any bundle with him. - A. No. In Walbrook, opposite the end of a court, I secured the prisoner at the bar; he said what do you want with me; I replied you have stolen a truss of mine; and I requested some one or two who were near me to assist me to take him up to my own door; they assisted me in taking him up.</p>
               <p>Q. By that means you secured him in your house. - A. Yes. When I got within three yards of my own door, I met my servant whom he asked the question of; she said I will swear that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in his hearing. - A. Yes. The prisoner made no reply; when I got him into the passage of my house, he acknowledged that he was the person that came to enquire about a porter's place. The moment he was in the passage I desired they would be kind enough to secure the prisoner; I went and found a man coming with the truss at the corner of Buckler'sbury, he said he found the truss on a post; I said where are you going with that truss; he replied, sir, I am going to bring it to you. He delivered it to me. I requested they would keep the prisoner in custody till I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the truss before. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any truss delivered. - A. On the 5th of February, a little after seven, there came a rap at the door, and the truss was delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man here that delivered the truss. - A. No; the truss was delivered to me; it was left in the passage, and the man went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you see any other person. A. About a quarter of an hour afterwards there came another knock at the door; the prisoner came in and asked for Mr. Hartwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he is the man. - A. I am quite sure, my lord, he is the man; he asked for Mr. Hartwell by name, he said he was informed he wanted a porter; I told him I did not know, but if he would come in I would enquire of my master, he was in the sitting room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master's sitting room. - A. Above stairs. I went up to my master, and delivered the message that the man sent me with.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you left the prisoner with the street door in his hand, whereabouts was this truss. - A. It was very near the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large truss. - A. Yes, I delivered the prisoner's message to my master, and returned down stairs almost immediately, I was not a minute with my master; my master said, he did not want one, he must be misinformed; as I went down I saw the prisoner was gone and the truss, I saw that before I got down stairs by the light of the candle, and the door was left open; I called out for my master before I got to the bottom; I ran into the street calling out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get sight of the prisoner. - A. I did not at that moment, a man in the street told me he had gone down the street; another man told me he had told me wrong, he had gone up the street; I returned again towards the Mansion house; I met the prisoner by the church going down the street; he had got rid of the truss and was running down the street; I called out that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of him. - A. No, I catched at him but I could not hold him, I followed him; I did not lose sight of him till my master stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the truss of goods again. - A. I did, they came into the house again, a strange man brought it in from the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man give you any account how he came by it. - A. No; I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be the same truss as was there when you went up stairs. - A. I did: my master's name was on it in large letters.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that is all you know of it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he is the man. - A. I am confident that he is the man that came and asked for the porter's place.</p>

Afterwards he dipped his hand in three times; he kept shuffling it under his apron, under his great coat; that is what I saw him do. I was not positive whether he put it in his small clothes pocket or no; that was after ten o'clock. I told the commodore what I had seen.</p>

I took him to the office in Worship street. I took him into a room where Ann Hall was sitting, that had been to pledge some shirts with Mr. Hall; I asked Ann Hall if that was the man that brought the shirts to her, she cried and said he was; he made no reply. I took him into the front parlour of the public office; the shirts were shewed him; they were taken out one by one.

On the 19th of January the two prisoners came into the shop, between the hours of six and seven in the evening; they asked me to shew them some ribbons; I took a drawer from the counter and shewed them, they did not like them. I took a second drawer and Williams choosed one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they standing together. - A. They were standing close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut her off any ribbon. - A. I did not; she pitched upon the ribbon and desired I would measure it, I did; it was six yards and a half; Bailey said there were seven and a half, I told her I would measure it over again to convince her I was right; while I was measuring it over again, I observed a hand in the box, I told her I was right, it was but six and a half; I cannot say whose hand I saw in the drawer, but I am certain it was one of the two; there was no person near enough to put a hand in but one of them two. They told me they wanted more, it was for three sister's bonnets; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170016"/>must be ten yards, and they wanted it all of one piece; I offered to get it for them by ten o'clock in the morning, that would not do. they wished to go; I told them to stay, I thought I had lost some ribbons, I wished to look them over to see what was missing; they were agreeable to stay, and did stay.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find there were any ribbons gone from your stock. - A. I could not say positively what ribbons I had missed; I sent for an officer, during the time the officer was gone for, I heard a ribbon drop on the floor where they were; I heard the second piece drop, I could not say it was ribbon; I saw Bailey put her hand into her gown or apron that was pinned up; I told her that she had throwed it either out of her gown or apron, she positively denied it, and said it came out of neither; then the constable came. I told him that I heard the sound of two pieces of ribbon falling on the ground; the constable has had them ever since. I am positive they are my husband's property.</p>

Yes; on the 28th of last January, between six and seven in the evening, she asked for a single candle, which I gave her, for which she tendered me one shilling; after she was gone I saw it was a bad one; I shewed it to my husband the next morning. I kept it by itself; he requested if she came again, to let him see her; she came again on the 2nd of February in the evening, about the same time, and asked for another candle, for which she gave me a shilling; I then called my husband, I told him that was the woman that gave me the shilling; he said she must be taken in custody; he sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at them shillings, and tell me whether they are counterfeits. - A. They are both very bad.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot tell whether they were made at the same time, - A. That is impossible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The shilling she said I gave her she picked it out of a parcel of money, there was not a shilling found on me.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutrix. Did you pick that shilling out of a parcel of money. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You had it wrapped up in a bit of paper in the parcel of money, you picked it out.</p>
               <p>COURT TO JURY. In order to put a stop to this practice of uttering counterfeit money the legislature thought it was necessary to punish capitally, any such practice after the first conviction. It is well known that it is owing to these people uttering this counterfeit money, that coiners are employed; if there were no utterers of bad money, there would be no coiners. The question for your consideration is, whether the prisoner uttered it with a guilty knowledge; to ascertain that, you must be satisfied with circumstantial proof: it is impossible to have positive proof. When she was convicted at the quarter sessions, the chairman told her the consequence of committing a second offence, with the greatest humanity. It is for your consideration whether you are of opinion, under all these circumstances, that she knew this shilling was a bad one.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Cook's christian name. - A. Edward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 30th of January any thing happening. - A. Yes, on the 30th of January I was sitting in the kitchen, I heard some noise on the leads.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that lead over the kitchen. - A. Yes, it was ten minutes before twelve; I heard the noise over my head; I did not get up directly; the noise was as if a person was cutting; I sat about two seconds; then I heard the noise repeated again, as if a person was ripping.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the kitchen did the noise seem to come from. - A. The first time I heard it, it came from the first window to the right; when I heard it the second time, the noise appeared more closer to me in the centre. I waited till my fellow servant came down stairs; I spoke to him; I went out of our hall door into North row; that is the side of the house. I went round the corner facing of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that where the iron rails are. - A. Yes, it is facing of the kitchen windows. When I came there, my fellow servant lifted me up on the railing; it was so dark I could not see; at first I thought I saw something, but it was so dark and rainy I could not; I stopped where I was; my fellow servant turned the corner, he saw a watchman coming across the road, he had a light with him; he stopped the watchman. In consequence of what he said I went to him, and we took the light from him; I helped my fellow servant up, and the light was held up; directly he saw the prisoner; I saw the prisoner come over the wall; he come down on the ground, he had a very great fall.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a person fall. - A. I did not see him; directly he fell he got up again, he turned round and ran away; I pursued him; he never was out of my sight, we stepped step for step; I struck him three or four times, I knocked him down and then took him; I brought him back to my master before I took him to the watchhouse. After I went to the watchhouse with the prisoner I went upon the leads; there was four feet and a half of lead gone from the first window on the right.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the window where you described that you heard the noise first. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How did the lead lay. - A. It lay by the sky light, it was fixed over the window, and that lead was gone, and the lead of the second window ripped ready to carry away; there are three windows; the whole of the area is covered with lead.</p>
               <p>Court There is no mention made in the indictment of ripping, only of stealing; confine yourself to stealing of lead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. How much lead was gone entirely. - A. About four feet and a half in length and two feet in width; the other laid at the other window; it was loose, it was not rolled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the other lead. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing the lead in the course of the day. - A. Yes, they were perfect in the course of the day; it was perfect when I saw it; I was on the leads, and the other servants were out upon it in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. As the prisoner was running away did you hear any thing fall. - A. Just as I seized the prisoner I perceived him searching his pocket, I thought he was going to use some violence to me; directly afterwards I saw him throw something away; I marked the spot where I took the prisoner; I searched the place in about half an hour afterwards; I found a knife, this is the knife (producing it). I found it just at the place where I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you observe whether the lead was cut or torn. - A. It was cut, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of some other lead, was that cut. - A. The nails were picked out, it was not cut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At Marlborough street, he said that he had not, nor any of the servants, been on the leads that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect on the 30th of January, whether you had been on the leads or not - A. I had business to do there; the door opens level with the parlour to go out upon the leads.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out upon the leads that morning. A. Yes, I was there seeing the soldiers go by; if there had been any lead taken away I must have seen it. I never said any such thing at Marlborough street.</p>

            , and going out of doors. - A. Yes, I lifted him up on the rails, I called the watchman and had his light; I saw the prisoner go up over Mr. Cook's water closet; I did not see his face, but I saw the size of the man; he got from thence to the wall into North row.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Davis overtook him. - A. Davis and I were together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person whom Davis had taken brought to your master's house. - A. He was brought to the door, there was a light in the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner that person. - A. Yes. I took hold of him, and never let him go till he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the day had you been on the leads. - A. I cannot say that I had; I had been in the parlour, but I cannot be positive that I had looked at the windows; as soon as we had been to the watch-house I went out upon the leads to examine it; I found the lead from one frame gone, that looks in North row. It was about four feet in length.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the other window. - A. The lead was loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any one person there. - A. We met a person at the corner; as we went round he went towards Oxford road.</p>
               <p>Court. You said that when you got up on the rails you saw the prisoner; do you mean to say you saw a man like the prisoner - should you have known him again if he had not been taken. - A. Yes, I should; I took particular notice of his hat and size; I should have known him again.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the bundle contain. - A. New stockings, new handkerchiefs, caps, and other articles, all new; when I took the duplicate out of her pocket, I asked her how she got these new articles, when she was obliged to go to the pawnbrokers in the morning; she hesitated on the road going to the office, she said there was another girl concerned with her; she took only three of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her what you took her for. - A. Yes, for taking the notes out of Collins's box; she said she had slept at the Portland Arms, in Portland-street, she had bought a new bonnet, and there it was left; I went there, I found she had been there in company with a coachman; she had left the bonnet there, and a pair of gloves; she said she was agreeable to give all the things up to Collins, and he would write to her friend to make him satisfaction;

            . I am a serjeant of the fourteenth light dragoons. On the night of the 10th instant, between the hours of eleven and twelve, I met the prisoners in Covent-garden; I knew them about three years ago in the Borough; I went into Mrs. Belshaw's wine vaults with them; Atterbury asked me to go in to have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there. - A. About three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any thing to drink there. - A. No; there was a girl at Mrs. Belshaw's blackguarded me for taking up a deserter; I went away from there and went to <placeName id="t18080217-32-crimeloc178">Mr. Norris's wine vault in Great Russel-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had the seals to the watch hanging out when you went into the house. - A. On entering the door I took the watch out and wound the ribbon shorter, they hung very low, that makes me sure I had the seals; after we had a glass of gin Brown came near me, I was standing up, he put his hand down my thigh, I felt it come near me; upon suspicion I stepped back; I said, I had missed my seals, you are playing tricks with me; I said to Brown you have got my seals; he said, how can you think so, I have not; I said, I am certain you have; I got my back against the door, and called for assistance; I kept in that situation till the watchman came and took them in custody; I wished to have them searched; the watchman would not do it. Atterbury says I will strip, I have not got them. They were taken to Covent Garden watchhouse by the watchmen; I stopped a bit behind to see if they had throwed them about; I followed them; the watchhouse keeper used me very ill; at length he made a search but not in a proper manner; nothing was found upon either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Atterbury at the time you felt the other man's hand. - A. About two yards distance from me and him both.</p>
               <p>Q. Your watch was not taken. - A. No, the watch remained.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear that the seals were gone. - A. The ribbon was cut across; I did not see any knife or scissors.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had much liquor. - A. I had been drinking, but not so much but what I knew what I was doing of.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you been drinking. - A. A glass of wine, two glasses of negus, a glass of gin, and a pot of beer in the day with the recruits; it had not taken any effect of me.</p>
               <p>Q. At the watchhouse the next morning did either of the prisoners say any thing to you. - A. Yes, Atterbury told me if I would not say any thing about him he would get me all my expences, the watchhouse keeper's wife says, if you have got any friends send to them; he gave Sheane, the watchman, two shillings to go to Gray's Inn-lane, to get some money of a woman that he lodged with to pay me; the watchman came back, and said to him, I see how it is, there is no person there that will give you any thing; he said, there was only a poor woman there where Atterbury lodged, she had no money for herself. The constable said it was getting late, they should go to Bow-street; Atterbury said if you will take a five pound note of hand, he would send for a friend, he would pay me; he said, I should ruin him for ever if they were both put in goal; if he was let out he could work for them both; he sent Sheane the watchman to a man to be answerable for the five pound to me; the watchman staid so long they were taken to Bow-street office; Atterbury came to me and says, d - n it, I'll give you seven pound if you will let me free. I should have taken the money if it had not been for the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take it. - A. No. Brown never made any offer at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the public house besides. - A. A young woman; she was at the front of the bar, not near me; no other person was in the house besides the person serving.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. You have said it was between eleven and twelve o'clock when you lost your seals. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a <rs id="t18080217-32-viclabel179" type="occupation">recruiting serjeant</rs>

                        targets="t18080217-32-victim310 t18080217-32-viclabel179"/>. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Common observations of life makes me know you are under the necessity of drinking more than any other man. - A. I might have been drinking more, but not so as to be incapable of knowing what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you was perfectly sober. - A. I was not perfectly sober, I knew what I was doing; I cannot say I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot say you was either drunk or sober; you were neither drunk nor sober. - A. I might be between both.</p>
               <p>Q. You met with these men just by Belshaw's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this woman. - A. I am not acquainted with her.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose she is an unfortunate woman. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she toy with you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a strange thing that a girl should take a liking to you all at once and she was to treat you. - A. I cannot account for that.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were taken to the watchhouse they were searched. - A. There was not a proper search made.</p>
               <p>Q. That is for the watchmen to explain, do you mean to say that there was no other woman in company with you but the woman that gave you the glass of gin. - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women was there in the gin shop. - I do not think there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be between the time you lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170022"/>the seals and the time the prisoner was searched. - A. Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him to the watchhouse. - A. Two watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were under the observation of the two watchmen all the time they went from the house. - A. Yes, but they crossed the street to go to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time to this you have not seen any thing about the seals. - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Brown. I should wish to know whether he did not strike a woman three or four times at Mrs. Belshaw's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had you any quarrel in the public house. - A. I cannot say I had any quarrel: the woman abused me at Mr. Belshaw's, and the landlord said he would have no row here; I went out.</p>
               <p>Brown. He was under nine or ten people in the house; the serjeant would have been beat well had it not been for me.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Covent Garden. I saw both the prisoners go into Covent Garden watchhouse; I was at the watchhouse door at the time they both went in; it was another watchman that apprehended them. In about five minutes after they had been in, a rattle sprung for another watchman to come in; I knocked at the door and Brown wanted to make his escape; I pushed him back. Atterbury sent me the next morning to his lodgings to get some money of his landlady he lodged with; after I came back he sent me to Holborn. He promised to give the serjeant a note of hand for five pounds; I went, and the gentleman was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Did you hear the serjeant say he would forgive them if he had a five pound note. - A. I heard him say give me a five pound note and I will not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Atterbury's Defence. I never sent for five pound, I was destitute, I could not; I said I would treat him, as he had treated me; we went to Mr. Belshaw's; immediately we came in the wine vaults he was knocked down, and he had twenty people on him; he did not say that he had lost his seals till he came into Mr. Norris's wine vaults; he said give me my property; I said I cannot, I had not got the seals; he says; I know you are not the man, if you will give me five pound I will not prosecute you. Immediately he accused us the young woman walked off. I had two glasses of gin there; whether they had one or two I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Brown left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called two witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

In Downes's pocket I found a knife; we took them to the office that night, and they were examined; the next morning I heard that Mr. Alexander's shop had been robbed; I went to his shop and examined the window that was cut; the hole that was made in the putty in the window frame fitted the knife; there was putty on the knife at the time. I fitted it; I told Mr. Alexander; he sent me to a girl that saw them do it.</p>

               <p>COURT. These men were found cutting a window at another shop, half a mile distant; they say it fitted the hole in the putty at Mr. Alexander's shop window; a great many knives would fit the hole.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before. - A. Never in my life; I asked him, as he was coming on, which way he was going, he said he was coming to town; I told him I was coming there too; we discoursed upon the road together in talking of America. I understood by his tongue he was an American; I told him that I had been to America, and I was sixteen months a prisoner there. We went as far as the Black Horse, I offered him a pint of beer; I then asked him where he lodged; he told me he had no lodging nor any thing to get a lodging with; I said, if you come along with me I shall give you something to eat and drink, and very likely a lodging; he went with me to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him something to eat and drink. A. I did; I gave him some mutton chops and bread, and sent for a pint of beer for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him a lodging. - A. I told him there was a bed if he chose to accept it; if he did not, there was a shilling for him to get a lodging for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you had never seen him before. - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170023"/>No.</p>
               <p>Q. You took a great partiality to him, never having seen him before - was this your own bed. - A. Yes; he went to bed in my own bed before I did; I locked and bolted the window and door afterwards; I laid down, I hung my watch up at the bed's head, I fell asleep; when I awoke in the morning I missed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not surprised at that. - A. I was surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very probable thing to have happened - did you miss nothing but the prisoner. - A. I then laid awhile; I listened to hear if my watch beat, it did not; I put my hand up to find if my watch was there; it was gone. I then got up and went into the yard, thinking he might have gone to the privy. I found he was not there; I searched my pockets, I missed a guinea, two two-pound notes, nine seven shilling pieces, nineteen shillings in silver, and two gold watch keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your property again. - A. My watch was found in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been long in this town. - A.Yes, I have been watchman to the London dock three years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to bring him to his oath where he me me: me first.</p>
               <p>Court. He says between Mile End and Bow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is wrong in that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot say exactly the place, but it was between Mile End and Bow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know what time you met with me. - A. Between five and six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take me to. - A. To the Black Horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take me after that. - A. Up to my own house in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give me to eat after that.</p>
               <p>Court. He said mutton chops.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What had I to drink before I went to his own house. - A. A pint of beer, and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you change a guinea, and I offered to pay half the reckoning for a quartern of rum. - A. You did not offer that, nor did I change a guinea; we had no rum.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor yourself. - A. No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner in liquor. - A. No, I did not take him to be in liquor.</p>

When he came out of doors he fell down in the street; we had not then above five or six yards to go.

               <p>Q. Did they drink with you. - A. No, nor I with them; I went out of the door about half past four in the morning to make water; Beasley and Price came out immediately after me, Beasley came up to me and asked me if I would go home with her; I refused it; I had my watch in my fob when I unbuttoned my smallclothes, I am positive I had it then; when I buttoned them up I missed it; I laid hold of Beasley immediately and told her she had got my watch; the prisoner Price was at her back; she went away; I took Beasley into the public house; I told the landlord of the house she had got my watch; the prisoner Beasley undressed herself, I did not see any thing of my watch; I did not search her at all, I took her to St. Martin's watch-house and gave her up to the constable of the night; the constable of the night, I believe, got directions from Beasley where to find Price; we went to No. 6, New Exchange-court, in the Strand; we met the Price and Branch coming arm in arm together; the constable took Branch and the watchman took Price; they conveyed them to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were the prisoners to you when you went out of the public house. - A. Beasley came up close to me and Price was in the rear of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them touch you. - A. Yes, the prisoner Beasley laid her hand upon my breast; I did not feel her hand go to my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near you when you discovered you had lost your watch. - A. She was close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your fob turned down so that your watch might fall out. - A. No, the fob was fastened at the bottom so that it could not fall out.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was not fastened, might not that fall out when you unbuttoned. - A No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you did not feel it go. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you had much liquor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.What made you out at that time. - A. I attended the Opera House as a soldier; I went to this house to get refreshment before I went to my quarters.</p>

            . I am a constable; I went with the last witness to New Exchange-court; I took Branch into custody; going along to the watch-house. I said to Branch, I believe you are the person that has got the watch, I think you had better give it me; he said he could tell me all about it; Beasley had informed me before that Price and Branch lived together, that made me suspect that he had got it; he gave me the watch, he told me Price gave it him to keep till the morning.</p>
               <p>Beasley's Defence. I know nothing of the man. I work in Tavistock-street and round the neighourhood; going out in the morning I met with this woman; she said, she was going out to work at the upholstery work at Mr. Trotter's; I said, I am going to the same place; it was rather cold, she and I went into this house to get a pint of beer; Price went out while I was warming the beer, I thought she was gone long; I went to the door, I met this man right at the door; he told me his watch was gone; he seemed very much in liquor; he took me into the tap room, and made me undress myself all to my linen before every one.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence. This woman and I were sitting together at the public house drinking a pint of beer; the soldier beckoned me out; I went out after him, not knowing what he wanted; I walked a little way with him, he asked me to have something to drink; when I got to the corner he wanted to be indecent with me; I stood a while with him; I perceived him pulling his small clothes down; he asked me to hold his watch while he eased himself, he asked my pardon, he told me not to go away. When he stooped I walked away, as I thought it not very decent; I met a young woman at the Sun, she was going into that house; there I met this man. I asked her to hold this watch while I took out the money to get something to drink. On going to my lodgings to clean myself, we met the constable. I meaned to take the watch back again to the public house. This woman is innocent.</p>
               <p>Branch's Defence. I am a <rs id="t18080217-35-deflabel196" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

Coming off duty after six o'clock I met with a man; we went into a public house; I was warming myself by the fire. Price came in, she asked me if I would have something to drink; I said, I did not care if I did. We went to the Man in the Moon the corner of Vine-street; she gave me a handkerchief, with the watch in it, to hold while she got the halfpence out to pay for the gin; I did not know then what was in the handkerchief. Coming out I looked in the handkerchief; I said to her in the name of God which way came you by this; she said, a man in Hemmings's-row gave her the watch to hold while he did something. I do not know what he was about, I was not nigh there by three quarters of a mile. I said if you mean any good to yourself go and give the property up to the owner, and I insist upon it you shall before I part with it. I thought it my duty to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on duty that night as watchman. - A. I was; she begged of me to go home with her to her apartments to get her a clean apron. When I came to the door the constable took me and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170025"/>watchman took the woman.</p>
               <p>Branch called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before had you seen this lead on the gutter. - A. Not for a great while; I should not have found it out I dare say if the officer had not come down. I am pretty positive that is the lead that was taken from the gutter; it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is very easy to put down a piece of lead like that to fit any gutter; there were bricklayers at work there at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. The question for you to consider, is, whether the prisoner did or did not steal this lead. You must be satisfied whether the evidence of Valentine, Ray, and Hergest, who applied the lead to the gutter and were satisfied in their minds, that that lead belonged to that gutter - you must try how far they are correct. - Your next enquiry will be about the guilt of the prisoner; you find the prisoner was a man working there; on Monday evening he left off work there, on the same day he was stopped by the patrol carrying a basket; in that basket is found the lead which was carried down and applied to the gutter; he was asked by the patrol what it was, he told him it was lead; that so far goes in favour of the prisoner, and then he told him he found it in a field hard by; if you believe that account, if you are satisfied that he found it, to be sure he is not the person that stole it; if you are not satisfied then as they say this lead was found upon him about eight o'clock; his behaviour at the time he is stopped, has nothing improper in it; he told them he worked at Bow; these are the circumstances of the case. If from the evidence you are satisfied that the man took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170026"/>lead from the stable, he is guilty of the charge; if you do not think so you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Hickley. - A. I believe he is something in the 15th light dragoons. I met him; he asked me whether I could inform him where Castle-street was. On going up Fetter-lane the right hand side of the way a person followed very close.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it. - A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, this gentleman was going with his coat buttoned; I looked to see if he had his watch, some person following very close; it appeared that he had a watch chain and one seal to it, it was a kind of a barrel chain; I observed that we got half way up Norwich-court when the prisoner and another person past us; the prosecutor was asking me if I knew Mr. Keith who keeps the Castle; I said, I knew the house perfectly well; we went up to the house, the gentleman was a little elevated in liquor, no great deal as I could perceive; I took him round to the front door instead of the back door, there being a step more, and as he was going in the steps of the front door, there were two people on the steps before us; a scuffle took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said. - A. I did not hear that any thing was said, there was collaring one another, that was the chief of the scuffle, there might be some blows; we found ourselves at the corner of Castle yard, which is the place where the house is situated. I saw a person's hand upon Mr. Hickley's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170028"/>watch chain when the scuffle took place; I cannot pretend to say whether it was the prisoner's, or whose hand it was; to the best of my knowledge, another person came up, which made three; in the scuffle two of them got away, while the prisoner and Mr. Hickley were scuffling together; then I ran after the other two; they run down Norwich court. I met the prisoner about half way down the court; he was following the others.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the prisoner scuffling with Mr. Hickley. - A. I did; I ran after the other two, and before I got half way down the court I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not meeting, he came past you. - A. Yes, he came past me; he asked me what was the matter, I believe the words I made use of were - the gentleman was robbed of his watch. I did not see his face at the time; he said let us go after him; he ran away, I was not able to run so fast as him; I lost sight of him; he is the same man, I saw him by the light in the Castle window; I am sure he is the same man; there was a light in the window that projected out about two feet; he was brought back by Mr. Norden.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time I was at my examination Sheppard said he was not sure I was the person or not.</p>
               <p>Sheppard. I said no such thing; I could not say so, because I was certain of his person. The prisoner asked me whether I met him or not; I said I did, and I believe he mentioned it before that at the magistrate's.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person that made the snatch. - A Yes. There were three of them; they all ran away and the people after them. The prosecutor went a little way up Norwich court, there came one back and knocked him down, he struck him three times and cut his mouth open; then he picked up his hat and ran away. I took the prosecutor to our house, because his mouth was bleeding. Master sent me to Hatton Garden to get two officers; then the prisoner was brought back to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that you saw the prisoner make a snatch at the watch. - A. Yes; he had a pen stuck in his hat and a white apron on; at the time when he was brought back to our house he had a pen and apron just the same.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker, I live in Charles street, Hatton Garden. On the evening of the 27th of January, coming out of my own street into King's Head yard, hearing the cry of stop thief I made haste; this prisoner was about thirty yards before the rest; I stepped over the way; I did not see any body before him, that was the reason I took account of him; he calling out stop thief, I thought he was the thief. When he came near he halloaed out stop thief the loudest; I knocked him down; he said he was not the thief; I said, stop a little, we can soon know whether you are the thief or no. A mob came up, and Mr. Sheppard he said that is the man that robbed the man in Castle street. I believe he had a white apron tied round him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in his hat. - A. There were two handkerchiefs in his hat; I observed a pen in his hat, I asked him what he wore that pen for, he said he was a broker. Mr. Trott came, I gave him up. The boy said that is the man when he brought Trott in, and Mr. Hickley's mouth was bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you observe the apron round him. - A. I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Trott. The apron was tucked up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner struck me first when he was taking the chain and seal; afterwards the person knocked me down, by which it occasioned such bleeding in my mouth; he cut my lips.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from St. Bartholomew's hospital from my wife; I received these two silk handkerchiefs from her; I was going down Fetter lane to buy something for supper; I stopped at the pork shop, Mr. Sheppard came up to me, he said there was a man who had been knocked down and robbed; I asked him which way they went, he said they went that way, up towards Holborn; I ran directly, there was a cry of stop thief, I halloaed stop thief too; one of the witnesses knocked me down and brought me into the tap room as a prisoner. I was placed before the prosecutor who had lost the chain and seal; there were two gentlemen who were present asked him if he knew the person that robbed him, he made answer and said no; he was very much in liquor at the time; I told him I would give him every satisfaction, I told him to send for an officer; an officer was sent for; Trott came, he searched me, and found nothing about me but my own property; I was taken into the parlour, Trott went into the tap room and got the watch belonging to the prosecutor; the prosecutor then said he would not come forward. Mr. Trott swore he would be d - d if he did not come forward the watch should be his.</p>
               <p>COURT. If it is true that the prisoner was the man who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170029"/>struck the prosecutor, and took away his chain and seal; the robbery is compleat, because taking it away in the open street, by force and violence, that is a highway robbery, because the man assaults the prosecutor first of all, by striking him, and then by violence taking the watch chain from his person; if you believe the prisoner is the man, in point of law it does not amount to a highway robbery; whether he is or not, it does not depend only upon the evidence of the prosecutor, because the boy, who was no ways concerned, he observed the prisoner; he says he is the man, he observed the apron round him, and the pen in his hat, at the time and when he was brought back he observed that; in confirmation of that Sheppard says he is the man; Nordon said he heard the cry of stop thief, no person running near him but the prisoner, he was calling out stop thief, upon which he stopped him; taking all these circumstances into your consideration, you are to say whether he is or is not the person that committed this robbery; he has called no person; therefore the evidence rests on the part of the prosecution.</p>

            . I am a porter to the prosecutor; the prisoner came in first and asked for a hogshead; I told him there was one outside of the house; then he went away; in about five minutes afterwards he came again, I was up stairs and at the time, I heard somebody come in the warehouse, I went down stairs to see who it was, I saw the prisoner standing at the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in the hogshead. - A. Yes, it was full of sugar. He held up his apron with one hand, and with the other he took the sugar and put it into his apron; I called to him and asked him what he was doing there, he made no answer, and went out of the warehouse; I followed him and collared him, he would not stop; I put my hand in his apron, I found a large lump of sugar; I asked him to bring the sugar back again to where he took it from, he said, no, I wont; I asked him three or four times, he would not; I went to see for one of my masters, then he got away; I went round the other way to meet him. When I came to the Red Lion coal wharf, I saw him go in the coal wharf with the sugar, then I stepped back a little and saw what he was doing, he untied his apron and hid the sugar in his apron in a dark corner of the coal wharf; I stopped till he came back, then I laid hold of him; I asked him where he put the sugar that he took out of the hogshead; he said he had no sugar; I said, came back with me, I will show you where you put it; I took him with me, and showed him the sugar, and then I brought him up to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLUNT. I am a constable; I produce the sugar; it is moist sugar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lambert. That sugar is the same as we have in our warehouse; I compared it with the hogshead, it corresponded; there was the hole in the hogshead where it was taken from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not get the sugar there, I got it from the hogsheads that I took from the sugar houses; the master where I live allows us the sugar for our perquisite.</p>

No, I was there on the next day at noon, I was in her house, I saw the prisoner there; I saw him first at the parlour door, he was standing looking on, but doing nothing; the fire was partly extinguished; the goods were chiefly removed. I afterwards heard a noise, I went up the garret stairs, there I saw the prisoner and another man loaded with things; I ordered them to take them to the room where they took them from, they did; when I came there there was my brother and another person assisting of him. I asked him where the prisoner was taking the things to, the other person said he had ordered the prisoner to take the things to the smith's shop; the prisoner was by and heard him say that; the prisoner then went away with the beadstead; I saw the prisoner afterwards, and hearing it was not delivered, I asked him what he had done with it; in the course of ten minutes I saw him near the ruins, his answer was, that he had taken it to a brokers just by; on asking him what broker's, he said he had not taken it away, two other soldiers had done it; when I found him denying that he had taken it, I insisted upon him being taken to Queen-square. The constable took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in his soldier's dress. - A. When he was in the apartment he had a soldier's great coat on; when he returned he had taken it off, and he had a leather apron on.</p>

            . On Saturday the 30th of January, the prisoner was brought to our office; when he was ordered to go to Tothill-fields bridewell, he asked me to go with him to get his great coat, I indulged him; I went with him into a room in Pye-street, there I saw a bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose room it was. - A. I saw his wite there; the bedstead was pulled to pieces, not tied up at all; his wife bursted out crying as soon as she saw me. I brought the bedstead away.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the bottom part of the house. Mr. Jozel and me and two soldiers went up stairs, he told us the house was condemned; in the first floor were some pots, he said we might take them and what there was; I took away the bedstead, my comrade took a bag of hair; he returned it when I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jozel. Do you recollect saying to the man there, that the house was condemned, he might take that away. - A. There were two or three garden pots Mr. Chamberlain said they might take away; when I asked him where the bedstead was, he denied it.</p>

             coming up to you. - A. Yes, near seven o'clock in the evening. In consequence of what she said I went out with two young men who were in my tap room; I went through the passage of the next door into the Green Man yard. At the time I was standing in the yard with the two young men, we consulted which would be the best way to secure the men we supposed to be in the house stealing of the lead. While I was consulting with them, two men rushed out of the door of the Green Man; we instantly pursued them, they ran towards Whitechapel, and jumped over some high paling into a field; I pursued them, and took the prisoner in the middle of a field; the other got off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him all the while you were pursuing him. - A. Yes, only momentarily; we passed no other person. I am sure the prisoner is one of them that came out of the house. I took hold of the prisoner and brought him to my house; I delivered him to the watchman; he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a police constable belonging to Worship street. On hearing there had been some lead stolen from the Green Man, I and Ray, my brother officer, went to the Salmon and Ball, it was near eight o'clock in the evening; we went to the watchhouse and looked at the prisoner, and then we proceeded to the Green Man. We went up to the second floor, there is a large passage that leads out to the balcony; in this passage we found the lead cut in pieces and rolled up; there is a sack full of it, above a hundred weight, I dare say. We took the lead to the balcony, Ray and I matched it to the balcony, it completely fitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it must be taken from that place. - A I am confident of it; it was fresh cut from the part that was left behind. I have no doubt but it come from that place.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it. - A. It was valued at ten shillings before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know any thing about it at all; I enlisted for a soldier at the Star and Garter, Whitechapel; I was very tipsy, I did not know what I was doing; they have said the lead was cut; they searched my pockets; they did not find any knife about me.</p>

If the pawnbroker is right, there is no doubt but that it was him that stole the coat; because stolen goods found in the possession<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170033"/>it is incumbent upon him to give an account how he came by them; the prisoner says he is not the person; the pawnbroker has sworn positively to him.

               <p>Q. Did you go at any time with a search warrant to the prisoner's lodgings. - A. I did, on the 9th of this month; I went first to Mrs. Damer's house, where I saw the prisoner; I told her I had business rather of an unpleasant nature to impart to her; but it would be the means of removing the suspicion from her, if she was innocent, by her going and having her box and person examined; she went with me with a great deal of willingness, to her lodgings, No. 5, Paddington-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what it was about. - A. Yes; I told her to search for some things that had been missing from Mrs. Damer's house in her apartments; I searched her pockets, I found nothing there; I then proceeded to search the room, and found nothing; I took her muff and gave it a shake; inside of the muff I drew out these four duplicates; I said to Mr. Roberts we have got the very thing we have been looking for so long; the prisoner began crying, and dropped on her knees and begged forgiveness; I went to the different pawnbrokers; the property was produced. Mr. Roberts claimed them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any piece of printed cotton out of your shop on the 27th of January last. - A. Yes, about half past five in the afternoon, two officers, Vickrey and Gleed, came into my shop and asked me if I had lost any printed cotton; on looking round I found I had lost two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the two pieces before. - A. About an hour before I had seen them in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not sold them to somebody. - A. Yes, I am quite certain of it. I had a piece of each pattern left in my shop; when I went to Worship street office I took a pattern of each, and laid it before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went to Worship-street you saw these two pieces. - A. I did; it was in the possession of Vickrey the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the pieces. - A. Twelve shillings.</p>

            . I am a police constable of Worship-street. On the 27th of January last, I, Gleed, Valentine, and Croswell, were going out on duty; I saw the prisoner and two other men at a little distance from the prosecutor's shop; they were all three together; when we first saw them they were about ten or fifteen yards from the prosecutor's shop; we were of one side of the way, the prisoner was on the side of the way as Mr. Nokes's shop was; I saw the prisoner go towards Mr. Nokes's door; the other men stood behind; he passed by the door and before we could cross the road he came back again; we could see very clear from the light of a window; I saw him with a bundle under his right arm, he run across the road, Gleed seized him; that moment he threw the bundle behind him; Crosswell picked up the bundle.</p>

            . Q. You were with the last witness. - A I was. On Wednesday evening, the 27th, I saw the prisoner with two other men in Shoreditch; the prisoner past the shop door of Mr. Nokes and returned again; I saw him go into the shop door and take something out; he came into the road, I ran and caught hold of his collar; he then threw something on the ground, Crosswell picked it up; I afterwards saw it was a piece of printed cotton.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had just come along Shoreditch from Greenwich; this gentleman took hold of my collar; the officers said I had taken a piece of print, and they said I had been robbing a shop; I told them I had not, I was going home; I had nobody with me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. You find one of the officers saw this man take it away. - It is not privately stealing, therefore you must acquit him of the capital part of the charge - then the question is whether you are not satisfied that he is guilty of the larceny; the property is found upon him. If you have any doubt about it, character in a doubtful case is very material; if you are of opinion he is guilty of the larceny, you will say so.</p>

I looked hard at him, and he crossed immediately to go the other side of the way; I went after him and stopped him in the middle of the road; I laid hold of him by the collar, and Gleed took the carpet from under his coat; I asked him where he was going with that carpet, he said to his master, he lived at Mile End New Town. I told him he was coming directly from that way. I took him to the office. When I was going to lock him up, he said he would tell me the whole truth; he said another man took it out of the shop and gave it to him; he was to meet the man in Shoreditch.</p>

The prisoner came into my house on the 25th of January; she asked me to buy a bunch of turnips; I refused to buy them; she went out and sold them to my next door neighbour. In about half an hour afterwards I met this same woman with a washing tub, a pair of stockings, and a waistcoat under her arm; she came up to me and asked me if I would buy the washing tub; I rather refused buying it at first, knowing I had one of the same size at home; she said if I would buy it, it should be worth my money. She asked me three shillings; thinking she would not take my money, I bid her two shillings for the tub. I brought it home. When I came in door I saw some splashes of whiting, the same as mine had; I looked and missed my tub. Seeing this woman with the stockings and waistcoat under her arm, I went down stairs, and missed the stockings and the waistcoat; I went out and overtook her by Smithfield bars talking to two women. I took hold of her, I told her it was my property that she had on her arm. She gave them up directly; I brought her home with me.</p>

I gave a signal to my fellow servant to open the door; he pushed the door open, and the prisoner threw the bag down and ran away; he followed him about an hundred yards and took him.

I brought down one and put it in the cart; while I was gone for that one I lost one pair of hind quarters from the cart; I made a hue and cry, if any body had seen them taken out of the cart; a man of the name of Tatum told me Parker saw the prisoner take it out of the cart, I went in pursuit of the prisoner, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN PARKER. I am servant to Mr. Griffin, a butcher in Little James-street, Bedford row. On the morning of the 4th, a little before nine o'clock, I was in Warwick-lane minding my cart where my master's property was; while I was standing there I saw the prisoner and another man pass by; I saw them go to the other part of Warwick-lane, and the prisoner took a hind quarter of mutton out of the cart; the person who was with him was standing against the post; when he took it of the opposite side of the way, I saw it as plain as I see you where you are, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance off where you. - A. I suppose about fifty yards off. He took it out of the cart, put it on his shoulder, and walked away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man. - A. He went with him; what became of them I know not I told Mr. Tatum of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. - A. I had seen him once, I believe; Ballard came out of the market, he enquired for the property; Tatum told him I saw it taken out of the cart; and by the description I gave him of the person he knew him by name.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him. - A. Not till the Monday following, I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him before the magistrate were you sure he was the man. - A. I was upon my oath then about it; I am perfectly satisfied that he was the man that took the mutton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If that man saw me take away the property that time, why did not he give information and have me taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. So he did.</p>
               <p>Ballard. I have seen the prisoner before; I have heard him called by name, and by the description I knew him; I have seen him in our market before about the carts.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time of this transaction, I believe Hickey was in your employ as porter. - A. He was <rs id="t18080217-66-deflabel385" type="occupation">porter in the warehouse</rs>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 16th of January, in consequence of any suspicion, did you and Mr. Nevitt, your clerk, conceal yourselves in your warehouse. - A Yes, we got up about half past six in the morning, the bell rung at seven o'clock; we concealed ourselves in the warehouse before any person entered in the warehouse; after the bell rung, I heard two men stop as I conceived, they came close to me in the warehouse, there were two men stood by me for sometime, I did not see them; they said in a sow tono of voice, do not make a noise, fetch or get a light were the words added to that; I do not know which of them proceeded to the counter, at no great distance I heard the reel distinctly, and they cut some twine; from thence they went from me some considerable distance back wards; I perceived Hickey our servant going first, coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any person entered but these two before mentioned. - A. No soul; and on their returning I observed Hickey first, Tobin followed him with the bags on his shoulder, they came nigh the door; I then remained sometime thinking to let them go out of the door; I heard the key put in the lock, and when the lock was sprung, I imagined then it would be time; I came from the place where I was concealed, towards the door; I saw Hickey as it were with the door in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Tobin. - A. I cannot say, I saw Tobin directly; on my running forward, Hickey, the short man. ran into the street; I followed him and ran I think better than a mile after him; he ran down Watling street, turned up Queen street, then into Pancrass lane; at last in the Old Jewry, there he was stopped by Mr. 
               <persName id="t18080217-66-person606">Bradshaw</persName>
             I was close to him; he was then taken to the Poultery Compter. I found Tobin in custody of our other servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Have you no other partners but those you have mentioned. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say Tobin had been in your service before. - A. Yes, about a fortnight before; I saw Tobin the day before he asked for Hickey, he had about three hats on his head, and about half a dozen pair of small clothes on his arm; he enquired for Hickey; I asked him what he wanted with Hickey; he said he wished to see him; I asked him what it was for; he said that he knew; I told him I presumed he knew where he lived, to go there; no, he said he did not; I then told him he might find it out; he then said I was a d - d impudent fellow; I said it was of little consequence he might go; I did not recollect him then. I knew him the next morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You live in this dwelling house yourself. - A. I do; the warehouse is under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any internal communication to the warehouse. - A. There is an internal communication to the warehouse; you may come in the warehouse two ways from the house, and from the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pay the rent yourself for the warehouse or only the house. - A. I pay the rent of the house and the warehouse as it were together, they are under one lease; the firm pay the taxes jointly, and I pay the rent; the premises are easy rented.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. You are clerk to Messrs. Berger. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conceal yourself in the warehouse of Mr. Bergers. - A. Yes, I concealed myself in one part of the warehouse, and Mr. Berger in another; after the bell rang, I immediately took my station in the warehouse; I was not in a part to see any one; I heard two men come into the warehouse to that part where I was; I heard them talk in a low tone, I heard the voice of Hickey distinctly, which I knew; when they came to that part of the warehouse where I was, they unlocked the accompting house door, and proceeded to unlock an inner door, which they had not the key of; unless the key was given to them by the servant, it was impossible they could get the key out of the iron safe; they must have another key.</p>
               <p>Q.The proper key was locked up in the iron safe. A. Yes. After they got in at the inner door, something heavy I heard drop in a bag; I knew vermilion was deposited in that place, I thought it to be vermilion; I heard something else rustling, I could not tell what it was; it was as though they were taking something else away; after which they came out of the inner door, turned the key of that and were proceeding out of the warehouse by Well court; there are two entrances to our warehouse, they got the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. As they went by you could not you see them. - A. No, but I heard them open the door to go out; after the door was open, I heard the prisoner Hickey<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170040"/>say to the other, stop, we must not go there, there is something a stirring; the door was then shut to. They then proceeded towards the door going out into Bow lane. When they got a short distance from me, as I thought they would not perceive me, I followed, and I perceived the prisoner Hickey at the door, with the door partly open. I spoke to Mr. Berger; I supposed the other was gone off. We both rushed to the door; in our haste we passed the prisoner Tobin, and left him behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hickey escape out of the door. - A. Yes; and Mr. Berger and myself followed him out into the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn back. - A. Not till I got to the Crown tavern in our lane, then I turned back; I heard a noise behind me, I turned my head round, and Tobin was in the act of coming out of the warehouse. I pursued him down Bow lane, crying stop thief; he was secured by Mr. Christopher Dodson in Chapside. I took him back to our warehouse. Mr. Berger secured the other man; we took him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that which had been brought out of the accounting house. - A. Behind the door, out of which Hickey ran, was the vermilion and the other articles; the vermilion is here. (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is that. - A. Two bags of vermilion, weighing thirty pounds each.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them. - A. From fifteen to ten pounds; the two sticks of verdigrease about forty nine shillings; eleven pound weight of bronze, seven pounds; they are the property of Messrs. Berger and sons.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag is not their property. - A. The small bag is Mr. Berger's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. At the time you apprehended the prisoner there was nothing found on him. - A. No, he had dropped the bag, which noise I had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was taken out of the house. - A. No, it had been removed from out of the accompting house; was on his shoulder, and he throwed it behind the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You never lost sight of him when you pursued him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Tobin's Defence. My lord - on this morning, as I was out of employment, I went to look after employment, any where, where I could get work; I had lived with Mr. Berger three weeks; I went as far as Watling street, I met a porter, he told me I might get a porter's place in Barge yard; I talked to him a great time; I came into Bow lane, and had turned up to Bow church, when the alarm was given. I was stopped. The day before I called at the warehouse to speak to Hickey; Mr. Berger asked me what I wanted with him; I told him I wanted to speak with him; he said, you rascal, go about your business, or else I will kick your a - e. I had two hats in my hand at the time, and two or three coats. I knew that Hickey was at dinner at that time.</p>
               <p>Hickey's Defence. On the 6th of January I came to this warehouse door to work as usual; the servant came down stairs and gave me the key of the accompting house and the warehouse. After going into the warehouse I unlocked the accompting house door to light the fire there; coming back again to get some wood I thought some of the men came and knocked at the door; I went down to the warehouse door, Mr. Berger run down the warehouse as if he was mad; I ran out of the door, he ran after me; upon which I was stopped and brought back.</p>
               <p>Tobin called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Hickey called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  <interp inst="t18080217-70-crimeloc410" type="placeName" value="Bell at Bedfont"/>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner on any part of your journey. - A. The waggoner took the prisoner up at Staines, before we came to Bedfont. At Bedfont we got out of the waggon and went to a private house; he took his bundle and went to the Bell, and I walked with him: I left my band box in the waggon; I staid at the Bell till the waggon called for me; he told me that he should wait till the waggon came; he went out with a lighted pipe in his mouth and left his bundle at the Bell; I had a suspicion that he was gone for my bundle; he came in again a little before eight o'clock, he brought in nothing with him; offered to lend me a coat to wrap up myself in the waggon; he took his bundle and went off; the waggon called at nine o'clock; they went after him and took him on suspicion of stealing my box.</p>
               <p>TAOMAS ATKINS. I am the waggoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect stopping at a private house at Bedfont. - A. Yes; the prisoner and the woman got out of the waggon at Bedfont at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards follow the prisoner and take him. - A. Yes; we took him about a hundred yards from the Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see him do. - A. He stopped; we went to him and asked him about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the box any where did you. - A. No. He said he had not seen the box; I took him back to the public house; Taylor went back and found the box just by where the man stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the box in the waggon when the woman got out. - A. Yes; I covered it with a bit of straw.</p>

            . Q. Do you live at Bedfont. - A. I live at a private house, where the waggon stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear any alarm about the box being lost. - A. I was going to the Bell to get a pint of beer for my supper; I met the prisoner coming from the Bell towards the waggon; I said, good night, sir; the Bell is nearer London than where the waggon stopped, at out three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go to the waggon. - A. No; I went to the public house, and stopping there a little bit, I heard that this box was lost out of the waggon; I set off after the man, towards Hounslow expecting this was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark. - A. Dark, he kept right on the road for Hounslow till we stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got before you stopped him. A About a hundred yards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any box. - A. No; I went up to him, I asked him whether he had not seen any box that had been taken out of the waggon; he said no; I told him we suspected he had, he must go along with us back to the public house; we took him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the box any where. - A. Yes; we found the box fifteen or twenty yards from the place we took the man from; close to the road upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason for charging the prison with taking the box. - A. I know nothing no farther than all suspicion; he owned nothing, nor nothing we could swear to, in regard of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here who saw him with the box. - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. - It is unnecessary to go farther there was a ground for suspicion; nobody saw him near the waggon nor with the box; it is a case of suspicion, but the people were too hasty in taking him up; they should have waited till he took the box up.</p>

No. Crawford came to me on the 29th of October, and left me on the 23d of December; she left me before I came down in the morning. Leaving me in this way, I thought she had done something that was not proper. I went into her bed chamber, I found I missed out of my trunk in her room two counterpanes; from that I looked in the buffet, where I missed four table spoons and four tea spoons, one salt spoon, and a pair of tea tongs; from that I went up stairs. I missed six table cloths, a sheet, four shifts, one shirt of my son's, one night waistcoat, four petticoats, a head cloth of a bed furniture, and five pair of stockings. - I missed two flat irons a day or two afterwards, and one pair of pockets that was found on the prisoner. I was present when she was taken from a house of ill fame in Whitcombe street, by my brother in law. When she was in the coach she mentioned that she had pledged the spoon herself in Chandos street, and the other prisoner Salmon had pawned the counterpane there likewise. We went into the pawnbroker's shop, the pawnbroker found the counterpane and the tea spoon; I stopped there with the prisoner while my brother in law got an officer; the officer came; we then went to Salmon's apartment in Bull's Inn court, where the officer searched her, and found the pockets on her, and in the apartments of Mrs. Salmon he found a number of pawnbroker's duplicates; some of these led to the discovery of other articles belonging to me, which were pledged at another shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Crawford lodge with Salmon. A. I am certain she did not. We went to Mr. Ackland's in the Strand; we found a counterpane, a shift, two table cloths, and a petticoat; that is all I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. These were your property. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a profile painter, 32, Bread street, Cheapside. On the 18th of January I took Crawford at a house in Whitcomb street; I put her in a coach and took her to the public office. I asked her how she could be so ungrateful to rob her mistress; I told her she had taken the silver spoons; she said she did not take the spoons, she had only taken the counterpane, and a shift of her mistresses's. In consequence of that we went to Mr. Wegulan; there we found the counterpane. Mr. Chapman acted in a manner that does him credit, he brought forward the spoon.</p>
               <p>Crawford's Defence. When he took me in the coach, he told me that if I would confess he would set me at liberty directly; consider, he said, you are almost at the office.

The prisoner Dukes came to me about a fortnight ago, he asked me if I wanted any rose wood; I told him no, not at present; he asked me if I knew any cabinet maker in the neighbourhood; I told him yes, Mr. Lawson in Maiden lane; he immediately said I will fetch it and let you see it; he brought it up to the door in Mr. Oakley's cart, he told me it was round the corner in Long acre; he said there were two men with him in the public house drinking he fetched it in the cart; I got up to the top of the cart and looked into the cart to see what wood there was, I saw two large pieces, which the prisoner called rose wood, which turned out to be king wood, and four pieces of tulip wood; I asked him what he wanted for the wood; he told me two guineas for the whole; I said, I did not want any thing of the kind; then he offered me the whole of it for one guinea and a half; I told him no, and declined having any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the wood again. - A. I could not swear to it by any particular mark; I think I should know the wood again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine them pieces of wood. - A. Dukes called on me the day after it was left, or the second day after, he asked me whether I meaned to purchase the wood that was standing there; I had never moved it from where he left it; he said he frequently dealt in such sort of wood as that; he said Mr. Gouge ordered him to get it, but it was not convenient for him to have it; he asked me nwepence a pound for the king wood, he put no price on the other; I informed him I would not have it if he would give it me, I did not want the king wood; I asked him for his address, if he had a stock of wood I would look at it; he gave me a reference to Mr. Gouge; he came on the Saturday after and took the wood away, as my wife informed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any application made to you by the prisoner Dukes. - A. I do, Foggett and me were together; he said, I am going out with the caravan, and if so be you have any thing that I can put in, I can get a customer for it. Foggett took two pieces of king wood to the cart, and three pieces of tulip wood; he delivered it to Dukes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the caravan after that. - A. Foggett and I went away; he said he would overtake us in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Dukes again. - A. In Picadilly; we kept strait on till we came to Long acre, we went into a public house and had a pot of porter; Dukes went out, he said he would go to the man, where he was going to; he went and came back again, and said the man did not want any, he said that man had recommended him to another man in Maiden lane, just the other side of Covent garden; he went there; we went with him both of us.</p>
               <p>Q. To whose house did he go there. - A. I cannot tell, we stopped at the end of Maiden lane; when he came back he said the man was not at home, but he would be at home in about half an hour, or an hours time; he had the wood in the caravan all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wait till the man returned. - A. We went just by the end of Drury lane, and there we had a pot of porter; he went away and said he would take Mr. Oakley's wood where he was going to; then Foggett and I left him, we did not see him till the evening; he said then that he saw the man, the man did not want it, he might leave it there till such time as he called for it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner Foggett ever say any thing to you about this wood. - A. I know no more about it; Foggett did not know where the house was, not to my knowledge; Dukes talked of fetching it away, but he did not know where to take it to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he took it to. - A. Last Saturday night Dukes told me then that he and Foggett went after it; I stopped at a public house, they said they had left the wood at Foggett's house. On Sunday morning I saw the wood at Foggett's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wood that you saw at Foggett's house the same that he put in the caravan. - A. It was the wood; that is the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. You never saw the wood in the caravan. - A. No, but I knew it was out of the caravan.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever was in the caravan you knew was not out. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now my good fellow, when did you tell the prosecutor this story that you have been telling my lord to day. - A. After I was taken up; after he chastized me in that sort of way I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not one word before. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I understood you to say that you and Foggett stole the wood; Dukes was not nigh when you stole the wood. - A. Yes, he was in the cart and received it.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY. - Mr. Walford. Did you apprehend the prisoners. - A. I apprehended Foggett in Mr. Oakley's warehouse; he told me where his lodgings was. I found the timber that I gave got here in his lodging; he had only a back garret. I asked him where he got the two large pieces of king wood,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170045"/>he said he bought it at the river side; I told him it would be very proper to bring the person where he bought it; he said he did not know where to find him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gow. Is that the wood they shewed you at your house. - A. It has all the appearance of it; it is just the same size and shape.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawson. I can tell the marks of it without looking at it. I looked it over when he offered it for sale; they are the pieces of wood he offered to me.</p>
               <p>Baker. That is the king wood that Fogget put in Duke's, cart.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell me what then passed. - A. The person that towed the timber in the canal said that Heather told him to come and fetch it from his master's house; then Dr. Perry granted a warrant against Heather.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor institute any other examination about the timber. - A. None whatever while I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170046"/>there; through permission. I was desired to go to Mr. Hilliard to know whether any thing could be done to the prisoner. In consequence of that the prisoner was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body make any application, and by whom was the application made to pay the expences. A. Herbert came to me on Friday before the man was committed on the Monday; Herbert said I want to know who is to pay for the prosecution; I said I always understood the prosecutor paid the expenses; I said let it be taken to Heather or Mr. Saunders; he said if you do not pay it bad will come on it.</p>

               <p>JOHN STOCKS. - Mr. Bolland. You are a baker living in Camden street, Islington. - A. Yes, I ordered twenty sacks of flour of Mr. George, Jordan's waggon was standing at the door after he delivered the sacks; upon searching the waggon, I found a sack laid across down on the waggon it was covered with the tarpaulin, it could not have fell down, so it must have been laid down in that manner; the hay that he had brought for his horses was throwed up and the tail of the waggon was fastened up ready to go away; after he came back. I asked him to point out the twenty sacks of flour he had pitched, but he could not do it, he had intermixed them with some other sacks that were there, that had been brought in about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to point out to him that there was not twenty sacks. - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. Was it not possible on a certain number of sacks being moved away from the waggon it might have fell down there. - A. No, it was impossible to fall down against the front of the waggon, the taupaulin was tucked under the sides.</p>

            ; I said then you are my prisoner for stealing a sack of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the waggon. - A. No, Mrs. Stock understanding what it was, she said to the prisoner; I hope you have not done just the same to us; he said no madam there is your twenty sacks of flour there; he pointed out to the twenty sacks; then I took him to the public house; soon after Mr. Stock's man came; he said therewas a sack of flour in the waggon. I went over and saw the sack of flour in the waggon, it lay quite flat and the taupaulin over it fastened at two corners.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of that morning had the prisoner said any thing to you about rent. - A. I was in the kitchen in the morning about eleven o'clock, she came into the kitchen to me and said she was behind, with her rent.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the fact, she was. - A. Yes; she said Daniel would bring home a two pound note, she would pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was she behind. - A. Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that morning, while you were in the bar, did you observe her in the bar or near it. - A. I was in the kitchen, the bar was left in care of my niece.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the day did you observe any thing about her dress. - A. I did; she had about a week or ten days before that borrowed my servant's shawl; on that day I saw her with her own shawl on; her shawl she told me was in pledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe in the morning whether she staid in or went out. - A. I cannot say. I was in the kitchen; when my husband came home between five and six o'clock in the evening I caused her to be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Holton also apprehended that evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.So that there was nobody left in their room. - A. Nobody; the next morning I went to her room, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170049"/>observed an old gown hanging on the back of the chair, that she had worn that Saturday; the same day she was apprehended I took it in my hand, I observed a small key tied withinside of the waist of the gown, with a string only; the key and gown are both here, this gown she took off while the officer waited for her; this is the gown, and the key is hanging to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the money that you lost wrapped up in pieces of old newspaper. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Now we know ladies do not wear pockets, and the key is tied to the gown in the modern fashion. It is a common key, it is not a picklock key. - A. To be sure it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your drawer locked. - A. My own key was left in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband keeps the house that the property belongs to. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sorry for your loss. How many lodgers did you keep. - A. Two, when the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all come in at one common door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have some servants perhaps. - A. Yes, two; a boy and a female servant.</p>
               <p>Q.This woman was a lodger in the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the upper part of it, not on the same floor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made the bed. - A. Myself; I never entrust the servant with the key; I always make the bed myself and keep the key, because I never trust the servant to go into it; it is where I keep my property.</p>

No, I asked her if she would unlock it to satisfy herself before I took it; she said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170050"/>was perfectly satisfied with my honesty, or else she should not have brought it to me; I asked her to come with me to see me lock it up, she refused coming, and I said I would not take it if she did not come.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Chapman's, boot-maker, Moorfields. On Tuesday the 26th of January, about ten minutes past five in the afternoon, the foreman of Mr. Chapman went to tea; he came back after he had been to Short street, he said there were three men standing there, they either intended to do the linen draper or us; I went and shut the door of the ladies' shop; we have two shops, one for ladies and the other for gentlemen; I stood at the other door, I saw the prisoner walking on the pavement, up and down; he crossed the road into Moorfield's quarters; I saw the prisoner behind a tree looking at Mr. Macklew's shop, I observed one of them as he went round the coach stand by the end of Moorgate, I saw him again in the quarters making motions to another; at that time Mr. Macklew's young man was taking the things in; he looked up at the next house at that time. I saw no person passing just at that time; I saw the prisoner about three yards from the door with a piece of printed cotton in his hand; I saw one that was with him meet him about half way in the road; I saw the prisoner give it the other, he put it under his coat and ran off across Moorfields; I immediately run and caught the prisoner by the collar, and brought him into the shop.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are chief clerk of the police office, Hatton Garden. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the examination of the prisoner of the bar, and also of Whiston. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that occasion was the silver produced by Mr. Dobson. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any declaration was made by Whiston, was any warning made to Whiston. - A. Before that declaration was made the magistrate cautioned Whiston upon his making the confession, he told him that what he said would be committed to writing, therefore he was to consider whether he would say any thing or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What one prisoner says of the other prisoner is not evidence against the other; it may be evidence against himself, and whatever Whiston might say is not evidence against the other.</p>
               <p>Court. It is making what another says not upon oath<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170052"/>evidence against the prisoner; the indictment proves the conviction of Whiston. (The conviction read.)</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney to Dobson You produced that silver on the trial of Whiston. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified</p>
               <p>COURT. Possession is not evidence of the receiver; possession is evidence of the thief. If property is recently stolen and found in possession of another person, he is the thief, and not the receiver. In this case we can have but one opinion, that is, to think that he is a very bad man; but though he is a bad man, we must try him upon the strict rule of law; - possession is not evidence of the receiver but evidence of the thief. I cannot state it to you that mere possession of property is evidence that he received it of another person, knowing it to be stolen; because to make him the receiver, there must be evidence that he knew another person stole it. It is a very fortunate circumstance to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Which department are you in. - A. The shawl department. On Thursday the 28th of January, our shop was very much crowded with customers; and the counter was very much crowded with goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Some on the counter and some on the floor. - A. None on the floor as I know of; I was at one end of the counter serving a customer; I observed this woman at the other end crowding upon the people. I do not recollect her speaking or asking one for any thing. I only recollect her face among the crowd. I saw the prisoner brought in by the last witness, she was taken up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it was that woman. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know how you could know that if there were fifty or sixty people in the shop; supposing you was serving me, you would not look at the other end of the shop - A. I can speak to you just now, and I can see the jury.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you look at one end and the other at the same time. - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are a clever fellow. - A. She had a scarlet cloak on; I knew her face very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How many customers in scarlet cloaks had you on that day. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that you recollected her face; was there any thing particular. - A. I cannot say any thing particular that I recollected her face by; but taking her face altogether, I recollected her; there was eleven shawls which I saw up stairs were said to be found upon her; I did not see them found upon her.</p>
               <p>Jury. I suppose you can tell us within some hundreds how many customers you had on that day. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not confine you to two or three hundred; had you a thousand persons in the shop. - A. About six hundred,</p>
               <p>Court. And can you remember the face of every one of them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither do I know how you can recollect the face of a person, the shop being so thronged; had she a bonnet on. - A. I think as far as I can recollect she had a straw hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Pulled over her face; how long is the counter where you stood. - A. So far as from me to you.</p>
               <p>Q. So then the distance that she was from you was as far as from you to me. - A. Yes, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing particular called your attention to her. - A. No more than persons in red cloaks excites suspicion. - Q. I do not know that red cloaks excites any suspicion; they are fashionable; or that a straw hat excites any suspicion. - A. I would rather suspect a person in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you should have more reason to suspect a woman in a genteel dress. - A. Perhaps that is the case.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask Bradshaw or Pedder what he delivered. - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. When the man returned home, and they were taking the casks off the dray, the man that was taking account of the casks, discovered, that there was one with a great deal of beer in it; I was called, in consequence of that I examined the cask; I found it contained beer exactly of the same quality as that which had been carried out; I asked the prisoner which way he came in possession of it, and for what purpose; he said the people at the workhouse had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170054"/>given it him; from the quality of the beer I knew that must be an untruth; I took him and Evans to the workhouse to see what quantity of beer they had delivered; when we got to the house we went into the cellar and there we found only four; while I was conversing with the men the prisoner slipped up stairs and ran away; I had some difficulty in securing him. I am very sorry to say that draymen make up beer in this way to the injury of the brewer; it was done with intention of converting it to his own use, he would take it out in parts and mix it; his intention was to rob my customers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I had any intention to rob my master I would not have taken the beer to my master's, but in the hurry of business I was mistaken; I took it home. It is the first time I ever was before a justice in my life. I hope you will restore me to my family.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I looked in that tub; this bag stood upright in it, which I took and shewed to Mr. Frith; I asked West if that was his cart, he said yes, it was, and that was his stable, and he found that bag in his cart; I secured West, and Bishop went after Hearn.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he emptied the bag, or was it in the state it now is. - A. In the state it is in now. I instantly followed him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Hearn's Defence. I chucked it in the cart; I never saw any body; I thought the horses would not eat it.</p>
               <p>West's Defence. I know nothing at all of it; when I got up I went to the cart and unlocked the wheel; it has no where to stand but in the open road; it has stood there twelve years.</p>
               <p>Hearn called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>West called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
