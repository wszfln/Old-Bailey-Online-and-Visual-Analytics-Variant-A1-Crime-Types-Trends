I am 16 years old, and live at 2, Montague Street, Russell Square—I am assistant to a firm of electricians—on July 5th, 1898, I entered the prisoner's employment at 4 and 5, Warwick Court, to learn the business—I left on, I think, March 10th this year—I went about with him at his work as an electric installer—about November, 1898, he told me that he had got the electric light free, but he never told me how—one fuse was taken out, and another was put in (<hi rend="italic">Pointing it out on a model.</hi>)—I have seen him do it, and I have done it myself—he said that when it was put so (<hi rend="italic">moving it</hi>) he did not pay for the light—that was put on in the evenings—when the fuse was not attached to the wire it was taken out and pushed on one side; it was put back in the morning—there was a very little light in the office in the day-time, hardly any, but in the evening there were sometimes four lamps and sometimes less—he told me to be careful of the light in the daytime, but he said nothing about the evening—about 5 months after I had been there 5 lamps were added, 2 in the shop and 3 outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been wireman to this company for 6 years—on May 10th I got instructions, and went to the prisoner's premises to see if the meter was in working order—I turned on the light, and it did not work—I put on a machine which I carry, and it worked—I discon<lb/>nected it, anl it did not work—I looked round the place, and found this piece of wire brought from the wall on to a single<lb/>wire tube about a foot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189907240018"/>
               <p>below—I tried the tube wire, and it cut the meter out—I also found that the lamp was not connected right to go through the meter at all, what I call the meter loop—no wire should be connected with a meter loop—there was no cover on the wires—it did not register the current that was used—the cut<lb/>outs had no coverings on them—I reported to Mr. Gehardi, and went there with him next day, and the wire was removed, but I could see the bare wire—the meter and the lamps were all right, except Mr. Thomas's light; the key<lb/>off was bare, and I insulated it, to prevent fire—I made a sketch, but I find now that it is wrong—on the 11th and 13th I went again, and made this model, without assistance from anyone—there was a hole like this on the premises; I cannot give any reason for that; it ought to have been covered—that represents the double pole cu<lb/>tout, and it is 2 ft. from it to the wall; I did not measure it—the casing has no cover on it; that is not usual—there was a piece without any cover in Mr. Thomas's room—I also noticed that the bottom one was bare—on the 11th the meter started with one lamp—I did not remove any of the casing.</p>

               <p>with the other witness to the premises—this model agrees with the facts, I found, with the exception of the wire coining out of the casing, the hole was there, bat not the wire—the other part was connected in a regnlar and proper way—I examined the wire in Mr. Thomas's room, and found a wire connecting from the loop to the two top wires—it would not register the electricity consumed—I say that the current passed into Thomas's room did not pass through the meter—the return part of the meter loop was bare; the installation was stripped off—I tried the meter—the first lamp I used was the one in Thomas's room; that did not start; I used another, I cannot say which, and I then discovered that Thomas's lamp was not going through the meter—I should say at that time the disc was not impinging on the arm of the magnet, it was revolving in the ordinary way—if it touched, however lightly, it would not move with one lamp on—I said to the prisoner that that lamp was connected before it came to the meter, so that the meter was not connected—he said that he did not know it—it was not proposed to have the case uncovered, as it was in Mr. Thomas's room—I cannot see any reason for having this pole cut out, or for this hole being here—I made these seals myself last night, and handed them to Mr. Cubit, of the Thomson Meter Co.—I could not detect that they had been opened and the wires taken out and closed again—Mr. Thomson has put a ring on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew of this little experiment being tried—the meter was tested before it left the company's office, more than 18 months ago, and the next time was by the London County Council inspectors after this question had arisen—there is no doubt that this was connected with the slow wire of the meter—this model does not show the T<lb/>piece—it should be just inside the horizontal piece—if used for the experimental testing of lamps you would have to have two wires—supposing the meter was cut out of circuit, Thomas's lamp would light, supposing there had been a tapping of the wire in the way that Mr. Oliver's plan suggests—if the current was diverted at A on the wire to the meter, the lamp in Thomas's room would light, because it would come through another way—if Thomas's lamp was attached, and the current was diverted at A, without going through the meter, the lamp would light in the same way, but in a different direction—the meter would show that—going round the other way, Oliver could see whether the meter was working—it would work backwards—it would in a long period show on the registration dial—he would notice the disc revolving, in a reverse direction—I could not see the magnet under the disc, but I could tell by the rate of the revolution of the disc; it would move very slowly with one lamp—it was open to the company to seal the cutters; that is not commonly done with ordinary cutters; it is with a high tension main—the County Council test the meters, and this meter was tested by Mr. Rossiter.</p>

               <p>went to the premises, and found this meter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and brought it away—I found the seals intact—I tried to start the meter with one lamp, but it would not start; lamps were added one by one, and it would not start then—the seals were then cut off, and I found the disc apparently touching the lower arm of the left<lb/>hand magnet—I procured a screw, driver, and examined it; the pivot underneath flew back to a turn of a quarter—on screwing it up the meter began to work; the other lamps were turned out, and it worked with one lamp, and it was found to work within our limit—nothing was wrong after the jewel<lb/>point was screwed up, and vibration would not shake it down then, but it would before—vibration would not cause it to go up again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was sealed when I got it—nobody could screw it up while it was sealed—if the screw was tight it would not come loose by long-continued vibration—if the disc was in contact with the magnet it would be unequal in its action—there was nothing to indicate that the seals had been tampered with, or the meter—I condemned the meter—it was good when it was adjusted; it registered within 2 1/2 points of accuracy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the firm who supplied this meter—I have been exclusively employed in the meter department—on July 22nd I attended at the office of the London County Council, and inspected this meter, and found it perfect—it is not pro<lb/>per for the copper disc to touch the magnet; if it begins to graze on the arm of the magnet it will not go back—it is not possible for vibration to send it up, and if it is properly set it will not go down—I have found Avhen working at the top of a building with machinery in motion that the vibration makes no difficulty, and I had one hammered for 33 minutes, and it had no effect—last night Mr. Rossiter made two seals in my presence, and I took' them home, took the wires out, sealed them up again, and put them in a handkerchief, so that if the seals had been on a meter I could have opened them, done what I liked, and sealed them up again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Both the models were prepared under my directions, but the first one was prepared from a sketch by Oliver; that was incorrect in one particular—Oliver's model shows a single pole cutout on the wire to the meter—the theory then was that the cut<lb/>off was from the central line—I say to<lb/>day that the short circuit, cutting out the meter, it did not go through the meter at all—my plan No. 3, produced at the Police-court, shows another theoretical combination—this is an imaginary line from A to B; it does not represent any wire—I do not know that the prisoner suggested that one of his own engineers should be present; there were 2 or 3 gentlemen there—if the current was diverted, Thomas's lamp would light at Z only—I do not think that the disc would revolve in the opposite direction—we have 3 years' contracts at 5d. per unit, with 10 per cent, discount, and 5d. on agreement—we have tried to get 3 years' agree<lb/>ments—this meter was in the room where Thomas's lamp was; therefore, that would be the first lamp tried to test the meter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an electrical engineer, of Hatton Garden—I was called about the end of May to examine the plan prepared by Mr. Collins, and the model—I found them to be inaccurate—I found no indication of any wire represented by this blue line in Plan 2—that would have been obvious to anybody making proper observation—there is also a representation of these 3 points, X, Y, and Z, on the model; they represent the wire in Thomas's room—my view of it is that the peelings are exactly the same age as those on the wire, and are quite of recent date—they were bright—it is a very common thing for meters not to record faithfully—it was a good meter after it had been adjusted—I was present on June 27th, when Mr. Rossiter set the meter, and I agree with him as to the falling of the screw which retained the jewel<lb/>point—the constant vibration would make it shift, and there would be no indication of the meter having been tampered with—constant vibration would have more effect in causing that than a sudden shock—there were indications of the force of vibration; the meter was in a place where people were continually going in and out, and the prisoner had a lathe and other things which would cause vibration—I saw a T<lb/>piece that should be below this point—it would be much easier for the T<lb/>piece to be cut out, and then it would not cut off the meter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That would not in any way account for the meter not registering with all these lamps on—even if the screw were loose, the currents would not be registered on the meter, because that current was not moving as quickly as it ought; it might wobble, and get against the pole of the magnet; it was binding, and one lamp started it—I conclude from that that the meter was not in order, and that there was some obstruction—if the disc happened to stop, the lamp would not set it going again; I should have put the blame down to the meter—I have not come here to be bullied—if the meter was not moving, I should conclude that there was something wrong with it—if I found a wire here I should have traced the other end of it before I came to a conclusion—I did not suggest be<lb/>fore the Magistrate that vibration would make the screw move up—part of my evidence is omitted; I was not talking of the screw with the disc, but a screw with the nut, and in that case no doubt it would be down<lb/>wards—I do not know what would cause it to move up—I explained that there was no lock<lb/>nut, and any vibration against it would cause it to go up or down, probably down—the prisoner summoned me on June 26th, saying, "Will you come and see my meter? it has stopped," and when I got there one or two lamps were burning—he said, "I want you to look at my meter; I came here on Sunday, and it had stopped"—he told me that it was not registering that morning, and that it was not registering on Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Farrar and Co., of 24, Cheapside, solicitors—we act for the landlord of 4 and 5, War<lb/>wick Court—I was informed that the original arrangement for the supply of electricity was through a master meter—I told the company that our client claimed the electric rent from the tenants—I objected to that, and instructed the prisoner to fix the light so that it lighted the door and passage only, and I got an estimate from him—that involved a fresh cable, and I told each tenant to make his own arrangements with the company, and gave the prisoner notice that I should cut off his light.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not instruct him to move the meter, but I told him that all the tenants would be cut off, so that they should not pay through my meter—I left it entirely to him how the work was to be done.</p>

                  </hi>. I have had 20 years' experience in the electrical</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189907240024"/>
               <p>profession, and have been employed in important engagements—I have heard Mr. Allom's evidence, and made myself familiar with this model—the T-piece is to obtain a current for testing purposes; it is very common to make arrangements, which would not be wanted by a consumer—if there had been a wire from the double pole cutter to the single pole cutters, that would be obvious—apart from the T-piece, if there had been any wire, anybody making an examination would be able to discover it—there was no indication of such a wire when I went there—I took down the casing myself to see where the wires came from, and I made this hole at the top myself—the pole was not visible till I removed the casing—the T-piece was visible—the disc is made of sheet copper, and it is exceedingly unlikely to remain true if it was knocked about; it might touch at one point and not at another, and if it stopped, by putting on a stronger current it might move off the point again; or a jar might do it, as it was in the workshop—they do not use that on Sunday, but the meter was fixed underneath the passage, and there was traffic in and out—all the meters in London do not go wrong, because they are not all of this sort, but they are all liable to do so—this meter was not approved by the Board of Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I suggest that the meter was fixed on an interior wall; it is not a wooden partition—I never saw a wall that was not subject to vibration—the basement of a building is the least subject to vibration—I have never seen one of these discs in Thomson's meters which was actually true—this disc (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) does not run true, but it is much more true than the one in the model—if this disc was running absolutely clear of the magnet on June 2nd, I see no reason why it should not register true—vibration might lower it, but not raise it—finding nothing in the wiring to cause a short circuit, I formed the opinion that the meter was wrong—I was looking on on June 13th,. and I never asked to have it unsealed, that I and my fellow experts might see it—the whole cover was short 3/8 of an inch, so that, if not so deep as the hole, it was broader—I could not see the two wires through the hole without getting on the steps—they were twisted up in a very unworkman like manner—they did not protrude; they were visible to any person in the room,'but not very noticeable—there were two wires sticking through, but no bare ends—it was a small hole, just such as you would make for connecting a lamp about 1/4 of an inch, just sufficient to admit the wire—no person could mistake the one for the other—when I examined it no wire was sticking through, but the wires were there; the whole thing was put up very badly—it would take 10 minutes to connect a wire along this casing and put it through in the way Mr. Oliver says, because the hole through the wall was only small—these wires being bunched up, made it difficult to trace them—an expert would not trace the wires without taking off the casing—I am not surprised that Oliver made a mistake, he ought to have called the prisoner, the person who was most likely to contradict him, if it was true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Oliver's mistake was that he suggested that there was a single pole cut<lb/>out on the wires of the meter—if he saw that the meter had stopped it was a very simple thing to take the cover off—there were not three wires—I traced the two wire, and found that they were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189907240025"/>
               <p>harmless wires—the hole was simply due to bad workmanship; it was absolutely unnecessary—the casing did not go up to the ceiling, and apparently no hole was made.</p>

I can account for the meter going on again when stopped by something wrong with the disc if it received a very slight jar; the plate may have rested on the magnet with its whole weight, or with very slight pressure—that might happen many times.</p>

                  <lb/>Cohen did the talking—I had asked Cohen if he knew a place where I could send my horses for a time, and he told me that Wiskar would take them in at the farm—he told me they would cost 5s. a week to keep, and 1s. for shoeing—we came to terms that the horses were to remain there—I was at Cohen's house when he was arrested, and he denied that he had any receipt for the horses—before he was arrested my two brothers had been to the farmer—one of my brothers went by the name of Fittlecock, and Cohen knew it.</p>

I next saw Cohen on June 7th, and the prisoner Foreman was with him. This was at my farm. I heard Cohen say to Horace Sheldrick, 'Come and see the horses.' Sheld<lb/>rick said, 'Yes.' Cohen then said, 'I think I shall sell them to Fore<lb/>man,' pointing to him, Cohen then asked Sheldrick whether the horses could be delivered. I said, 'If you will give me the receipt which I gave you for the horses, and pay me for their keep, I will deliver the horses.' They then went away to look at the horses. At about 4 p.m. the same day the prisoner Foreman, with another man, not Cohen, came, and Foreman said, 'I have come for the horses I bought from Fittlecock,' and he handed me the receipt, paid me 24s. for their keep, and I handed him the horses.</p>

For the past week deceased has been unwell; she was sick on Wednesday, the 21st, and feverish; she refused her food. I put her to bed, and on the Thurs<lb/>day morning she was very feverish and thirsty; she only took light food. I kept her in bed all day. On Thursday evening I saw she was very ill, and I sent for the elder of the Peculiar People and he anointed her in the name of the Lord, and prayed for her; on Thursday night she was very restless; I was continually up and down with her; on the Friday bhe was still ill, but presented no new symptoms; on the Saturday she was rather better, but still in bed. She continued the same until Monday evening, when she grew worse, feverish, and coughed; at times she broiigbt up phlegm, which was a little inclined to be yellow. On Thursday sho waa very much worse; her breathing was laboured; on Tuesday morning she had loud breathing from the throat. We sent for the elder, and he anointed her again, and prayed for her; but she continued to get worse. On Wednesday she had various changes. We sent for Sister Appleton*,. she came, and helped me watch her. The child died on Thursday morrf<lb/>ing at 2.50 a.m. I have had bix children, three of whom are dead; there were inquests on those which died. I did not call in any medical aid, although I knew the child was very ill. The last day of its life I knew she was dying. I called in Mrs. Appleton, as I thought she might give me some advice or enlightenment as to what to give the child. She is often called in by our people here in castf of illness; she is not paid." Frederick Norman's deposition: *'T am the father of the deceased. I knew of her illness on June 218t. I saw her sick, and saw that she was feverish. I thought she had a bilious attack. She wa? worse next day. I sent for the elder, as I considered her ill. I saw her every day, and several times a day. My wife and I were quite at one as to our treatment of the child. The child had beef<lb/>tea, port wine, patent barley water, warm milk, and oatmeal gruel. We used no poulticing.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Frederick Norman, in his defence, said that he did not call in medical aid simply because it was against the tenets of the sect and not because he could not afford it. or because he wanted to break the law; tliat the Lord had taken care of him and his wife and children all of whom were supposed to be weak; and that he could not call in medical aid, as it was against his belief. Eleanor Norman, in her defence said that it was against her belief to call in a doctor; that the Lord Had helped her a number of times, and that He had stepped in on their behalf many times, and on behalf of others.</hi>

I was called on June 12th, about 10.40 p.m., the potman had hold of the prisoner's left arm—she had a knife in her 'left hand, with Mood on it; I took it from her—Hedges was just outside the door—he said, "Oh! policeman, look what she has done; look at the blood running down my trousers; take me somewhere as soon as you can—the prisoner could hear that, and said, "Yes, I did it; I am sorry I did it on the wrong side; Idid it because he was living with a dirty woman"—I took the prosecutor to the doctor's first, and then I took the prisoner to the station—another constable took the prosecutor to the in<lb/>firmary—I do not know whether he was living with another woman.</p>

He had some beer; I called for some whisky, but did not drink it"—I charged her with attempting to murder her husband—she simply said, "Yes"—I have made inquiries about both of them—the man formerly lived with the prisoner for many years at Oxford they are man and wife—he is a. sawyer—he is given to drink at times—he works very hard when not in drink, but when he is he is very violent to her—once he was sentenced to 14 days' hard labour for assaulting her, and about two years ago he was summoned for assaulting her, but he did not appear at the Court, and a warrant was granted for his arrest—it is difficult to prove whether he is living with another woman—the woman he is lodging with is married, and her husband is in the house.</p>

I am medical officer to the infirmary at Lewis<lb/>ham—the prosecutor was brought in, suffering from a wound in the right side of his chest—he was in a state of collapse—I found, on examination, that he had a punctured wound between the second and third ribs—the direction was oblique—he was covered with blood from his neck downwards, and it ran out of his right boot when he was undressed—the wound had gone down to the ribs, and had been forced outward, and had gone between the ribs into the armpit—the knife had penetrated about an inch—the ribs had stopped it and turned it—it was not a dangerous wound; the danger arose from the quantity of blood he had lost—he was under my care from the 12th to the 27th—he had symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—he admitted that he had been drinking, and shock and the loss of blood will very often bring on <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> when a man has been drinking—this knife is sharp, and a moderate blow would cause it to penetrate.</p>

Rose, about nine years of age, and up to June 23rd I had a boy named Harry Arthur Baker, who was seven years old when ho died—I noticed Rose was unwell on Wednesday, June 14th—on the Thursday I took her to Dr. Maguth, of 6, Ferrier Street—this is a photograph of his shop-front, with the words, "Dr.</p>

               <p>Maguth, LL.D"—I thought he was qualitied—Rose Ciimplaioed of sick-jiess and headache on Wednesday, and of her throat on Thursday—the prisoner looked at her throat—I told him what she complained of—he said it was a very bad ulcerated throat, and that she must have a bottle. of gargle for it, a bottle of ointment to rub outside, and medicine riot her bowels—I paid him 2d. for the gargle, 2d. for the ointment, and 8d. for the medicine—the medicine was "Every four hours"—he showed me how to use the ointment, and about the gargle—I took her again on Friday and Saturday, June 16th and 17th—I told him on Saturday morning I had a little boy sleeping in the same room—I was rather pressed for room, and asked him if I had any<lb/>thing to fear from that—he said, "Nothing whatever,"as it was only a severe ulcerated throat, and that I was on no account to force them with food, as I had told him they could go a considerable time without food, and he said on no consideration was I to give them milk after 5 o'clock in the evening—I was to keep the girl warm—she went about the house and out—on Saturday Harry came in from play and complained of head-ache and sickness, about 2 p.m.—I took him to the prisoner on Sunday—he complained of his throat being sore—I noticed his throat was beginning to swell; it started from the glands below the ear—I took him on the Sunday evening at 10 o'clock, my husband being queer at the same time—I told the prisoner the symptoms, and asked if he could let me have something—he gave me a little bottle of drops, to be taken every two hours, also another pot of embrocation, which he told me to rub thoroughly on the outside of the throat—I paid him 1s. for the embrocation and 6d. for the drops—I think I told him the girl was a little better—I took the medicine back home and gave the boy some of the drops, as prescribed—they seemed to do him a little good; he seemed easier—I rubbed in the embrocation, as directed—the swelling took three days to go down—these are the bottles—on the Monday the boy's throat seemed worse, and I took him to the prisoner on Monday afternoon—he looked at the boy, the swelling on the neck, and in his throat—he said as the swelling was oat<lb/>side the throat he would not have such a bad throat as the little girl did; that he had a small ulcer on the left-hand side, and that he must have a bottle of medicine for his bowels—I paid him 8d. for the medicine—he told me the boy should take it every four hours, the same as the little girl—on the Tuesday the swelling seemed worse on the outside of his throat—I took him to Dr. Walker, of East Hill, Wandsworth, who looked at his throat—he advised me to keep him well nourished and warm—on Wednesday, June 21st, I took the boy to the prisoner again—he said his throat was very much better—the boy still complained about it—the swelling outside had gone down a little—on Thursday, June 22nd, the boy was up and about as well as the previous days from the Saturday—on Friday he seemed very much worse, the first thing in the morning—he was blue in the face, spitting up phlegm and thick blood, and was not well enough to get up—I kept him in bed—I went to the prisoner in consequence of his state—I told him my little boy was very much worse; I was afraid he bad caught a chill, and that he was splitting up blood, and turning blue in the face—the prisoner said, "Oh, dear me; he must have a bottle of medicine to burn his throat"—he gave me this bottle, with directions</p>

               <p>for the medicine to be taken every two hours in a tablespoonful of water—I took the medicine home, and followed the directions—he took it, but turned blue in the face, and continued to spit blood and throw up phlegm—he cried for water—each time I gave it him there was slight coughing, and after that he gradually got worse—about 2.30 p.m. he had a fit, and fell off the bed while calling for help—that was directly after I gave him his third dose of medicine—he had to fight for his breath-while doing that he fell from the bed—I then sent a neighbour, Mrs. Bright, to the prisoner—ahe came back alone—I then sent for Dr. Charlesworth, of East Hill, Wandsworth, who came between 4 and 5 p.m.—he examined the boy—the boy died that evening—the prisoner did not take the boy's temperature—he did not put a glass in his month—he did not test his water—the little girl was attended by Dr. Charles-worth from that day—she is better, but not quite well yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave evidence before the Coroner as well as before-the Magistrate—my husband complained of his kidneys and headache—the prisoner gave me a box of liver pills; my husband took them—he' is a journeyman basket-maker—he could not stop at his work—he has re<lb/>covered—the girl and the boy went to a Board school—I went to Dr. Walker's between 6 and 7 p.m.; I stayed about 20 minutes—I waited about three minutes to see him—I was not in his surgery 10 minutes—Dr. Walker examined the boy's throat—I asked him if there were-symptoms of diphtheria—he said he did not see any, and it was not ulcerated throat, but tonsilitis—I first mentioned diphtheria—I said I was-afraid it might bediphtheria—I sawthe prisoner for about 10 minutes on the-Friday, when he gave roe something to burn the boy's throat—I told him' the medicine burnt the little girl's throat, and he said that was exactly what he wanted it to do, and that I must insist upon her taking it—the children were allowed to go out and play.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians—I practise at East Hill, Wandsworth—on Tuesday, June 20th, the child Harry Baker was brought to me by the mother about 7 p.m—she told me she had taken the child to another doctor—I looked at the child's throat—she asked me to prescribe for the child—I declined to do so, thinking she had been to a qualified practitioner—as she was leaving the surgery she asked if she ought to keep the child warm, and I said, "Yes," and suggested that it should have plenty of nourishment—she asked ii there was diphtheria—I told her I could see no diph<lb/>theric membrane—if I had been attending the case, there was sufficient</p>

               <p>in the constitution of the child to make me suspicious of diphtheria, which requires careful watching to see whether it develops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the mother the child was suffering from ton<lb/>silitis—I did not treat the case—I did not volunteer advice—the mother paid me a fee—I saw signs of follicular tonsilitis—there was an exudation of matter, and a secretion of follicles at the root of the tongae—I would not call it ulcerated—there was inflammation—the parts around the tongue looked red and angry, necessarily—the child appeared very feeble, and diptheria might possiblyset up in two days, which might increase till the result was fatal—it is very difficult to say whether there is a hard and fast rule among medical men for the treatment of diphtheria—the latest recog<lb/>nised treatment is the anti<lb/>to serum treatment—one old way was with the diphtheria kettle, with the long spout—patients die even after proper treatment; and it does not follow that, even with the greatest medical attention and skill, the disease can be cured—the cure does not depend upon the size of the larynx—there is difficulty in diagnosing and distinguishing diphtheria from tonsilitis—albumen la the urine is not an absolute test—unless there are other symptoms present, it would not necessarily direct my attention to diphtheria—the presence of albumen in<lb/>the urine would make me more suspicious of diphtherift—if I had seen signs of diphtheria I would have told the mother—I told her to continue the treatment—the distinguishing characteristics of tonsilitia and foli<lb/>cular diphtheria is a question of degree—in tonsllitia the feebleness may not be so marked as in incipient diphtheria; it depends upon the condi<lb/>tion of the child—you would not expect so healthy a child of people living in two rooms—this child appeared 'well nourished, but feeble—its feeble<lb/>ness and the condition of its throat were symptoms which made me suspicious of diphtheria—the symptoms were consistent with tonsillitis—the symptoms are undistinguishabie at an early stage between tonsilitia and incipient diphtheria, or on the first day from scarlet fever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In a case likely to develop into diphtheria there are-obvious precautions a medical man would take, such as putting the-patient to bed and nourishing the child—the child should be coaxed to take plenty of nourishment, and the symptoms should have been watched from day to day, to see how the disease developed—the diphtheretic membrane may appear in a few hours or in two days, or even longer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. (Brussels), a licentiate of the College of Physicians, and practise at East Hill—on June 23rd I was sent for, and went to see tho deceased boy at 4.45 p.m. I examined his throat; there was a large patch of diphtheretlc membrane covering the tonsils—there was also a patch of membrance on the pharynx,. and the child was obviously suffering from diphtheria—there were obvious signs that the disease had extended to the larynx—there was great difficulty of breathing—the boy was blue in the face, and there waa a complete loss of voice—the boy was dying—a person of skill would wateh such a case—the urine should have been tested 'i there was any doubt about the case—I know albumen was present when I examined it on the Friday—I afterwards, by order of the Coroner, made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found that the child died from asphyxia caused by diphtheria extending</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189907240060"/>
               <p>from the pharynx to the larynx—I am absolutely certain that in this case the disease had cominenced in the pharynx, and extended to the larynx—the pharynx leads to the lungs; thechild was quite healthy in other respects—the membrane which I saw on the Friday could not have started on the tonsils and spread to the larynx between the Wednesday and the Friday—in a case like this it would be improper to tell the mother not to force food on the child—the proper treatment would be to give very nourishing, light things, like beef-tea, and, if there is any sign of heart failure, stimulants—it would he very improper to let a patient be up and about in such a case; the patient should be put to bed—there is always heart failure in diph<lb/>theria, and it is important to keep the heart as full as possible—the absence of nourishing food would be against the recovery of the patient—I saw a bottle of medicine, marked C(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in the house—I tested it—it is the medicine given to the child under the direction of the prisoner on the Friday—when I tested it I found it was very hot, and I think it was capsicum, which is made from cayenne pepper—it would not be a proper medicine to give under such circumstances—it would act as a local irritant, which would increase the danger of suffocation—on the same evening, Friday, I saw the girl Rose—she had still marked diph<lb/>theria—the membrane was still visible on both tonsils and on the palate—she was kept in bed for two weeks after I saw her—she is re<lb/>covering now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I refused to give a certificate after I heard the prisoner was attending the deceased boy—I had not heard of the prisoner before—I think the patch of exudation was the commencement of the diphtheretic membrane—if I had seen that I should have kept the case under observation—incipient diphtheria and tonsilitis go step by step up to a certain point, when they diverge—if I had seen the patch of dis<lb/>charge, that would have made me more suspicious of diphtheria than tonsilitis—it would not be possible to increase the circulation in the diseased parts—it is very difficult to analyse vegetable substances—it was wrong to say, "Do not force the child to eat," but it should have been coaxed; you can always overcome a child by coaxing; it is very im<lb/>portant that the child should have nourishment—Rose is now suffering? from diphtheretic paralysis—it is local; it is confined to the soft palate and the pharynx—I have talked about this case to Dr. Walker, he is a neighbour of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I refused to give a certificate because the child had not been attended by a medical man—the law requires the certificate to be given by the medical man who has been in attendance—I agree with Dr. Walker when he says that he saw quite enough on the Tuesday to make him suspicious that this might be a case of diphtheria—the testing of the urine is a very important thing—it is a very important thing that milk should be the staple diet—I have no idea what the prisoner meant by saying the child was to have no milk after 5 o'clock.</p>

On July 12th I went to the prisoner's shop, 6, Ferrier Street, and purchased one bottle of embrocation and one bottle of spasmodic drops—I labelled them "D" and "C," and my initials—I afterwards gave them to Dr. Luff"—I also got four pamphlets from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> He was not practising as a medical botanist for 25 years; he was studying—I have only known of his practising on one child; that was 12 or 18 months ago—my inqniries show, as far as I can find oat, that he has only practised since the beginning of this year.</p>

                  </hi>. and F.R.O.P. I am physician to St. Mary's Hospital, lecturer of medical jurisprudence, and one of the official analysts at the Home Office—I have seen and examined the bottles of embrocation and the bottle of drops given to Mrs. Baker, and also the bottles of stuff bought by the inspector—the bottles containing what are called spasmodic drops contain capsicum; the principal ingredients in the embrocation is camphor—the phamphlet says that the embrocation gives immediate relief among other things, in diphtheria, weak lungs and mumps—in my opinion, it would not be the slightest use; in my opinion, it would do decided hum in a case of diphtheria—in a case where the patient showed an enlarge<lb/>ment or swelling of the neck, with a sore throat, the rubbing in of the embrocation would do harm, because it would irritate the inflamed and tender glands—one never dreams of rubbing tender glands—it is obviously wrong treatment—friction is wrong; it would aggravate the ease, and increase the swelling of the glands—the drops, in my opinion, would be most harmful in a case of tonsilitis, because capsicum is a very powerful irritant—it is not a matter of opinion—the child choked each time the medicine was administered, the result of the irritation—it would increase the spread of the membrance—in my opinion, it would certainly accelerate the death of a child which was suffering from diphtheria—I can only regard the statement that the swallowing of a few drops would relieve fits and coughs as ridiculous; it would not relieve chronic asthma, bronchitis, lockjaw, or whooping cough—the child was first prescribed for without being seen by the prisoner, although the mother informed him that the child was sneering from a bad throat, and although he knew that the child's sister had had a bad sore throat—the administration of capsicum was entirely wrong; the whole treatment was entirely wrong—I think that to say the child should have something to burn its throat shows gross ignorance—it was quite wrong to allow the boy to sleep with his sister—diphtheria can undoubtedly be caught from persons, especially if children sleep in a bed together—I am perfectly certain that the membrane could not have de<lb/>veloped betweenthe Wednesday and the Friday—it would not be proper, to increase the circulation in a case of inflammation like this—you want to reduce the inflammation—the application of ice or cold spray would be much better—having heard the pointe of the case, I think, undoubtedly, proper treatment by a person of any skill would have prolonged the life of the child, and, I think, probably saved it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found no mineral in these bottles—soap liniment is absolutely useless to be applied outside in diphtheria—myrrh would not counteract the effects of capsicum; it is opposed to capsicum—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189907240062"/>
               <p>is not an irritant; it is a very slight antiseptic—doctors have several remedies for diphtheria—capsicum is seldom administered, but it is given for spasms and colic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If there was myrrh in the embrocation, it would not be the slightest use when rubbed in or taken internally; it is too weak an antiseptic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his defence, said that when he saw the child there were no signs of diphtheria; that there was no membrane; that there was an ulcer in the boy's throat; that on the Wednesday his throat was in a perfectly healthy condition and that he took his temperature by feeling his pulse.</hi>

It is absolutely impossible to take a persons-temperature by feeling their pulse—it is impossible that the throat could have been in a healthy condition on the Wednesday, and the child to die on the Friday.</p>
               <p>
