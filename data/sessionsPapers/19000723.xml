I am a messenger in the Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of proceedings in the bankruptcy of Jacob Greenberg and Abraham Attelson, trading as Greenberg &amp; Attelson, timber merchants, of 115, Bethnal Green Road—the petitioning creditor's petition is dated August 30th, 1899, the receiving order September 22nd, the adjudication October 6th, and the appointment of Mr. Bourner as trustee October 9th—from the statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt there is a deficiency of £1,197 13s. 10d., the liabilities are £2,079 6s. 4d., the assets £881 12s. 6d.—there is an original and amended statement—the name of Weinig appears among the contingent and other liabilities of the separate estate of Attelson—Weinig's address is Maplin Street, Mile End—he is described as a waiter and the amount as £25 for attendances at King's Hall on June 20th, 1899—on the file is an order of Mr. Justice Wright of May 8th, 1900, upon an application on the part of the trustee against Isaac Griew—the defendants were publicly examined on Novem<lb/>ber 9th and other days—this is a transcript of the evidence which is on the file.

                  </hi>. I have been connected with the firm of Leary &amp; Co., timber merchants, for some years, including Christmas, 1899—they first did business with the defendants in March, 1898—up to June, 1899, the transactions were payments within a month, under discount—on June 2nd I saw Greenberg at the defendants' office—he offered to purchase about a car-load of oak which I wanted to sell—that is about 10,000 to 12,000 ft. superficial—I reported to my principals, and they agreed to supply—on July 24th the delivery order was sent, and this invoice—the amount is £117 13s. 10d.—the terms were the same as before, but we could not enforce them, the discount being 2 1/2 per cent. for cash in a month—after the timber was sent I saw Mr. Greenberg, who said he had seen Mr. Leary, and asked him for the return of the delivery order, and Mr. Leary handed it to him—I went to the meeting of creditors at Masons' Hall Tavern on August 15th, to represent Leary &amp; Co.—a com<lb/>position of 7s. 6d. in the £ was proposed, and ultimately I agreed to 10s. in the £, provided it was secure—no payment has been made of this account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in constant touch with the defendants—we had very few dealings—I found them straightforward—everything up to the last account was paid promptly—this was part of a special cargo of oak—the payment for this timber became due on August 24th—they offered it back—I refused to take it—our dealings amounted to £390 8s. 1d.—the profit they sold it at was at about one-eighth of a penny—it was sold for £139—it is not a good profit, to my mind—there was £22 profit on the transaction—I should call that a good profit.</p>

Attelson, £100"—the total amount shown by the account to have been lodged in the bank, is £8,069, and the payments out were £8,483.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant—I was appointed trustee in the defendants' bankruptcy on October 9th, 1899—I was present at their public examination on November 9th—I then saw for the first time the receipt for £175—it was handed me by Attelson—it is dated August 31st, 1899—I wrote to Weinig immediately at the address given in the statement of affairs, Maplin Road—the letter was returned to me—I wrote again, and that letter was returned—I first found Weinig when he was served by an officer for examination under Sec. 27—this account(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) shows total receipts in cash £7,852 1s. 6d.—there are also receipts which came from the bank—the cash account shows that they paid £7,857 8s. 9d., which includes cheques drawn in their favour—the amount drawn from the bank and paid away totals £15,809; that is, cheques drawn to pay creditors—the amount paid into the bank and the amount paid in cash total £16,533 16s. 7d., or £526 8s. 3d. more than they had received—the payments out include the amounts they drew themselves—the accounts show £6 a week drawn by each of them—at the end of the account is an item of £1,415, which purports to be in respect of cheques drawn by themselves—this entry is accounted for in the receipts—it is by putting that entry in that they arrive at the over payments—that was in addition to the £6 a week each—this accounts for the sum which they say they paid out in excess of what they received—there are also entries relating to bills amounting to £175, which are wrongly entered—the effect of these entries being wrongly made renders their account deficient £845 13s. 8d.—in the day book there is an entry dated August 28th, 1899, of the sale of timber to Isaac Griew—that gives the figures of the measurement of the wood, and £139 6s. 9d. as the price—I produce the cheque from Griew; it is for £135 17s. 2d.—that is loss 2 1/2 per cent. discount—it is dated August 21st, and drawn by Griew on the London and South Western Bank, Shore-ditch, and endorsed "Greenberg &amp; Attelson"—they did not keep a proper cash book—there was nothing in their books to show what became of cheques and money represented by cheques—cheques were cashed over the counter, and money taken by Attelson—I found an entry showing what became of the walnut obtained from Mr. Moss—there is an entry on July 31st, £190 18s. 8d., and by the day book it appears to be walnut—they did not keep a ledger account for Mr. Moss.</p>

               <p>address is entered as Caplin Street, but the C is altered to M—I did not look in the directory to verify it—Weinig handed his card to me at the examination, but I lost it—I sent the second letter to Maplin Street after that—I do not now know the correct address—in the first instance I got the address from the statement of affairs where Weinig appears as a creditor—I should say that Weinig was found at the address on the card, which was 29, Maidman Street—the address given as Weinig's in the statement of affairs of Attelson's separate estate is not in the writing of either bankrupt—I think it is in their clerk's writing—I examined Weinig before the Registrar—I cannot say that I asked him as to this £175, but he was asked as to the whole transaction—Leary's timber was bought for £117 on June 2nd—it was sold on August 28th for cash £139—I say that this was not disposing of the wood in the ordinary way of trade, as it was sold to a man who did not deal in walnut—the money was received by Attelson, who did not pay it to the firm's account—the timber bought from Mr. Moss for £180 was disposed of in the way of trade, but was sold to Mr. Griew, and supposed to be paid for by a contra account—the bankrupts' ledger shows a purchase of timber by Mr. Griew on November 29th, 1898, to the amount of £250 1s. 11d.—there is also an entry in the book to show that he had paid to the bankrupt £60, and another of £50, with no date; another cheque, £41 6s., no date; another £40, no date—these together total £191 6s.—they are all entered before December 2nd—I cannot say that there is any entry except the item of £250 for mahogany for which those smaller sums could have been in pay<lb/>ment—the account is balanced just above those entries—the debtors stated that they had drawn to this extent from Mr. Griew as against this. mahogany which they had sold to him—I then find there is an entry as to mahogany returned—there is no date to that—it is between an entry of December 29th and one of April 14th, 1899—it appears from the account that on July 31st, when this walnut of Moss's was handed to Griew, that these people were owing him considerably more than £1981, but the entries in the books are of such a nature that I cannot say they are correct—the entry of the disposal of the timber to Mr. Griew for £74 6s. is perfectly accurate—up to the entry of May 25th last I have nothing to say—the entry in respect of the item £136 10s. is, I believe, correct, and represents the actual transaction between these people and Griew—the entry as to the £190 18s. 8d. for the sale of Moss's walnut to Griew is correct according to the day book—it is not properly placed in the account—it ought to be put before August 28th—with reference to the entry £34 3s. 3d., I believe that this is correct according to the books—if the four items on the other side of the account, amounting to £191 6s., were paid by Griew to these people, they are properly entered, subject to the want of dates, but I doubt if they were paid—without dates I cannot trace them—I admit the item for £7 5s. 3d., entered on December 2nd—I cannot trace the item on December 29th for £30; it is correctly entered there if it was paid—I have not been able to trace the next cheque for £50—the five bills for £140 15s. 8d., entered on April 14th, have not been paid—Mr. Griew has not met them—the next item, £16 19s. 2d., has not been paid—with reference to the item £74 6s., if the timber had been sold to Mr. Griew the entry would be correct but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190007230015"/>
               <p>misleading—it was apparently an entry between Griew on contra accounts; not with the firm, but with Attelson privately—the item for £139 6s., Leary's mahogany, is not right—they did not get that amount, but £139 16s. 2d.—the cash and discount should have been entered in two separate items—if these transactions took place with Griew, they were properly entered, but I do not think they did—I cannot trace them through any of the books—I have traced them in the cash accounts filed by the debtors, but the cash account is made up from the ledger, but they ought first to appear in the cash book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The entry in the ledger as to item £190 18s. 8d. for Moss's wood, dated July 31st, appears here after an entry of August 28th, £139 6s. 10d., which is in respect of a sale of Leary's wood—if that was a genuine entry, I should not expect it to appear a month late—the reason I give for saying that the disposal of Leary's wood was out of the ordi<lb/>nary way of trading is, that at a meeting of their creditors, on August 15th, the debtors had produced a statement showing that they were insolvent; the property was not theirs to deal with—I pointed out to them that on August 22nd, when I made an investigation of their books, the creditors would wind up the estate in bankruptcy, and that they must not deal with any property in any way whatever—I told both of the debtors that—I had included Leary's wood among the assets—I was then at the docks—they told me that if the composition was accepted they would sell their assets to pay it—I did not report in favour of the composition—I wrote the second letter to Weinig on November 29th—the examination was on December 7th.</p>

I am the partner of Mr. Friedberg as wholesale manufacturing furriers—we have a warehouse at 4, Golden Lane—on leaving on June 2nd the place was properly locked up—on returning the following Tuesday I found doors had been forced and stock taken from the stock-room, value about £2,600—the best furs had been selected, which would require experience—I had a communication sent to the police—in consequence of what they said I gave instructions to my brother Isaac—I went to Molinski's house on the Tuesday, Wed<lb/>nesday and Thursday—I heard something on June 20th or 22nd, and went with Sergeant Bacon to Blackburn on Friday, June 22nd, and saw Mr. Worswick, a draper, there with Bacon and the Superintendent of Police at Blackburn—the interview was not satisfactory, and I saw him the fol<lb/>lowing Monday, June 25th—I called a second time on the Saturday after<lb/>noon, and picked out one sable necklet and five solitaires as my property—I was with Bacon and the Superintendent—during the conversation Bacon went out and got a search warrant—then Worswick produced other furs—I identified the 30 single and 10 double furs produced—their cost price is about £144—I should want £170 for them from a shopkeeper, wholesale—my brother Isaac stores a bag or two of pieces at my ware<lb/>house—he was there on June 2nd—I saw him from about 10.30 till he went out to lunch, and afterwards till 1.50, when the warehouse was closed.</p>

On June 22nd I served a notice on the prisoner, informing him that the deceased's deposition was going to be taken at the hospital—(<hi rend="italic">Deposition: Read:</hi> "I am the wife of William Irwin; I have been living at Great Titchfield Street, at Peter Robinson's, not with my husband; I was going to my work at Peter Robinson's this morning, when my husband came up to me and asked me to speak to him; I told him I had no time; he said 'Take that, then.' He stabbed me; he struck me with a knife. I saw the knife; I ran away and fell down. I remember being taken to the hospital. We have quarrelled about money; I could not keep him; he had asked me for money. I have been living apart from my husband since twelve months last October. Last night my husband said I had driven the last nail into my coffin; I left him then. It was in Titchfield Street I left him. I met him by surprise this morning; I did not expect him. He has often assaulted me before. I have never charged him or summoned him for assaulting me. I never knew that I was going to meet him. He has waylaid me about four times a week. He has never done any work. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My quarrel was not exactly on account of my going out with another man; I have done so; a friend of my hus<lb/>band's, but there was nothing wrong; I have known him about two years and a-half.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 80, Colworth Road, Leytonstone, and am valuing inspector to the East London Water Company—I know the defen<lb/>dant and I have seen him write—we received this application from him about December 5th, 1898: "Gentlemen, I request you will supply me with water for erecting four houses at Preston Road, Wallwood Park, Leyton<lb/>stone, to contain seven rooms, and I hereby consent to such supply being cut off in case the water should be wasted," etc.—the supply was granted at a charge of £1 8s. 6d.—about March 21st, this further application was received from the defendant for eight more houses in Preston Road, which supply was also granted and paid for at the same rate—on May 23rd he paid for a supply to twelve more houses in Preston Road, to come from the same source as the last, for which he paid £3, being a total of £6 13s.—that is all he has ever paid for a building supply to the estate—in June, 1899, there was an increase of charge made for water for building purposes, when it was charged on a different system according to the size of the houses—on September 9th this application (E) was received for eleven more houses, enclosing a cheque for £2 15s.—he stated that it was to re-connect an old building supply—the cheque being on the old basis of charge was returned, and he sent in exhibit (F) giving the dimensions of eleven houses he proposed to build in Popple<lb/>ton Road—this is the letter(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—the charge, under the new system, amounted to £14 11s. 2d.—the supply was not taken up or the money paid—about March 14th there was another application by the defendant</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190007230057"/>
               <p>in respect of seventeen houses in the Dyson Road—this was reduced to twelve houses; six to build, and six to plaster only—the price worked out at £11 10s.—it was not taken up—on April 25th the defendant called on me at my private house between 5.30 and 6—he said, "Your foreman has found a pipe running into my well; this pipe I had for drinking purposes for my men; as the water has been running into the well I will pay anything"—I said that I could not deal with the matter, and referred him to the people at Lea Bridge, the superintendent engineer, to which he replied, "Oh, very well; I would not have had this happen for anything"—the company received this letter of April 26th from the defendant (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—the com<lb/>pany replied on April 30th, stating that the matter would come before the court of directors—on May 1st the defendant wrote: "Dear Sir,—I regret that you are unable to give me an interview," etc.—on May 4th there is a letter from the general superintendent, stating that the whole of the correspondence and the report of the case were in the hands of the solicitors of the company—on June 15th the defendant applied to the company for a building supply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The second building supply to the back of 32, Preston Road, was converted into a domestic supply on March 9th, 1900—I cannot say if the houses were then finished—no building supply was paid for after then—I have known the estate for some years before it was laid out for building—there was a lake, on the site of which some of the houses in Preston Road are built—it was about 200 ft. by 40ft; we had a punt on it—when I saw Holland on April 25th I had not heard from Shearman—it is a constant supply, and cisterns as well—when Holland called on me he did not say he had dug up an old building supply—I jotted down what he said on a piece of blotting paper—it seemed so, strange—I heard him state before the Magistrate that he had said so, but it was not correct—it might be possible for him to say such a thing without my jotting it down—I have known Holland over 15 years as a highly respectable man, a builder in good business—he has a great many houses, but I do not know enough of him to say what his rents amount to—he has been in the neighbourhood many years, and his father and brother, too.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe he is well known, and takes an active part in local matters, though not in public matters—he was the only builder on that land coloured green on the plan—in getting a building supply, the houses for which the supply is asked are stated—the first he got was for Nos. 2, 4, 6 and 8, Preston Road—it would not be possible for him to find an old building supply at the back of No. 8, Preston Road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am district foreman to the East London Water Company, and know the district in question well—tht buildings first erected were small houses in Preston Road—a supply was granted on three different occasions for houses in that road, first for four houses, then eight, then 12—no other supply was taken up by Holland for Preston Road—the Poppleton Road supply, which had been used for the first four houses, was eventually cut off—the second supply was at the back of No. 32, and that payment was for a domestic supply—the main runs down Poppleton Road, and connects the three, houses, shown in</p>

               <p>Poppleton Road and Preston Road, but it was cut off—in September, 1899, Holland drew my attention to a hole at the back of No. 2, Preston Road—he said he was digging a hole there to collect the surface water, because the company's charges were too heavy for a building supply—I have not measured the well, but should say it was 4ft. by 4ft., and 8ft. deep; it might be more, and was boarded by planks—the first time I saw it it was empty—in a fortnight or a month's time when I passed it was about full, say 2ft. from the top—at that time Holland commenced building in Poppleton Road—in the latter end of De<lb/>cember or the beginning of January, I noticed water trickling across the gardens of Nos. 2, 4, and 6, which did not appear to be surface water—all through October and on to April Holland went on building in Poppleton Road and in Dyson Road—I knew he had had no building supply, except for houses in Preston Road—on April 25th, about 11 a.m., I noticed when passing over the land, there was at the rear of No. 8, a small hole about 2ft. long and 1ft. deep, with a bag across it, and I saw water trickling over the bag—I lifted the bag from it, and saw water boiling up—I saw nothing but water in the first instance, but I immediately pulled up my coat sleeve and put my hand in, and in doing so I found a lead pipe coiled round in the hole—there was about 9 in. to 12 in. of water there—I lifted it up and discovered water coming from the end of it—I could not tell then where the pipe came from, for it ran away tinder the ground—the water was coming through the pipe into the hole—there was a small channel or grip running down to the big hole at the rear of No. 2. the place pointed out to me in September, and water was running from this grip down to the well—I could not at that time say how far below the surface the pipe was—just before my getting to the hole a man dipped a pail of water from the small hole where the sack was—the sack was not quite big enough to cover it right over—it was an ordinary pail, holding from two to three gallons—the man was working on the building, and he took it to the rear of Dyson Road, and put it into the mortar bed—Holland's building was going on in Dyson Road—I called one of the workmen, and asked to see Holland, and he came in two or three minutes from the works in Dyson Road—I asked him the meaning of this pipe, and where it was leading from—he said it was leading from No. 8, Preston Road—I showed him the water running down to the big hole, and told him he would have to come to the company's offices and see our chief Superintendent the next day—I left him and went to Dyson Road—he followed, and came up to me again after I had been attending to another gentleman on business, and asked me to give him one more chance, that he would go to the office and pay, and make it worth my while, and would give me whatever I liked to ask—I said I could not compromise the matter: it was too serious—I reported it verbally to the District Superintendent at once, and made a formal report in writing after—on the same day I sent a man named Eaton to inspect the fittings of No. 8, and to trace the pipe, if possible—except for Holland's state<lb/>ment I had no knowledge that it came from No. 8—I did not go with the man, but visited the place again on the 27th, and there was no water there or running along the channel to the big hole, neither was there any</p>

               <p>in the gardens of Nos. 2, 4, 6, and 8—the surface was dry—I saw the tenant, Mr. Brett, there on July 5th, and while speaking to him in the back garden, Mr. Holland got over the fence into the garden, and joined us—Brett explained to Holland that I was there to expose the pipe in the garden, and Holland's advice to him was as it had got to such a state it would be best to leave it, and it was left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. It was not until July that things were ripe for taking steps, and a summons was then issued against Holland—I went there again on July 13th by arrangement to examine the garden, in order to trace the pipe—I had no authority previously—we opened the garden at the corner of the lawn, at the end of the lead pipe, and we found the pipe with a garden hose attached to it, and to a pipe in the scullery, and the water flowed from it on to Holland's land—to prove the pipe was still there the garden hose was attached by means of the company's main, and it was attached to the tap by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. The pipe was not traced when I was there—there was no ground opened—the hose was attached to the pipe by the W.C. one of Holland's own—this is the joint that came from the W.C. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the length of the garden from the W.C. to the fence is about 48ft. to 50 ft., and about 12ft. to 14ft. from the other end of the fence to the small hole—on July 5th I saw some timber removed and the pipe exposed on Holland's side of the fence, by his request—I went by arrangement with the solicitors about 5 or 6 p.m.—he removed the timber at the rear of No. 8, Preston Road, and underneath it there was some lead pipe coiled up with a stop-tap on it—it was connected with a pipe running into the garden of No. 8—the tap was about 5ft. from the fence—you could turn it on and off, and then it ran to the little hole—turning it on at that distance, it would flow in the pipe, continuing under ground, to the little hole, and then run down to the little hole and through a channel into the big hole—this tap was necessary, or there would be an overflow of water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On April 25th, when I put my hand in and found the pipe, Holland said that one of the workmen had left the tap running—the end was, as it appears now, partly battered up, and water was coming from it—the water was then trickling out of the little hole—it was an ordinary pipe, and had been apparently hammered up—I found the pipe in the garden on July 13th, but on July 5th I found the screw-down tap—the matter had been in the hands of the company since April 26th—on July 5th Holland pointed out that pipe with the tap, showing that there had been connection with the main—it would have been easy to remove the whole of the pipe between April 25th and July 5th—I could not say pipes were left about the garden to July 13th—the pipe was lying under the timber—it was pointed out by Holland on July 5th and July 13th, not found; pointing out and finding is a different thing, I think—the land dopes it the corner of Preston Road and Poppleton Road in a south-westerly direction—the well is in the direction of the slope—I have been on the land two or three times a week, but I have no fixed time for going—I go round my district at different times—it might be twice in a day I should cross there: some<lb/>times, perhaps, not for a whole week—I went there on April 25th and walked by the side of the fence of No. 2, Preston Road—I saw Holland</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190007230060"/>
               <p>on the scaffold in Dyson Road—the scaffold is right in view of the little hole—I do not know Goss—I could not say it was not Gross I saw before the justices—I saw Palmer before the justices—I did not see that he was plastering in Poppleton Road—I could not identify the man who dipped the pail into the small hole; he was, perhaps, 100 yards away—I stood at the rear of the twelfth house that was then building in Dyson Road—I might have been 12 or 20 yards off from the little hole when I saw him dip the pail into it—the hole was 2ft. over by 1ft. deep, as near as I can give it you—I only had to wait a very short while for Holland to come up—I saw him coming towards me when he came off the scaffold—the man was not dipping the pail when he was coming to me—the hole was only partly covered up, so that anyone passing close to the hole would see the water at once—it had not rained heavily on April 25th to my knowledge—I have never measured the big well—it might be 13ft. deep, running down in some parts to 14ft.—I can not say—the estimate I give of it is about 8ft. by 4ft. by 4ft.—I may have seen the well 20 or 30 times when I passed the land to go to the buildings—I have never seen it empty at all to my knowledge, only in September—I cannot say that I saw it as late as June 23rd—I have not been on the land since this case stood for trial—I cannot say the latest date I saw the well at the back of No. 2—the last time I saw it was June 13th, be<lb/>ing filled up—I saw a hole at the rear of Dyson Road on June 16th, at Holland's request, when well No. 1 was shut up—when it was shut up I cannot say—there was about 1ft. of water in this bole; it was about, the same size round, but not as deep as the other—I never measured it—it was boarded round, the boards sticking out 5ft. or 6ft. above the ground—I cannot say when it was dug—the depth from the ground level was about 5ft. to 6ft.—the one shut up was at the back of No. 2—the one I saw open for the first time on June 16th was, according to the plan, at the back of No. 40 or 42, as near as I can say—I cannot say whether there is a hole at the back of No. 14, Dyson Road, with water in, not boarded in—it may have been there without my observing it, there are so many holes about this land—I cannot say that I noticed a large ballast hole at the back of Dyson Road more than in any other portion—the land has been all dug, for sand and ballast—when I found the pipe and water trickling from that opening, of course one might assume it came from the rear of Preston Road, but it is possible that it came from a number other than No. 8—a man going and finding a thing like that cannot assume, unless he traced the pipe, where it was going to—on looking at the houses round, it might be a reasonable surmise, but it was not the surmise I made at the time—I did say before the Magistrate that I examined the direction of the pipe, and it appeared to come from 8, Preston Road, but that was simply turning round after the man saying it was coining from there—it would come from whichever way the pipe was laid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was nothing to suggest to me that it was an old building supply—the pipe in the hole was under the ground, just covered, so that you could not see it until that piece was cut out—when the boards were removed it was found coiled up underneath—my district is a large one—the water trickling and the man taking a pail of water from it</p>

I am a house pointer, of 8, Rosebank Grove, Wal<lb/>thamstow—I was formerly working for Peachey, of Walthamstow, and after that I worked for Holland—I started in February, pointing houses—three men worked with me, George Simpson, Gardner, and Challis—I supplied the men—while we were working there in February, March, and April, Holland was working on the job himself constantly, and the same hours as we were—he used to be with the bricklayers—we used a considerable quantity of water, which we got out of the big hole at the back of the first house in Preston Road—it was the only water on the job—it used to come from a leaden pipe about 40ft. from the big hole, and ran down a little channel—when the hole was full it did not run—it was always full—all the men working on the place got their water from the big hole—there was a small hole where a pipe was, big enough to dip a pail in, and which was covered up by a sack—Holland told me to tell my chaps to keep it covered—if anyone wanted a pail of water and the big hole was dry, they used to dip it out of that—I used about 70 to 80 pails of water a day—I did not know where the tap was—I was working there on April 25th, when Mr. Shearman found the pipe—I saw him find the pipe, and send for Holland—he pulled up his coatsleeve and put his hand in, and found the pipe—you might see it without doing that if you dipped the water out of the little hole—three days after the water was cut off, following Mr. Shearman's visit, pipes were put in the man-hole at the corner which had to do with the sewer, connecting it with</p>

               <p>the large hole—the water lasted three days after Mr. Shearman cut it off—it did not become quite dry at the bottom—then the connection was made with the sewer—they used the sewer water as fast almost as it came in—as people put it down their sinks and used their W.C.'s it used to come into the big hole—my men complained of the objectionable character of the water; they could not stand it; it was very offensive—I complained to Holland about it, and he said it would do my men good—I left the job because I could get no chaps to work for me to finish my job up—we stayed there till June 2nd, and then all went away—I remember Mr. Mardell coming, and I told him of the hole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The opening in the man-hole was made in the night, and fluid drawn from it—I never saw a double load of chalk lime delivered on the land—the hole was opened three days after April 25th, when the water was cub off—on May 11th Mr. Mardell inspected the man-hole—I do not know Goss—(<hi rend="italic">Goss was brought into Court</hi>)—I know him—I did not see him brick up the opening in the man-hole—it was not bricked up on May 11th, the day Mr. Mardell inspected it—the fluid was flowing when I finished on June 2nd, and on June 9th it was also running in the hole—I was engaged to point the houses in Preston Road and Poppleton Road by contract—"C. Bard" in that book is my writing—I cannot tell you from that book when I was working—on June 1st I signed the book; there was 8s. 6d. short that week on one road—I asked Holland to pay it; he refused until the job was finished—I told him I could not get the men to work on account of the bad water—I did not say, "I will make it hot for you"—I was at Stratford Police-court once—I was not a witness—I communicated with the solicitors for the water company at Stratford—I told them the truth—after Mr. Mardell came I went to the Town Hall, Leytonstone, to complain of the bad water on June 9th, and I told the East London Company's officials what I have told you to-day, about the water running from the little hole to the big one, and being drawn in pails—it was after they had found it out—it was the same day as I asked Holland for money—they had found out about the pipe from the little hole to the big hole, and the water running; they did not want me to tell them that—I went at once to the Stratford Petty Sessions, and was fetched by one of the water company's officials—I had not noticed an account in the papers of the previous proceedings—everybody on the job who wanted water used it out of the hole—there was a continuous flowing of water from the little hole, where the pipe was, to the big hole, until it was full—the water ran out of the pipe, down a channel about 6 in. wide, into the hole—where the hole was it was covered up by a wet sack—people could see the water, but not the pipe—the hole smelt of sewage down to June 9th, when I went to the Town Hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When Mr. Mardell came on May 11th he smelt the plaster on the wall—I told him not to rub his nose on the wall—he said, "What's up?"—I said, "Go and look at the hole," and then he called Holland's attention to the hole—two gentlemen took a note of my evidence the day I was at Stratford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pointer, of 40, Bremner Road, Waltham<lb/>stow, and was employed by Bard between February and June this year, working on Holland's houses—my gang used between 70 and 90 pails of water a day from the big hole—the water got into the hole by a pipe running about 40ft. away from the well, down a trench about 1ft. wide and 6 in. deep—the end of the pipe was in the small hole, which was covered with a sack—there was no other water on the job—the water going into the big hole was regulated by a tap about 4ft. from the fence—Holland told me to go over against the fence and put my hand down the hole and turn the tap on—I found water in the hole—Holland was there daily working—water was also got from the small hole where the pipe was—I remember filling a bucket at the pipe, and leaving the water running—I took the bucket up on the scaffold, and Holland told me to run down and turn off the water and cover the pipe up with the sack—Shearman came up one day and found the pipe—after that the water began to smell badly—I complained of it to Bard—I left on June 2nd—the water stank so that we could not use it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not at Stratford Petty Sessions—I saw the water company's solicitors last Friday—Bard asked me to go the same day—I did not know that Holland was charged before the Magistrates till Bard came—I went to the solicitors with him—I had been working for him two or three months, and have known him about two years—I know Holland refused to pay Bard till the work was finished—anyone working on the ground could see that there were three holes with water in them—the channel was about 40 ft. long—the hole where the pipe was and the tap were covered over—I told the solicitors all I knew about this matter last Friday—I am certain that the incident of my leaving the tap running after I took a pail of water from the hole, and Holland telling me to stop it, occurred—I told that to the solicitors—they read over to me what I signed—I did not think there was anything wrong in taking the water—I mentioned it to the solicitors because they asked me—Bard and Simpson were with me, and heard me tell them—Challis came with us the next day.</p>

I am a pointer, of Walthamstow—I am now work<lb/>ing at Clapton—down to June 2nd I was on Holland's houses in the Dyson and Poppleton Roads—we want a considerable quantity of water for pointing—I was working with Bard and Gardiner, and we got our water from the large hole at the back of the houses—when I first went there the water used to run from the pipe down a little bit of trench over land into this hole, and we dipped it out with a pail—Holland was working there all the time we were—a man from the water company dis<lb/>covered the pipe—after that the water smelt so bad that I complained to Holland—he made no answer—I left the job in consequence on June 2nd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pointer's labourer, and worked at this place from February to June—I used to fetch water for the men pointing from the well, which ran from a pipe underground—some distance from the well there was a little channel between the two holes, along which the water ran into the big hole—the small hole was covered over with a sack—when the water in the big hole got low a tap was turned on to fill it again; I have done it—it would perhaps be left running half the day—all the water used for the building was taken from the big hole—Holland told me to cover up the hole when I took water—the water afterwards smelt, and I left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Water was taken from the ballast hole when the water was low in the big hole—that was after the water stunk; about a week after Shearman came—it might be more—I do not know of a double load of chalk lime being delivered there—water is used for running into putty—the well smelt for more than three days—I was there when Mar<lb/>dell came, and had the manhole opened and the brickwork made good—the well smelt of sewage after that, and up to my leaving on June 2nd—Holland would not pay Bard, and Bard said that he would make it hot for him—I had to go short through it—it did not make me hate him more—I went before the Justices with Gardiner, at Bard's request, on Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Leyton Urban District Council—my attention was drawn to this matter on May 11th, and I went to the spot marked "well" on this plan—it smelt very strongly of sewage—it was close to where the men were working—the water was, I believe, being used for running putty—I at once spoke to Holland about the man-hole, from which I was told water was running, and asked him to open it—he sent for a man, and it was opened—I found a bag of clay just inside the end of the pipe, which dammed up the water which should have run into the sewer, and it ran into a small pipe which ran back into the well—it was near the bottom of the well—the sewage was thus taken to the well—Holland said he thought somebody had sold him and given him away; that he did not think he was doing any harm—I had the bag taken out, so that the sewage could go into its proper channel—I went there frequently, and on June 9th there was another complaint—I did not notice a smell in the interval, and opened the man-hole again—I saw it on May 12th—on June 9th there was 6 in. of fluid in the well—I had some drawn out—it was rather thick, but it did not smell of sewage.</p>

               <p>Walthamstow—on Wednesday afternoon, June 27th, I met the prisoner in Wood Street—she spoke about her home—I said I was sorry—I had a pint of ale in my jug, and we had a drink together—I took her home with her little girl, after buying 2d. worth of greens, as she said she had nothing to put them in—she played my piano, and stayed a good hour—I asked her several times to go—she left between 5.30 and 6 p.m.—I went out, having locked my house up, for a few minutes—when I returned I found the glass of the door broken, so that I could put my hand to the latch—in the house all the grass was thrown from the vases, and my large clock was taken off the mantelpiece—I also lost a cape belonging to my daughter—it was hanging on a nail in the parlour near the clock—I ran out for the police, when a constable came—I afterwards identified the prisoner at the Police-station—I had given her an old skirt, and upstairs was a pair of old trousers which I had promised her in the morning.</p>

I am an oil merchant—on Friday after<lb/>noon, June 8th, I was at Anerley Station, waiting for the 3.8 up train, and saw a baby lying on the platform, and then I saw the prisoner and a woman struggling on the line—the train was in sight—I tried to call the engine-driver's attention—I saw the prisoner deliberately pick the woman up and lay her head across the outer metal—they ware struggling in the 4-ft. way—the prisoner then turned himself to the 6-ft. way—he held her down on the line, and before I could get assistance the engine was upon her; the rail or the guard-rail, I cannot say which, came and thrust her over—I heard her scream, and saw her struggle—a porter picked her up and put her on the platform, and I saw that her arm was crushed.</p>

I am manager to Henry Woodwell, of the Stirling Castle public-house, Camberwell—on April 15th I advertised for a bar<lb/>man, and received several answers, and amongst them Walker called—he gave his address, Bird-in-bush Road, Peck ham—he said he had been nine months with Mr. Miller, of the Black Bull, High Street, Borough, and had left about six days; that previously he had been living at the Rail<lb/>way Tavern, Hornsey, for 18 months—I went to the Black Bull the same evening about 6, and saw Miller, the landlord—I told him I had come after the character of Walker—he said he knew his business, and he could not speak too highly of him as a good, honest, and sober man—I asked him if he knew where he was living before—he said, "The Rail<lb/>way Tavern, Hornsey," and that he had a good reference from there with him for 18 months—I went back, and Walker called the same evening—I told him his reference was all right, and he came in to work the next day—he was with me 16 days, and the takings fell off not less than £16—my suspicions were aroused by the quantity of coppers we got rid of in giving change—there were two men I did not like the look of, and I told Walker not to serve them any more—I told them to clear out—two minutes afterwards Walker paid, "I am going too, governor," and he went—I should not have taken him without a reference.</p>

               <p>been a heavy drinker for a long time; that he had formerly kept a public-house, but had been obliged to give it up on account of her drinking, but since that time she had continued to drink; but recently she had been very good, meaning that she had kept sober; but on the Saturday afternoon he had come home and found her drunk, and the sight so maddened him that he had beaten her with a stick, but in his passion he had forgotten himself and had done more than he meant to do; that he very much regretted what he had done, and that, if she recovered, he would never lay his finger on her again—I attended to her until she died—she was suffering from symptoms which I put down to drinking habits—there was frequent vomiting, which con<lb/>tinued for several days—there was great enlargement of the liver—she also developed symptoms of pericarditis, which is frequently induced by drinking—I last saw her alive between 12 and 1 on June 9th—I was present on June 10th at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—Dr. Kempster was present part of the time—Dr. Whitehead conducted it—we found evidence of injury to her head—in my opinion she died from syncope, which was caused principally by the disordered condition of the liver, and pericarditis—she had hardly a healthy organ in her body—the kidneys were diseased—I do not think the violence had much to do with her death.</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the police—on June 9th I was called by them to 72, Beaufoy Road, and there saw the body of Ella Newton at 10.5 p.m., five hours after death—on the 10th I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination nearly all the time—I saw no signs of pericarditis—there was an absence of lymph—the beating she had received doubtless accelerated her death—the illness, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the beating, doubtless killed her—there was nothing in the disease from which she was suffering which would account for her death.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I practise at Wimpole Street—at the re<lb/>quest of the Secretary to the Treasury, and of the Coroner, I made a second examination of the body of the deceased on June 17th, in pre<lb/>sence of the other doctors—in my opinion she died from syncope, which was due to the diseased condition of the liver and kidneys, the result of chronic alcoholism, and, secondly, from the very serious injuries which she had received—I do not think there is a shadow of doubt that the injuries accelerated her death—I will not say that they were the only cause of death—there were two bones broken in one arm, but caused by two separate blows—there were large bruises and coagulated blood over each fracture—the body was covered with marks—the statement that there were no marks on the front of the body is not true—if the marks I saw were caused by the beating, they would certainly be there on the Monday.</p>
