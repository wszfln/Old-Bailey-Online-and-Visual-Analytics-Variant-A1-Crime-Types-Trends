               <p>Mr. Waldron. On the 30th of October last, I intended to go to Court, and therefore I asked the Prisoner (who was my <rs id="t17381206-2-deflabel9" type="occupation">Servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17381206-2-defend33 t17381206-2-deflabel9"/>) for a particular Shirt? He told me 'twas above Stairs, and accordingly he went up into my Bed chamber, and after he had taken the Goods, he went quite away, and never came into my Service any more. I lost a Gold Watch, and a Steel Seal which hung upon a Hook, at my Bed's Head, and two Diamond Rings; ten Holland Shirts, a Hanger with a Horn Handle, a Cloth Coat double buttoned, with Gold Buttons, a Dimity Waistcoat, a Pair of Breeches, and a Pair of Shoes. I advertised the Goods, and the Advertisement came out the next Day with a Reward of ten Guineas, to any who would inform me of them. On the Sunday following, the Prisoner came to the Green Dragon Ale-house in Church-Court, where he was stopped with some of my Goods upon him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060003"/> about two Hours after he was taken, I saw him at Justice Frazier's, and he fell down upon his Knees, and begged Mercy. He had delivered the Rings to Mr. Frazier before I came, and had confessed they were not his own, but he insisted on it, that he was entrusted with them, though I never intrusted him with them at all. He deny'd his Knowledge of the Watch; but that was brought to me (after the Advertisement came out) by one Smithson, who told me he bought it (the same Day I was robbed) at an Alehouse in Aldermanbury. This Smithson is a Broker in Holbourn. When he was before Mr. Frazier, I asked him, how he came by these Things? He said, they were delivered to him in Trust, without mentioning by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking the rest of the Goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Waldron. Yes, and he had two Shirts on his Back, which he acknowledged were mine, and pulled them off, and delivered them to the Constable. The Waistcoat and Breeches, I believe, he has upon him at this Time; I know he had them on Yesterday. He told me; that three of the Shirts were at the Pawnbrokers, and directed me to them. The Hanger likewise was found upon him, but it was taken from him at the Alehouse before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been with you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Waldron. He came to me on the 18th of Sept. last, and robbed me on the 30th of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask Mr. Waldron, whether he did not intrust me with these Things?</p>
               <p>Mr. Waldron. No; not with the Watch nor Rings. He took in my Linnen from the Washerwoman, and when I called for any of it, he brought it me. He had a Key of the Place where it was kept, and I had a Key, that I might look over it, at any Time. He was so far from being entrusted with any Thing else, that when I went down into Devonshire, I put all my Jewels, my Watch, Rings, and Snuff Box, into Mr. Murray's Custody, who is the Master of the House where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Frazier. The Prisoner was brought to my House the 9th of November last. I ordered him to be searched; and after some Difficulty, there two Rings, and this Seal were found in one of his Breeches Pockets, before Mr. Waldron came. The Prisoner told me, he had no Property in them, and that I might keep them if I pleased. When Mr. Waldron came, he owned them, and swore they were the same he lost. They have been in my Custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Waldron. This Seal hung to my Watch: these Rings are likewise mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frazier. When I ask'd him how he came by these Things, he hesitated and paus'd, and would give no Account: but, says he, I have no Property in them; if you please, you may take them yourself. He owned they were his Master's, before Mr. Waldron, and to the best of my Remembrance he told me, he was not obliged to make any Confession.</p>

            . So I sent my Daughter up Stairs to look over the Goods, and she found four Shirts, which the Prisoner had pawned, at different Times, in the same Name. These are the four Shirts, which I carry'd to Mr. Waldron, and he owned them directly. He pawned them for six Shillings a-piece, and they have been till now, in my Custody.</p>

            . I bought an Olive-colour'd Coat, and an old red Coat of the Prisoner, on the 31 st of October. The red Coat, it seems, was his own.

The red Coat was old, the other was but an indifferent Cloth, and had an old Lining in it; the Gold Buttons were papered over. I paid him 25 s. for them. I went afterwards to see him in the Gatehouse; and asked him if he did not know me? He said he could not call me to Mind, - but he shook his Head, and had the Breeches belonging to the Coat upon him at that time.</p>

            , Constable. On Sunday Night, about a Month ago, I was sent for to the Green Dragon, to take a Man who had robb'd his Master. I went, but the Prisoner was taken in Custody, before I got there. I searched his Pocket slightly for Weapons, but found none. He was searched again, before Mr. Frazier; and I took two Diamond Rings out of his Pocket. He had two of Mr. Waldron's Shirts upon his Back, which he pulled off; then he pulled his own Shirt out of his Pocket, and put it on.</p>

While we were talking, I am sure I felt one of their Hands in my Breeches Pocket, and I believe it was Garden's Hand, because she was nearest me: Bates was not near enough me to do it. I said nothing about it then, but clapp'd my Hand to my Pocket, to know if they had been there; upon which they immediately walk'd off, and I miss'd a Guinea and a Portugal Piece, of 36 Shillings. I had the Money, I am sure, an Hour before, when I came from my Master's House in Bow-Lane, and I had been in no Company. Upon missing my Money, I follow'd

She told me I was mistaken; and that she had no other Woman in her Company that Night. Very well, says I, pray how long have you been here? A great while, she said; but the Landlord told me she was but just come in, and had given him a Guinea to change: I saw it, and believed 'twas mine; 'tis now in the Hands of the Landlord, and is very pale and very full-headed. I can swear it was mine, but I could hear nothing of the Portugal Piece: I had taken the Guinea but a little before, of a Servant in our House, and had disputed whether 'twas a good one. I think it was not possible for Bates to have pick'd my Pocket, because Gordon stood before me, and Bates stood on one Side of us. I never saw either of them before, but I am sure they are the Persons.</p>

The Man on my Side the Chaise took about three or four Shillings from me; and ask'd me for my Watch: I told him I had none, but he felt for it, and pull'd it out. Among the Money they took a little Key which belong'd to a Dog's Collar.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken from Mr. Smalt?</p>
               <p>Evans. About seven Shillings and some odd Money. After they had robb'd us, they went over the Fields behind a Haycock, towards Cranbury-House. When I got Home, I talk'd of the Robbery - all the Parish knew of it the next Day; and in about a Week on nine Days, I heard of the Prisoner by some Gentlemen, who make it their Business to take these People. They told me, that Rigby's Father lived in Shoreditch, or somewhere about Morefields, and kept a Garden. I know nothing of the Prisoners, but by their Stature and Size they should be the Men; and Rigby's Father sent once to me; and after that, he came to my House, to make up this Matter; he begg'd I would be merciful to his Son, and that I would not hang him. I told him, I could not hang him, if the Law did not. This was about a Fortnight after the Robbery; and when I had a Warrant out against him. I can't say he offer'd me any Money, but he talk'd about my having my Watch again. He would have agreed to any thing if I would have made it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to give you your Watch again?</p>
               <p>Evans. I can't say he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about your Watch?</p>
               <p>Evans. No, Sir, but there was a Sort of a Talk about it, and if I would do so and so, he would do so and so.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he propose to you?</p>
               <p>Evans. Nothing, nothing at all; but he came with a Design (if he could have agreed with me) to let me have had my Watch again, and to have satisfy'd me with what they thought proper; but because we could not agree, we had no more Words about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want you to agree to?</p>
               <p>Evans. I heard nothing about that; yet I don't know but he would have given me my Watch, and something beside, if I would have agreed with him. I was with him once about it at Shoreditch: The first time we talk'd about it, was when somebody sent for me to Shoreditch; so Mr. Smalt and I went thither together, and then we told them, we could do nothing at all in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the Prisoners since they were taken up?</p>
               <p>Evans. Yes; I saw them in New Prison, and went with them before the Justice, where I told Rigby that I believed he was the Man who put his Hand into my Fob, and pull'd out my Watch. He said he was not the Man who robb'd me, but own'd the Watch was given him to pawn the next Day. This Gentleman (Mr. Goddard ) has got it now.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Evans on the 9th of June, in the Chaise about 10 at Night, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060006"/> the Robbery was committed. We were robb'd on this Side of Ball's-Pond Turnpike. Three Men came up to us, and one of them caught hold of the Horse's Reins, and back'd us into a Ditch. Then the Man that bac'kd the Horse, went on Evans's Side of the Chair, and the other two came on my Side, and with Pistols in their Hands they demanded our Money. They took from me, 7 Shillings, and when they had got that, they went to my left-hand Pocket; I told them there was nothing there but Half-pence. 'Damn you, said they, Farthings are as good as Silver, and so they took Three-pence from thence. When they demanded Evans's Money, he gave them 3 Shillings, and sav'd 8; for when they found his Watch, they searched him no farther. Then they went away, from London, towards the Turnpike, over the Fields. 'Twas such a time o'Night, that we could not take notice of their Faces. - We could only observe their Stature, and not so much as the Colour of their Cloaths: but we described the Men as well as we could to the People of New Prison, and Clerkenwell Bridewell, and at last we got Intelligence of the Prisoners, and Mr. Evans took out a Warrant against them, by their Names. After they were taken up, I went to the Prison to see them, and found they answer'd the Height and Size of the Men that robb'd us. When they were before the Justice, they were ask'd, if either of them would make himself an Evidence? Brown said he knew nothing of the Matter, and so could not. Rigby offer'd it, but the Justice would not admit him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard them talk; did you remember any thing of their Voices?</p>

            . Last Sunday night, in the Morning, Mr. Harris, the Constable, came to me with a Warrant for the apprehending of Rigby, Jesse Wallden, and a third Person. I went with him and others, in hopes of taking them all; but at that time we took only Rigby. We found him in bed in his Father's House by Shoreditch; he keeps a Garden, called The Curtain. As we were carrying him over the Fields, I ask'd him if he had not better discover his Accomplices; I told him he would do himself a Piece of Service by making such a Discovery. He told me, for some time together, that he could not, and would not, for he had not seen any of them since the Robbery: But some little time afterwards he said, - '' I was not in the Robbery, nor have I '' seen any of the Persons concern'd in it, since it '' has been committed; but I can tell you where '' the Watch is pawn'd.'' He own'd that he went out with an Intent to rob, and that he changed Coats with

             (the Butcher) under the Haycock, and that the Robbery was committed while he was under the Haycock, and the Watch was brought to him there, and his Coat return'd him by Walldon, after the Robbery. He said farther, that he pawned the Watch the next Morning to a Woman in an Alley by Moorfields. I urged him to discover his Companions, and at last he said he knew where to find the other Prisoner (Brown), and agreed to go with us to look for him in Cock-Lane in Shoreditch. As we were going along he said, '' We may as well '' call for the-Watch too, as we are so near'' And accordingly, he carried us to a House, and ask'd for it. The Woman wonder'd he should come for a Watch on a Sunday, and told us it lay for a Guinea and a Half. I put two Guineas into his Hand, and bid him pay for it: He gave her the Money, and I had 7 s. 3 d. out of my two Guineas. When I had got the Watch - Now, says I, you shall know this Watch was stole, a Man was robbed of it upon the Highway - give me my Money again. So she took her 7 s. 3 d. and return'd me my two Guineas. This is the Watch.</p>
               <p>Evans. 'Tis the same Watch I was robb'd of.</p>


               <p>Goddard. When I had thus got the Watch, we went and took Brown in Cock-Lane; and upon his denying that he was concern'd in this Robbery, I bid Rigby not charge the Man if he was not guilty. Why, says he, he was not with us this Time, but he very often has been with us, and as he expected to be made an Evidence, he must do something. But when he ( Rigby ) was before the Justice, he could speak to nothing but this Robbery, and in this, he said, Brown was not concerned.

About 7 Weeks ago my Mistress sent me out with a Sieve of Oysters to sell in Petticoat Lane: When I was coming home, I saw the Prisoner hulking about our Door, and he pretended to be making Water, but I thought he was pushing against it. When we came home, we found the Door broke open and a great many Things were taken away.</p>

            . I lodge in a Ground Room in Mr. Smith's House. On the 18 th of October I went out about 4 o'clock, to go down to Billingsgate, to get some Oysters for the Girl to go out with that Night. I returned home about Seven, and found a Door of my Room broke open; not the Set Door, for that is left open for the sake of other Lodgers, but a Door in the Entry, near the Street Door, which we never made any use of, and as we always went in and out at another Door, this which was next the Street Door, was fasten'd up with two Bolts and three Nails, and a great Looking Glass hung upon it. This Door we found broke open, and a Chest of Drawers was broke open likewise, and a Calamancoe Gown, three Pair of Sheets, a white Apron, and a Muslin Hood, were taken from hence; the Candlestick and one Apron were taken out of the Room. After my Surprize was a little over, I said to my Husband, - '' I fancy the Man that was transported a '' while ago with my Brother, has done this, - '' I fancy 'tis Bullingbroke.'' And accordingly, I got a Warrant the next Day, and took the Prisoner; then search'd his Room, and found one of my Shifts. Upon this he was carried before Mr. Justice Farmer, and there he own'd the Fact, telling us his Wife was the Occasion of his committing it; but he would not sign a Confession in Writing, nor would he tell us where the rest of the Goods were. His Wife said she knew where they all were, but she refused to tell us. I am sure the Goods I have mentioned to be in the Drawers, were all there when I went out, and that the Drawers were lock'd.</p>

She came to me with a Warrant to take the Prisoner, on the Eighteenth of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060008"/> October, about twelve o'Clock at Noon, but they desired me to take Care of myself, for he was a vile, desperate Fellow. Upon this, I thought proper to wait till between 5 and 6 o'Clock for the Assistance of another Constable, and about seven we took him. He told us, he was guilty of the Fact, and could not help it now. Says he, '' I have nothing to do, but beg my Life.'' Why says I, you have very lately been transported  Says he, '' I was transported about fifteen or sixteen '' Months ago, and am but very lately returned: '' My Wife has been the Ruin of me.'' I never saw the Prisoner's Wife till she came to make up the Matter, and then she told them, her Husband's Life was in their Hands.</p>

I said, I was going home to my Lodging, and wanted none of her Company. We had no more Talk together, but when I came to my own Door (which was but a little Way from the Place where she first spoke to me) I bid her begone about her Business, and she went off some Paces. I thought she had been gone, but while I was taking the Key out of the Door, after I had opened it, she brushed in upon me, and while I was in the Entry, she pushed one of her Hands to the Waistband of my Breeches, and the other she employ'd in picking my Pocket. I cry'd out - '' What are you doing!'' and drew back, and clapping my Hand into my Pocket where I had five of these Portugal Pieces, and a Half Guinea, I missed all but one Thirty-six shilling Piece. I fastened the Door immediately, and called my Landlord; she then pretended to strip herself, but I was not satisfied with that; therefore we got a Watchman, and this Woman, to take her up Stairs, and after some little Time, they brought me down my Money.</p>

When we got her up Stairs she was unwilling to be searched by Force, - she would undress herself, and when she was all undressed, as she stood upright, one of the Pieces of Gold dropped from her. Then she clapped herself down upon a Bed in the Room, and would be searched no further. I resolved to search her, and she finding it must be done, she clapped her Hand under her, and put the rest of the Money into the Bed, where it was found directly. I imagine she swallowed the Half Guinea, while we were searching her for the other Money.</p>

I heard how it was, and we got her up Stairs to be searched; while she was laying her Apron upon the Bed, I heard something fall from her; I stooped down, and took up a Thirty-six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060009"/> Shilling-Piece.

               <p>Mr. Tanner. On Wednesday was Fortnight, half an Hour after Nine at Night, I and six or seven more Countrymen I went from The Three Nuns in Aldermanbury to see a Funeral. I stood (to see it go along) about twenty Yards from the Church-Door. While I was standing there, two Men came up against me, and one of them, with the Point of his (bent) Elbow kept my Arm thus, - (i.e. confined his Arm by keeping his bent Elbow between it and the Prosecutr's Body) and had it not been for the Crowd, he pressed me so hard with his Elbow, that I should have been drawn down by it. At the same Time I felt something grabbling in my Breeches Pocket. As soon as I could, I endeavoured to bring my Hand to my Pocket, but before I could do that, Kew (the next Witness) said to me, '' Sir, your Watch is '' picked out of your Pocket.'' No, no, says I, 'tis not my Watch, - 'tis my Money, - 'tis fifty five Guineas in a Purse, which was in my Left-hand Pocket, buttoned up; and the Purse lay at the Bottom of my Pocket. This is the Fellow to the Purse I lost; - I have been a hundred Miles in the Country for it. - I perceived it going, and that another was picking my Pocket, while my Arm was held up, by the other Person's Elbow; which was done with so much Force, that I could not stir my Arm, to secure my Pocket, and my Side is still sore, with (the Pressure of) the Point of his Elbow. I put my Hand into my Pocket, and cry'd - '' My '' Money is gone''! Kew said, - Then that's the Man, and immediately caught hold of him, and said, he would swear it. Then I took hold of him, and we carry'd him to the Three Nuns in Aldermanbury, and from thence he was carry'd to the Compter. I apprehend it was not the Prisoner, but another, who pinned me up with his Elbow, - but the Prisoner was pressing against me at the same time as close as he possibly could, and bit his Lips in this Manner, [Here Mr. Tanner bit his Lips and contracted the Muscles of his Face] and staring me full in the Face, while he was grabling in my Pocket.</p>

I stood with my Light, and the Countryman, (Tanner) stood by me: I knew him before. Presently I saw a Man come up, that goes by the Name of BLACK SAM; a Man of a base Character, and who gets his Bread this way. This rais'd my Suspicion, and seeing him, I imagin'd Mischief was going forward: I look'd at the Countryman, and believed 'twas intended toward him. Presently I saw Black Sam shove the Countryman, and the Prisoner (whom I never saw before) was behind Black Sam and the Countryman, but his Situation was a little on one Side of the Countryman. I thought the Prisoner's Hand was in his Pocket, and that he was the man; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060010"/> he look'd genteely dress'd, and I was so afraid to accuse him, that my Knees totter'd under me: But I observ'd what I could, and saw a Hand come out, just where the Countryman stood. I look'd at the Countryman, and thought they were picking his Pocket. As soon as the Hand was drawn from the Countryman, I saw Black Sam put out his Hand, and take something from the other. Something hung down, which I thought was the Chain of a Watch. Upon this I immediately said to the Countryman, - '' Sir, '' You have lost your Watch.'' Black Sam turned about to me that Instant, and said, - How d'ye, Master? How d'ye, Master? - and slipp'd by me. The Countryman, the same Minute said, 'twas not his Watch, but his Money, that was gone. Then, says I, this is the Man that took it, and caught hold of the Prisoner by the Collar: The Countryman seiz'd him likewise, and another Man coming up to our Assistance, he was carried to the Three Nuns, and I follow'd them soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. What Cloaths had the Person on that the Hand belong'd to which you saw drawn from the Countryman?</p>
               <p>Kew. He was in Blue-Grey, and I saw what he was about. Black Sam kept shoving him, and the Prisoner was behind the Countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body between him and the Countryman?</p>
               <p>Kew. I don't apprehend there could be any one between them; for Black Sam kept shoving the Countryman, and the other was behind him: I believe there was no body between the Prisoner and the Countryman. There might be six People round them, but I don't apprehend that any body was between them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charg'd him, as the Person that took the Money, what did he say?</p>
               <p>Kew. He said, - I take the Money! - Yes, says I, you took the Money, for I saw Black Sam with you. Why did not you secure Black Sam, says he? I said I was not sure of the thing, till the Countryman spake, and then he was just slipp'd by me. While the thing was doing, I don't apprehend that any one was between Sam and the Countryman, or between the Countryman and the Prisoner: For I was so near them, that I saw them both; and if I had had Spirit enough, I could have put out my Hand, and could have received it (the Hand with the Purse), for Black Sam put his Hand behind him, and the other Man all into his Hand but the Strings; then it was that I spoke, Black Sam turn'd to me - How d'ye, Master? and slipp'd away in the Crowd; an then I said to the Prisoner, Let it be what it will (that is lost) you're the Man, - because I said at first he had lost his Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you speak to the Prisoner in particular, above all the rest of the People?</p>
               <p>Kew. Because I thought he must be the Man that took it, and because before I spoke I thought he was about it; and because I thought no one was capable of doing it but Him; and my Thoughts were so strong, that I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one else so near, or so situate, as to be able to take the Purse, and put it into Black Sam's Hand, but the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Kew. It was my Opinion there was not. Black Sam only confin'd the Countryman, and I charg'd the Prisoner, because I thought no body else could do it; and, before I spoke, I thought he was about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you, or Tanner, lay hold of me first?</p>
               <p>Tanner. Mr. Kew touch'd him by the Shoulder, and said, - You are the Man that pick'd his Pocket. He then took hold of him, and said he would swear it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not a Countrywoman as near Tanner, as I was?</p>
               <p>Tanner. No; there was not While I had got the Prisoner by the Collar, I look'd about for somebody to assist me, and I saw Mrs. Billings, who quarter'd in the Inn, and I call'd to her, and said, - Mrs. Billings, this Man has pick'd my Pocket of 44 Guineas, for God's sake take hold of him! Upon this, she and some others assisted me, and we got him to the Three Nuns</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Kew if I had not both my Gloves on, and my Cane in my Hand, at that Time?</p>
               <p>Tanner. He had his Cane in his Hand, - but he had no Gloves on. I look'd at his Hands the same time he was seiz'd.</p>
               <p>Kew. I did not look at his Hands at all; but caught him by the Collar, at the Instant I suspected him to have done the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Hand that deliver'd the Purse to Black Sam's a Glove on? (to Kew)</p>
               <p>Kew. No; none at all.</p>
               <p> Abraham Woodhoster. I paid Mr. Tanner 57l. 6 s. for some Cloth I bought of him, on the 21st of November, by a Draught on the Bank .</p>
               <p>Tanner. I had 16 Shillings from another Person, which I was to carry down and pay in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060011"/> the Country. The Draught upon the Bank I received between Twelve and One the Day before; so I made up 65 Guineas, and put them in a Purse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woohoster. I take Mr. Tanner to be a very honest Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Tanner, it he has not been encouraged to prosecute me in hopes of the Forty Pounds Reward?</p>
               <p>C. There's no Reward at all in this Case.</p>
               <p>Tanner. I have neither been applying to get my Money made up, nor to make up the Matter. After I had been robb'd, I went away directly into the Country, and travell'd Night and Day to get home. My Pocket was pick'd on Wednesday Evening, and I got to Froome in Somersetshire on Sunday, for fear the Gang should do me a Mischief after the Prisoner was sent to Newgate. I had brought up some Goods to sell; and as I was in Necessity for Money against Christmas, I sold these Goods at Five Pounds Loss. I had been absent three Weeks from Home; and though I went home directly, yet several of my Neighbours met me, and lamented my Misfortune, which they had heard of by the News-Papers, before I got home, and by a private Letter which somebody had sent into the Country. On Tuesday after I got home, one Gully came into the Crown Inn at Froome, and said he had been in Gloucestershire, Bristol, and other Places, buying Goods; he pull'd out a Sheet of Paper, wrote on both Sides, and told the People he was come to Froome to buy 100 Pieces of Cloth. On Wednesday Morning this Man sent for me; I was afraid to go, lest it should be to arrest me, as I had met with this Misfortune; so I sent a Friend to drink a Pint of Beer there, and learn who it was that wanted me. He returned, and told me 'twas a Gentleman that came from London; so I went to him, and he ask'd me what I would please to drink, and told me he heard I had the Misfortune to have 55 Guineas pick'd out of my Pocket lately at London; I told him 'twas true, and the worse Luck was mine. Says he, I have been considering on my Pillow, by what Means you might have your Money again. I said was a great Loss to me - Ay, says he, 'tis a great Loss to a poor Tradesman, - I beg your Pardon for calling you so - I am so, indeed, said I. Well, reply'd he, if you'll be rul'd by me, I'll find Means that you shall have your Money again, though the Man that took it is a Stranger to me, and I have been ten Days from London; yet I have Acquaintance who will make up this Matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that this Man came from the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tanner. He insisted upon it, that I should go to London with him, and though he said he came to buy many Pieces of Cloth, yet he would buy none, and at last the Gentlemen of the Place suspected he was a Confederate. About six or seven in the Evening he told me, he would lay me five Shillings, that sixty five Guineas should be made up to me if I would be directed by him, and that the Money should be found in some unknown Person's Pocket, and I should not sign any Writing at all. I told him, it was impossible to make up a Felony, and that the Lord-Mayor had commited him, and had ordered me not to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you make it out, that this Man came from the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Tanner. He said, he came from London directly; and the Gentleman in the Town having some Suspicion of the Man, I was sent for to the George, and he was taken up, and put into Ilchester Gaol. When I got home, two Lawyers were sent to assure me, that this Man would give it me under his Hand, that if I would do as he would have me, I should have fifty-five Guineas, and ten for my Trouble. The Justice hearing this, was very angry the Gentlemen should suffer such a Person to be in the Town, - one who had offered to make up the Matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Still I ask you, whether you can prove this Man came from the Prisoner, or was employ'd by him?</p>
               <p>Tanner. I can't prove that - but there are several Names to the Papers (he had upon him) of Persons, that did employ him. My Lord With Submission, he was talking of forty Pounds which I expected to make of him, - I never had a Thought about, nor was any Money offer'd me, till this Man came to me to make it up.</p>
               <p>Defence. This Countryman is a Man of an ill Character, his Country people give him a bad Word. He can neither write nor read, and since he has lost his Money, he has heard I have three of four hundred Pounds, and he said he would swear any Thing to get two hundred Pounds of it. He is a litigious Man, - I thought the Court would have indulged me, - I have feed Council, -</p>
               <p>C. But here is no Point of Law; and you know Matters of Fact as well as your Council.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Night this thing happened, I was going from Gutter Lane Moorfields, and the singing Boys being at the Funeral, I stood between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060012"/> the Church-Gate and the Conduit, to see them. As I stoed there, a Man came and asked me, Whose Burying that was? I told him, I could not tell. Then a young Woman, who had washed for me, stopped, I asked how she did, and took her by the Hand, with my Gloves on; but before she had spoke a Word out of her Mouth, this Man came and took me by the Collar, and said I had got Mr. Tanner's Watch, tho' I knew nothing of the Matter; and a Woman that belonged to Tanner came and clapped hold of my Collar too. I was carry'd to the Three Nuns, and there I pulled off my Gloves, and turned out my Pockets, and I had - no more than an Eighteen-shilling Piece and some Silver - about me, - that was all I had, - in my Pockets.

            . I live in Chick Lane, and sell Cloaths, I was going that Night to the Axe Inn, and the Funeral coming by, I asked the Prisoner, Whose Funeral it was? I never saw him, - nor knew him before, - but he was in grey Cloaths, with a Glove (or Gloves) on, leaning on his Cane. He told me, he did not know; so I walked away, and was not farther from him, than I am now, when a Woman came up and spoke to him, and presently, I heard a Noise, that a Person was laid hold of, for picking Pockets: I crowded up, and saw it was the Person I had just been speaking to.</p>
               <p>Q. What Distance of Time might there be, between your speaking to the Prisoner, and your hearing this Noise?</p>
               <p>Emps. Not a great while: Five, six or seven Minutes. - It might be seven or eight, for aught I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the Axe Inn that Night?</p>
               <p>Emps. Yes; to enquire for a Man that came from Birmingham, but they did not know him.</p>

I follow the Wash-Tub, and was going to put off a Day's Scowering at the George and Gate, in Gracechurch-Street, but seeing the Funeral, I stopped, as others did, and seeing the Prisoner, for whom I used to wash, I asked him for his Washing, &amp;c. I said it was a fine Burying; - Yes, says he, and took me by the Hand, and says he, - pray excuse me, - my Gloves are on. - And not a Minute afterward, - no, - not Half a Minute afterwards, - the Mob seized him, and cary'd him away; I can safely swear to a Minute, and I was just by him when this happened.</p>

            . I am an Apothecary in Bloomsbury: I know the Prisoner James Lyon: He came to my House, August 31, with my Sister Mary Williams, (after they had been taking a Walk in the Fields) and said they had agreed to be married, - I remember it was in Tottenham-Court Fair Time, and they were both willing to to be married that Day. I had my Sister consider what she was about; but she, having a Notion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060014"/> that the Prisoner was worth Money, and that twould be a good Match, desired to be married then. The Prisoner and she din'd at my House, and after Dinner she went home to her Lodging, to dress herself, and we sent for two or three different Roman Priests to perform the Ceremony; but they were not at home. At last we went to one Johnson's in Eagle-Street, ('tis a private House) and there we found a Priest, one Mr. Vane, and by the Consent of each other, - by asking the Consent of each other, that is, - whether you'll take me, - and I will take you, they were marry'd. 'Twas not the Ceremony of the Church of England which was read, but that of the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a Ring made use of in the Ceremony?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. I can't say that: - but 'twas according to the Ceremony of the Romish Church, because my Sister was a Roman. When the Ceremony was over, they came to my House, and after supper they went to bed together. Next Morning he went about his Business, and she went to her Lodging. At Michaelmas following he took a House in King-street, St. Giles's, where he <rs id="t17381206-26-deflabel121" type="occupation">kept a Pawnbroker's Shop</rs>

                        targets="t17381206-26-defend188 t17381206-26-deflabel121"/>. Here they liv'd a Year and a Half, and she went by his Name, and appear'd as his Wife in all manner of Shapes and Respects. Indeed since Christmas last I have not seen her; we have been to enquire after her, but can't hear whether she is dead or alive.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there any Courtship preceded the Marriage?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. He had been with her two or three times, and the thing was talk'd of; she inform'd us of the Offer he had made to her - I never heard it suspected she was his Housekeeper, but she went for his Wife with every one.</p>
               <p>Counc. In what Manner was the Ceremony performed?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. 'Tis taking such a one for my Wife; - and she says; she takes such a one for her Husband, To Have, and To Hold for Life.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did the Person produce a Book?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. Yes, - Latin and English; but I did not look into it.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then it might be a Play-Book, for aught you know?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. I did not look into it, sure enough.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there any Latin read at that Time?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. I can't say that particularly; but I remember the Consent of the Parties, very well. I never attended a Marriage by a Popish Priest, but this and my own, and that was fourteen Years ago.</p>
               <p>Counc. Are you a Roman?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. Yes, - but the Prisoner is a Protestant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q. Have not you, (on your Oath) said she pass'd for a Housekeeper, and not for my Wife?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. No; nor have I ever heard any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q. Had not she a Husband then living?</p>
               <p>Mackworth. She had not, he died abroad - Long before this I received an Account of his Death by Letter, and his Relations went into Mourning for him. I have lost the Letter, for I had no Notion of these Difficulties coming up.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mackworth gave much the same Account with Mr. Mackworth: adding, that she was a Roman Catholick, and that the Prisoner and her Sister were married in the same Manner that she and Mr. Mackworth were married; that she could not remember all the Words, only these: - I take thee for my wedded Wife, and endow thee with all my worldly Chattels: that the Prayers were in Latin; but that the Priest gave them a deal of good Advice in English; that there was a Ring made use of; that after the Marriage, they were visited and received Visits as Man and Wife; that during the Year and Half they liv'd in Kingstreet, they were not one Night asunder; and that the Marriage Ceremony was performed by a Priest, in a Room up one Pair of Stairs, about Nine o'clock at Night; she and her Husband, the Bride, Bridegroom, and the Priest, being only in Company.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner about 6 Years come Christmas next. He married Mr. Mackworth's Sister, and I remember their living as Man and Wife together in King-street, Bloomsbury. Her Name was Williams before he married her. I took the House they liv'd in of the Prisoner, and they liv'd with me in it Half a Year afterwards, and all that Time she went by his Name, and they liv'd and lay together. She has dined several times at my House since last Christmas Day. I don't know what's become of her now, - but I believe I saw her last February.</p>

            . I have not known the Prisoner till lately: I have heard my Husband speak to him; but I was not married then. I have known him about a Twelvemonth, and have seen Mrs. Williams (poor Woman!) several time since Christmas. I believe she was his Wife - else<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060015"/> she would not have taken the Usage she had from him.</p>
               <p>Counc. The Question now is, Concerning a Marriage De Jure and De Facto; Whether a Marriage by a Popish Priest is a Marriage De Jure? She is a Wife De Facto - she has liv'd with him as such, and he has acknowledged her for his Wife; but, I must own, I am not prepared to produce particular Cases to this Purpose.</p>
               <p>But as I have been often told upon the Circuits, that I must shew some Ceremony to have been performed, I was willing to shew the Truth of the Case. I apprehend the Prisoner would be liable to pay his first Wife's Debts, and if he should, then this poor Woman's Substance, who has been deceived by him, is to be taken from her, and she can claim no Dower out of his Effects. Call Mrs. Allen.</p>
               <p>The Council on the other Side objected to her being sworn, and observed that as all Acts constituting Felonies are to be construed strictly, so a Marriage, strictly and according to the Laws, must be a Marriage according to the Ceremony of the Church of England, and it appearing that there had not been such a Marriage, but one by a Popish Priest, it was submitted, that they had not incontestibly established the first Marriage, nor had they so established it, as to be intituled to produce the second Wife.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Allen. I was married to the Prisoner the 19th of July was twelve Months at <placeName id="t17381206-26-crimeloc122">St. Mary Magdalen's Church</placeName>

He then passed for a Widower, and I lived with him 'till I took him up, except a little Time he was in Ireland. I found it out in June, and told him of it; he deny'd it utterly, but I called upon Mr. Mackworth, and he confirmed it, and said he was present at his first Marriage, and told me all that he has said here. This was the Reason I indicted him for marrying me. I am a Protestant, and have brought this Prosecution against him, by my own Resentment. I sent for a Marshall's Man, and was present when he was brought before Mr. De Veil.</p>

            . I was present when the Prisoner married Mrs. Allen, at St. Mary Magdalen's Church.</p>
               <p>Council. I apprehend, 'tis necessary (in order to shew the Court has a Jurisdiction to try him in Middlesex) that they should produce the Warrant by which he was taken. The Rule of Law is, - that the best Evidence is to be given in such Cases, and the Warrant will speak for itself: That being produced, it will appear for what Offence the Man was committed, and in this Case 'tis mentioned in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Council. I imagine it never was required, or ever was expected, that the Warrant should be produced, and that the Objection with Regard to Jurisdiction is easily answered; for if he had been taken up in another Country, he had not come here but by Habeas Corpus. But as he is here, he is to be taken Prima Facie, as he is before the Court. And Mr. De Veil says he was brought before him, and committed by him; therefore he can easily shew, if 'twas for any other Offence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Mackworth. Were all the Words necessary to make a Popish Marriage repeated on this Occasion?</p>
               <p>Mr Mackworth. Yes: I never read the Words of a Popish Matrimony in my Life, yet I believe he was married according to this Form. The Priest was in a Secular Habit, but he put on a little Thing, which we call a Stole. 'Tis a Thing that comes round their Shoulders; a Bit of Silk about four or five Inches broad, and hangs down a little Way. He had no surplice on; but he was one whom I had seen officiate as a Priest; and no Seculars wear the Stole, tho' they may do some Office. <rs id="t17381206-26-verdict123" type="verdictDescription">

            , Constable. On Monday-Morning, between One and Two, I was going my Rounds, and heard a Noise in a Night-Cellar, where they sit up, all Night, and sell Beer and Ale, and any thing, and every thing. I ask'd my Beadle if I had any Power to go there, because 'tis out of my Parish? He told me I had. So I went and found People standing at the Cellar Door, whom I dispersed; then I went down into the Cellar, and saw a great many People, forty, I believe. The Woman of the Cellar led me to the farther Part of it, to some Women, that, she said, had been troublesome; when I returned to the Middle of the Cellar again, I saw the Prisoner and another <rs id="t17381206-38-deflabel168" type="occupation">Serjeant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17381206-38-defend244 t17381206-38-deflabel168"/> standing upright, and my Beadle said to me, - '' Master, '' here's a poor Man wounded! '' Wounded, says I, let me see! The Deceased was a Welsh Man, and spoke such broken English that I could hardly understand him; but he lifted up his Coat and Shirt, and I saw no Blood, but something that I thought had been a Wart upon his Belly: He kept groaning and sighing, and said he was stabb'd and murder'd; upon which I said, - Prithee let's look at it again; I saw it again, and perceived some Spots of Blood upon his Shirt, and that 'twas the poor Man's Cawl which hung half an Inch out of his Belly. I ask'd him who did it? He told me the Prisoner, who then stood near to, and facing the Box, where the Deceased sat, and made no Answer to what the Deceased said. I bid him be sure of what he said; - Yes, says he, That was the Serjeant, (pointing to the Prisoner) that stabb'd and kill'd me. Then I turn'd to the Prisoner, and told him I must secure him; he had his Sword then in his Belt, but Serjeant Duckworth, who stood by him, took hold of it, and turn'd the Point of it towards me, before I took it out of the Prisoner's Belt, that I might see the Point was naked, and without a Chape, (i.e. the Metal Cover at the Point of the Scabbard) I took notice of this, and after I had seiz'd the Sword, I order'd him to be carry'd to the Round-House, where I waited for the Deceased to come and confirm his Charge. He was no sooner came in, but I observ'd his Countenance change; so I sent for a Surgeon: And while he was gone for, I enquir'd again of the Deceased, how he came by his Wound? The Prisoner was present at the same time, and heard the Deceased tell me He was the Man that had stabb'd, and kill'd, and murder'd him. The Prisoner said, - '' Could I do it, with my Scabbard '' on, and my Sword-undrawn?'' The Deceased (in a Passion) said, '' Yes, you did it, - '' and, d - n you, you Villain, you know you did '' it. Your Sword was naked, and you knew it. '' I only said - it was not fair to draw upon a '' naked Man, and you said, - G - D d - mn your '' Bl - d, I'll stab you, and you did it directly.'' This was what the Deceased said, and I did not hear the Prisoner make any Answer at all to it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173812060017"/> When the Surgeon came, he said the Wound was dangerous, so I ordered a Bed for him (the Deceased) in the Watch-House. The Prisoner also had a Bed, and lay in the Watch-House that Night, and next Morning he was carried before Mr. Justice Hilder, and from thence to St. Martin's Round-House, as the securer Place. In the Evening the Surgeon declared his Sense of the Danger the Deceased was in, and desired the Justice might be sent for to him, before he died. Accordingly, I brought the Justice and Prisoner to the Deceased; he was then in a colour'd Coat, but the Deceased knew him immediately; the Justice gave him his Oath, and he swore that was the Man who murder'd him. I don't remember the Prisoner said any thing at all in his own Vindication.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Deceased sober at that time, or in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Burton. I can't tell; I believe he had been drinking.</p>

             (Beadle) confirm'd Burton's Evidence: He said that while the Constable went to the farther End of the Cellar, he stood between the Prisoner and the Deceased, who told the Witness he was stabb'd by the Prisoner; and that he had only said to him, 'twas a Shame for him to draw upon a naked Man; to which the Prisoner did not answer one Word. The rest of his Evidence tallied with Mr. Burton's. He added, that he was one who attended the Deceased to the Watch-House, who seem'd likely to faint away several times, as they were bringing him along; that he went for the Surgeon who dress'd the Wound, and then the Deceased swore again at the Prisoner, and said he had kill'd him, and that his Sword was naked; that when the Justice was examining the Deceased, some body ask'd the Prisoner if he was not sorry? to which the Prisoner reply'd, - Sure, - I am sorry; he likewise said - the Deceased had been drinking, but he imagin'd he was sensible with regard to what he said and did.</p>

That the Surgeon came about ten o'Clock to dress him, and at that Time the Prisoner cry'd, - I did stick him! I did stick him! But you gave the Affront. To which the Deceased reply'd, - I only said, 'twas a Shame to draw upon a naked Man; I went up into a Corner away from you, but you followed me and stabbed me. This, he said, was spoke before the Prisoner, who answered not a Word, and when he was before the Justice he owned again, that he had stabbed him, and said, - Sure I am sorry. And the Deceased continued making the same Declaration to his Death.</p>

Mr. Snoud (the Surgeon) being call'd, the Bleeding was stopp'd, and after the Deceased had kept his Bed about three Days, he seem'd to recover, and at Length the Wound was cur'd; but the Effusion of Blood had occasioned a Weakness of Body. It appear'd that under this Indisposition the Deceased had play'd at Skettles, and that three Weeks after the Accident, he walk'd to Richmond Park, where he sat a great while to see the Nobility hunt in the Park; after which he walk'd some Part of the Way home, and came the rest by Water. It likewise appeared that he had taken Cold; which was follow'd by a violent Fever, of which he died.</p>
