The prisoner was in my service twice—she left me, and came back about two months afterwards—she was the only servant I had—I had a purse with eleven new sovereigns in it, locked up in a little box, which I kept in a leather trunk, also locked, which was kept in my bedroom, which communicated with the prisoner's bedroom with folding doors—it was some<lb/>times in her room and sometimes in mine—I kept the keys—I was saving the sovereigns to pay for my license, which was 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen the eleven sovereigns safe four or five weeks before—the prisoner left my service on a Thursday, about four weeks ago—I was not aware of her going till after she left—I then went to the box and missed my purse and sovereigns, and also four or five foreign coins—the box bad not been broken open, and I had had the key all the time in my pocket, on a ring with my other keys—I' am sure I did not take the money out myself—it was a bead purse, which I had had for twenty years—two orphan children who I keep, slept in the room—a week or two before the prisoner left I told her she must look out for another situation, as she kept company with a married man—I received some information, in consequence of which I said to the prisoner, "Ellen, are you going?" she said, "Yes; that man's wife follows me so, and brings a crowd about the house, and says she will have my life"—I asked her to stop, and she said she would stop till I got another servant—that was on the Thursday night, about two hours before she left—I did not see her go, I suppose she took her box out at the side door—a woman named Connor, a sister-in-law of her's, used to come backwards and forwards—I charged Connor with taking the box away, not the money—they were both put to the bar before the Magistrate, and Connor was discharged because there was no case against her—I charged her with taking the prisoner's box—it was just getting dark in the evening when I asked the prisoner to stop till I got another maid.</p>

In Aug., 1852, I engaged the prisoner as clerk and traveller at a salary of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and his expenses—his duty was to collect orders and sell goods when I sent him for them—I used to take stock every month, and come to an understanding with the prisoner of what had been done by him—I was in the habit of entrusting watches to him for the purposes of sale for me, and he was to bring me back the money or the watches—I took stock in Nov., and missed four watches—I told the prisoner of it; he said he had them at home, and would bring them the day after, or in a few days—I had given them to him to sell, and ho had never returned them—I took stock on 3rd Jan., and missed then thirty-five watches, including the four I had previously missed—I believe I had entrusted twenty-six watches to him in Dec, or perhaps not quite so many—I then missed seven other watches which I had not entrusted to him; they had been taken from my stock without my knowledge—I told the prisoner I missed seven watches, and that I was quite surprised about it—he said he did not know anything about it, but he thought I was right—he then said he would bring the whole of the watches on 6th Jan.—on 7th Jan. the prisoner sent me two letters; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—some duplicates were enclosed in it, in consequence of which I made inquiries at the various pawnbrokers indicated on the tickets, and found the watches in pledge—Russell, the police officer, came to me, and I went with him to the prisoner's lodgings several times, and made efforts to take him, but we were unsuccessful—from 7th Jan., until the prisoner was seen at Westminster Hall, I had no opportunity of taking him—</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After Purey had left you, and had robbed you, you sent the bill to Switzerland to get money to pay him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I swear that—I expected that the bill would have been paid, and I should then have paid the money to Mr. Purey, but he was not in custody and I could not—he afterwards became a witness in a case against me, and I gave him into custody; I never could take him before—the bill I received for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two I O U's I received—they have not been paid—one is the I O U of a Mr. Green—I do not know him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of Skinner-street, Snow-hill. I have known the prisoner rive or six years—I do not particularly recollect seeing him at my shop on 29th Oct.; but on that day two gold watches were pledged at my shop, to which this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers—it is in the name of John Purey, for two gold watches, pledgedfor 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was there on 3rd Nov., and pawned three silver watches for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on 24th Nov. a silver watch for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on 7th Jan. five silver watches for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the watch pawned on 7th Jan. had been previously pawned—I do not recollect seeing the prisoner at my shop on 7th Jan.; he merely paid the interest on the watches, and got a fresh ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Law Incorporated Society. We keep a register of all certificated attorneys, and all those who are <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> in practice as attorneys—it is made out from a declaration made by any solicitor who wishes to commence practice—it is a copy of his declaration—it must necessarily contain the names of all the solicitors who are entitled to practice—there is an annual roll and a continued roll—I have searched both, and do not find the name of the prisoner there—I am perfectly satisfied he could not have been an attorney in practice—this will not inform me whether at any time he had been admitted as an attorney—he is not entitled to practice without a certificate, and he must necessarily, previous to obtaining a a certificate, lodge a declaration, and he is not on the roll.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">THURSTON</hi>. I am clerk to Commissioner Fane of the Bankruptcy Court. I produce the proceedings in Bankruptcy of Joseph and John Legge—I have the adjudication here—(<hi rend="italic">this was dated 2nd April</hi>, 1853, <hi rend="italic">and declared Joseph and John Legge, upholsterers and cabinet makers, to be bankrupts, within the meaning of the Act. Signed, "Edward Goulbourn, Commissioner.</hi>") I also produce the declaration made by the defendant on 4th April (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "I Joseph Legge, being declared a bankrupt, do solemnly promise and declare that I will make true answer to all such questions as may be proposed to me respecting all the property of me the said defendant, and all dealings and transactions relating thereto; and that I will make a full and true disclosure of all that has been done to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief")—I was present on 4th April before Mr. Commissioner Evans, at some part of the defendant's examination, but not the whole time—his signature is to each page of it—I did not see him sign it, but I know his writing—(<hi rend="italic">part of the defendant's examination was then read as follows</hi>: "Mr. Marshall is the landlord of No. 4, York-terrace aforesaid. He is no relation of mine. I have not taken any portion of that house. About two month's since I applied to Mr. Marshall for an advance of money. Mr. Marshall is not in trade, he is a speculator in anything and everything. I have known Mr. Marshall about two or three years, I imagine he was always a speculator and never in business. I think it was about two month's since Mr. Marshall agreed to let me have what money I required upon my stock in trade, as also of my partner. It was upon a portion of my stock about a month ago. Mr. Marshall gave me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, all gold, to the best of my belief, as a loan on personal security. I gave him no security whatever, nor did my partner to my knowledge; but I promised to do so in case any further sum was advanced. He did make to myself and partner one advance of 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about a fortnight since. It was paid partly in notes and partly in gold. I cannot positively state whether any one was present")—that examination is sealed with the seal of the Court—on 5th April, the defendant was examined before Commissioner Fane, as follows: "Have you anything further to add to your examination of yesterday as to your books? All memorandums or books that I have, to my knowledge, are at Southampton.—Where at Southampton? They are with Mr. Marshall, whose address I do not know, with the exception of a few memorandums, which the officer who took me has in his possession.—Where did you see those books? At Southampton, in the house in which I was arrested: I wish to state that all memorandums were there when I left, relating to my transactions—Where were the books, were they in a desk? In a desk.—Describe those books?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185307040019"/>
               <p>They were chiefly memorandums and invoices, bankers' books, checks, and other memorandums; I cannot remember anything else at present.—Were those books and papers the only books you kept in your business? They were, to the best of my belief.—Did you keep a ledger? There was a ledger, but there was no entry in it.—As the property you speak of was deposited with Mr. Marshall for the benefit of your creditors, was Mr. Marshall selected to receive that property and deposit by your creditors, or any of them? He was not.—By whom was he chosen? He was chosen by myself and brother.—How came you and your brother, or you alone, to choose him? For the security of the property until we could make arrangements.—I ask you, why you selected Marshall more than any body else? Because we had known him.—How long had you known him? Two or three years. As what? As a cabinet maker, at Canterbury.—Where is he now? At Southampton. "On 9th April, 1853, the defendant was again examined as follows: "Do you adhere to the statement you made on your first examination? No.—In what respect do you wish to depart from that? That Marshall is a relation of mine—he is my father; that he has all the property I have or had deposited with him at Southampton, at No. 4, York-terrace, New Town, Southampton, That is the only thing that I can remember in my examinations that I can correct; I wish to correct others, but I cannot remember them.—Who took the house at Southampton? Marshall Legge, the person I have spoken of before as Mr. Marshall.—Was Marshall Legge, your father, ever in business?Yes—Where are the account books relating to your business? The memorandums and papers were at Southampton, in York-place, when I left; they were in a desk, and all the books I had, except a pocket book and banker's book.—Where is the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you received from Gingell? 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited with Marshall Legge, my father, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to Mr. Fisher, my former landlord, for rent, and the rest was spent in going to Southampton, and other little expenses.—What were your intentions when you went to Southampton? To rest for a short time, and to make arrangements for the benefit of my creditors.—By the Commissioner—I am not satisfied with that last answer, because it is impossible to believe you went to Southampton, and put your goods into the hands of your father, assuming a false name, with any intention to benefit your creditors; I therefore again call upon you to state what your real intention was? The sole reason I had in placing the goods there, or one of the motives, was to preserve them for the benefit of my creditors at a future time as soon as I recovered myself, as I was very ill at the time: I intended to see them to make them an offer, and to throw myself upon their mercy I had this motive also, which was to prevent one or two creditors coming in and sweeping off what there was, and thus deprive the whole of the remainder of the benefit of them, that was my motive; I also wished to prevent an execution coming in, and I had been threatened by the holder of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; signed, Joseph Legge. "On that occasion the defendant was re-committed to the Queen's prison, the answers not being satisfactory.</p>

               <p>Zuccani, one of the creditors, went with me to No. 4, York-terrace, New Town, Southampton—we searched the greater part of the house for the prisoner and his brother—after immense difficulty, caused by a man who called himself Marshall, who has since told me his name is Legge: and the prisoner's wife—on my return from the coal cellar they attempted to keep me from getting into the house again; but with the assistance of Mr. Zuccani I got in again, and proceeded up stairs, when Marshall got two upholsterer's hammers, and the prisoner's wife a very large stick—I kept them at bay, and sent Zuccani up stairs—we eventually captured the defendant, who came from the upper part of the house—I did not see John Legge, the other bankrupt, there—I took possession of the furniture that was there—the house was full of cabinet and upholstery work, some finished and some not—I should say it would weigh full four tons, and there was more furniture at No. 5, as No. 4 would not hold the whole—on the following day, Monday, 4th April, I took the defendant up to London—I was present at his examination, at the Bankruptcy Court, on 8th April, I think it was—I then saw the man who had represented himself to be Marshall—on 20th April I again saw him at Guildhall, and having been told something, I said to him in the defendant's presence, "Your son has given you some money, what is it?"—the defendant heard it, and said, "I have not given him any"—I said, "You have"——Marshall then said that Mr. Wontner, his attorney, had given him some—since that I have twice seen the defendant and Samuel Marshall Legge together, at Guildhall police court—I have 'not heard them say anything about their relationship, but have always heard them address each other as father and son; I cannot give the exact words—I heard them conversing together for half an hour, and they appeared to understand each other perfectly well as father and son, but I cannot recollect any of the words that passed between them; they identified each other in a general way—I was not present in the Court of Bankruptcy on 9th April, when the defendant was examined, and said Marshall was his father.</p>

I saw the defendant at the Queen's Bench prison after the last examination—we were talking about whether the indictment for perjury was to be carried out or not; he asked me whether it would—I said I believed it would, and he said he could never be convicted—I said, "Well, what can be stronger perjury than stating that you do not know your own father?"—he said, "If I had not chosen to have admitted that he was my father, they could never have proved it against me.

I have known the prisoner two or three years—there was a little dealing between us—in May last there was no money due by me to the prisoner—on 24th May Hutchins came to my house between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—Duffield was with him—he banded me this piece of paper, and said "I have brought this paper, a writ from Mr. Lewis"—I said I did not owe Mr. Lewis anything at all—he said, Mr. Lewis instructed him to take any sum of money he could get from me—he said, could I give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he would take that and give me a receipt, and I should have no more trouble—I said, "No, not a farthing"—he called me on one side, and said "Can't you manage to give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"

On 29th June, about 11 o'clock in the evening, I was in the Crooked Billet, on Tower-hill, sitting in front of the bar, and William Thomson was on my right hand side; he was rather the worse for liquor, but was sensible enough to know that he lost something—he was sitting between the two prisoners—I saw Foley put his hand in Thomson's pocket, and take out a box—he shook it, and I heard something like money in it—he then knocked Thomson down, gave the box into the hands of Justice, and they both went out together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Jannings, a hosier. On 25th June, about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked to look at a black handkerchief with embroidered corners—I showed him some, but we had not got exactly what he wanted—I went to the other end of the shop to inquire if we had anything likely to suit him, leaving him at the counter, and the handkerchiefs before him—I returned to him, and said those were the nearest we had got—he then asked to look at some white embroidered waistcoats—I took him up stairs, but not having anything likely to suit him, we came down again—he asked me if I could get them for him—I said I would endeavour to do so, and he said he would call again on Tuesday, and asked me for a card of the shop—he made no purchase—I know these handkerchiefs, they belong to Charles Jannings; some of them have his private mark on them—I did not miss any till Haydon brought the prisoner to the shop, but when we were shown the handkerchiefs we knew them to be our goods—I cannot positively say how many were gone, but we found that the stock was short.</p>

On Saturday, 4th June, in consequence of information, I went to No. 14, Newton-street, Holborn, accompanied by Maskall and another officer—I went to the back room on the third floor, it was about a quarter past 6 o'clock in the evening—I found the two prisoners in the room, and another man—on my entering the room, Newton stood up, and picked from off the hob some pieces of plaster of Paris mould, and dashed them into the fire—I said I belonged to the police, and I seized hold of him—a part of the mould was scattered from the fire on the floor, and he commenced trampling upon them—I seized him, and he resisted violently—I pulled him from the fireplace, and pushed him back against the window, and his head came against the frame; I then put him into the hands of Sergeant Maskall—while I was engaged with Newton, I saw Price throw something on the fire—I saw two shillings distinctly, and they melted—another shilling went into the crucible—I saw her throw more than two shillings out of her hand—one of them went into this crucible, and I got it off before it was quite melted—this is the crucible, with part of the shilling in it—I also took from the fireplace these moulds for casting 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces—one mould is whole, and there are several other pieces of moulds—they were in the fire, near where a pipkin was—some of these pieces I found on the floor, which I prevented Newton from destroying—these are moulds for casting 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., pieces, and here is a mould for making shillings—on the table near the fire was this jar, and in it I found thirty-nine counterfeit shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in a little box on the mantelshelf there were four counterfeit sixpences, and fourteen fourpenny counterfeit pieces—the fourpenny pieces are finished—the shillings are not finished—some of the sixpences are finished—on the table I found this file with white metal in its teeth—on the window cill I found a galvanic battery, wire, and plate; also a jar, and a jar containing acid solution, a portion of which I have got—I went to the cupboard, and in it I found this piece of glass, which is used for making plaster of Paris moulds, bearing on it marks of plaster of Paris, and some sand, which is also used—I forgot to mention that in the jar which was on the table there was, I believe, seventeen sixpences,</p>

I accompanied the last witness to the house where the seizure took place—when I entered I saw Newton take the moulds from the hob, and dash them into the fire—he was immediately seized by Brannan—he resisted very violently—some portion of the moulds remained in the fire, and some flew out on the floor, and Newton commenced trampling on them as soon as ever they were on the floor—Brannan seized him, it was all the act of a moment—I assisted in removing him to the other side of the room; he was there given into custody—I searched him on the spot; in his left hand waistcoat pocket I found three paper parcels containing counterfeit coin—one parcel contained ten shillings, the next five shillings, and the other twenty counterfeit sixpences—they appeared to be in a finished state, and were wrapped up separately—in his right hand waistcoat pocket I found a good half crown—he was then taken to the station house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live in Foley-street. I know Mr. Wood's house in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square—I passed it on 2nd June, at 11 o'clock at night, I saw three men standing at the door—there are three steps—there was one man on each step—I. passed close to the steps—I had a flowerpot in my hand, and I stopped to change it from one hand to the other—I believe the prisoner Gillings to be one of the men—I had an opportunity of seeing his face from the gas lamp, which was four or five yards from the spot—he had a bushy moustache then, and looked very different to what he does now; still I feel justified in saying he is the man—he was at first looking down the area—after he looked down there he looked towards me, his eye met mine.</p>

On 22nd June I went to No. 50, Regent-street, Westminster; the name of Gillings is over the door—Gillings and Benge live in that house—it is a marine store dealer's shop—I entered by the shop, and went to the first floor back room—the door of that room was locked—I first knocked, and Benge came up stairs from the lower part of the house—I had received a key from another constable, and I put it</p>

               <p>in the door, and opened it—when Benge came up I told him I came from Mr. Minton, a metal dealer over the water, to purchase some paintings—Benge was then present; he went into the room with us—I do not believe he knew where we got the key—when I went in I found these six paintings rolled up on a box in the room—I looked at them, and asked Benge who they belonged to—he said, "To my nephew and me"—I said, "What do you want for them?"—he said, "I don't know, my nephew is out; would you call again?"—I said, "Do you live in this house?"—he said, "I do I live in the kitchen; I have lived there some time"—I then put the bolt on the door, and told him we were officers of police, and these paintings were the produce of a burglary, and I should take him in custody on suspicion of being concerned in the burglary—he said, "Oh, indeed! I am only a lodger in the house, I know nothing at all about them"—I made a search, and found three silver watches in a box in the room, and four duplicates, three of which relate to watches and a chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and printer, of No. 19. Little Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On Saturday 11th June, about the middle of the day, the prisoner Broese came to my shop (he gave me his name Buray, but not on that occasion)—he said he wanted a plate made exactly like a tracing, and produced a small piece of paper which he had back from me with the proofs—I have not seen it since, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were two pieces of paper, one was the tracing, and the other was a piece printed in red ink—he said he wanted a plate made exactly like the patterns, and inquired the price, I told him about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he did not think the person it was for was particular to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he would ask him first, and call again—he said he should very likely want a great number done perhaps 1,000, but he should want 200 at first—he then took both the papers away—as far as I can recollect of the piece he took away, it would correspond in size with the piece cut out of this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should think it would have fitted into it—I returned him the tracing, and</p>

               <p>the little bit of paper, that was to show me the kind of margin there was to be to it—he said he wanted it exactly like the tracing, and the small piece of paper that was printed in red ink, and to be very particular to do it in every respect like the red printing—at 6 o'clock on the same evening he came again with the same small piece of paper, he left the papers with me, requesting me to execute the order he had given me in the morning—I asked him his name, he wrote it down on a small piece of paper—this is it, I think (<hi rend="italic">produced, "Mr. Burai</hi>" <hi rend="italic">was written on it</hi>), he wrote it, except the first letter—I asked his address; at first he seemed surprised, and did not seem willing to give it—he did not give it, and I did not press him—I told him it was usual for strangers to leave a deposit, I should require 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he left 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he would call again on Monday and bring the remainder of the deposit and some paper that he wanted printed—he wished the paper printed from the plate—this is the paper that he brought (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he brought it on the Monday or Tuesday evening about 6 o'clock, and said he should want it printed from the plate which I was to make—he also brought a piece of paper with some writing on it; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it was brought that I might make out some of the words more distinctly—they are the same words on the tracing and on the paper, they are more legible on the paper—the letters are extremely small on the tracing—he said he should want 200 done, and should want the proofs first to show this other person—he said he would call on the following evening, Tuesday, for it; he gave me another 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a deposit, and left—on the Tuesday evening, between and 7 o'clock, he called again, the plate was then partially engraved; it was engraved from the tracing with the assistance of the letters on the paper—he examined it, and said he thought we were doing it very well—he asked when he could have a proof; I told him I would endeavour to let him have one on Thursday—on the Monday I had called on the Dutch Consul, and made a communication to him—in the proceedings I took afterwards, I acted by his directions—on the Thursday Broese called about o'clock in the evening, and asked if the proof was ready—I told him we had not finished the plate, and we would have one ready on the Friday evening for him—he left the remainder of the deposit 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and called again on the Friday evening and asked if the proof was ready—I had about a dozen of them printed, and gave ten of them to him—he examined them, and pointed out one or two necessary alterations—he said he must show them the other person, and took them away—he returned almost immediately, and asked for the small piece of paper printed in red ink; I gave it to him, and he left, saying he would call again that evening, or early the next morning—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I have got the plate I engraved; it is complete, with the exception of the alterations which the prisoner directed me to make; they were not made—the ten impressions I gave him were impressions from the plate—he spoke to me during the whole of the time in English, and seemed to understand my answers very well—I understood him very distinctly—I thought he spoke English very well for a foreigner.</p>

In consequence of a communication from Mr. Whiteman I went with him to the Consul-General of the Netherlands on 13th or 14th June—I received instructions from the Consul, and on Thursday, 16th June, went to Mr. Whiteman's shop, about 7 o'clock in the evening—I was secreted in the back parlour, and saw Broese in the shop—I remained on the spot till he came out, and then followed him out, and saw De Leenu standing still at the</p>

               <p>bottom of Great Queen-street, near Lincoln's-inn Fields—he was just on the move, almost standing still, and looking about him, about thirty or forty yards from Mr. Whiteman's shop—Broese went in that direction, but proceeded along Lincoln's Inn-fields—De Leenu followed, and when they came near Turnstile they joined company—I followed them; they walked together, apparently in conversation—when they came to the Globe Insurance, in Cornhill, Broese turned to the right, towards London-bridge, and De Leenu went in the direction of Whitechapel—I followed him, and missed him near Gulstone-street—I went again on the Friday evening to the same neighbourhood, with Inspector Shaw, and an officer named Williamson—we took up our position so that we could see Mr. Whiteman's shop—about 6 o'clock I saw Broese coming along, and pointed him out to them—he entered Mr. Whiteman's shop, and further up Little Queen-street, towards Holborn, I saw De Leenu standing on the right hand side of the way, and drew Shaw's attention to him—he was about forty yards from the shop—I saw Broese come out of the shop and go towards Holborn, towards where De Leenu stood, but he suddenly turned back again, and re-entered the shop of Mr. Whiteman, and at that time De Leenu came towards the shop, towards Great Queen-street—he continued to advance, but I lost sight of him for a short time, because I kept my eye on the door till Broese came out again, which he did in a minute or two, and turned into Great Queen-street, towards Long Acre—I went into the street, and saw the prisoners on opposite sides of the way, both going westwards—I think Broese came over to De Leenu, and then they walked in company together till they got into Long Acre, when we took them into custody—I took hold of De Leenu, and took this pocket book from his hand, in which I found one of Mr. Whiteman's cards, and the card of another engraver, in Holborn; also a note of the Bank of the Netherlands, with a piece cot out of the margin; also this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe it is in Dutch—(<hi rend="italic">this being interpreted, contained the following list of articles, with their prices</hi>: a screw, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a file, 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a leather, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; paper, 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; paint, a small piece, 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; pens, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; pencils, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; paper for notes, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; plate, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; printing, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; coupons, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; changing a note, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; ink and pumice stone, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; gum and lead, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I also found this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), on which is the tracing of part of a note (<hi rend="italic">this being read had</hi> "1000" <hi rend="italic">on the upper part, and</hi>"40" <hi rend="italic">at the bottom</hi>)—the prisoners were then taken to the station house—I told Broese he was charged with having a plate engraved to represent an Amsterdam bank note, and asked him by whose order he got it done—I told him he was not bound to answer me without he pleased—he told me that a person of the name of Smith, living in John-street, employed him to get it done—I could not make out who he meant by Smith, of John-street, and he pointed to De Leenu, and said, "That is not the man"—he did not tell me what John-street, or give me a description of the person—he declared that he did not know De Leenu, and that he had never seen him before—I asked him if he was quite sure of that—he said, "Yes"—that was in De Leenu's presence—as far as I could understand him he said he was asking De Leenu to direct him to some place, and that he was directing him, and De Leenu, at the time they were apprehended, said so also—one of them gave the address, No. 10, Tenterden-street, Whitechapel; they both said they lived there—I went to Whitechapel—I could not find Tenterden-street, but found Tenter-street—I could not ascertain correctly that Broese lived there, but I ascertained that De Leenu did—I went into a kitchen of that house, which was used as a bedroom also, and on a chest of drawers there I found this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), tied up in this way, in which I found three Amsterdam bank</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the prosecutors' firm; we are brewers at Ratcliffe. In Sept. last the prisoner came to the brewery, and said his name was Thomas Chambers, and he wanted to borrow some money; that he would deposit the assignment of the lease of a house to him in our hands, that it was a chandler's shop or corn dealer's in Felix-terrace, Liverpool-road, and he wanted money for the purpose of converting it into a beer shop—he was not selling beer at that time, I presume—having looked at the premises a day or two afterwards, I agreed to advance the money on that security—there was an agreement that he was to be supplied with his beer from our brewery—in about a week or ten days he came again, and brought the various assignments up to the tenant previous to him, and alleged as the reason for not producing the assignment to him that it was in the hands of his solicitor, to whom be owed money, and he could not bring it—he wanted a check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give his solicitor, and so bring the assignment—I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in a few days after he came again, and brought this deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then gave him these two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. checks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the rest of the money—he signed his name on the back of them, at my request—we supplied him with beer on several occasions to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the deed was to he security for the money and the beer—if I had known his name was Plum I certainly should not have advanced him the money, as beer had been supplied by the firm in 1849 to Plum, and brought away again in consequence of it not being paid for, and because we heard the character of the man—I did not know him personally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185307040058"/>
               <p>before that—before I trusted him I communicated with Mr. Larchin, a member of our firm—on 17th Dec. I gave the prisoner into custody on a charge of forging the deed—he said he had altered it from the name of Plum to Chambers, for his name was Chambers equally so with Plum—I asked him why he had done that—he said it was not my business, or he did not choose to tell me, or some answer of that sort, I cannot tell exactly—before that time I had received some information about him, and the house he was then in—I had that information at the time he was given into custody—I told him that his name was Plum, and that he was the same man that had been at the brewery in the Kingsland-road, and that we heard he was about disposing of his business—he said yes, it was quite true, he intended to dispose of it.</p>

Goddard and Eyre—I had the prisoner taken into custody again a short time ago—he was taken before Mr. Norton—he did not discharge him, I believe—I was not present—he was merely taken before Mr. Norton to be identified.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the reason that, after preferring a charge as far back as Dec, and taking him before a Magistrate, that you indict him without going before a Magistrate now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were induced by our solicitors to believe that the Magistrate's decision was incorrect—they directed us to come before the Grand Jury, and get a bill without going before a Magistrate—it would have been difficult to give him notice, for he could not be found—we learned that his name was Plum a few days before he was given into custody—we did not learn it three or four months before—I did not know his name was Plum before I made him an advance, and I believe my partner did not—he is here—I saw the person who professes to be the prisoner's landlord—I believe his name is Davis—I do not know whether he is here—I went to make inquiries of Davis before I made the advance to the prisoner—I told Davis that a person of the name of Chambers had a house of his, and wanted to borrow money, and after that I advanced him money—after I knew this to be a forgery, I asked him for an assignment of the lease—that was before I had seen my solicitor—I do not say that we should not have prosecuted him if we could have got the assignment—it is impossible to say what we should have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say you would have got this assignment from him and prosecuted him also? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think if he had fulfilled the terms of his agreement with us, that is, to assign the lease to us in default of paying the money advanced to him and for the beer, there would have been no prosecution—he had agreed to assign the lease to us, and before giving him in charge we asked him to assign the lease, and he refused—we would not have settled it if we could.</p>

Larchin, in consequence of which I went to try to get the beer away, and succeeded—I saw Plum there, he saw it taken away, and sent for the police to give us into custody, but they refused to do anything of the kind.</p>

On 24th June, the two prisoners came to my shop—I do not think I ever saw them before—I am quite sure they are the persons—I think it was between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—there was another little girl with them—Amelia Dible asked for a mourning bonnet—I served her with one—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the price of it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she paid me a sovereign; I gave her 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—Lavinia Dible then asked for a mourning bonnet—I showed her one, and she purchased it—she then purchased a small bonnet—her own bonnet was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the small bonnet 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., these are them—this cap front, and this flower she purchased afterwards—the front was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the flower 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a sovereign, I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—while they were buying the bonnets, there was a conversation between them—one of them said in presence of the other, that they had received a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go into mourning, on account of the death of an uncle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure who paid for the bonnets? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of them paid for one bonnet, and one for two, but I am not quite sure which—there was a pair of stays purchased, I believe, by Amelia—I dare say they were in my shop a quarter of an hour—these are the bonnets and stays I sold.</p>

I saw the prisoner some time before 13th March, at his home at Rushgrove-street, Woolwich—I told him I wanted him to go to a coffee shop to see if he could get some gin and tobacco—I said they were selling without a license—I took Sergeant Thompson to his house, I believe, on the Wednesday—I said to Thompson, "This is the man I was speaking to you about"—Thompson had some conversation with the prisoner about going to Rice's house—it was the same house I meant when I spoke to him first:—there was an arrangement made that the prisoner was to go to Rice's house on Sunday morning, the 13th March—the prisoner was to come to the station and meet Thompson on the Sunday morning—I saw the prisoner on Saturday night, 12th March, about 8 o'clock; I asked him if he intended to come—he said he did not know—I told him he was not forced to come, but he agreed with me that be would come the next morning—he said something about his mates hearing of it—I came with him to within about ten yards of the Marine Barrack gate—he there met his wife and went back with her—he came to the station on Sunday morning about half-past 7 o'clock—Sergeant Thompson and myself were there—I saw Thompson give him a small stone bottle in the station—he said something to him about his going down to Rice's coffee shop—he said that was the bottle to see if he could get some gin, and he gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was perfectly sober on the Saturday night and on the Sunday morning—I saw the prisoner and Thompson go out of the door of the station together—I saw the prisoner again, I believe, on the next Saturday night, either in Powis-street or Hare-street—he said he went to Rice's coffee shop, he asked for a cup of coffee, and they told him they had none, but they would give him something better—he said, "I had four glasses of gin which was drank there, and I had another glass, which I put into the bottle"—and he likewise had a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco, that he smoked a part of it there, and the other part he had brought away with him—he was quite sober—I saw him again on the Saturday afterwards, and he told me the same tale—this was on Saturday the 26th, the second Saturday after he had been to Rice's.</p>

In consequence of information from Thompson I went to the Marine Barracks, at Woolwich, on 29th March—parade was going on—Wall came to me directly after parade was over—I asked him whether he was the person who bought the spirits at Rice's—he said he was—I asked him how he obtained it—he said he went and asked for some coffee, and was answered there was no coffee, but he might have a drop of gin if he chose—he said he was admitted into the house, and he had four glasses of gin, for which he paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a glass, and half a quartern he put into a small bottle, and brought away with him which he gave to Sergeant Thompson—he told me a boy in Rice's shop took part of the gin with him, and he had also 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—I read Sergeant Thompson's statement to him; that at a quarter past 8 o'clock that day he went to the house, knocking at the door of George Rice—he asked for some coffee—the answer was he had no coffee, "You can have a drop of gin"—he went in the house, had four glasses of gin, at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a glass, and he had a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco, and a glass of gin in the bottle; the tobacco and gin I took from him—I read this to him, and asked him if that was correct—he said it was correct—I asked him whether he was sober at the time he bought the spirits, and whether he used any artifice to obtain it—he said he was perfectly sober, and he used no artifice to obtain it—I was at the George the Fourth on the morning of 28th April—I saw the prisoner there, and heard him give a statement to Mr. Dwelling—that was the morning the information was laid before Mr. Traill, the first occasion—I heard the prisoner give the information to Mr. Dwelling—it was the same statement he had made before me—I saw the prisoner again on 13th May, at the guard room of the Marine Barracks—he was working in the garden—I took him a summons to attend the second hearing against Rice on 20th May—he said he was sorry he had had anything</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as assistant to the Solicitor of Island Revenue on the occasion of preferring this information—by the statute it is necessary that there should be ten clear days' notice given before the examination—the first examination was on 28th April—I was in attendance—before I went there I went to the George the Fourth to take the evidence of the witnesses—amongst others who made a statement before me relative to the transaction the prisoner was one of them—I took the evidence that he proposed to give from his own mouth (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"On Sunday morning, 13th March, at 10 minutes past 8 o'clock, I went to the defendant's coffee house, in High-street—I found the door shut; I knocked; a man opened it; I asked for a cup of coffee—he said, 'You can have no coffee this, morning; you can have some gin'—I went in, and entered the front room—the man told me to come in the inner room—I went in, and sat down by the fire—them was a boy and girl there—the man said to the boy, 'Give him some gin'—the boy got him a glass, and he drank it—it was gin—he put down a shilling, and had 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he then had another glass, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked the boy far 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—the boy said he did not know whether ha had any, but he brought him some—that he had two more glasses of gin, he drank one, and took the other away in the bottle")—that was the substance of the evidence he gave me—this was on the morning of the day on which the first information was to be heard—he was in attendance; but on discovering that there had not been the ten days' notice given, it was necessary to withdraw that action—the defendant did not appear—in the course of the account that Wall gave me I did not discover any hesitation or apparent want of memory in his relation, not the least, and he was perfectly sober—the information was heard on 20th May before the same Magistrate, Mr. Traill—m consequence of what passed on that occasion, Mr. Traill ordered a communication to be made to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.</p>

On 6th June, about 8 o'clock in the evening, I missed a coat and waistcoat from my desk—I had seen them safe there at 12 o'clock in the day—in the pocket of the coat was a rule and some letters, and in the waistcoat a knife and a latch key—the desk was at the back of the shop.</p>
