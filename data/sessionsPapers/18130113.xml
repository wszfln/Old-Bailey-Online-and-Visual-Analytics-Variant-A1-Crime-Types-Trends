On the 24th of December, I lost a silver watch; I value it at five pounds, a gold chain, value six pounds, and a seal, one pound. It was taken from my front room two pair, in my own house. I had seen the watch in my room about twenty minutes before seven. I took it to see what o'clock it was.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130004"/>I laid it on the chest of drawers. I missed it about eleven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come out of the room - A. A few minutes before seven. I did not see the watch after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; she was a lodger in my house. On the 26th, I had a quantity of bills printed, and sent them about to the different pawnbrokers, and in about half an hour after the bills were distributed, word came from Mr. Everett, in Berner-street, that the watch was at this shop, pledged for four pounds. On the same evening I changed a one pound note for the girl's mother, and I changed her another on the 27th. On Monday morning, I took these two notes to the pawnbrokers. The lad he proved them to be two of the notes that he paid to the person that pledged the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you so - A. Yes. After that I came home to my own place, and asked the mother whether she had any more notes. She gave me another note, with the same date on it. I asked the mother, how she came by these notes. She told me, that the daughter brought the notes. I then took them to Malborough-street office. The daughter said, she took the notes of Mr. Goddard, a pill-box maker, in Noel-street, and when the prisoner found that Mr. Goddard denied given her the notes, she confessed that she went in the room and took the watch, and pledged it at Mr. Everett's, in Berner-street, for four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner encouraged by you, or any body else, to confess - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you rent the house that you live in - A. Yes, and live there with my family.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he loose these - A. About the 27th. I did not miss them until we received the duplicates from the prisoner. She was a servant to us. The prisoner absconded from us. These articles were taken at different times from us, as the duplicates will specify. On the 23d of November, I was informed by Mr. King, who keeps a tavern in the street, that our servant had been running up a bill for liquor to the amount of one pound. On the 24th I have reason to apprehend that she discovered that we had found out that she had been running a bill, by her leaving the house the next morning; and as I found that she had run that up at the public-house, I enquired at other places in the neighbourhood. I discovered that she had ran up other bills. I found out where her sister lived. I went to her sister, and after I left the sister I went home. I had not long been at home when her sister came with a letter, and fourteen duplicates. I heard, after I received the duplicates that the prisoner was in the workhouse. I sent the officer to take her.</p>

I asked her the lady's name. She said, she could not remember the lady's name. I then went to enquire of my mistress, leaving the door open, and when I had got halfway up the passage she called me back again. She asked me to remember the name for her. I told her I could not repeat the name unless she spoke it, perhaps I might know the name if she would tell me. She then hesitated, and said, some name, but what name I cannot say. I then asked her if it was Grace, a relation of my mistress. She said, it was. I then left her to acquaint my fellow servant, that she might tell my mistress. I saw no more of her after that. I acquainted my fellow servant, and went down into the kitchen, leaving the woman outside of the door, with the door open. My fellow servant went up immediately to acquaint my mistress. My mistress was up stairs. About half an hour previous to the woman's coming, I saw the coat hang in the passage; it was a good distance from the door. My master discovered the coat was missing, about ten minutes after the woman was gone.</p>

I shut the door. I went and told my mistress; she delivered me the butter. I paid her for it, and then let her out. I shut the outer door, and then went down stairs. I saw no more of her. I left her in the passage when I went up stairs to acquaint my mistress about the butter, and when I came down I found her in the passage; then she gave me the butter.</p>

I sent one of my boys for a constable. She staid in the shop: the boy came back, and told me he could not find a constable. In the mean time she went away, and came back in a short time and wanted the coat. I then went out myself and brought in a constable, and gave her in charge. I desired the constable to tell Mr. Stevens I had detained such a coat. He brought me word to bring it up to Bow-street, the next day; which I did. I marked the coat in the office. The magistrate ordered the coat to be given up to Mr. Stevens. I had the coat in my custody until it was given up. This is the mark I put upon it, and then it was delivered up to Mr. Stevens.</p>

The door was shut. The woman was alone in the passage, no one answered the door. I went and answered the door myself. There was a man standing at the door, I asked him his business. He returned me no answer. He spoke to the woman in the passage. He told her a lady over the way wanted some butter; her answer was that she had not more than would supply that house; she would serve them the next week. He then left the house and I shut the door after him. One of the maids at that time, I believe, was gone up for the money for the butter.</p>

               <p>Eleanor the wife of Patrick Hannams Defence. When I went with the butter there was a man at the door; he told me he would be half-a-crown in my way; he gave me a great coat, and told me to leave it at a public-house, the corner of Wild-street. It was a man that had been buying soap or candles in the house, and my selling butter there, Mr. Stevens was positive, he said, I was the person that had taken the coat. I never saw the coat until the man give it me.</p>
               <p>Eleanor the wife of James Hannam's Defence. This woman told me to go to Mrs. Stephens's to ask for a bundle my sister had left there. We are both married to two brothers. Mrs. Stephens gave me the coat. My sister told me to pawn the coat, and to bring her the money; accordingly I went to Mr. Rossiter's. I being known there, I thought I could get more money there than at any other place. Mr. Rossiter had some suspicion of the coat; he stopped it. He told me to go. I thought it was too bad to go back to this woman, she being in custody, without money or coat. I went back to Mr. Rossiter, and he gave charge of me, as I would not go without either money or the coat.</p>

            , esq. On Tuesday the 15th of December, about eleven o'clock in the evening, my fellow servant and me were going to put the horses to; they were job horses. Mr. Brougham's footman was going to put a great coat into the carriage; he called to me, and said both doors were open, and the steps were let down. Immediately I run to look for the door glasses, and found they were both taken out, and as I was going to tell Mr. Kinley, the hackneyman of the yard, I saw the prisoner walk from the carriges directly. I run, and laid hold of him. I asked him, who he was. He said, what is that to you. I asked him, where the coach glasses were that were taken out of my carriage. He said, he knew nothing at all about them. I said, I think you are a thief, and I will secure you. He had both his hands at liberty; he pulled his breeches down. He said, he had been to ease himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him take his breeches down, did you - A. Yes. I asked him, where. He pointed towards the carriage where the glasses had been taken out. I then got more help. I got him well secured. I took a candle to look whether there was any such thing done, where he pointed to; there was not; and as I returned back I found the two glasses standing by the off side of Mr. Brougham's carriage, and the strings were cut off. These are the strings; I found them in the yard. There was nobody in the yard, when I collared the prisoner, but me, my fellow-servant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130007"/>and the prisoner, nor had there been for some time before. It was in the back yard. It is no thoroughfare.</p>

I told the coachman. He said, he would see whether the glasses were gone. He came, and saw they were, and he saw the prisoner going away from the carriage. The coachman went and took hold of him; he asked him, who he was. He was very impertinent. He said, he was a gentleman. The coachman asked him, where his glasses were. He said, he did not know. He said, he had been in the yard to ease himself. He had not got his breeches down when the coachman took hold of him. He unbuttoned them afterwards. The coachman took the candle and lanthorn, to see if he could find any such thing done. He could not find any such thing. There was only me, the coachman, and the prisoner, in the yard.</p>

She agreed for four shillings, and I was to stop with her. I sat down in a chair. She asked me to take off my top coat. I took my coat off, and threw it across a chair, which was a little distance from me, and in a minute or so after, the prisoner said she wanted to go out. She went out. She said she would return in the course of a minute. I waited in the room half an hour. She did not return. I then took my hat to go home. I went to the chair to look for my coat; it was gone. I looked all over the room; I could not find it. I staid in the room two or three hours, and then went home. The next day I went to Bow-street for an officer. The officer told me to look out early of a morning. On Tuesday morning, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come to her door. I told her she was the woman that had taken my coat from me on the Sunday evening. She said that she never saw me nor my coat before that morning. She said, she had been at Wapping on the week before, and she did not return home till Monday night. I took her myself to Bow-street. She afterwards told me she had pawned the coat.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Armstrong, pawnbroker, Baldwin's-gardens. On last Monday week, the prisoner pawned a great coat with me for one pound. I am sure the prisoner is the woman. This is the coat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my coat. I made the coat myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the young man came up in my room I asked him, what he was going to give me. He said, he had no money. I said, I am an unfortunate girl, I must have money. He then said, he would leave me his coat. He took his coat off, and said he would call in a day or two. On Tuesday morning he came and said, come along with me to Bow-street. I took him to the pawnbrokers, where I had pawned the coat. I am innocent of robbing him of his coat.</p>

On Saturday evening, about half past seven in the evening, in the beginning of December, I cannot say the day of the month, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I had a pair of second hand shoes. He looked at two or three pair of shoes. He paid me four shillings for a pair. I had just put out of my hand a pair of new shoes to serve him, and as soon as the prisoner went out of the shop I missed them. I had nobody in the shop but a bricklayer and a carpenter that were doing work for me. On the Sunday following the prisoner came past my shop. I asked him where he lived. He said, if I followed him I might see where he lived. I followed him. In the course of ten minutes afterwards, the prisoner and his wife came to my door. The prisoner abused me very much. I then told him, if he abused me much more, I would charge an officer with him. I was almost sure that he took them, though I did not see him take them.</p>

I was in company with another constable; that constable is since dead. The prisoner passed me. I perceived that he had something concealed under his coat. I stopped him, and asked him, what he had. He replied, nothing. Yes, said I, you have nothing. I opened his coat, and found these pieces of brass underneath his coat. I took him into a house, and searched him. He had one of these two pieces of brass-in his breeches pocket, this piece of brass in his waistcoat pocket, and this piece of brass in his hat, wrapped up in his pocket handkerchief. I immediately took him in custody, and found out where he worked, and where the property was stolen from.</p>

About half past two at noon, on Sunday last, I saw the prisoner go up a gentleman's gateway; after being there about five or six minutes, he came out, and went up Mr. Ponder's gateway. After being there about five or six minutes, I shut him in. He was there about seven or eight minutes. He, by some means, got the gate open again; he came out with the great coat under his arm, and the hat and umbrella in his hand. I collared him, and took him up the gateway, to Mr. Ponder's private door. I knocked at the door, Mr. Ponder came down to the dour, and owned the property. This is the great coat, hat, and umbrella.</p>

            . I am a furniture-broker, Castle-street, Long Acre. The prisoner applied to me to purchase this piece of oil-cloth, on the 23st of December. I went and looked at it, and purchased it. He applied to me a day or two after, to know whether I could purchase another piece. I told him, I could not, unless I knew where it came from, to know whether it was stolen property. A person was sent with it. The prisoner told me he brought it from Whitechapel-road, and on the second piece of cloth coming to my house, I went down to Mr. Hayward, and asked him if he had lost any property. I am sure the prisoner is the man. He delivered the second piece, but not personally. This is the piece of floor-cloth I paid for; and I received it of the prisoner.</p>

On the 17th of December, I lost two pair of men's shoes, and two pair of women's shoes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130010"/>and three odd ones. The two pair of women's shoes were hanging up against two panes of glass in the window, and the two pair of men's shoes were in the window.</p>
               <p>When did you miss them - A. About six, or a few minutes before six o'clock, on the 17th of December last.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suppose that the prisoner was the person that took the shoes - A. I was at work in my shop. I was alarmed by a woman coming in, and saying there were three persons-lurking about my shop; one of them, she said, was a big man; he sat at the end of the window, and the other were two lads. There is a place outside of my shop where you may rest a bundle. I got up and looked, and then I set down to my work again; then my little boy cried out, father, father, there is a man's hand in the window. I looked round, and saw my wife take the prisoner in custody; she said, you are the man I want. I went and took him by the collar, and dragged him into the shop. I immediately went to the window to search for what shoes were missing. I found those missing that I have mentioned, and three odd shoes.</p>
               <p>MRS. STEPHENS. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 17th of December, between five and six o'clock, in consequence of the alarm made by the woman, I stood on the step. I heard my son say, father, the man's hand is in the window. I then saw the prisoner's hand in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise of breaking of the glass - A. No; the window was cracked. As soon as my child spoke to his father, I saw him draw his hand back. He dropped the shoes, and when he drawed his hand back; I took him by the collar, and I said, you are the man I want, and with the assistance of my husband I got him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any more than one shoe found - A. Not by the window. We have got that shoe here; it is one of the odd shoes.</p>
               <p>- TOWNSHEND. I am an officer. I took the prisoner in custody. I searched him, and found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are three odd shoes; they were found in the window. The fellows of these three were taken and gone. The shoe that the prisoner dropped fell in the window. The two pair of men's shoes, and two pair of women's shoes, and the three odd shoes, were entirely gone. I can speak to these three odd shoes; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was stopping by the window to see a man strike a light; this woman came out, and said, where are the shoes. I said, what shoes. She said, the shoes that I took out of the window. She directly collared me, and took me into the shop.</p>

            . Q. Did you lose a great coat on the 10th of December last - A. Yes. The prisoner, on the 9th came to my landlady, and enquired for a lodging. He went to bed about eight o'clock, on the 9th, in the same room with me, but in another bed. He got up the next morning about six o'clock; I got up a few minutes before seven o'clock. I returned to breakfast about eight o'clock, and I missed my great coat from off the bed. The prisoner told me that he had pawned my coat at Islington. I went to his mother's on the Sunday, and there the prisoner gave me the duplicate. The constable took him in custody. The pisoner owned to me that he did the robbery.</p>

The prisoner seemed frightened; he asked, if we wanted the basket. We said, we wanted him and the basket too. I asked him, where he was going with it. He said to a chandler's shop a long way off there. There were five quartern loaves in the basket, and six halves.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I saw the basket and the bread at the magistrate's. The magistrate told me I had better take them home; they would be spoiled. I have one of the loaves here. The basket had my master's name on it, and the bread my master's mark, all of it.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of December, he came in, and asked to see the horse. I permitted him to see the horse. The horse was in a stable at the back of the house, and when the prisoner returned I was in the back parlour with my master's son, and on the prisoner's passing through the shop I observed him put something into a bag. A woman came into the shop; the prisoner then came to me; he said, a woman is in the shop; I think you had better serve her; and while I served the woman, he quitted that part of the shop where he had taken the lasts, and got to the further end of the shop, and after I had served the woman I told the prisoner I did not like his transactions; I was entrusted in Mr. Gotch's shop as a confidential servant, and that he had put some of my master's property into his bag. He said, he had not. I ordered him to empty his bag. At first he hesitated, and afterwards he turned out of his bag these two pieces of leather and five wooden lasts. Three lasts out of the five were thrown among the new lasts. These two I can speak to. And after he turned them out of his bag he denied they had been in the bag. He had these two pieces of leather, five lasts, and a pigs head, and two small-clothes in the bag. The lasts and the pieces of leather came out first.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he denied that - A. Yes, but I saw him turn it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you say they are your master's property - A. Only by his taking them from the new lasts by the side of my master's cutting-board, and my master has a great deal of leather like this.</p>

            . On the night of the 8th of January I was at the King's Head; the prisoner came in and called for a pint of porter. He placed himself down in a box, and put a pint pot behind him. Not the pot he was drinking out of. The landlord brought him a pipe of tobacco. He gave the landlord the money for the pint of beer and the pipe of tobacco, and in mistake he gave the landlord a sixpence for a farthing, which the landlord returned, and on my seeing him put the pot behind him I took up the newspaper, and while I was reading the newspaper I saw him put the pint pot in his pocket, under his great coat. I went and informed the landlord of it. I thought he had not used the landlord well, after he returned him the sixpence to put a pint pot in his pocket. The prisoner observed me tell the man of it; then he got up to the further corner of the box, against the window. He took the pint pot out of his pocket. I told him he had used the landlord ill. I called the landlord in, and told him the man that I had told him had put a pint pot in his pocket, he had taken it out, and had put it behind him. I saw him put it behind him. The prisoner said, the pot is behind me, but it was here before I came in. I saw he wanted to take the pint pot out of his pocket, as he moved, and I moved on purpose to see him take the pint pot out of his pocket. The pot was delivered to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The pot was delivered to me; it has my own name upon it. The magistrate asked me if I saw the pot taken from his person. I said, no; the pot was on the table when I came in. The prisoner said he took it from behind him. The magistrate then said he had better hold his tongue. It is my pot. It is worth fourteen pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About six o'clock I went into the Nag's Head, I had a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco. Pocock said to me, are not you a villian. What for, said I. He said, I had a pint pot of the landlord's. I am innocent of the charge. I did not know that the pot was behind me at all.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 24th of December last, about half past nine in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Marston's house. I watched him into a public-house, the corner of Wych-street. He did not stay there. When he came out he crossed over to Newcastle-street; I tapped him on the shoulder; I told him, I wanted to speak to him. He ran away from me; I ran after him, and catched him by his collar. I then took him to the watchhouse. He then confessed that he had two pair of stays about him. I searched his person, I found two pair of stays inside of his breeches, and about three quarters of a yard of calico in his coat pocket, which he confessed to be his master's. He said, he had been robbed himself a few days before, of nine shillings, and that he had taken his master's property to replace that. These are the stays.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my stays; they have my private marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These stays are my own goods; I cut them out at my leisure hours at my lodgings. I took the stays to my master's shop to prop them off with the hot irons, having no opportunity I withdrew my attention. At the watchhouse I was so confused I did not know what I said.</p>

I asked him, where he had got it. He said, he had found it on the ground. I brought him towards Mr. King; supposing it was stolen from him, and Mr. King's man owned it.</p>

I went there on the 8th, about twelve at noon. I took five one-pound notes in my pocket-book, which was in my inside pocket, in the lower part of my coat. I particularly marked the notes with my initials, and on my return I found they were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mark them - A. From my suspicion that I had of the person, having lost notes three times before. I went up stairs to have my hair cut. I sat down with my back to the fire. I took off my coat, as usual. I had been there many times before. After having my hair cut and dressed, I put on my coat again, and on my return down stairs, I found my pocket-book was in the same place, but no notes. The pocket-book was in my pocket, but the notes were taken out. I communicated it to the officer, who was below, and my friend. I had an officer below, who saw me place the notes in my pocketbook, and waited my return. The officer immediately proceeded up stairs with me, and charged the prisoner with having taken the notes, which he denied for some time. The officer began to search him and declared he would find the notes if they were in the house after his denying some little time he pointed to a box near the fire, which a cat was sitting upon. The officer opened the box and found the notes exactly as they had been in my pocketbook. They had never been opened. The officer took him in custody.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wilson. On the 10th of December, about four in the afternoon; the prisoner came into the shop. I saw him take a pair of shoes off the shelf; he put them behind him, and when he had an opportunity he put them into his pocket. I then acquainted my fellow servant of it, and he acquainted my master; then he sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he come in for something - A. About a fortnight before he left a deposit for a pair of boots he frequently came to see if the boots were ready, but he never thought proper to take them away. When the prisoner was going out of the door I secured him, and held him until the officer came.</p>
               <p>- LEE. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner. In his great coat pocket I found these shoes. Mr. Wilson said, they were his shoes. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are my shoes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the dwelling-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen - A. On the 17th of last December, at the hour of near two at night. My wife awoke me, and I was some time insensible. I was between sleeping and awaking. She said, she heard a noise as though some one was breaking in; being market morning I gave no credit to what she said. I believed it to be the horns of the cattle, which struck against the shutter bar. I was going to sleep again. She prevailed upon me to rise. In about a quarter of an hour she heard a crack in the shop. I arose in bed, and saw a light in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your bed then - A. In the back parlour. I coughed, thinking it might alarm whoever it was, had the light, I expected, would be put out in consequence, and my wife coughed. The light was not extinguished by our coughing, as I supposed it would be. I thought it not prudent to go out, on account I did not know how many there might be there, therefore I drove my fist through the window, in the frame of the parlour. The light, by that alarm, was extinguished, and I immediately went through the parlour door, towards the shop door, and on opening the street door I brushed the prisoner's clothes near the door. I took hold of the prisoner by my right hand by his left collar, and not knowing whether there were any others in the shop I believe I went out first, dragging the prisoner with me. We were struggling together between five and ten minutes; I calling watch. We got just on the entrance of Smithfield when the watchman came up. I gave the prisoner into custody of two officers, who are here, who conveyed him back into the shop, and on searching the premises no one else was found. We looked to see where he got in. He got in under the window, where we put the shutters in day time. It is wood work where he got in; the outside is a small door, a bolt at the top and bottom, and a lock in the middle. He forced it by punching back the lock. He by that means contrived to secret himself in the cavity, between that door and the other door. My wife thought she heard him for three quarters of an hour. When I got out of bed I was quite naked, except my shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house down Long-lane - A. I believe it to be five or six houses.</p>

            . I was night constable. On the 7th of December, the prisoner was brought in by the watchman and the prosecutor. I took the charge, and put him in the Compter. I went back to the house, and saw the place where he broke into. The outer door had a lock in the middle, and a bolt at the top and bottom. He had forced the wood work all away.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going round my beat, a quarter before two. In coming through the close I had a pair of gates to open, to let myself into Smithfield. I heard the cry of, watch. The cattle being on the pavement. I made the best of my way to Long-lane, and at the end of Long-lane, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner. The prisoner was endeavoring to get away. I catched hold of the prisoner. I conveyed him back to the premises he had broken in. I searched the place. He broke in underneath the window, where they put the shutters in the day time, in a kind of a box, There is a kind of a door to it outside. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130014"/>forced open the door, and got into the shop by forcing the partition right off. I detained him in the shop until the prosecutor dressed himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been taken in the shop - A. Nothing had been taken. Then I conveyed him to the watchhouse, and gave him into the charge of the constable</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming past there between one and two o'clock, going to Smithfield-market. The prosecutor was at the door: as I went past he catched hold of me. I know nothing more about it.</p>

I got out of bed; I shoved up my window. A person that lived in the market told me that my shop door was open. I opened my room door; the first thing that I saw was a square of glass taken out of a casement at the back of my house. I went down stairs with a light in my hand, and found my street door open, and my back door also. I looked for the key of my shop; that was gone from the place where I generally left it. The shop is not at my house; it is in Fleet-market. I went to my shop. I saw this bundle of halfpence in this apron, which apron I believe belonged to the prisoner. It is not mine. It had a tablecloth covered over it. I went into the little room behind my shop, and found these tools, which tools belongs to the prisoner. They say he is a cabinet-maker. My cupboard that we left the halfpence in; that was broken open, and a drawer likewise that had halfpence in it.</p>

I never left the shop until Mr. Beadle came. Mr. Beadle and I went into the shop. There were these chissels and halfpence, and a cloth over them.

On Saturday night, I left some halfpence in the shop, in a corner cupboard, and in a drawer. I do not know the exact quantity. He had not got quite the whole of them. When I came there on Monday morning, I found the cupboard door bursted open, and likewise the drawer. I found these four chissels close by the cupboard on the bench. They had used one of them to force open the cupboard and the drawer. I found the halfpence against the door, propped up in this apron to the amount of two pounds thirteen shillings and a penny. The apron is not mine. I never saw it before. I found the prisoner in the saw-dust bin.</p>

               <p>Q. Had these gentlemen lost any of these wayling pieces - A. Yes. The wayling pieces of timber are tied together with ropes. We missed several of them. I went to Shears's. At Shears's I found three pieces of wayling, one piling, and one pile-head. Shears's premises, where I found these things, is No. 9, Shire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of anything Shears said to you did you go to a man of the name of Denny - A. Yes; and in consequence of what Denny said, I went to the prisoner. The prisoner said, they were small pieces floating on the river, and he thought them not of much consequence.</p>
               <p>- DENNY. Q. Did you sell any pieces of timber to Shears - A. I did; the pieces of timber that were produced at Bow street. I bought them of the prisoner about a week, or better, before they were in possession of Shears. I live in Shire-lane, Temple-bar. In the morning, a little after eight, this timber was put up against my place. The prisoner was with them. He asked me, whether I would buy them. I asked him, whether they were his property. He told me, that he took them up in the river, and that they were his privilege. I gave him two pounds sixteen shillings for the five pieces. There were two more pieces. I gave three pounds five shillings and six pence for the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shears. There were five pieces of timber found at your house - A. Yes. I bought them of the last witness, Denny. I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS. I am a Bow-street office patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on last Sunday, about three o'clock. I told him, I apprehended him for selling some timber to Mr. Denny. He said, he picked it up somewhere about Blackfriars-bridge.</p>

There was only one common stair-case</p>


               <p>Q. There were some rooms under the shop I suppose - A. Yes, a kitchen, and a coal-cellar. The kitchen was in the occupation of Mr. Wright, and I had the privilege to use it. Mr. Wright did not had in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. But he rented these apartments for the use of and your family and his business - A. Yes. Nobody slept in the kitchen. There was a pantry adjoining the coal-cellar, which was in the prisoner's possession, and the coal-cellar was in the prisoner's possession.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the names of the prisoner's servants that used to sleep in the house. Do you know a man of the name of Praston and a man of the name of Whitehead - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether they slept in it any part of the week preceding the fire - A. No; I cannot. On the 11th of November, the day the fire happened, I went to bed about half after eleven o'clock. I had not left any fire in any of my apartments. We generally have a fire in my front room two pair of stairs, and that was out before I went to bed. My children were in bed before me; my wife and I went to bed together. About a quarter before three in the morning, the first thing that called my attention was the cry of fire, and the rattles. On my being disturbed, I opened the front window and looked out, and saw the sparks came over the house. The sparks seemed to come from the back of the house into <placeName id="t18130113-35-crimeloc195">Newgate-street</placeName>

After I had opened the window and saw the sparks come over the house, I then went and opened my sitting-room door which leads to the staff-case. There is a window there that you can see the back part of the house. I could see the fire from the landing-place, from Mr. Smiths accompting-house. It came right through the sky-light of the accompting-house. It broke through the glass. Then I went into my bedroom, and told Mrs. Finch the house was on fire. She took two children and I took one. I went to get out at the top of house; that was fastened. I did not succeed. Then I went to the front garret door, where Miss. Rose lodged. I found I could not get out there; then I came down stairs. On my coming down stairs I saw Mrs. Smith, she opened her bedroom door; she had a lamp in her hand. She was dressed with a bonnet and gown on. She appeared dressed in her usual way.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you judge from her appearance whether her clothes had been hurried on in haste - A. They had not appearanes of that. She appeared in her usual dress as in the day. I then proceeded down stairs, and opened the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it - A. Not at all, it was shut to with a common spring lock; no bolts were shot. As soon as I opened the street door, the people came in and took the children. I then went back, up stairs, and the men followed me up stairs, but who they were I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner's wife - A. She came down stairs nearly the same time with my wife.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130017"/>The fire was very rapid at the time that we came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you got down stairs did the stairs tumble in - A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I was down.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be from the time you discovered your danger and made your escape - A. Not more than twenty minutes when the stairs fell in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Between your being alarmed and the stairs falling in - A. Yes; I think, about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When first you came down stairs did you discover where the fire came from - A. I think through the window. I could see the flames coming right through the sky-light, in Mr. Smith accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the shop on fire - A. Yes. I was on the spot. I saw the whole of it consumed.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you before, I believe, since you know who was in the house - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner's child in the course of the day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of knowing whether the child slept in the house that night - A. No, I had not. I had not seen the child in the course of that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The first alarm that you had of fire was somewhere about three o'clock in the morning - A. A quarter before three.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the fire you observed was a very rapid fire - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the probability would be that the fire would been it down in half an hour - A. Not so soon at that; about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived in the house - A. About thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that Mr. Smith had another house in Hounsditch - A. I understood that he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he slept at that house sometimes, and sometimes at home - A. I cannot say. I do not know whether he slept out, nor do I know whether he was at home that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mrs. Smith - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She we understand is since dead - A. Yes, she is. I saw her come out of her bed-room with a lamp in her hand, alight. I knew very little of Mrs. Smith; she was sometimes sober and sometimes intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In what state was Mrs. Smith that night - A. I think she was in liquor that night. The fire was backwards, in Mr. Smith's accompting-house.</p>

               <p>Q. In what room had you any fire in the house - A. In our sitting-room; the front room two pair of stairs, adjoining our bed-room. We raked that fire out before we went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, when you came out of your chamber, did you see Mrs. Smith - A. Mrs. Smith came out of her chamber nearly at the time we opened our bed-room door. She was dressed completely. I was in a great fright. She did not appear alarmed as I saw. We went up stairs first; we could not make our escape up stairs; we came down stairs and escaped, and as I came down stairs I saw the fire in Mr. Smith's accompting-house. That room projects beyond the upper part of the house. It is behind the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. As you came down in the passage did you find the shop on fire - A. I did not. I made my escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire in your room, or on your story, when you were alarmed - A. None in the least.

               <p>Q. Then the persons in the house that night was Miss Rose, in the room over you; yourself, your husband, and three children, in your own room - A. Yes, and Mrs. Smith in the room behind mine. I know of no other persons being in the house that night. I was not intimate with Mrs. Smith. I never entered her apartment. She had the appearance of frequently being intoxicated.</p>

On the night on the fire I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and between two and three I was alarmed by the noise in the street. I slept in the front of the house, in the three pair. On my being alarmed, I looked out of my window, and saw the fire flying over the top of the house. I afterwards went to the back part of the house; I observed the fire come from the back part of Mr. Smith's house, from the place where he used to keep the coals; the cellar underneath the parlour, or accompting-house, he had; immediately underneath the sky-light parlour. I alarmed my family.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it before the house was entirely distroyed - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning after the the fire did you see the prisoner any where - A. I did, in my own house. He came there betwixt eight and nine; a man came in with him. They were talking together. The prisoner sat down, and seemingly affected. He burst into tears. The prisoner asked me whether I could give him some breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your house is next door to his house; are you the tenant of that house - A. I have a lease on my house.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time before the fire-happened had you observed any thing taken away from the prisoner's shop - A. I saw a bundle taken away between eleven and twelve at night. It might be two or three weeks before the fire. The bundle was as large as a man could carry.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were these things removed - A. By two of his men. One of the men's name was Whitehead. I cannot say the name of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a public-house - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you let out beds at any time - A. I do.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130018"/>At the time the fire happened, Whitehead slept at my house.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he been in the habit of sleeping at his master's; was it two or three years - A. I cannot say. He had been a long time there; how long I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You lived next door to Mr. Smith. Did you know Mr. Smith and his wife - A. Yes, very well. Mrs. Smith would drink a little. I have seen her a little intoxicated five or six times, and I have seen a lamp burning in her passage, and I have put it out. I did not think any danger in the lamp burning, but I always put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the fire was about half after two - A. Yes, somewhere about that time. The fire was not very rapid when I first saw it. I suppose it had not long broke out. When I first saw the flames they were bursting through the windows in the area at the back part of the house. Where the fire first began I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner carrying on a pretty extensive business - A. Apparently he did. He had a large stock for a <rs id="t18130113-35-deflabel197" type="occupation">tailor</rs>

            . I am a lamp-lighter in Newgate-street, and in that neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. In the night of the 11th of November, or rather the morning of the 12th, were you in Newgate-street - A. About a quarter before three in the morning I was in Newgate-street; I saw the appearance of fire behind Mr. Smith's house. I knocked at Mr. Plummer's door first, Mr. Smith's door next, and then at Mr. Bull's. I got first into Mr. Bull's house. I went backwards. I found the fire coming out of a kind of an area in Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it set fire to any thing of Mr. Bull's - A. Yes, the wooden partition that was between Mr. Bull's premises and Mr. Smith's was on fire. I throwed about two pails and a half of water on it; then I asked for more. I took a poker, and went to Mr. Smith's house. I broke one of the pannels of the shop door. I got the door open. At first, the shop was full of smoke; the smoke dispersed on my opening the door. I found four patent lamps on the counter, which I took away. They were not alight. There was a great fire at the back of the house. The fire was burning very rapidly. I got my fellow-servant to get me a ladder, and as I was going up to the one pair of stairs window the ladder fell. I fell down and broke the bone of my arm. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>MRS. LONDON. I was employed as a char-woman by the prisoner. I was employed by him some time before the fire. I used to light the fires. I usually fit two fires; one in the shew room, and the other in the kitchen. I sometimes lighted the fires with turpentine wood, and sometimes plain wood. I bought the bundles of wood at Mr. Newman's, in Newgate-street. My mistress gave me the money. I had seven bundles for sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use shavings - A. Never. I never saw any shavings in the house in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there the day before the fire - A. I was. I lit two fires on the Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you quit the house on that day - A. I quitted the house twenty-five minutes after ten, exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. This shop of Mr. Newman's, where you bought the wood, is a regular oil shop - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the kitchen below stairs, where you lit the fire - A. A good sized kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a safe grate - A. Very, so far as I know. I left a good fire in the morning. I left the house about twenty-five minutes after ten.</p>

               <p>Q. Within a few days before the fire happened, had you sold any shavings to Mr. Smith - A. I sold him one sack in the fore part of that week. I put them in the cellar, in the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The fire happened on the Wednesday, then that must be on the Monday or Tuesday - A. Yes. I sold him one other sack the night before the fire happened. I took the second sack into the cellar where I took the first. I did not see any of the shavings that I had taken before. The last sack I took was between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, before dark. Mr. Smith ordered the shavings, and he paid me. He asked me the first time for two. I had but one, and therefore I took the second afterwards. I was at work at Dr. Ford's house. I never sold any shavings to Mr. Smith before. I used to sell them to the pastry-cook. Mr. Smith asked me to let him have some shavings to light his fire with, as soon as I had made them. I told him I would let him have them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the fire that happened in Newgate-street - A. I do. On the evening of the 10th of November, the prisoner called at my shop, between eight and nine, after dark. He desired to have a gallon of turpentine. He brought with him a stone bottle. I told him the price was fifteen shillings per gallon. He said, he knew it was high, but he had given more. The turpentine I measured myself, and put it in the bottle. He told me to tie a leather over the cork, and then he enquired if we sold pitch. I told him, we did. He then enquired if we had any in seven pounds bags. I told him, we had not; I would put it in seven pound bags; if he wished to have it put up in that manner I would do it for him. He then ordered three seven-pound bags, and while the pitch was cutting up he took the bottle of turpentine, and went away with it. He said, he would return for the pitch. I asked him, if he would allow me to send the turpentine home. He said, no, there was no occasion for that; he was tolerably strong; he would carry it himself He then went away. He was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. When he returned for the pitch I was not quite ready. He was waiting in the shop; he saw some links in the shop; he then said, do you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130019"/>sell links. I said, we did. He said, he would take two of them. He took two, and desired to have them cut in half, which was done. He had three bags of pitch; and four half links tied up together in a coarse cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you would have made no charge if one of your servants carried them home - A. Oh, dear, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the fact, whether he was acquainted that you knew him - A. I recollected him, from frequently seeing him standing at his own shop door. He might know me. I have no reason to suppose that he knew me. He had never dealt with me before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Newman perhaps, that keeps a shop in Newgate-street - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I should think that oil, and such sort of things might be purchased thdre - A. There is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know whether he deals in pitch and links - A. I do not know, but it is customary; most oil and colourmen do sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the length of one of them links - A. About eighteen inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not extraordinary to have them cut in half - A. I think not, sometimes; for the little boys, who cannot raise money enough for a whole one, we cut them in half.</p>

            . I live in Butcher-row, East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been acquainted for some time with the prisoner - A. About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you belong to the same lodge of Masons that he did - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that lodge occasionally meet at the Horns, Doctors' Commons - A. Some of the members, not the lodge. It is called the Royal Arch-chapel. It is a branch of the lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made an appointment before the 11th of November to meet the prisoner on the night of the 11th - A. I had seen Mr. Smith on the night of the 11th. I believe I told him that the chapel would assemble on the 11th. I told him if it would be convenient for him to attend he would receive that part of masonry that he had not received before. Mr. Smith replied, he did not know that it would be convenient to attend; he would, if possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, yourself, go to the Horns that night - A. I did. The prisoner did not attend. I left the Horns a little after one o'clock in the morning. The prisoner was at my house that night. I found him there when I returned, about nine o'clock. I learned from one of his men that he would be at my house. When I went home I found the prisoner at my house and two men, Gardner and Pratton. The prisoner had a small dog with him, a white curly French dog.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay at your house - A. I believe until four in the morning. They had taken rump steaks and oyster sauce. Mr. Smith drank a good deal. He was rather tipsey. He wanted to sleep in the house. I told him, I had not a bed empty; I would send the patrol to see him home. I called the patrol, and told him I would give him half-a-crown to see him home. Mr. Smith was so drunk. I sent the patrol home with him. I have known Mr. Smith two years. I have heard him spoken of as a man of character and good repute.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, in Newgate-street. My house was within two doors of the prisoner's. Two or three days after the fire, he sent his servant to my house. The prisoner and me met at the King's Head by appointment. He wished to have the bottom part of my house. He said, he had heard I was going to leave it. I told him, I could not treat with him, for it, because the reports in the neighbourhood were very unfavourable. I told him, the reports in the neighbourhood were, that he had been buying pitch and turpentine of Mr. Bull in Fleet-market. He hesitated for some time. I concluded by that hesitation, that it was no such thing. I said, you had better go to Mr. Bull, and explain this thing, and clear up your character, He said, we would go to Mr. Bull's.

             was present. We asked him if he could accout for the fire, whether he suspected any body owed him a grudge. He said, nobody did owe him a grudge. He was pressed very closely whether there was any thing of a combustible nature on the premises. He said, he would now mention what he had never done to any soul before, that he had bought a night or two before the fire a gallon of turpentine, and twenty-one pounds of pitch; that was all. A little after that I was left alone with him; pressed him further about the fire. He said, he had bought two links; after that, he said, he bought them of Mr. Bull, in Fleet-market. I asked him for what purpose he could have bought these things, and having them in the house. He said, they were on the premises at the time of the fire, and the turpentine was to mix up with paint, to paint his back parlour and back bed-room of Newgate-street, and his houses at Bow. The pitch was to pitch a trough, and some spouts at Bow, and that they were put in the coal-hole the pitch, turpentine, and the links. The links were to give a light while the work was done in the cellar at Bow. They were for some work which he intended to do at Bow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether there were any other combustibles - A. I told him these things would not do it of themselves, without there were something else applied to them. He said, there were a few shavings in the coal-hole, and in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention how the shavings were placed with respect to the trupentine - A. He said they could not communicate together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether there was any fire in the kitchen, below, that afternoon - A. He said there was not any in the kitchen the whole afternoon. That was as Mrs. Smith told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time he had left his home that night - A. About half after nine at night. He said, when he went out there was not sufficient fire to warm a little milk or beer for his wife. He said, that Mrs. Smith was the only person belonging to him that was at home at the time of the fire. He put the lamps out before he left home. He also said, that his policy and all his papers were burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, the prisoner said that he would mention one thing that he had not mentioned to any soul before; what was the day that he mentioned that - A. The 20th of November; nine days after the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he supped that night before the fire - A. He said, he supped at Mr. Thorn's, Butcher-row, East Smithfield; and that he usually spent his evening out. He went to Mr. Thorn's to treat two of his men with a supper. He frequently treated his men with a supper; he had done it twenty times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he went to that house - A. He said he went there to serve his friend. He had never spent three evenings before at Mr. Thorn's. I asked him the name of his tenant at Bow. He said, Nelson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you quite correct in his saying, I will now tell you what I never told any soul before - A. I am. Them were his very words, as if he was conveying information that was not known before.</p>

            . I am the messenger of the office. I delivered the policy at Mr. Williams's, Newman-street, Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is the evidence on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>COURT. Does the prisoner choose to say any thing for himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are a few remarks I have here, if your lordship will permit the officer of the Court to read it.</p>
               <p>(Read.)</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentleman of the jury, I stand here accused of a crime of the greatest magnitude and enormity, and of which, if I am guilty, it must be under circumstances of the greatest atrocity; for, if I am guilty of setting my house on fire, I must at the same time have contemplated the murder of my wife, a woman to whem I had been married nearly twenty years, and who was the mother of my child. That I am not this monster, I trust I shall be able to satisfy you of, by the most convincing evidence.</p>
               <p>In cases of this nature, one naturally looks to the inducement of the commission of the crime. In my case there could not be any inducement for my committing it. My circumstances and situation were flourishing, no one ever clamoured at my house for money, and I was always prepared to meet every demand on me, long before the day of payment arrived; and it is a fact, that the whole of the demand I had to meet, from the time this unfortunate accident happened, until the Christmas following, (a space of upwards of six weeks), did not exceed three hundred pounds; and the probable receipts of my shop, during the same space of time, upon a comparison with the receipts of the preceding year, during the same period, would have amounted to three times that sum. The fire happened on the 11th of November. On the 4th, I made a payment of one hundred pounds; on the 5th, I paid my rent to Michaelmas, amounting to thirty-five pounds. At the time I made this latter payment, I was in possession of several hundred pounds, in money; which my landlord's clerk noticed, and is here ready to prove, but I am sorry to add, that this fell a prey to the flames. The time of year at which the fire happened was most particularly unfortunate, for the two months previous to Christmas may be considered as the harvest of our business, you may judge then, whether I would have chosen such a time of the year to effect my purpose, had I intended to set fire to my house.</p>
               <p>My prosecutors affect to throw a suspicion as to the amount of the property on my premises, because, previous to my removing my insurance to the Atlas office, I had been insured to the amount of one thousand pounds only, on my stock in trade, at the Globe office; whereas, I increased my insurance on stock, in the Atlas office, to two thousand pounds. This can be only an affectation on the part of the prosecutors, because they had every opportunity of satisfying themselves on the subject. They have examined my servants as to my property, and they are here now to be examined by you, and from their examination it will appear, that at Christmas, 1811, my stock in Newgate-street was taken, and amounted to upwards of four thousand pounds. That stock was always kept up, and in the two months preceding the fire, my purchases did not amount to less than fifteen hundred pounds. My prosecutors say, that on looking over my stock in Houndsditch, they found it come very far short of the sum insured upon it, and they therefore draw an inference that the stock in my house in Newgate-street was equally short. My answer to this is a very plain one: previously to the insurance being effected, the stock in this shop was also taken, and amounted to about thirteen hundred pounds; but being advised by my friends to confine my business to my house in Newgate-street, I had given notice of quitting my house in Houndsditch, at Christmas. My business there was breaking up, and the shop was barely supplied with stock necescary to keep it open. Had the prosecutors found an excess of stock there, they might have said, that I had removed my stock from the other shop in contemplation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130022"/>of the fire, and which would have been a very natural conjecture. But I shall be able to shew that there was not a removal of stock from Newgate-street, but on the contrary, that at the time of the fire my shop was fully stocked. It may be proper for me to observe here, that previously to the failure of Mr. Shoel, my principal dealer, the balance of my accompt with him stood generally at about three thousand pounds; besides this, my dealing with other persons were very considerable. What then could have been my inducement for my setting my house on fire? I could not have contemplated a fraud on the insurance office, because it appears that I was not insured at above one half my loss. Moreover, if I had contemplated a fraud on the office, it must have been contemplated from the time of making the insurance. Is it probable that I should have given notice to quit my house in Houndsditch, if I had intended to set fire to the Newgate-street house? I think you will say, no. I trust I shall also be acquitted of any intention of destroying my wife, who, notwithstanding her failings, I tenderly loved. She was, moreover, the mother of my child. By her death I have lost a comfortable income from property at Bow, which she was entitled to for her life; the loss of which I could have guarded against, by purchasing the interest of these persons who were entitled to the property in reversion, and who were desirous of selling, if I had had the gift of prescience. What inducement could I then have had for committing this heinous offence. I trust you will say, none. The fact is, that the dreadful calamity has put a stop to a most flourishing business, destroyed all my prospects, and reduced me from a state of affluence to a state of beggary; for the remnant of my property, including the amount of my insurance, would not enable me to satisfy the demands of my creditors. It must, therefore, be evident that I could not be benefitted by this calamity.</p>
               <p>The prosecutors have said that they wished to avoid this prosecution, but that they were compelled to it by the popular clamour of the neighbourhood. A man who is unfortunate seldom wants calumniators. I have not deserved ill of my neighbours, for my conduct towards them was marked by acts of kindness. They have, however, circulated a story to my prejudice, respecting my purchasing some pitch, turpentine, and links, or torches, of Mr. Bull, an oilman, in Fleet Market, the evening preceding the fire, and that I refused to let Mr. Bull send them home for me; and they have added that I made the purchase with the view of using these articles in the conflagration of my house. The latter part I most solemnly deny, but that I made the purchase of these articles, is true, and also, that I chose to take them home myself. This may, at first, to you appear extraordinary; but, when you are informed (and it will be proved), that it was almost my constant habit to be my own porter, bringing home my own joint of meat from market, bringing my two or three gallons of oil from my oilman's, and, indeed almost every thing consumed in my house, it will no longer appear so. Pitch and turpentine are things that when they are set fire to, are very active in their operations. Now, it will be proved that I left my house in Newgate-street, about ten o'clock, in the evening of the fire, for the purpose of supping at Mr. Thorn's, who keeps a public-house in East Smithfield, and that I was there about a quarter before three in the morning, when the fire broke out. Would pitch and turpentine, if set fire to, have smothered for four or five hours? I think you will say they would not. Had the fire proceeded from these articles they would have emitted a strong smell. Now, the lamp-lighter, who was the first person to discover the fire, says, that he smelt no particular smell; and, moreover, that if he had had half a dozen buckets of water he could have extinguished the fire. Could he have done so if the flames had proceeded from pitch and turpentine? I think you will say, no. Besides, had I intended to set my house on fire, I need not have gone from home for materials; for the quantity of oil consumed by me in my shop would at any time have afforded me the means of combustion. It is, however, necessary that I should state for what purpose this pitch, turpentine, and links, were purchased. I before mentioned that my wife was entitled for her life to three houses at Bow; by some means or other the water found its way into the cellars of these houses. The person who acted occasionally as my clerk, in keeping my accompts, had been formerly in the employ of a surveyor, and went with me in the latter end of the summer to examine into the matter. He recommended an efficient drain, or sewer, to be constructed, which would operate as a drain to the neighbouring houses, as well as my own; but as the neighbours did not very readily come into this plan, it was thought adviseable to carry a trough, or trunk, through the cellars of my own houses, to drain off the water, and which trunk it would be necessary to pitch well for its preservation.</p>

               <p>This was resolved on, and it was at the same time resolved that an arris gutter should be placed round the eves of one of the houses for the purpose of conveying the rain water into a butt for domestic purposes. That it would also be necessary to pitch. Pitch was also necessary for the repairs of one of the flaps that opened into the cellars of one of the houses, from the street, and it was for these pur- purposes that the pitch was purchased. The torches were for the purpose of lighting the cellars when the work to the trunk was doing, as candles had been found not to give sufficient light. As to the turpentine, that was to be used in painting at Bow, and also a part of my back shop in Newgate-street. I have been informed, that since I have been here, the prosecutors have caused the premises at Bow to be surveyed, and have found a trunk lined with lead in the cellars. It may be so; but that was a matter not within my knowledge; for, at the time Mr. Pether and I went to Bow, the water in the cellars was up to our knees, and prevented us from finding out the actual state of the place, and what Mr. Pether and myself had concluded upon, was the result of conjecture only. Coupling this explanation with the want of inducement to my committing the offence charged against me, will, I trust, prove satisfactery; and the more especially, when it is corroborated by the circumstance of one of my tenants<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130023"/>having, within two or three days of the fire, been very pressing for the repairs being set about. It may appear strange, that I should purchase these articles in Fleet Market, which were to be used at Bow; but it will no longer appear so, when you are informed, that the Bow errand cart used to call for parcels at the next door to me. I might also observe, that if I had intended these articles for the purpose of conflagration, and wished for concealment, I should have gone a greater distance from home for them than Fleet Market, where I am known almost by every one, and which is within three hundred yards of my late house in Newgate-street, and the persons resident there are in the constant habit of passing my door, and I believe few people are better known than myself.</p>
               <p>It has also been stated as a supicious circumstance, that I purchased a considerable quantity of chips from a journeyman carpenter, who was at work repairing a house opposite to me. It is true that I did so; it was done in the face of day. Several of my neighbours had availed themselves of the opportunity of doing so, and I was equally entitled to do so with them.</p>
               <p>It is also stated, that I denied having bought the combustible articles. This I must beg leave to contradict I never did deny that I purchased the articles; but when Mr. Metcalfe informed me that it was circulated in the neighbourhood, that I had purchased the articles for the purpose of setting fire to my house, I denied that; meaning to deny that they were purchased for such purpose. Mrs. Smith too was seen, when the alarm was given, to come out of her room ready dressed, with a candle in her hands. I am sorry to say that it was too often the case for Mrs. Smith to lie down with her clothes on. She had a propensity for drink, which she too often indulged, and was very frequently in a state not to help herself. Whether the accident of the fire was occasioned by her carelessness, in a moment of inebriety, or not, I cannot venture to say; and indeed it does not, I submit, appear very clear that the fire began on my premises; but this much is certain, that she was not prepared for the accident, as there is very little doubt but that her death was occasioned by the fright.</p>
               <p>The prosecutors, before the Lord Mayor, stated, as a ground of charge against me, that I made a claim as for a total loss, without stating the particulars; this is a matter for Mr. Anbrey, my solicitor, to answer; as the claim was made under his directions. I can only repeat here that the gentleman of the insurance office had every means afforded them of satisfying themselves on the subject of my property.</p>
               <p>It may appear strange that I should be from home at the time the accident happened, and that it was an unseasonable hour for a person to be out. I do not mean to justify it; but when a man has been closely confined to his shop from eight o'clock in the morning till ten at night, he wants some relaxation; it certainly might be taken more moderately; and as to my going home that night to Hounsditch, instead of to Newgate-street, there was nothing extraordinary in it. I had spent the evening and part of the morning at that part of the town, and it was no uncommon thing for me to sleep in Hounsditch on such occasions. It has also been observed that my son had also been removed from Newgate-street to Hounsditch. There cannot be any thing extraordinary in that. My mother lived in the house at Hounsditch, and surely there cannot be any harm in his visiting his grandmother. It was a thing he often did. But the mention of these matters only serves to shew how eager people are to catch at every trifling circumstance, that may throw the slightest suspicion on another.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I leave myself in your hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see upon her any marks of intoxication - A. Not then. When she was at the Old Bailey she seemed very heavy; whether it was for want of sleep, I cannot say. She appeared perfectly steady when she came down stairs.</p>

The boots, he said, were not worth mending. He said, he could make me a pair of shoes of them, for eight shillings. When the prosecutor came to me, my man was disatisfied with the shoes he made for him. I brought the shoes down, and shewed him them. The prosecutor claimed them. I am sure these are the shoes I had of the prisoner. The prisoner acknowledgd to having stolen them, and wished me to intercede with his master.

I could not go there with the cart. I desired Mr. Edney to take care of it, and when I came back Mr. Edney had got the pork on the foot-board. He asked me, whether I had sent any body for it. I said, no. He said, a man had just been there, that said, he had been sent for it. He gave me a description of the man. I pursued and took the prisoner. By his description I had seen the prisoner lurking about the lane, when first I came with the cart. I took the prisoner in Lombard-street. I brought him back to the cart. A gentleman sent for an officer; he took him in custody.</p>

I saw him take a bundle out. He jumped from the cart with the bundle in his arms. I went to him, and took hold of the bundle, and asked him, what he was going to do with it. He said, he was going to Sam's coffee-house. I told him he must not take it until the man came that belonged to the cart. He then laid the bundle on the foot-board, and turned down a court that leads into Nicholas-lane. He called out to his mate. Armsworth came to the cart directly afterwards. I told him. He persued him, and brought him back.</p>

Green ran from me. I called out, stop thief. I searched Brett; I found a handkerchief on him. Green was stopped by a witness in court, and was searched by him. I only found one handkerchief on Brett.

               <p>Q. At that time there was no note of it being paid to you - A. Certainly not. I left town for the long vacation, on Saturday, the 20th of August. I came to town on the Monday following, and was in town until the Saturday. On Friday, the 28th of August, when he rendered me the account for that week; not seeing Worthing in it, I asked him if Mr. Worthing had paid. He said not. I asked him this question in consequence of my suspicion, and fixed my mind on Worthing. I returned to town on the 1st of October. I looked in the book in the course of that week.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the week did you find the entry in the book exactly remaining so - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some discovery you made in the month of November, did you question the prisoner, in consequence of some fees received by him not accounted to you - A. I did; particularly on Monday, the 23d, or on the Tuesday. On my turning to the entry, I observed the entry had, Pd. Wo. In the first place, I asked him if that, Pd. Wo. was his hand-writing. Neither the, Pd. nor, Wo. is my hand-writing; that never was paid to me by the prisoner, or by any other person. I asked him then, when this fee had been paid. His answer was, about the time the paper was left. I then said, that is on the 25th of July. He said, yes, or thereabouts. I then asked him, whose writing that was: putting my finger to the Wo. He hesitated, and rather faintly said it was mine. He did not say distinctly, but rather hesitated about it, and then intimated that it was mine. I then made this observation; I know, and can swear positively, that this fee was never id by you to me; I have had my eye upon this particular case; I have recorded this in my memory per m; I am confident it is your's. I told him, that I had placed himself in an awkward situation. On Thursday, the 26th, he acknowledged that was his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is it - A. It is the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Part of it are observations in red ink; are they as the rest, the prisoner's hand writing - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the introductory part; it supposes to be an answer to a letter; what date is it - A. The 17th instant.</p>
               <p>Q. What is instant - A. July, 1812.</p>
               <p>COURT. What is the date of that - A. 21st of July, 1812. It purports to be an answer to the 17th instant, and dated the 21st.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General Had you, upon the 21st of July, seen or had any letter of the 17th refered to, by it - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Now, I propose this being proved to be the hand-writing of the prisoner, and not by the authority of Mr. Daniel. I mean to give by Mr. Ridge's book the letter of the 17th. I do not mean that as a proof by itself; that letter came to the hand of the prisoner, it shows that the prisoner, by some means, was the principal that became acquainted with that letter. I therefore propose to give your lordship, by Mr. Ridge's book, that letter of the 21st.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The original must be produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Where is it. Captain Daniel said he received no such letter. This must be the prisoner's hand-writing, and this must have been in the posession of the prisoner. I gave him notice to produce it; he does not produce it. My learned friend says, I admit it. Supposing this letter came to the hands of Mr. Daniel, before I could go into the copy I must shew the original was destroyed or lost, that is enough. If Mr. Daniel say, I received a letter on the 17th, I have destroyed it or lost it, than the copy becomes evidence here. I do not want it in this case, because of that letter. The prisoner raises all the inference that I want I do not want to press that he opened that letter; it is enough that such a letter was known to the prisoner, and if it appears to the Court that the original is not produced, then I will read the prisoner's letter to Mr. Ridge, in the name of Daniel, 21st of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Daniel. Look at this; this is a letter of the 15th of July; it is writen in Mr. Daniel's name. Is that the prisoner's writing - A. It is. It was not written by me, or by my authority.</p>

He came down the steps to the Strand bridge. This was about five o'clock in the evening. He took up two pieces of timber that were laying on the abutment. I followed him until he got near to the Savoy church-yard, going out into the Strand. I asked him, what he was going to do with it. He said, he was taking them for a use. I asked him, for what use. He then said, he did not know where he was going to take them to; he was going to make a trifle of money; he was short of money. These are the pieces of timber. He brought a man to take one of the pieces.</p>

I should never have known that I was plundered, except from information. I went to the Maidenhead. I taxed Pugh with it. He owned it. I then went and consulted with Rivett and Dowset. I sent for the prisoner to come to London. As soon as he came I charged the officer with him. The prisoner then owned to selling eight trusses. Pugh, the accomplice, was present at the time. I never promised or threatened him. He owned every thing to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in your service any time - A. Yes; she came, I think, on the 31st of March, and continued with me six months.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of September had you occasion to search her box - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Mr. Deering, and some of the servants, go into her room for that purpose - A. Yes. She was surprised at being suspected, and was very reluctant of opening any thing that belonged to her. Mr. Deering and I both insisted in her opening her drawers, and the first thing that we found was about half a yard of black lace. It is here. One of my children's stockings was found in another drawer, locked up, and another piece of lace was in the drawer. I then required to search her box. On the top of the box was a decanter inside. The box was locked, and when she came to her letters, she said this is my property; no one shall see them; they are my letters. She put all the things in the box again, and locked it up. I then insisted upon searching further. Under the letters I found a tablecloth, some pieces of dimity, and a pencil-case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This young woman was taken up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130030"/>Marlborough-street office - A. She was not taken up. She attended there to be discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you consented to her discharge - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that no sum of money was paid by the prisoner - A. I say there was, but it was not to make good the things that were stolen. When I hire a <rs id="t18130113-47-deflabel268" type="occupation">lady's maid</rs>

                        targets="t18130113-47-defend432 t18130113-47-deflabel268"/>, I tell her I give her charge of my wardrobe, that she is answerable to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there paid - A. Two ten-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was upon her being discharged at Marlborough-street, was it not - A. No; when her wages was paid. I do not know when she took these things. We found them upon the 28th of September, 1812.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discharged her, and when you took the money for the loss of the things in the inventory, I believe, after that she brought an action - A. An action was brought by her.</p>
               <p>Q. And is now pending - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. And now, having given up the charge in Marlborough-street, and the action now pending, you bring her here. You thought fit to take her up again, during an action that is pending upon you for false imprisonment - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Why did you forego the charge at first - A. Because Mr. Baker told Mr. Deering and me, that for that charge she must die, and when we came to town this copy of writ was taken out against us. We went before the same magistrate and had his advice, and pursued his advice; and Mr. Conant said it was for the good of society.</p>

            . Q. Did you attend at the time the box was searched, and the drawers - A. I did. The prisoner shewed her box very reluctantly. I saw the lace and the stockings found. When she came to her letters she shut her box, and said no one should open them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason that you did not proceed when you went to Marlborough-street - A. Because the charge would affect her life, a young person like her, had come with a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How long had she been in your service - A. About six months. She was lady's maid, and acting as housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore when things were used in your house, it was her duty to see the safe custody of them - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever think of charging her here until the action was brought - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, gentlemen of the jury, the tablecloth was not used in common; it was used only when we had company. I had not put this tablecloth in its proper place. I put the tablecloth there for safety until I returned from Bath. I knew I should not have Mrs. Deering's keys to put it away before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

On the 19th of December, about three in the afternoon, the prisoner brought me some pheasants to sell; they were in hampers. He had an ass with him. I bought twelve pheasants of him, and I paid him for them. On the 31st, I saw him again; he had some pheasants with him. They were in hampers, upon an ass. He said he was come before his time.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen him before - A. On the 19th. He then said, he should see me that day fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he came from - A. Yes; he said he came from Chesham Bottom. When he said he had come before his time, I told him, it did not make any difference about that; I was quite prepared for him. We went into a two pair of stairs room. I made an excuse to go down stairs to get a wire to fastern the window, to prevent the birds from flying away; instead of getting the wire to fasten the window, I went to get a person to keep the prisoner in conversation, while I sent a person to Marlborough-street office, as I had a suspicion the pheasants were stolen.

               <p>Q. Did you loose any books on the 7st of January - A. On the 7th of January, Mr. Sampson, a bookseller, in Oxford-street, came to me, and asked me if I had Lord Littleton's and Grays poetical works. I told him I had. I went to the shelf where they should have been placed, I found they were missing. I then told Mr. Sampson, I thought they were missing. Mr. Sampson took them out of his pocket; he said, he had just bought them of a man who had offered them for sale, and he had given eight shillings for them; that the man was to come again in half an hour to sell him some French books; and towards the evening. Mr. Sampson's boy came and said they had detained the prisoner. I went to Mr. Sampson's shop, and challenged the prisoner as being the person who had been in my shop. The last time he was in my shop was on Thursday week. He came into the shop at the time I was engaged. He asked for two sets of Cowper's poems, the small edition. I told him, I had not got the small edition, but I could get them. He walked backwards and forwards in the shop, and said he would call again. He called no more. I did not see him after that, until I saw him in Oxford-street; I then accompanied him down to Marlborough-street office. He waited by me, and ran into the street. I followed him, and overtook him at a considerable distance, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Who was in your shop when the prisoner came in - A. Three elderly women and some young ladies, and the maid servant.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMPSON. When the prisoner came in my shop I was shewing some pocket-books to a lady. The prisoner asked me whether I purchased books. I said, I did. He produced Gray's and Lord Littleton's poetical works. He asked twelve shillings for them. I bid him eight. He refused it; at last, he took it. He then asked me if I bought foreign books. I said, I did. He said, he had purchased some at the Auction Mart; he did not read foreign languages; if I bought them, and would be at home in an hour and an half, he would bring them to me. After he was gone I examined the books that I had purchased. On the first leaf of Littleton's works was, plates, fourteen shillings. I recognised the writing to be Mr. Clark's, of Piccadilly. I went down to Mr. Clark. The officer has the two books. The prisoner came again to my shop on the Saturday evening, and Mr. Clark was sent for.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time, last month, lose any property out of your house - A. Yes, a new watch. On Sunday morning, the 5th of December. I am not certain whether it was done night, or on Sunday morning. I lost the watch from my sleeping chamber; it hung up at my bed's head. I hung it there when I went to bed, and two other young men lost property at the same time. I have not seen my watch since. The prisoner slept in the same room with me, and another young man. The watch cost me five pounds; I had not had it long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alarmed in the night or not - A. No. When we awaked in the morning we found the prisoner gone, and my doors undone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lodged with you - A. About a month. He had not said any thing about his going away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. At the end of a fortnight. I saw the said Bennet coming towards my own door. I spoke to my lodger. My lodger spoke to him, and he ran away. We pursued him. I took him myself near Cranford-bridge, towards London. That is about six miles from my house. When I overtook him. He was walking very fast. I charged him with taking the things. He denied it at first. I charged the constable with him. He then confessed that he had pawned the watch in the Borough for thirty shillings. He said, he had lost the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. You slept there, did you - A. I did. On the 22nd of December, between the hours of eight and nine at night, I was coming from Baker-street, to Grafton-street house. Our house being a corner house, I observed a man leaning over a post. I did not like the looks of him. I had a little boy along with me, between ten and eleven years old. I said, Thomas, come along with me. I went by the house, took the little boy along with me, and went to the bottom of the street, and came back on the opposite side; and when I came opposite of the house I saw the street door open, and a man came out with the six blankets. I ran after him immediately, and catched the prisoner, and took the blankets from under his arm. The other man ran away. I had a little bit of a tustle with the prisoner. He ran away. The watchman took him to the watchhouse. I took the blankets from him. They were in a bag under his arm. The bag was searched at the watchhouse; it contained six blankets, and the prisoner had some matches in his pocket, and some twenty-penny notes, and one-penny notes. I left him in the care of the watchman, and the blankets also. They are here. They are quite new. I left the house in the morning, between six and seven. I fastened the house when I left it.</p>

I watched him into Northumberland-court.

He came down the court, crossed over to St. Martin's-lane, went up Exchecquer-court. He took the quart and pint pot, and put it into a bag. Then I stopped him. I asked him what he had got. He kicked my shin, and ran off into the Strand. I cried out, stop thief. He was knocked down by a guard, and stopped. I examined the bag, and took the prisoner in Bow-street. These are the pots.</p>

            . I am a Thames police officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. On Monday, the 4th of December, before day light. I was keeping watch on the river; I saw a boat coming from towards the tier in Shadwell dock, about four tiers from where the Commerce laid. I rowed after that boat. I saw the prisoner in that boat when I over-took it. The first thing I saw in the boat was a bucket, and four pieces of pork in it. There was nobody in the boat but the prisoner. I asked him how he came by that pork at that time in the morning. He said he was a Greenland man, and he was going to carry it on shore to a poor person where he lodged. He said, he took it from the ship William. He pointed and said, there she lies, off there. He pointed to the tier where I first saw the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on the Middlesex side when you first laid of hold him - A. Yes. After that, I saw two bundles of clothes in the boat. I then said, whose are these. He said, one is mine, and the other belongs to a lad that was going to make his escape from the vessel that day. I knew it could not be legal for them things to come on shore to a poor person, where he said he lodged. I lodged the prisoner in the office. Then, after that, I went over to the tier where he said the ship, named William, laid. I could not find any ship of that name laying in the tier. There was no vessel at that time of that name laying in the tier. I went further down, and then I learned that the ship Commerce had something stolen from it. The goods were afterwards claimed by Mr. Stanhope. This is the frying-pan, the bucket, and the pork.</p>

            . I am a broker. On the 11th of December, I happened to be coming by Mrs. Bullwinkle's shop, about seven in the evening; I saw the prisoner and another boy lurking about the shop window of Mrs. Bullwinkle. I saw the other boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130034"/>put the prisoner up to the square of glass that is made to open in Mrs. Bullwinkle's window. This square of glass was made to open and shut. In consequence of that some person came down and moved them. I was on the opposite side of the way. They were alarmed, and went away, and when they came back again the other boy opened the window, and took the cheese out, and gave it to the prisoner. I seized the prisoner, and took the cheese. The other boy ran away. I took the cheese into Mrs. Bullwinkle's shop, and delivered it to her son.</p>

We afterwards went to the premises that had been robbed, and under the frame of the washhouse window it appeared that some sharp instrument had been used. There were several notches in the under part of the frame of the window. The notches appeared to be cut clean, as if by a sharp instrument. Mr. Ousby said he found this hatchet in the brook. I took the hatchet to Butler's house, and Butler's son said it was his father's hatchet.</p>

            's Defence. These things that were found in my possession. On Thursday morning, about half past six o'clock, I was going to Covent Garden market to buy some greens and potatoes, for my wife to sell. On my going up by the Five Fields, I saw by the side of the bank, a bundle. I went to it, and picked it up. I took it home to my wife. She said, what have you got there. I said, a bundle. This was about half past six o'clock, on Thursday morning. I left it at home until I came back from market. We took the things out of the bundle; it was very dirty. My wife's sister took some of it home to wash. My wife had not time to do it being busy in her shop. These things were hanging up in the out-house which the officer called the pigsty; it is an out-house, which any body can see what is in it, passing along the road; and these things, which my wife took to pledge, thinking they were her own, as I picked it up on the highway. She thought it was her own, as I had told her that I picked it upon the highway.</p>
               <p>John Butler's Defence. I work at the new Strand bridge. On Thursday morning, my brother called on me to go to Covent Garden, to bring home greens and potatoes. I was behind. He went forward. He said he picked up a bundle. He took it home to his own house. That is all I know about it.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Mr. Manning's name - A. David. The house is in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn. On Sunday night, the 29th of November, Allen and Turner came into the house, and two women with them. They called for a quartern and a half of gin. They did not set down at all; they staid a quarter of an hour. Allen went out of the house, and Elizabeth Fox and 
               <persName id="t18130113-60-person582">
                  John

             came in, and Allen likewise; they appeared to be well acquainted with each other. They remained in my house half an hour altogether. They were looking about, and going in and out, quite in a remarkable manner. They left the house about five minutes before eleven o'clock. I began to shut up my house. The last two shutters that I put up Allen came out of Charlotte-street. My house is at the corner. At five o'clock in the morning the patrol called me up, and told me that the cellar flap was broken up. I came down stairs. It was dark. I found my cellar flap broken open. It had been secured by two bolts. It is a heavy flap; it is as much as two brewers servants can raise up. Considerable force had been applied to get it open. I lost thirteen gallons of rum, ten pounds value; four gallons of brandy worth six pounds; and four gallons of brandy was moved from one part of the cellar to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130038"/>Q. Then all the things that they intended to be taken was not gone - A. No. There were six bottles of wine taken away, that is worth one pound one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was Turner dressed the night before - A. In a white coarseish apron, a frock-coat, with pockets at the sides. Allen was dressed with a crape hatband round his hat. Silvester had got an ash coloured stick with him.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About five o'clock, on the morning of the 30th of November, I was in Grays-inn-lane; when I came near the house of Mr. May. I passed the cellar flap, a quarter before five; the flap then appeared to be safe; I walked over it. In about a quarter of an hour, I passed by again; I perceived a man holding the flap up. He was standing holding the flap up. That was the prisoner, Turner. He had on a loose blue coat. hanging open, with metal shining buttons, and pockets outside, a white apron on, hanging down. There was a lamp directly over his head, that gave me light to see him. It was a lamp with two burners. There was another person with him; the other person was down upon his hands and knees, appearing to me to be coming out of the cellar. He had a fustian jacket and trowsers, and a black hatband on his hat. On my coming so near them, they seemed to be very busy at the time. I took it to be the landlord of the house at first. On my proceeding near to them, they dropped the flap, and I heard something rattle, which I supposed to be a bottle of wine. They immediately run away very fast. I then endeavoursd to pursue them. On my stepping over the flap, it tripped me down. As soon as they got into Fox-court, there is a turning on both sides. I lost them. They made their escape. I went to the nearest watchman, and the watchman and I alarmed Mr. May. We examined the cellar. I had seen

               <p>Q. Did you know Turner before - A. I know him by sight, not by name, by seeing him in Holborn. I had often seen him in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You known the landlord, did not you - A. No. There is a new landlord in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you first saw Turner that he run away - A. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from him when you first saw him - A. Perhaps five or six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Turner's face - A. Yes; he looked very hard at me, so that I saw his countenance. I had my cutlass under my coat; he could not tell who I was. I speak to him both by his dress and by his countenance.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known where he lived - A. He has lived in Cross-lane. I saw him again at Hatton-garden office three or four days afterwards. I know him again as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing Allen's face - A. Not so particularly his face as this dress. I speak to him now by his dress than his countenance. There was nothing particular in his dress, except he had on a crape hatband, a fustian jacket and trowsers, and he was a stout person.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Allen before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said, in Allen's presence, that you recollected that he had a crape round his hat - A. Yes, and after he was examined the crape was produced. It was taken out of the privy.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 2nd of December, I apprehended Allen. He had this jacket on him, and in company with Silvester. I apprehended him in Parker's-lane. He had a crape hat-band on. I took him first to a public-house, and searched him, and then I took him to a place that we have at the office. He then had the crape on his hat, and when I brought him up at night to the magistrate. I missed the crape off his hat. I took a candle, and went to a place where he was locked up, and found it down the privy, in the place where he was locked up. I apprehended Turner on the Saturday following, at a public-house in Chick-lane. He had on a large blue frock coat, and white metal buttons, and outside pockets.</p>

             and another person came in.

He offered the girl five pounds, if she would tell who she was in company with that night. She denied knowing us. The landlord said he lost eight gallons of rum and brandy: was any found or traced to us?</p>

I called my husband, and I told him I had missed a cheese. He considered a minute or two, and went out, saying, he would see if he could find the cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband - A. In the back yard. I sent my little girl to him. He came and went out immediately, and in about two minutes my husband brought the prisoner in with the cheese under his arm, tied up in a dirty apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same person that came for the tobacco in your shop - A. No. My husband charged the watch with the prisoner.</p>

            . My wife called me in, told me that she had lost a cheese. I went out, and went to the corner of the street, where I saw three men standing together, a little distance from the corner. I waited the space of a minute. The prisoner and two others came by me. The prisoner was walking in the middle of the other two. Having got past me I jumped at him, and catched hold of him by the collar. The cheese was in a dirty apron, under his arm. The moment I seized him by the collar he said, he had never seen my shop in his life. I told him, I would soon shew it him. I took him back to my shop with the cheese. This is the cheese. It had my name on it when it was lost. It is there now; R for Roper. I had seen the cheese in my shop about ten minutes before my wife called me into the shop. I am certain that is my property. The cheese cost me ten-pence halfpenny a pound.</p>

I instantly picked it up. Two young men saw me pick it up; they said, I picked up a prize. I put it under my arm. Coming by Marybone-lane, Mr. Roper took me in custody. That is all I have to say. I never saw the two young men before in my life.</p>

There was a constable standing by three or four boys came up, and said, do you toss. I said, no. I had not made pies long; distress had drove me to it. I said, I do not toss. The constable standing by said, that is right, mistress, do not toss. Then some other boys came up, and said, do you toss. I said, what is tossing. He said, I will hold an halfpenny so, and you cry head or tail. I begged them to go. One of them said, I should cry. I cried, head. Then I said, go along. Some boys came up, and knocked my tin up; they gave me a push; I went against the pump, or else I must have gone right back.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boys were there - A. Seven or eight. One of them knocked the tin up; I tried to save the money, and I tried to save myself, and in my falling I got upon my hands and my knees. My hands was very much trod upon; they bled very much. They tore my apron off my sides. I cried out for mercy. I did not think anything of the money. The people came round me; they were very kind, and picked up some of the halfpence that laid under feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how much had you taken from you - A. I think, about ten shillings, the best part of it in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners there - A. I saw Dorset there. I did not see Manners there. I saw Dorset pick up some of the silver. I was close to him all the time he did it. Dorset was one of them that knocked my tin up, and that tried to push me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dorset say anything - A. I cannot say he did. When the people came around me, the boys were gone. Some boy shewed me where the constable lived, and told me the boy's name. This happened on Saturday; on the Tuesday following, I saw Dorset again; I knew him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner in his shop any time - A. I do not. I never saw him until I apprehended him on the 12th, at eight o'clock in the evening. I was extreme busy near eight o'clock; I had occasion to go into the back parlour. When I thought I heard a footstep I went into the shop. There was no person in the shop at that time. I returned to the back parlour, and when I got as far as the fire place, I saw a man standing with a child in his arms. I immediately ran out of the shop, end pursued as far as the church.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this shop - A. It is opposite of <placeName id="t18130113-63-crimeloc366">Compton-street, near St. Giles's church, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. You went out, and what did you see then - A. I saw the prisoner go under a gateway, which is five doors from our house. I did not follow him under the gateway: I did not like to run the risk, knowing that part of St. Giles's. I then proceeded straight up, until I came to Lawrence-lane. The prisoner came out of Lawrence-lane, and by the description the man gave me, I put my hand inside of his coat. I perceived then there was a bottle. I secured the bottle, and took it out from under his coat, and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What bottle was that - A. It is my master's shew-glass; it stood on the counter; it is full of refined liquorice. I had this bottle in the shop; it was taken from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you heard this footstep had you seen it on the counter - A. Not five minutes before I saw it. The value of the bottle is seven shillings, and the contents worth five shillings and four-pence. The prisoner said he had bought it for sixpence at the corner of the gateway. The bottle and the contents are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming along a boy overtook me; he asked me if I would buy that, and before I had time to look at it he ran up the gateway. I ran after him, and on my coming out of the corner of the gateway the gentleman catched me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come into your master's-shop, and when was it - A. On the 10th of December, about half past one, the prisoner came in with another, to buy a shawl. The prisoner had a child in her arms. The prisoner came in with her mother, as she called the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it asked for the shawls - A. The prisoner. I had three shawls on the counter. I opened three; they were all separate. She bought a red shawl, and paid ten shillings for it. She looked at two more, and took them to the door to see them by the light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she return them - A. No. She came back again and put them down. She then went out of the shop with her mother. I saw a shawl hanging from under her shawl. The shawl that she bought and paid for, she gave to her mother and when the prisoner went out of the door, I told my master that I thought she had got a shawl. My master told me to go and fetch her back. I pursued her, and fetched her back. I found the shawl that I missed underneath her shawl, and when I brought her into the shop I took it from her, and when I took it from her she wanted to pay for it. She was searched at Marlborough-street office; there was a five-pound note found upon her.</p>

I told him, I saw it just before I served the customer, meaning the prisoner. We made search for the crape, and could not find it. There had been no other person in the shop. My young man pursued the prisoner, and in ten minutes he brought him back. and when the prisoner was brought back he had two shawls and a remnant of crape.

I went out in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him near three hundred yards from our house. I desired him to come back with me. I told him there was a mistake in the things that he had bought. He would not come back, but run away; I followed him, and overtook him when he had run about sixty or seventy yards. He had a small bundle under his arm, which I wished him to give me. He would not. I insisted upon his going back with me. He attempted to untie the bundle. When I saw that he endeavoured to untie the bundle, I snatched it away, and took it to my master. The bundle contained two shawls, and the crape that I had missed.</p>
               <p>Q. You got him home - A. Yes, and I went for a constable, and gave him in charge. These are the shawls, and the craps; they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner lodge in your house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to own it to you - A. I do not know. He came to me and my husband the next morning; he took me and my husband to Mrs. Levi. He said, that he had sold it for eight shillings. On Tuesday morning he came and told me he had taken it. I did not know him before the Sunday morning before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anything of more value besides the flock bed, in the house - A. There was a watch on the mantle-piece. He never touched anything but the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything about him, what he is; Did he visit your lodgers - A. No. I never knew him before the Sunday, that he came on the Monday, and took the bed. The bed laid on the ground, tied up as it was brought. A countryman of the prisoner brought it there, and we had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been in your house - A. Near upon two or three days. It was not untied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it was his property - A. No, he did not, and he came and owned it himself.</p>

            . I live in Rosemary-lane. On the 14th of December, the prisoner came in and offered a bed for sale, about half past three on the Monday. He asked for the bed twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What country man is he - A. An Italian. He speaks broken English very well to be understood. I offered him eight shillings. He said he could not take it. He took it on his shoulder and walked away. He stopped about an hour and a half away, and then returned, and said I might have it. Then I gave him eight shillings for it. On the 15th, the prosecutor came and claimed it. The officer came and took the bed. They came, and the prisoner along with them. He shewed them the house where he sold it.</p>

            . The prosecutrix came to me on Tuesday, the 15th. She said, that she had her house broken open, and she had found where her bed was; it was at Mrs. Levi's, in Rosemary-lane. I went there, and found the bed. I produce it. I went back to the prosecutrix's house. The prisoner came in, and I took him in custody. I asked him, how he came to do it. He said, he believed the devil occasioned him to do it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the bed by the piece of red cloth being put on as a mettrass bed. I am quite certain it is the same bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings - A. Yes, but I had no lodgers in the house at that time. He came in between nine and ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come in for - A. He came to sleep all night there; he gave me a shilling to go for a pot of stout. I went out for this pot of stout, and I locked the door after me. When I went out, my property was in the drawers. I might be gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to the most. When I came back, I found my door open, and, when I came in I saw the man was gone. I looked round my room, I saw there was nothing missing in the room. I put the pot of stout on the table, and I looked over my drawers. I missed six sheets, two cotton gowns, a piece of patch-work, four yards of cotton, bed-curtains, a cotton shawl, a silk shawl, and a black velvit pellise, and a tablecloth, two side curtains, and a cotton top to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you know this man before - A. He came into my place; that was the 15th he came in and set down, and asked me how I did. He might set down ten minutes, not longer, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt he is the person that came on the 17th, have you - A. He is the person that came on the 17th. He said, he would sleep with me, and pay me for sleeping with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things - A. Part of them. I found them in an old clothes shop, in Poplar.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was applied to by Mrs. Lindsay. I went with Butler and Mrs. Lindsay's servant to Hounsditch; we met the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock at night, on Tuesday the 5th of January. The servant spoke to him, and called him by his name. She took hold of his shirt, and seized him by the collar. After a great deal of resistance, we got him into a public-house, and secured him. On coming along he tried to make his escape out of the coach; he threw himself out of the coach. He was handcuffed. He attempted it again the second time. We brought him to the office, and then we enquired of different people that had been robbed in the neighbourhood. The different people came up, and Mrs. Griffiths among the rest, and when we brought him before the magistrate he confessed the different robberies, and from his information we searched for Mrs. Griffiths's property. We found one gown and one shawl in Mrs. Treadaway's back room. I then went up stairs. We found the curtains hung up at the bed, the patch-work that was on the bed, and one gown. Butler found four sheets.</p>

               <p>Q. He came to your house on the 29th of December, about what time - A. About six o'clock in the evening, and about seven o'clock the prisoner went to bed. I locked the door, and went out to a little needle, and between ten and eleven o'clock I returned. I found the door broken open, and the lock broken off, and on my looking round, I missed the things out of the apartment; a bed, a bolster, a sheet, a blanket, two quilts, the bed furniture, a gown, two linen petticoats, and one flannel petticoat. All these things were in my apartment when I went out. Part of them things were afterwards found at Mrs. Treadaway's, by the officers, Brown and Butler.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell office. On the 6th of January, I went to Mrs. Treadaway's. I took Wasko up on Mrs. Lindsay's charge. Mrs. Castle came before the magistrate. She said, Wasko was the person that broke out of the house. Wasko then said, before the magistrate, that the woman might have the things again. He acknowledged the several robberies he had committed. He acknowledged this, and told us where to go and fetch the things. I found the things where he told me at Mrs. Treadaway's. As soon as I went into Mrs. Treadaway's shop, the prosecutrix told me that Mrs. Treadaway had got her gown on her back, and looking over some flannel petticoats in the shop, Mrs. Castle pointed out one of her flannel petticoats, in the shop. We searched about the shop. I found this bed furniture in the shop; and locked up in a box in the cupboard in the back room, we found two white petticoats. The prosecutrix said, one of the petticoats had some lace on. I told Mrs. Treadaway, I had found the petticoat, and she must give me the lace. She said, she could not tell me where it was; at last, she pulled it out of her pocket. In the cupboard, I found the piece of old blanket. Then she sent her niece out in the yard; she fetched in a quilt in a wet state. It was hanging out to dry I asked her how she came by them. She said, she had bought them of a man, he said he took them away from a girl's house that had made away with above seventy pounds of his money. I told Mrs. Treadaway she had done wrong in buying these things; some of them were new. I said, how came you to buy them of such a man. She said, she had bought of him three times; she did not know what she was buying of; it was early in the morning, hardly light; she did not know but what they were old things until she came to look at them in the day. Wasko said, she gave fifteen shillings for them. She said she did not give so much. Butler was with me all the time.</p>
               <p>Wasko's Defence. I have slept in the house, and I have lost seventy-five pounds there.</p>

               <p>Treaddway's Defence The first thing I ever bought of him was two sailor's jackets. He told me he need not sell his clothes, but a woman had robbed him of seventeen pounds; and the second time he came was about ten days after.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence; called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 5th of this month, I was going up George-court, towards my lodgings. I saw the prisoner looking at some boots and shoes that were outside of Mr. Cranmer's. I observed he looked as much at the people that passed as he did at the shoes; that gave me suspicion. I watched him. I saw him take the half boots. I followed him down the court, and going across Piccadilly I saw him drop them. I picked them up, and catched him before he went ten yards further. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I never had him out of my sight.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On Monday evening, I was going down Bethnal-green-road; I saw the prisoners, Archer and Wall, standing at the prosecutrix's window. I passed by them twice. I went about half a dozen doors further on. I stood in a door way. I saw the prisoner, Archer, ascend the steps, and go into the shop. He then brought out the half cheese. He gave it to Wall. Wall took the cheese, and went and secreted it in Harp-lane, Bethnal-green-road. Then Archer sung out, George. George would not answer until he had secreted the cheese. Archer came to the shop with Wall; he looked to see that the coast was clear. I saw Archer go up the steps again. He took a leg of pork out of the window. I ran over the way, and just as Archer was coming out, I knocked him down in the passage. Wall was outside at the time; he ran off. I took Archer to Bethnal-green watchhouse. On my return back to the prosecutrix's house, I saw Wall just coming out of Harp-lane. I went to him, and asked him where he was going. He said, home. I said, what have you got here. He said, nothing. He had the cheese in the handkerchief that had been round his neck. He said, he had picked up the cheese. I said, I thought so, I was looking for it. I took them before the magistrate the next day. Archer had been in the House of Correction for robbing the toll-gate of some halfpence.</p>

The master said, his apprentice had robbed him of some callico. I asked the prisoner, where it was. He went to the bed, and took it out from between the tick and the feathers. He had cut it off a piece of between thirty and forty yards. His master took the piece out of the drawer. It matched exactly.</p>

I lost a jacket, trowsers, shirt, stockings, and a towel, and a coffee mill-barrel. The prisoner did not belong to the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they lost on board a ship - A. Yes. they were. The prisoner came on board a ship as it lay in the dock. About two o'clock in the morning, he found he could not open the half deck; he opened the chest, and took a bundle out; he took a wine-glass also, he hunted all over the half deck, to see what he could take. I could but just discern him. When he went on the top ladder I went in deck; the prisoner struck me, I sung out for the watchman, the watchman came and found the prisoner laying at the foot of the boy's bed, and all the things with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come on board - A. She was laying in the bason.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me at the cabin door - No; I heard you. The other boy awaked me, then I heard you making a noise.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. With respect to the one pound eighteen shillings, on the 6th of May, that I am charged with, sorry would I be at all to attempt to to injure mortal being. I could not, by any means whatever, attempt to destroy my fellow man in any respect. I never was arraigned at the bar of justice before. I appeal to that Great and Almighty being, before whom I shall one day appear to answer for all the sins I ever have committed, and before whom all the ends of the earth must stand and tremble, at the vengeance of the Almighty. I never did attempt to injure any man whatever. I appeal to him who judgeth the hearts of all men. I have only to say that as I have been sworn against, my punishment, with Cain, of old, is greater than I can bear. I know in whom I have believed. I know that he is able to save to the uttermost. In him I believe, in him I trust. He will never leave me. I therefore commit myself humbly into his hands. If I am transported, my punishment will be death itself. I cannot bear it. My health is in a delicate state. I throw myself at your mercy. These gentlemen, who are to try me for death itself, and therefore, I know, I have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for my sins. He has made an atonement for me. I have poured out my soul in prayer to him, who is able to save to the uttermost. I commit myself to your mercy, and look to him on whom you shall look at the great and terrible day of judgment; when all nations of the earth shall stand before him, at whose bar have I pleaded guilty. I know nothing of the transaction of the 6th of May, merely only that all accounts of the 6th of May were settled with Mr. Briggs. I call on Mr. Briggs now, whom, perhaps, in some respects, I may have injured. I am sorry that ever I have injured him. With gratitude I must say in some respects I am indebted to him. Let him go to the utmost extremity, I forgive him freely, for all he has done or said, and brought against me. Man is but a creature of the day, that cannot foresee future events. When left to himself, he becomes fiercer than any beast that roves the woods of Africa or America. Oh, when the spirit of Christ departs from him, what a desperate state must he be in, and I will say, with David of old, let him who thinks he stands, take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130048"/>heed least he fall. Surely wee see with our eyes; the sword is going through the nations of the earth and why are not we awakened. It is our sins we all see, though we are not brought to the bar of justice; for our sins we are securged. Pardon me for taking up your time. I only plead, and ask for mercy. I was tenderly brought up, and lost my father and mother in the infancy of my youth. They were snatched from me. In my situation I have no friends to come forward here in this country. I am friendless and desolate, cast upon a miserable world. I can say no more. I am quite overcome. Let your judgment be tempered with mercy, I beseech it. My prosecutor has not stated what I have done with the one pound four shillings. I kept an accompt in my pocket-book. I don't think I saw him produce that book to see whether there is, on the 6th of May, goods entered. If so, then I must have actually have handed him over the sum. He has not produced the Book to satisfy the gentlemen of the jury.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the memorandum-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any entry on the 6th of May, of one pound eighteen shillings - A. No. Two grey blues, at seven. That is all. (The memorandum-book, bill, and receipt, handed to the jury.)</p>

On the 3rd of September, he took some goods to Mr. Hewitt, of Leadenhall-market, with a bill and receipt. When he returned, he said ma'am, here is the receipt; Mr. Hewitt was very busy, and could not pay it. He desired me to call again in a day or two. I said, very well. In the course of a fortnight or three weeks. I desired him to call, for fear Mr. Hewitt should forget it. When he returned, he said, he was gone out of town; he could not have it until he returned. I then began to think that all was not quite right. I went to Mr. Hewitt's the next day; I said, I think you owe me a small bill for baskets. He said, no, I do not; I paid your porter. Mr. Hewitt shewed me the bill and receipt, and gave me leave to take it away. This is the bill and receipt; I received of Mr. Hewitt. It is for one pound one shilling and three-pence.</p>

            . I am an officer. When I took the prisoner in custody, I told him the charge that I had against him. He told me that he had received the money, but had lost it in the way to his master's house, and on the day he was committed he wished to speak a few words to the magistrate. He then said that he had paid the money to Mr. Umney. Mr. Umney was called. He was asked if he had received that money. He said, no, there was a man called, but he would not receive the money. The magistrate desired me to go to Mr. Umney's house and take possession of the money. It was two pounds odd that was left for the discharge of the prisoner's debt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the money of Mr. Hewitt. I lost it at Billingsgate. I was fearful of telling of it. I thought I should be able to pay it by my industry, but was prevented. I offered to pay it at five shillings a week. About eight days after that I was taken in custody. My brother went to the prosecutor's, and offered to give security. This was refused. The prosecutors said, the money must be paid. My brother borrowed the money, and went to the prosecutors. They informed him all was settled. The officer went to the prosecutors, and took the money that was paid by my brother, and I was fully committed for trial.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. How long from the time that he received this money was it that you saw Mr. Hewitt - A. I believe, the first week in November.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore from September to November you never heard anything from him that he had lost it - A. Not a word of it.</p>

I made her go down stairs again. I heard Mrs. Esdaile ask her how long she had had the key of the wine cellar. She replied, only that morning. I said, that was false, as I had locked the key of the cellar up myself the night before. I went up stairs to get the key of the cellar, and when I came to the closet where the key of the cellar was kept, I found a false key in the closet door, and the closet open. The cellar key was not there. I found the key sticking in the cellar door. The footman came upon her too quick; she had not time to take the key away.</p>

They told me they had just come from sea, and they must have the clothes on Sunday morning following. I told them, I could not promise them, the time was so short, but I had a suit of clothes would fit one of them. I fitted them on one of them; he liked them, and I was to make for the other by Sunday morning. On Sunday morning they came, they bought various other articles of wearing apparel. They told me they had no money about them, they would thank me to go to their landlord with them, and as soon as the clothes were delivered the clothes would be paid for. I made out the bill and receipt according to their request. I sent my foreman with them to the place where they lodged. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The things that you made for them were two waistcoats and two jackets - A. Yes. They bought various things besides, and I was to send them to their lodgings, and the landlord was to pay for them. I sent my foreman with them.</p>

            . I went by the order of my master to take them two suits of clothes. I went with them two prisoners to a house in Artichoke-lane. Their pretended landlord asked me if I had made them men's clothes. I said, yes. He said, walk up stairs after me. I had the clothes with me. I went up stairs. The prisoner Myers said, I shall go and clean myself. The landlord asked me if I had got the bill. I said, I had. The other one took the bundle to go and clean himself. After they were gone, the landlord took a pocket-book out of his pocket. I expected he was going to pay me my bill. In the course of two or three minutes, I asked him where these men were gone. He said, he did not know. I then said, where is the clothes; my order is not to leave the clothes without the money. He said, I cannot pay you to-day, call to-morrow. I went the next day. I knocked at the door; a woman opened the door to me. I expected the woman that opened the door was the daughter of that fictitious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130050"/>landlord. She told me, in short, that this man that pretended to be the landlord did only lodge in the house; he was only a fictitious landlord; he had only a furnished room. He had ran away, and had handed them things out of the house that night. The landlord of the house told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not evidence. You know nothing at all, only that you went there, you delivered to one of the men the jackets and trowsers. Why, did not you lay hold of the man - A. I did not suspect that he was not the landlord of the house. I never was paid for them clothes. I am certain these are the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your clothes again - A. No. I asked them what they had done with the clothes. They made a jeer of me.</p>

               <p>Myers's Defence. On the 20th of November, I went to this man's house; he asked me what clothes I wanted. I told him I wanted some clothes; I had no money; I would shew him a man that would be answerable for mine. He took measure of me for a suit of clothes. He said, he could get them ready; he would send them to my house on Sunday. I called at nine o'clock; he then said they would be ready in half an hour. He told me he should send his foreman with us to the man that would be answerable for us. When the foreman came in, Mr. Wright stood on the stairs; he said, these young men have bespoke the clothes, will you be answerable for them. Mr. Wright said he would. He asked him to sit down, and to take anything to drink. He said, he was in a hurry, he would call again. He did not call till Tuesday. He was very well satisfied. The next day, Mr. Wright was very ill, and so he was all the week. Then Mr. Wright went out. We never knew that he was moved until the Monday fornight following. Then Mr. Levy said, in case we did not pay him or give another security, he would swear our lives away. Then he should have security for his money.</p>

The prisoner was in my house several times that day. It was in the evening part that he stole the pots. The first pint pot that I missed was about half after nine at night. It was taken from the tap-room. The next pint pot I missed was about a quarter before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, between the time that you missed the first pot and the time that you missed the second, had the prisoner been in your tap-room - A. Yes, he had. I did not see him take the first pint pot; I heard he did. I watched him to his own lodgings, which he occupied of me in a court behind my house. I followed close behind him. It was dark; he could not see me, and he is deaf, he could not hear me. When he unlocked his door, I heard him put something down, which sounded like a pewter pot. He came out of his room. I went down. He followed me down into my own house. He called for a pint of beer. I served him myself in a pint pot, which he took into the tap-room. The prisoner was sitting at a table where another man was drinking a pint. The man that was drinking a pint, he went, and left the pint pot there. I had seen the pots on the table; I would not let the maid fetch them out. I went to a secret place, and watched him the while. I was watching him an hour and a half. He did not touch the pots. I thought it would be prudent for me to go into the bar. I had not been in the bar ten minutes before I saw the prisoner go out. I sent my servant girl into the tap room to see whether there was one or two pint pots left on the table. In consequence of what she told me, I went out after the prisoner had overtook him by the end of the court. I took the watchman that I had in waiting I stopped him at the end of the court. I searched him and found my pint pot in his pocket. I then gave him in charge of the watchman, and went to the watchhouse with him. The officer searched him, and found the key of his own room. I went back, and searched his room. I there found the first pot that I mentioned, and likewise found two pans fit to be used for the purpose of melting pots. There was solder at the bottom, which induced me to think they had been used for the purpose of melting pewter pots, and that pint pot that I found there had my name and sign on it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel parish. Mr. Cox gave me charge of this prisoner about a quarter before eleven o'clock. I searched him, and found upon him a pint pot; it had the name and sign of Mr. Cox upon it. After I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, I found two keys upon him. I took the prisoner with me to his room. One key opened one room, and the other key another room. One was a bed-room, and the other a lumber room. In the prisoner's bed-room I found a pint pot; it had the prosecutor's name and sign, and I found two pans there underneath the bed; they bear the appearance of having melted metal. As I was taken the prisoner along, he asked me to let him go. I told him it was as much as my place was worth to let him go.</p>

On the 5th of December, about eight o'clock, I was sitting at my desk, opposite the shop window.

            . I am a baker. I live near Mr. Howell. On Saturday morning, the 5th of December, about twenty minutes before three o'clock, before day-light, hearing some footsteps in the street, I went out. I observed the watchman coming up the lane with a quantity of bread under his coat. I asked him how he came out so soon in the morning. He said, I have got some of the bakers bread below, but you must not take any notice. The watchman's name is Wyegate. I watched Wyegate to his door, about four doors from our house. He tapped three times with a stick upon the pavement, and the door was opened. He went into the house occupied by Mrs. Carter, where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Howell what you had seen - A. I did, about eight o'clock in the morning. Mr. Howell followed the prisoner about half past nine, up to the Queen Elms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Howell follow the prisoner - A. Yes, and Wyegate, the watchman, was talking to him at the Queen Elms. When Mr. Howell came up to look at his bread, he found four quartern loaves, and this flour, more than the prisoner had out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Wyegate had - A. He had a great quantity of bread under his great coat. I saw the top of two quartern loaves; it made a great bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Howell charge the prisoner with having more loaves and flour than the fair delivery - A. Yes. Millis said, the flour that he had in his basket, Mr. Lockey's young man gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Lockey - A. A baker, in Lisle-street, and when the young man was fetched, he denied it; in the hearing of the prisoner, he denied giving him the loaves and the flour. He then said, a stranger gave it him, and he was to leave it at the Queen Elms public-house for the stranger, and he was to have a glass of gin for leaving it. Wyegate was in custody a week before he said anything about the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. On Saturday, the 5th of December, I went along with Mr. Howell to the Queen Elms. Mr. Howell took the bread out of Millis's basket, and underneath there were two parcels of flour tied up in one bag, and a string between the two; underneath there was a bill of parcels where to take the flour to. Millis came back. Mr. Howell asked him how he had come by that. Millis said, that Lockey's man had given it him. Dick at Lockey's was produced before the prisoner. Dick said he knew nothing at all about it. Millis then said, some other person had given it him to leave at the Queen Elms until called for. Then Mr. Howell gave charge of the watchman. I took Wyegate to Queen-square office. He was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He was at large, and then in the afternoon, I was ordered to see after Millis. I searched the watchman's lodgings with an officer. We found a quartern loaf there; it was taken to Queen-square office. One of the men came forward, and said he believed it to be Mr. Howell's. Millis was brought forward. He was asked if he had anybody to speak for him. He said, he knew Mr. Dyson. I took him home with me until Tuesday, and then I resigned him up. Wyegate was in custody eleven days. He was released to give evidence against Millis.</p>

I went along with Dyson in search of Millis. I found Millis at a public-house, at Knightsbridge. I took him out, and told him I had a charge against him at the suit of his master, for stealing bread and flour. He seemed at first astonished, and denied it. He said, that Wyegate had been assisting him in removing the bread from the bakehouse to the shop. Wyegate was in custody. He was discharged on purpose of becoming an evidence against Millis.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the vinegar in your shop - A. No. The cask and its contents were under my window of my shop. I had seen it at seven o'clock, and about nine in the evening I perceived it gone. I went that evening to give information at the watchhouse that such a cask of vinegar was lost. I saw it again about twelve o'clock that night in Kelly's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Kelly - A. I believe he is a lumper. He lives in West's Gardens; that is about half a mile from Cock-hill. I saw the prisoner on the Monday following. The 5th, was Saturday. On Monday, I saw the prisoner in custody at Shadwell office, and when I saw the cask at Kelly's, I knew it to be mine that had been standing under my shop window.</p>

            . I am a beadle of Shadwell. On Saturday, the 5th of December, I saw a man rolling a cask about two hundred yards from Mr. Munro's premises; it was about nine o'clock in the evening. When the prosecutor came to the watch-house, and said he had lost a cask of vinegar from underneath his window, I told him what I had seen. I saw the way the man went down. I took a candle and lanthorn. We traced the marks of the cask to Kelly's house, and we found the cask at Kelly's house. The prosecutor claimed the cask. He took the cask and Kelly to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was it you saw rolling this cask - A. I could not observe. It was in the dark. It was a man with a long jacket on.</p>

It was rolled to my house about nine o'clock in the evening. Jame Smith and another man brought it. They asked me liberty to leave it in my yard until morning. I said there was not room in my yard; he might leave it in the room until morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man - A. I do not know. He was taken, and admitted an evidence, and then run away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after it was in your room was it that any body enquired after it - A. I saw Mr. Munro,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130053"/>Mr. Cleugh, and another gentleman. I asked them what they were looking for; they said, what is that to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they see the cask of vinegar - A. Not till I told them where it was. Mr. Munro said it was his. I directed him were to find Smith in the morning. I believe he lived at Limehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the cask that they found in your room was the cask that was brought by Smith and the other man - A. Yes, I am. They took me up about it. They kept me in prison until the Monday following. I had Smith taken on Sunday morning. Smith told me that he was employed by a cook of a ship to roll it down to King James's stairs. He was not able to roll it any further, so he rolled it to my place, to leave it there till the morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They all speak very true as far as I know. I was employed to roll or carry it in the best manner I could, to King James's stairs, and when I had rolled it four or five yards, he desired me to roll it back again. I said, I suppose it was New Crane stairs he meaned. He said, it was. I rolled it to Kelly's house. I met the other man. He said, where are you going. I said, to New Crane stairs. I looked round, and the man that hired me was gone. I went into several public-houses to look for him. I said to Carter, you must assist me in rolling it back. He said, what must you do with the cask. I said, I did not know; I know a man of the name of Kelly, near here, he will let me leave it in his place. I left it there. Carter and me went down to Three Crane stairs; we enquired of the waterman, and at the public-houses; we could not find the man. I went home until the morning. I was going down in the morning again, I met a man; he told me the officers were looking after me. He said, I had better keep out of the way. I replied, I shall not keep out of the way; I shall call at Shadwell office; and as I was going to the office, I met with an officer. He said, is your name

On the 18th of December last, she took possession of the apartment, and she left on the 6th of January, and took the key with her. On Friday she left the apartment; on the Tuesday following I had the door opened. I missed a pair of sheets, pillow-cases, and two blankets, and a pillow, tablecloth, and four curtains. These things were let to the prisoner with the lodging. I missed them. On the next morning, I saw them at Mr. Wadmore's, the pawnbroker in Tottenham-court-road, where I found the prisoner's char-woman,

I told him I did not want a penny for it, if I had any he should have it. I opened the till, and showed him one that was not thin enough. I shewed him the second and the third, they would not do. He reached his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130054"/>over the counter, pretending to point to some halfpence that would do, and with that he put his hand in the drawer and clasped as many halfpence as he could, and put them in his pocket. I said, he had robbed me before my face. He said, he had not robbed me. He said he had twenty-two halfpence about him. He pulled the money out of his pocket, and shewed it me. I told him, I was sure he had robbed me, and asked him if he would let me look in his pockets. He would not. I tried to reach over the counter to feel his pockets; he dodged back, he would not let me. I went round the counter. He went to the door, and went out. He crossed the way, and run. I went to my neighbour, and told him of it. I shewed him the prisoner; he was running; and my neighbour pursued him. I am sure the prisoner is the boy that took the halfpence.</p>

She pointed to the lad, and said, there he runs. The prisoner was then about sixty yards from my door. I pursued him. He turned the corner, and then I saw two. The other lad had on a blue coat. The prisoner a white one. The prisoner ran into a brick field. I got pretty near to him. I saw some people before; I called out, stop thief. He ran round by the heap of earth in the brick field; he made a bit of a stoop. I could only see his head as the earth was between him and me.

            . I am superintendant at the dock at Poplor. On the 30th of December, in the morning, about half past seven, the watchman sent a boy to acquaint me that he had a man in custody. I went and saw the prisoner in custody, with the rope that he cut. I asked the prisoner, why he had cut that rope. He told me, for hunger. I replied, there were several ships fitting out, they had not their complement of men, there was good provision there for him, and good pay.</p>
               <p>- BALL. I am a watchman in Blackett's yard. I saw the prisoner cut this rope from the bridge, and he ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Blackett's name - A. John: father and son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in great distress. I had had nothing to eat for two or three days scarce. I took the rope. I was going to sell it to get a bit of bread.</p>

He got into Tothill-fields. I made him an out-door apprentice, in a kind of a way that he might keep himself in credit, and not finding all the wire come home, I got a search warrant, and when I went I found all my tools missing, and never could find what he had done with my silver wire. My tools are here; they are plates and copper rings. I trusted him with the complete tools, altogether worth between ten and fifteen pounds.</p>

I went out, and compared the piece that he had brought back with the piece that had been cut that day. It was the piece that had been sawed that afternoon. One piece corresponded with the other.</p>

            . I am a watchman, in Hackney-road. I was crying the hour of ten. I saw the prisoner tumbling something near the saw-pit. It was after ten. I asked him, what he was doing. He said, it was nothing to me. I said, I was ordered to take care of the timber. He shewed me a piece of a bedstead. He seemed to be in liquor. He said, he lived in Coal-harbour-street. He came with me as far as Nelson-street. He went away, and instead of my going into the box, I went to the other end of the street. I heard a person coming down. I met the prisoner with a piece of timber on his shoulder. He put it down by his own door, I said, this is a comical piece of bedstead. He knocked at the door; his wife let him in. I knocked at the door. I said, tell your husband to come out. He came out, and at the corner of the street, I lost him. I went back, and secured the property that I had seen upon him. I took it to Mr. Foulkes, and Mr. Foulkes believed it to be the piece that was near the saw-pit. I took Mr. Foulkes with me to shew him where he lived, and there was another piece of timber before his door, who brought that I do not know. I am certain that he is the man.</p>

            . I am a patrol at Fulham. On the 10th of January, I was going my round, between three and four in the morning, I heard a noise at Mrs. Bankes's house. We went close to the house. We thought we saw some one on the house. It was not light enough to discern him. He slipped down when he saw us. He had got this pipe off, and had doubled it as you see it now. It was affixed to Mrs. Bankes's house.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of straw was it - A. It was oat straw; it grew upon an half acre, near 'Squire Littleton's. There is a rookery there. It was cut before it was ripe, in consequence of the rockery, or else it would have stopped a fortnight longer. On the 15th, I was going my round, I saw a trace of straw from my house to these men's premises. I traced it across the road, up to their doors, and when I got there, I saw two pig sties, and two hogs in each sty. One of the sties belonged to one of the prisoners and the other to the other. The hogs were feeding on oats, with chaff. I found one bundle of straw in each of their sheds. The oats were not cleaned to send to market; they had been thrashed. They always stand in the barn until we clean them up. The oats that the hogs were feeding on where like oats just thrashed. I clean them up every week, and send them to market. They had one bundle of straw in each of their sheds, and they had some oat straw in each of their sties; a very good bed for the hogs. I took samples out of each. I took it home and compared it with my straw at home. I found three bundles of straw missing. I do not sell straw. I use it all up on my farm.</p>
               <p>Q. These were bundles of straw, not trusses for sale - A. No; there were three bundles for my own use. I bound them myself, my man being unwell. I am sure that these bundles of straw in the hog sties were my property, and that they had growed upon that half acre. I enquired of

Then I enquired of William who the other two belonged to; he said, what is that to you. I then said, who feeds them; they are feeding upon my corn. He made use of bad words; he said, d - n and blast your eyes, if you swear we stole your property, we'll do for you.</p>

               <p>Q. Has each of your carman a bin appropriated to their own use - A. Yes, and each man keeps his own key.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 8th of this month were you present when Goodenough broke open the prisoner's corn bin - A. I was. The corn bin was in the stable. It was locked; and when I had it broken open, I discovered this wooden can, containing three quarts of gin. It is a kind of a pail. We use them wooden cans in the distillery. The men take out gin sometimes with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a pewter pot - A. No, there is a mistake in that. I found nothing else in the corn bin. The prisoner was not on the premises at the time. On the next morning, when he came to work, I had him taken up by Goodenough, and two quart bottles were found upon him. I then went with Goodenough to the prisoner's lodgings. I found there four quart bottles full of gin. I asked the prisoner what he brought the empty bottles for. He said, he had borrowed one of Mrs. Smith, who keeps a public-house, within a few yards of our house. He said he had some gin in a quart pot, underneath the manger of one of the horses. I told him I would go and search for it. I did. I could not find anything there. I returned, and told him I had not found what he described. We then told him what we had found. He said, he thought no harm of taking a drop to drink. He was then taken before the magistrate.</p>

I looked at the shilling he gave me; I told him it was a bad one, directly, and I threatened to send him to the Compter for putting a bad shilling upon me. I called out to the waterman that attends the coaches, to know where I could get a constable. The prisoner, upon my calling out, run into Leadenhall-market as fast as he could. I ran after him. I believe I called out, stop thief; some person in the market stopped him, and I came up to him. He was never out of my sight. The constable came by, and I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Draper that constable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the shilling that he gave you to the constable - A. I did, the next morning. I am sure the shilling that the prisoner gave to the constable. The prisoner was taken to the Compter, and at the Compter I agreed to purchase all the oranges he had for a shilling. I paid him for them with two sixpences. One of the sixpences was the sixpence that he had objected to, and then he made no objection to it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Christmas day, I was standing in Cornhill, selling oranges. This gentleman bought fourteen oranges of me for a shilling. He gave me two sixpences; one of them did not appear to me to be a good one. I refused it. He gave me an eighteen-penny piece. He said, give me a shilling. I took my shillings out of my pocket; I said, take one. He took one; he said, it was a bad one. I did not know it. I had just taken it. I said, I would change it for him. He said, I will not have it changed; he would give charge of me.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you known her to be actually in the service of Mr. Cock - A. I cannot say. She had left him for a twelve month, as they tell me. I supposed her to be Mr. Cock's <rs id="t18130113-108-deflabel652" type="occupation">servant</rs>

She came the next day for a turkey, two fowls, and four pounds of butter. I delivered that to her, as I thought for Mr. Cock. She came in the evening of the same day for a goose and two rabbits. When she went out of the shop, my man said she was a little drunk. I did not see her afterwards, until I saw her before the magistrate, on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Cock since - A. I do not know that I ever saw him in my life. I never knew him. His servant came and paid for what he had.</p>

He called, he said, for a parcel for Mrs. Cater. I had previously received a letter from a person calling herself Mrs. Cater, on the morning of the same day.</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Cater will be obliged to Mrs. Ord to send her on Thursday by the carrier, six yards of twilled sarsenet, and the widest you have. I think I paid you for the last I had seven shillings per yard. I wish to have it of the same quality, and a bill of the same, and the carrier shall bring you the money on his return; also will thank you to send me two or three skeins of purple silk. Stretham, December 3, 1812. Addressed to Mr. Ord, St. Paul's churchyard."</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Ord. You had no such customer - A. No; that excited my suspicion. I gave orders to my people that if the carrier should call, the goods should not be sent. They were to state to the carrier if he called, that the lady was not known to me. About five in the evening, the prisoner called as the carrier. He said, he was the Stretham carrier, that he called for Mrs. Cater's parcel. I went to the prisoner from curiosity. I asked him what Mrs. Cater was. He said, she was a lady of great respectability, and kept her carriage. He had been her carrier for four years. I asked him where he went from in London. He said, the Old Bailey, Bishopsgate-street, and the Borough. He held in his hand a pocket-book; it appeared to contain letters, as carriers commonly have directions and orders and patterns of goods that he had got to match. I was determined to risk it. I thought she might have been a lady that came to my shop. I was present when the goods were delivered, six yards of sarsenett, at eight shilings a yard, and three skeins of purple silk at ten-pence a skein. They were put up in a paper parcel, by a young person who is in court, directed to Mrs. Cater, Stretham.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your property, and you expected to be paid for them, did not you - A. I did. I have not receive the remittance as promised. I did not receive the money on the following day. I became suspicious that the carrier or Mrs. Cater had deceived me. I waited a reasonable time for the money to arrive, I sent a young man down to Stretham, to ascertain the fact. They ascertained that there was no Mrs. Cater, at Stretham.</p>
               <p>Q. You never received the money or had the goods returned - A. No.</p>

            . I assist Mr. Ord. I was in the shop at the time that Mr. Ord described, that the prisoner came in. The prisoner came in, and asked for the parcel for Mrs. Cater. I went and told Mr. Ord that the carrier had come for the parcel for Mrs. Cater. Mr. Ord came to the prisoner; he asked him whether he knew Mrs. Cater. He said, yes, he knew her perfectly well; he said, she was a lady that kept her carriage, and that he had carried parcels for her for four years. Mr. Ord then went and cut off the sarsenet, and gave it me to pack up. I packed it, and enclosed a note with a bill of parcels. I directed it to Mrs. Cater, Stretham; and while he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130060"/>was at the counter he pulled out his pocket-book, and in his pocket-book there were several papers; on one was a bit of muslin. He said, it would be eleven o'clock before he got home. Then I gave him the parcel. He asked for a pint of beer. He never returned the next day. On the 21st, I went with the officer for the purpose of taking the prisoner. He was taken at the Dog and Bear public-house, in the Borough, at half after ten at night. The moment I saw him I knew him. I have no doubt he is the same person.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 4th of January, I went to the cousin of the prisoner, and I got the direction where the prisoner lodged from the cousin. She said, this box belonged to the prisoner. In this box I found the bill of parcels, proporting to be writ by Mr. Ord. This is it; and here are the three skeins of silk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ord. That is the bill of parcel that was given to the prisoner with a note directed to Mrs. Cater.</p>
