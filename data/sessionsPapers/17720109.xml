I came the next morning about half after six, and rung at the door, the window shutters were put too; the bolt was forced off, and the sash broke, and pushed up as high as it would go; the closet door stood a little open. I went about three o'clock the day before to fetch out a bible for my mistress, then the cabinet was safe. There was a bell in the window which was taken away, and laid in the sink; and the glass of the window was broke just at the screw; there were two marks of feet upon the iron rails that are before the window.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live at the bottom of the Minories. On the 23d of December the two prisoners and Collins came to my shop between ten and eleven o'clock, to buy clothes, my son sold Burn a Bath surtout for half a guinea. I was in the shop at the time; he paid two crown pieces and a six-pence for it, but not a new six-pence. Parker afterwards bought a coat and a waistcoat, for which he paid a guinea in thirty-two new six-pences and a crown piece. Collins did not buy any thing.</p>

               <p>Rooke. Some of them were there till eleven o'clock that night; I can't say whether Collins was.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collins. Had you any conversation about going out that night?</p>
               <p>Collins. Nothing more than common. I got up again about half after eleven o'clock. Burn and Parker came up to me as I got up; we went to several places about Westminster; then we went to Marybone, and from thence to Chelsea. There I broke open the shutters, and got into a house; it was fastened with a bolt, which was pulled off; afterwards I forced it open with two chissels; the nail was drawn out of the bolt; I broke a pane of glass, and threw a handkerchief over the bell to prevent its ringing, and took it out. Burn was at the corner of the street to watch; Parker was out at the gate three or four times. I drew out a sort of a brass-headed iron that was in the sash, and then threw the sash up. Parker went in, but he ran out again almost as soon as he got in. We took such a little desk as this out of a closet by the window; we had a tinder-box with us; I broke the cabinet open when we got into the lane, and found some crown pieces in it, either eight or nine, and some new shillings and six-pences, I can't tell how many; also a two-guinea piece, a black snuff-box, and a picture inside it like a bracelet; there was a little stone, and a large medal that seemed to be of one of the Popes. We threw the desk in the road, and the papers too. We did not divide the money regularly; I had the crown pieces in my pocket. I lent Parker one crown to buy his cloaths; Burn had two crowns of me before that; Parker had the sixpences and shillings. I put the crowns underneath the seat of the coach as we were drawn down to the Mansion-house. We changed two of the crowns coming down Holborn. I bought this coat just above Mr. Burke's shop, and paid two crowns for it.</p>
               <p>Court. You have given an account of eight?</p>

               <p>Q. from Parker. Had not I some new silver in my pocket a day or two before this happened?</p>
               <p>Collins. Yes, and I asked him how he came by it; he said, what was that to me?</p>
               <p>Q. Was the silver you paid away at Mr. Burke's shop part of the money that came out of the house?</p>
               <p>Collins. Yes.</p>

               <p>Fowler. Shut down. The prisoner was standing between the chairs, and the two coats and the waistcoat were bundled up, and lay in the chair they had hung on before.

I went and knocked at the door; I could not make any body hear; I thought it was an empty house, so I got in at the window; I had not been in a minute before that gentleman came in, and said I was a thief, and he would take me before a justice. I had been at sea, and I was going to the Marine Society to go again on board a merchantman. I used to do things for my father, who is a porter. I used to go on errands for gentlemen.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old next July. I was along with Mrs. Tooth about three minutes after eight in the Park; the two prisoners came up and demanded our money; I told one of them that I had but a shilling; I gave him that. I went down Park-lane, and met the two prisoners coming out at Park-gate. Knowing them both again, I dogg'd them into the Golden-lion at Hyde-park corner; then I got my father, and secured them; I said these are the two men that robbed me and my aunt in the Park; they said they had not been in the Park for four years, for that they were deserters. I knew the regiment they belonged to by their cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see that?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamps?</p>
               <p>Salmon. There were lamps in Park-lane; I could see by the light from them. A man came by whom they offered to stop, but he got on pretty briskly, so got off.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from your aunt?</p>
               <p>Salmon. Not a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Ward, and which Randall?</p>
               <p>Salmon. That is Ward, I believe, and the other Randall. (Describing them wrong.) They were searched; one had three six-pences, a shilling, and some halfpence.</p>

               <p>Q. How near is the Golden-lion to Hyde-park corner?</p>
               <p>Pugh. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. When you came down the lane, where did you see the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Pugh. They were just on the outside of the gate, coming towards the Golden-lion.</p>

               <p>I never was nearer the Park than the Golden-lion; I had been drinking with some of my comrades in Brigg-street, which is pretty near half a mile below the Golden-lion.</p>

               <p>I was along with Randall; I am quite innocent; Salmon described our dress wrong.</p>
               <p>Salmon. I said you had got a pair of white stockings, and that the other had garters on. I thought it had been so by the appearance in the dark, but it turned out to be dark-coloured stockings.</p>

               <p>Lees. There were two men of good character in the company who said they were in company with them. I did not know of this trial till between twelve and one o'clock to day. One of the men was examined before Sir John; the other was there, but he was not called.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoners first mention these two people?</p>
               <p>Lees. The very first time that I was with them.</p>

               <p>Salmon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Be cautious, and give me a true answer to this question - After you came out of Park-lane, when you first saw the prisoners, were they in the way from Brigg-street to the Golden-lion?</p>
               <p>Salmon. They were going from the Park-gate towards the Golden-lion, and were not going from Brigg-street towards the Golden-lion.</p>

The portmanteau was carried out into the field; out of that I lost a coat and waistcoat, four shirts, seven pair of stockings, three handkerchiefs, two silk and a linen one, three neck-cloths: There was a pair of breeches, and a new piece of nankeen left in the fields; they were in the portmanteau with the other things.

I saw the sheet a week before when he took the room. He was stopt for another robbery, and then I went to see what was gone out of our room, and missed the sheet. He confessed having stole it, and said he pawned it at Mr. Wildman's at Islington. I went there and found it. (The sheet produced, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

The prisoner and another man came into my house with two pieces of cloth, on (I think) the 27th of November, about twelve at noon; they had some in a sack, and a piece under their arms. After they had been about an hour, they asked if we could lodge him. I said he might lodge in the garret, and put the things in my bed-chamber. I thought he had brought them out of the country to sell. He went away, and I heard no more of him till Saturday, when the other man came to me, and told me, a spiteful person had put him in prison on suspicion of stealing the cloth, and asked me to let him have it. I would not. He said he was going down to be examined again, and asked me if I would go. I went, and told the justice of the other things. I saw it measured at the justice's; I think one of the two pieces was light cloth; one 17 yards and upwards, the other 16 yards, and one I believe about 12 yards of serge.

               <p>I was going down to Birmingham, and between Whetstone and Barnet I saw this lying on the road. I picked it up; another man was very close by me; I brought it up on the Causeway; found it too heavy for to pretend to carry it back to London; I took a piece out, and put the other on the side of the road. I thought, as the hay-carts came to town in the morning, that they might bring it. I did not know the colour, it being dark. I came to town to the Three Pigeons; I left a piece with a man there, a countryman of mine; I never offered to sell it. I went and gave a man a shilling to put it in his hay-cart, and carry it to Mr. Prebble's. I never advertised the thing; I did not know how to go about it; I intended to advertise it going next day to the Pigeons, thinking I had all the cloth together. They charged a constable with me. I know I was a little in liquor when I went there. I saw no waggon when I picked it up.</p>

On Sunday night, December the 15th, I was picked up in Drury-lane, at the end of Long-acre; I was a little in liquor, and was so foolish as to go with her; she took me to Angle's; we had some liquor there; there I missed my pocketbook, and asked for it: they said they had not got it; and one went out and then the other, and I went after them into the street. I saw Angle, and asked her for my pocket-book; then I missed my watch out of my fob. I ran after Angle; she got away. The next morning a young man that lodges with me went to Sir

            . On Monday morning a barber that lives in the front room of this house came and said. there was a gentleman robbed the over night in the room; I asked him which way he knew it; he said he had seen the gentleman. I went and searched the prisoner's lodging, which is the back room, and found underneath the drawers a pocket-book open and the papers all loose; the papers had all been examined. Mrs. Angle came in; I asked her where the watch was. What watch! said she. I said I have found the pocket-book, if you don't give it me I shall search you. She hesitated a long time; at last she pulled it out of her pocket. I took her into Bow-street. On examining the pocket-book I found who it belonged to, and sent a man to enquire whether this man lodged at the house that a letter was directed to him at.</p>

I said you lie in a shocking manner; I asked two young men to help him on the causeway, that he might not be exposed to the carts. As I came back at Bartler's buildings I saw the person reared up between the prisoner, another man, and a boy; one said you had better take a coach, and repeated it; the old man said, no; I will walk. I heard the old man say, you say I have no watch; I have a watch. I went away. I had not gone far before it struck in my mind, I don't know what these fellows have in view. I went back; I saw the prisoner snatch something out of his hand and run off; I ran after him, he turned round, and I took him by the collar; he lifted up his hand that had the watch in it; I got a constable, and he was taken to the Counter. I gave the watch to the constable. (The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>

On the 12th of December, about eleven in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner come out of one of the warehouses with a basket of raisins and the sack on his back. On my going to the door, he slept back a step or two, and throwed it off his back. I stopt him at the warehouse door, and asked what business he had there, and how he could have the impudence to rob us in the middle of the day. He fell on his knees, and begged for pardon. I found in the sack a basket of Malaga raisins, about 50 lb. It was one of five we had received on the 5th of December from Reading; that was missing out of the five; the constable has had it ever since. The sack lay empty in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>There was seven or eight of us went down to look for work; we went to the bottom of the wharf, and they employed about four of us. I staid to see if there would be any thing for me. I went into this warehouse, and saw this sack by the door, and something in it. I kick'd it with my foot to see if it was a jobb for me, if it was but two-pence or three-pence. The warehouse is common for any body to go in from the wind. I had no design to steal it; I never did such a thing in my life.</p>

I did not feel the woman taking the watch nor the money till she was going away; then I had the presence of mind to feel for my watch, and it was gone. Then I said hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you together?</p>
               <p>Morrison. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any familiarities pass?</p>
               <p>Morrison. No: Then she denied the watch, and made several protestations, and opened her bosom for me to search her. Then the watch came up, and some people, and used me ill. When the watchman came, I gave charge of her. She was carried to the watch-house, where she was searched, but nothing was found on her. Mr. Barrett, the constable, coming by, asked what was the matter; and there was a woman in the watch-house that saw the watch hanging by her side; the seal was tuck'd under her petticoat-string behind. I lost the two shillings at the same time, I cannot say out of which pocket. I don't know what money I had; she owned to taking five shillings to the mistress of the watch-house. I can safely swear I had two shillings in my pocket; I received eight or nine that night, some of one Mr. Gold, and some of a person in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you met the woman had you the watch?</p>
               <p>Morrison. I am very sure I had it when I met her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it out while you conversed with her?</p>
               <p>Morrison. No.</p>
               <p>- Barrett. I am the officer. I saw this woman at the watch-house. I went to know what was the matter, and there was a noise about a watch and some money that was lost. Some people appeared to her character, and said he was drunk, and lost his watch, that I was almost persuaded of her innocence. A woman that was a prisoner said she certainly had the watch. I then searched her, and found it between her legs in her hand; I believe she was going to shift it. (The watch produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) There was no money found upon her. She could not tell what to say, she seemed confused. He was a little in liquor, he was not drunk; he had a black eye, and had been ill used. He told the number and maker's name of the watch directly; he was sober enough to know what he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going down Drury-lane; this man met me, and took me down Steward's-rents, and asked me to oblige him. I asked him to make me a present; he said he would go and get change; I would not trust him, so he gave me the watch while he went to get change, and then he wanted to have it again; on my refusal, he brought three watchmen to take me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you give her the watch?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>

            . I drive the Northampton coach. The prisoner came to me at Barnet on the 29th of November, and asked me if I could bring him to London an outside passenger. He said he had beer at the next door; he asked me if I would drink; he put a bundle into the boot, and came with me to this side of Sadler's-wells; then he got down, and went himself to take his bundle out. I saw him take out the portmanteau; I said, that is not your bundle. He made no answer, but took it out, and ran away with it. It was about seven in the evening, and was very dark. I took him up between five and six o'clock; it was dark then.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you know the man?</p>
               <p>Knight. I saw his face when I drank with him in the house, and am positive the prisoner is the man. When he had taken out the portmanteau, he ran down the path-way into the fields. The portmanteau belonged to the Rev. Mr. De Sallis.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Was there two portmanteaus, or one?</p>
               <p>Knight. One portmanteau with a case.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. What clothes had I on when you took me up?</p>
               <p>Knight. I think a light-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No. I had the same coat on as I have now. He has laid it the 29th of December; it was the 11th of December I found the portmanteau to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of the portmanteau being found?</p>
               <p>Knight. The day he was taken.</p>

            . I am a silversmith in the Borough. On the 2d of December I bought these gold knee-buckles of the prisoner (producing them); he took them out of his breeches-knees. On the 3d of December he sold me a pair of gold shoe buckles. I gave him 3 l. 7 s. an ounce; they were not standard.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Burges. Very genteel; he said he was in an office, and was afraid to wear them; he said he had not wore them above three or four times, and that he lost l. by them.</p>

            . I was going to the Minories on Saturday the 14th of December. While I was in <placeName id="t17720109-23-crimeloc146">Butcher-row, Lower East-Smithfield</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17720109-23-crimeloc146" type="placeName"

I looked over my shoulder, and saw the prisoners and another man running across the street into a passage. I was afraid they would knock me on the head if I went after them; so I stopt, and they came out again in the main street, and said, Now we have got it, we don't know what to make of it. I took Fenley by the breast, and said, You are the man that picked my pocket. He swore a great oath, and said he would knock me down with a carman's whip; and when the mob came up, and encreased, they got away. We went after them as far as the Hermitage, where we took Fenley, and carried him into the Sun, the bottom of Nightingale-lane. I never found my things again. I am certain these are the people that robbed me. I looked over my shoulder, and saw enough of them to know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the third person that is not taken?</p>
               <p>Paxton. Yes; when I collared Fenley, the other was close by, and bid him knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoners. Why did not you lay hold of us before we went into the passage?</p>
               <p>Paxton. Because I was alone, and could not encounter with three?</p>
               <p>- Brown. I was passing by; seeing a mob, I stopped. and saw the two prisoners and another man; one had a whip. I went with the prosecutor, when they run away, to take them. When they came out of the mob, the tall man had the horse-whip. We followed them to the end of Nightingale-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the men you saw at the end of Nightingale-lane, were the same as came out of the passage?</p>
               <p>Brown. I cannot positively say: he said he could swear to all three of them. Banks came in to vindicate the other; I believe they swore pretty much, and he asked Fenley if he knew him; he said, No, d - n your eyes, I never saw you in my life before.</p>
               <p>Banks's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was just come from Deptford; I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090018"/> through Wapping, and I went away as far as from here to Newgate, where I stopped to make water. A man came up to me, and asked what I was peeping into the window for. I said, to see what was the matter. He said, he believed I was one concerned, and I should go with him. I asked what he meant by that, and made a resistance, and I asked if he knew me. He said, No; he broke out of the watch-house; and I do not know whether this is the lad that was in the watch-house with me or no.</p>
               <p>Fenley's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going to my aunt's when this man laid hold of me in Nightingale-lane. He took me to the justice. The next day he went to my mother, and asked her to give him 4 s. 6 d. for the cloth. He could not swear to me before the justice. He went to my mother again to ask her for a guinea, and said, if she would not give him a guinea, he would make the witness swear, and then he swore at the justice's that I was the person. I am used to the Sea.</p>
               <p>Q. to Paxton. Did you offer to take 4 s. 6 d. the morning after for your cloth?</p>
               <p>Paxton. No. On Monday night I could not see what colour his face was. The justice asked if I could swear to him. I said, no. He said he would remand him back to prison. On the Friday morning his face was clean, and as soon as I saw him, I knew he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to take a guinea, half-guinea, or any money, to make it up?</p>
               <p>Paxton. No; they offered to give me something. I said, if they would go to Justice Sherwood, and he would discharge them on that account, he might.</p>

While I was ringing the bell at a gentleman's door there, the prisoner came behind me, and I turned my head, and saw him draw the handkerchief out of my pocket. I cried, Stop thief! He run away straight up the street. I followed him about twenty yards; he fell down, and I fell upon him. I charged him with having my handkerchief; he denied it; he stript for me to search him; I did, but could not find it. When I was bringing him back, I found it at the corner of Houndsditch; he had thrown it away. (The handkerchief produced, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>On Sunday night was week I was coming from Shoemaker-row; I saw this gentleman, he was running along. He stopt a lad, and said, you have picked my pocket; he searched the lad, but did not find it. Then he laid hold of me, and said, I believe it was you. He let me go then. About three hours afterwards he and another man took me behind a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you at first charge another man?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; I took him up. As I was carrying him to the Compter he got away.</p>

            . I am a merchant's watchman on the kays. I saw the prisoner, on the 12th of December, go to a frail of plumbs several times, and take out the plumbs. I went to him, and took hold of him. He begged me to let him go. The frail was almost empty. The frail held about half a hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the prisoner work on the kays?</p>
               <p>Butler. No, he is nothing but a plunderer on the kays. I had spoke to him to go away several times.</p>

            . I was in the shop between two and three o'clock. The prisoner came in and another person with her, and asked to see some ribbands. I shewed them a drawer of ribbands; the prisoner took up a ribband to look at, and then desired me to hand another ribband to her that was in the window; I shewed it her; she did not like it; she was going out, and I saw this piece of ribband in her apron. I said, young woman, you have a piece of ribband; she seemed confused, and said, no; it is a piece I bought at the next shop. I took it out of her apron, and I have no doubt but that it is the prosecutor's, it is one of the pieces I shewed her.</p>

A neighbour informed me that they had purchased four pieces of brass, which they thought were mine. When I inspected them I thought they belonged to me. I took them home and examined them with the pattern, I had more reason then to believe that they belonged to me. I did not at that time know who sold them, but I desired them if the person should offer more goods of that sort to stop him. I was informed in December, that there were more goods offered by a woman, who represented herself to be this man's wife, upon which I took up the prisoner; he at first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090021"/> denied it; afterwards he owned before his master, that he had taken the four pieces of brass out of the warehouse that was even with a garret, where he had been mending a floor. There was a large quantity of these sort of pieces lay in this warehouse; they are sockets for warming pans. He said before my lord-mayor, that he found them under the floor in the garret, and looked upon them to be his perquisites.</p>

I watched several nights. In the night between the 2d and 3d of December I heard a noise on the tops of the house; at last I heard a piece of lead fall; then I heard another piece fall. After some time I heard the lead rattling below. Accordingly I went to the place; there I saw the prisoner with the lead upon his shoulder. On seeing me, he threw the lead down, and ran away. I pursued and took him. I examined the house where the lead fell, and it appeared that it had been cut from a house lately occupied by Mr. Peters; that was the only house of five or six that had not been plundered.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you think he got up?</p>
               <p>Bannister. By the wateredge of the next house.</p>

            . I am a waterman. I brought Ward ashore when Mr. Brigs stopped him coming from the Elizabeth. I did not know he had the carrots of tobacco till I came on shore. I was coming from Union-stairs, he hailed me, and bid me put the boat round the lighter. I heard two voices; the basket was handed into my boat, which was covered over, and I got Ward and the tobacco in; he bid me stop, there was another coming; then Trotter looked over the stern, and said, are you gone? he made answer, Jemmy are you coming? he replied he could not come that night, because there was nobody on board but himself and the cook. As I was rowing him on shore, I said, I fancy you have something here that you should not have, if I had known it I would not have took you in; he said, what he had was no harm, for if any boat came along side he could drop it over-board. I told him it was hazardous to me and my boat too. I was agoing to row him ashore at the Hermitage, and he bid me row him to Smith's Ways; he bid me come after him, because he had no money; as he came on shore the officer, Brigs, stopped him. The tobacco weighed one quarter and fourteen pound. Brigs took it from him, and he ran away. I saw the prisoners drinking together. I charged them with it, and they both went out of the house.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about it. I went on board to see James, and he was not on board; going on shore there was a man desired I would carry this basket for him: he said, he would come on shore at Smith's Ways and pay me, and he called a sculler. Going on shore the officer stopped me, and asked what it was; he took it out of my hand, and I went away, and said, I would get somebody to take it. I know nothing what it was no more than the child unborn.</p>

            . I received the flat of Mr. Fenix; I put it among other things under my master's window. The two prisoners were drinking at my master's house at the time the waggon came in. They went out. They came in again, and had more drink. They went away; I followed them about thirty yards from the place. I found one of them was helping the flat of butter upon the other's shoulder. I called for assistance, and secured them. I got the flat of butter back, and it appeared to be the same flat that Mr. Fenix had unloaded in the morning.</p>

There is the mark of two chissels, which had been made use of in order to strain the sash off to take away the effect of the screw; it is very plain they entered there: by the violent wrench the bed within side gave way, so they then got up the sash. In order to favour their design, when they came in, the curtain was let down so as to screen every thing above the top of the wall, for fear, I suppose, that the light should appear. The same people that entered broke open a chest of drawers. In the front palour there was a tea-chest, in which were two silver cannisters, a pair of silver tea-tongs, and a silver strainer; they took them, and they threw the sugar out of the sugar-dish on the table between the windows: they went, I suppose, next into the back parlour; there was a chest of drawers with five large drawers. The chest was a very strong one, which they had great difficulty in opening; they broke open the bottom of a book-case, a bureau, and a closet in that room (the back parlour). They also broke open in the passage another place that the servants bring the linen down from, that is used on the table (the house-keeper's pantry) but they took nothing from that.</p>
               <p>Q. What was lost out of the back parlour?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. A gold coronation medal, a broad five-and-twenty, a piece of gold coin, &amp;c. (repeating the things mentioned in the indictment) with many other things of great value.</p>
               <p>Q. The most valuable of these things, where were they?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. In the chest; the rest, the gold chains, the crown pieces, and the half-crown pieces were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that chest very difficult to open?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. It is a mahogany chest, of an inch and a half-plank, with plates at each corner, fastened with wood screws; they began it at one corner, then they whirled it round and went to the other corner; and at last drew three screws out that screwed the siaple, about this length ( describing it, about a foot long) I do not suppose a horse could have drawn them out.</p>
               <p>Q. No body had access to it but yourself?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. No other person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since you had been at the chest before?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. There was hardly a day in the year when I was in town but I went to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen most of these things in the chest in some reasonable time?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. Yes; and there was a pocket-book with some notes of hand, and to a very considerable amount. I verily believe they were all there that night, at twelve o'clock, that the robbery was committed. I returned home from the tavern about twenty minutes after eleven, and from half an hour till three quarters after eleven I went to bed. Some of my family will shew you lordship; they were up after me. I went into the back parlour, as I always do, to hang up my hat, and put down my stick. I always go into the fore parlour to receive my cap to go up to bed; every thing was safe then; it was one of the finest nights, perhaps, as ever was seen; it was full moon, and a remarkably clear, fine night; that if any man had stood upon the hill, if I had stood at the top, and he stood any where between the bottom and the top, I should certainly have seen him, it was so remarkably a clear night. I was disturbed about a quarter after seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. It was not light enough to see to dress myself properly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think they must have been about breaking open this strong chest, and the other places?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. I should think they could not be less than two hours; there was another box in this strong chest that had nothing but writings in it; they broke it open; they were disappointed, and meddled with nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing, the persons that had committed this burglary, left behind them?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. My servant saw some things; there was a chissel, which was a very useful thing to them in this robbery; after having got the chissel into this chest, they broke the saneer, and came at the screws; for it is a very strong chest. They had then recourse to my parlour poker,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090028"/> which had been new steeled, that was so drove against the end of the top of the chest, that it has left almost a polish on the poker now.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in your judgement you have no doubt but the thieves got in at this window?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the servants use candles when you came down?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. Yes, when I came into this back parlour the chest was opened, and the writings and things thrown about; some writings remained in the drawers, some were thrown about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go out of the door or window?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. They went out the same way they came in I believe; they opened the gate to go out of it; but they went out of the window of the house; they unbolted the bolts but could not get the lock open; the key is always carried up stairs, and so they went out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. from all the prisoners. Whether you ever saw us loiter about your house with intention to rob you?</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. No.</p>

            . I got up about half an hour after seven. I came down a little before my master.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Sir Robert said he got up at half after seven; the servant says he got up before his master.</p>
               <p>Wargent. I can't speak exactly to the time. The thieves had got in at the parlour window next the gate; it is about a yard and a quarter high; I believe they had broke the bolt of the outside shutter off, which I had bolted over night, there is a pin goes a-cross the window; they had forced there their chissels in, and so separated the sashes and got them open. I fastened the window about four o'clock in the afternoon. I went to bed about twelve o'clock; I was in that parlour a little before I went to bed; the window was safe then. When I came down stairs I went into the fore room; I saw the window up and one of Sir Robert's swords lying naked in a chair; it was a mourning sword; it was in the sheath the night before standing upon the ground in the back parlour. I found three pokers in the back parlour, one of them was bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Does no servant lie either on the kitchen or parlour floor?</p>
               <p>Wargent. No; all above stairs. I saw this chissel (producing it) and the chest was drawn out about a yard, the chissel is broke; here is the bolt of the parlour window (producing it) it was broke off, a strong poker very much bent; they made an attempt at my pantry, but had not broke it open; they broke open several drawers in the kitchen; the door was locked, and they had tried to wrench it with this chissel by the mark of it; they broke one of the points of the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing lost out of the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Wargent. Yes; three silver saucepans, two silver skewers, three tea-spoons, and one old table-spoon. I saw them there the night before when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you wake in the morning?</p>
               <p>Wargent. Not till the house-maid came to call me. I laid up three-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoners. If he saw us lurking about the house at any time?</p>
               <p>Wargent. I saw two men there about ten o'clock over night, they were in the passage of the next house but one to Sir Robert's; there is a court; I cannot tell who they were, one was standing at the end of this passage, another standing at the next house; I came up to our gate; I did not ring, but turned round, and looked at them; I went towards them, and they went up the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this when you went to fetch Sir Robert home?</p>
               <p>Wargent. No; I had been out about my own business before.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoners. Whether it was either of us?</p>
               <p>Wargent. I do not think it was; I went to fetch Sir Robert about eleven; we got home about a quarter after eleven; but saw none of them then.</p>

               <p>Court. Did nobody lie on the first floor?</p>
               <p>Jones. No: when I came to the parlour door I saw both the doors open, and the window wide open, and the curtains were down; I went up to the house-keeper to call up Sir Robert; we let the curtains down when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Sir Robert said they were up.</p>
               <p>Sir Robert. When I came from the tavern I went into the room, the curtains appeared to me to be up then.</p>

               <p>Jones. Entirely down; I drawed the curtains up before I saw Sir Robert.</p>
               <p>Q. How far up?</p>
               <p>Jones. I drew them up pretty near the top, not quite, they do not go quite to the top. There were missing one quart saucepan and one pint saucepan, and another saucepan without a handle, all silver; they were upon the shelf in the kitchen, and there was a silver skewer and an old silver kitchen spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing the persons had left behind them?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, a match and a candle in the fore parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the match one of your matches?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; we have not such matches in the house, as I know of; these are them (producing a bit of a large match that had been lighted and a piece of candle) the candle was in the window that was broke open.</p>

I saw a picture in the square snuff-box. There were between thirty and forty mourning rings; I never counted them; there was about eight or nine diamond rings.

               <p>Lyons. No; I did not take notice of that; there was one hoop diamond ring set, I think, in gold; there was a diamond breast buckle; there were three silver saucepans, two skewers; one of the silver saucepans had the handle broke off; two silver tea cannisters, one silver sugar bason, with a cover, they were square, both of a size; there was one eating spoon that had been used very much; there was a kind of a coat of arms upon it, but I did not understand it, and there were one pair of tea-tongs, and two or three old silver tea spoons.</p>

               <p>Q. How many crown pieces do you think together?</p>
               <p>Lyons. A great quantity of them, for they took them away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay with you?</p>
               <p>Lyons. About three quarters of an hour, Burton and Flannagan went away first about a quarter of an hour before the other two; Phanix and Jones staid to reckon what they would come to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the money before they two went away?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes; the sixteen guineas and half a moidore.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say?</p>
               <p>Lyons. I asked them where the things came from; Jones and Phanix said they came from a house in the city, but could not tell whose; they said the house went down somewhere by the water side; that it was a very great house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you what way it was got?</p>
               <p>Lyons. They told me they broke it open. Jones said that they were near three hours before they could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Near three hours getting in, or after they were in the house?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Near three hours before they got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they explain whether they were near three hours trying to force their way in; or what was the expression they used?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Very near three hours before they could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones say this in the presence of the other three?</p>
               <p>Lyons. No; after Burton and Flanagan were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation about the house where these things came from in the presence of Burton and Flanagan?</p>
               <p>Lyons. No. (A spoon shewn him) That is the very crest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the same crest on the old spoon?</p>
               <p>Lyons. There was no crest nor coat of arms, but only three letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what were the letters?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. to Mary Jones. What were the letters on the spoon?</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any intercourse with these men after they went from you? when were they taken up?</p>

               <p>Lyons. I saw them no more after that time. On the Monday following I sent nine guineas to the prisoners, in sealed-up papers; three guineas in three separate papers to Burton, Flanagan, and Phanix. I paid Jones three guineas at my own house on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send these three guineas to each of them by?</p>
               <p>Lyons. My servant-girl; she is just by. I bid her carry one paper to Burton in Clerkenwell Bridewell; the others to Phanix and Flanagan in New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send money to these prisoners at any other time?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes; in the Christmas-week I sent fifteen guineas to prison, and five I gave to Jones when he came; five guineas to Burton, five guineas to Flanagan, and five guineas to Phanix: Jones came to me, and I gave him five guineas; that was a Saturday. I sent these parcels to the prison by my wife. I went last Saturday a week to Newgate, and carried them sixteen guineas. I saw there the four prisoners. Jones was then not confined, but was taken as he came down stairs. I gave them then four guineas a-piece out of my own pocket. They said they should want some more money before the sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the gold chains?</p>
               <p>Lyons. All the gold was melted down; the chains, medals, and boxes. One Josephs melted them down. There are two brothers of the Josephs; one had the silver, the other the gold.</p>

               <p>Lyons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not unlawful, in your religion, to traffic on a sabbath morning?</p>
               <p>Lyons. I have not followed my religion a good while, for I cannot live by my religion.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw Heley that afternoon, and he gave you one of the hand-bills?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that hand bill I believe all the things you have mentioned are described?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes; there were rather more things than were in that hand bill; the gold watch was not in the hand-bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked whether you saw any crown pieces; you said you believed there was; you said you believed you saw some; it is only belief now, is it? You say Flanagan and Burton were gone away when you had this conversation?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the beginning of your evidence, you said you had no conversation with them?</p>
               <p>Lyons. I had very little conversation; this was all the conversation I had with them, which was after those two were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked whether you enquired where the things came from, and they said, from a house in the city, but did not know where?</p>
               <p>Lyons. They did not know the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no conversation with them whether they had been concerned in taking them, but only they said they came from a house they did not know where?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said on the spoon there was S. R?</p>

               <p>Lyons. No, there were three; I only remember those.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you was taken into custody?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Near three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to charge the prisoners, above all the people you were acquainted with, with these things?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Because they brought them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that now, and insist upon it?</p>
               <p>Lyons. Yes; I said it before Sir John and Sir Robert.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never read over that hand-bill since, in order to refresh your memory as to the quantity of these things?</p>
               <p>Lyons. No; I kept it in my pocket: it was as black as ink: Mr. Tinsdale has got it.</p>

               <p>Sir Robert. They are were on all public occasions. The gold chain of Lady Ladbroke's are very small links, like the old fashioned necklaces that were used to be worn; and at the bottom of it was a barrel of gold, set with pieces of chain, to make a finish.</p>

               <p>Bromly. Yes, it was. Jones said, Lyons had some things of his; he said that he asked forty or fifty guineas for them; and Lyons said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090033"/> were not worth half the money, not nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Bromly. About three of four o'clock in the afternoon. I cannot say exactly; and Jones and I came away together. Lyons said he had got a piece of gold to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. He said this in the presence of Jones?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No; Jones was not there at that time. I said I would send somebody to buy it of him. I went to one Heatley.</p>
               <p>Court. He is not here?</p>
               <p>Council. No; he was here last sessions, but was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any gold at Lyons's?</p>
               <p>Bromly. I saw a piece of metal that they called gold; they put it in a scale; Heatley bought it; he gave him about thirty guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the conversation was about the rings; was any thing said about Heatley?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No; Heatley was not there. Jones said he had some rings worth 40 l. I saw none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lyons or Jones talk about any other rings?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No.</p>

               <p>Bromly. He said he owed them some money, and desired he would send it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he sent you, was there any talk about goods?</p>
               <p>Bromly. No, not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Heatley do with the gold?</p>
               <p>Bromly. He took it to the refiner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him?</p>
               <p>Bromly. Yes, I went to the place, and staid at the corner of the square. It was taken to one Mr. Cox's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go into the place?</p>
               <p>Bromly. I saw him turn down; and he came back, and asked me to go and buy and ounce of silver to hear what they would say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason?</p>
               <p>Bromly. He said, do you go and buy an ounce of sterling silver. I went and bought it; and when I came back, Heatley asked what they said; and I told him, they said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Cox's?</p>
               <p>Bromly. I went to a house in Little-Britain.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember their coming to your house?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. About a fortnight ago Jones came and enquired for my husband.</p>

               <p>S. Lyons. Fifteen guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body present?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. No; I called them out into the yard, and delivered five guineas to each. I staid about half an hour, and drank some wine. I cannot recollect any conversation that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Bromly?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. Yes, I saw him once or twice with my husband. I believe the last time was about ten or eleven days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come about?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. He brought a young man about some business. I was not up stairs. They said his name was Heatley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Bromly brought?</p>
               <p>S. Lyons. A bit of gold that was melted. Bromly said he was sent for money; he said he came from New Prison; and said, the lads desired to know why he did not send them the money?</p>

               <p>Prisoners. When any body used to come, they said, where are the Aldermen? where are the chains? and used to call us Sir Robert. Sometimes they had a bottle of wine; she went out, and came in again; then she came back; they had another bottle, and some bread and cheese.</p>

               <p>Tinsdale. Here is the piece of gold that was delivered to me in the presence of Mr. Bond; it was melted all in one, and is now cut into pieces; there are thirty-two ounces of it. I have the scales they had in Lyons's, house for weighing these things; Lyons produced them. He wanted to take them himself; we did not chuse that, without seeing him take them from thence. There was another piece melted at the same time this was; in the ingot was put some clay, to make one ingot smaller than the rest that were disposed of by Lyons to one Hankley. I found this hand-bill in Lyons' pocket. (producing it.)

Phanix came in first. I returned them all the money but the crowns and half crowns. Phanix refused to be searched. He said, he would not be searched, unless we sent for a constable.

His brother came in soon after, a stout portly man; half a pint of wine was called for; he sat about a minute or two, when in came the prisoner and another gentleman like a countryman; it was in a little narrow room backwards, at the three Lemons, Goodman's-field. This country gentleman said he saw this young man at cards one night, and asked him how he came off. He stew about the room like wildfire; said he, I lost so much money. How? Said he, in cutting the cards. I lost 40 or 50 l. but I don't mind that a farthing. What, said he, did my uncle say when I was gone out? Why, that you was an idle young rascal, and would spend all your fortune. But said he, you got a prize, did not you? He said, yes, he got 5000 l. He then proposed to cut for some money. He brought in the cards; all under five was this gentleman's and all above five this man's. Zounds! thinks I, you have a good chance to beat this man; so they went on several times; this countryman won every time. At last this man said, Captain, cut you for me, he wins every time. I said, I beg to be excused, I will have no hand in it; I never played for a sixpence in my life. They said, it is no harm for you to cut. I cut once or twice, and this countryman won. The prisoner said, you are all devils, I will cut no more; I will toss up. He swore again, You are all a pack of lousy scrubby fellows; I will lay any thing you cannot produce forty guineas apiece at one time. Smith sitting by me, said, Captain, have not you got so much? I said, No. He said, Could you not get it? I said, Yes, I could in an hour. Then he said, Lay it. I was foolish enough to lay; I paid the money down, and I went cut, and Smith and the other countryman went away with me. I put down three guineas; O! said Smith, I will take care they shall not run away with the wager; I will take care of you. I went away innocently enough. I went into the city, and drew my money from the banker's. This stout fellow went with me, and we received the cash. As soon as we got into the house, he said, Captain, you are too late by two or three minutes, it shall be a drawn wager; (though we were within the time) they shan't use you ill. We returned the money. Then they proposed play at cutting for a sum; I said, I would rather go about my business. One of them by me, said, You shall not go yet, captain. I saw a little woman put her hand to the door, and push the bolt too. When this was done, O! thinks I, I am gone; then I began to be terrified. Thinks I, now what will become of me; I shall be certainly lost. After this they went on and cut away, sometimes for two guineas, then five, then sixteen. My money held out longer than the countryman's and this Smith's brother's; then they had nothing but mine to work for. I thought to keep some back; one of them minded me. I told them all mine was gone. I lost 41 l. 2 s. 9 d. I had drank nothing that blessed day but one glass of wine.</p>
               <p>Council. Oh, it was a blessed day indeed!</p>
               <p>Abbot. I wanted to keep this money fast. This stout fellow stood close to me; he said, You have more money yet, out with it; d - n me, turn it out; and up with his fist at me. I was obliged to take it out. As soon as it was done, I saw no money put to it; no wager betted, nor card cut; but the prisoner, as soon as I had put down two guineas and 3 s. 6 d. swept it up, and said, that is mine. I stood up and said, surely you will not take my money from me in this manner? I said to Smith, You know I am a poor man; you have brought me here to ruin me. The prisoner stood there all the time, and he took the whole tote of the money. After this Smith said to me, You shall not lose your money; I have a merchant over the way owes me 100 l. I will draw that and pay you. I went out with Smith. I said, Where is the house? He said, Not far off; and so brought me on, till he turned the corner by the Magdalene. There was a little alehouse by the Swan; he said, Go in there, and call for a pint of beer, and I will go to the house, it is over the way. I went in; I could drink none. When he got out, I went and peep'd round the corner; when I peep'd, he ran as hard as he could. I ran heard after him, but before I came at him he had turned the corner. I never saw any more of him. I came up to London last November with corn, and on the 4th of November I had been to dinner, and I saw this Smith, and a man with boots and sours walking together. I seized Smith directly. I said, Do you know poor Abbot now? He said, no. I am an Irishman. I came up last sessions to attend on him, and walking down the Strand on the 5th of December, I came plump on him. I said, Ah, young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090039"/> man, what have you done with my money you got from me? He said, I don't know any thing of you. I took him before the Justice. The other man drew his hand from me, and ran away as fast as he could. He ran up a court; I called stop thief; they ran round me, and the man got off. We had the prisoner before Sir

I waked last Friday night, about four o'clock; I heard a great noise below stairs; upon which I rang the bell, and alarmed the servants. I went down with one of my servants; I took the bar of my window in my hand; and I found, first of all, the door of the closet in the hall broke open. I found the fore gate and the back door barr'd up. I found seven or eight locks broke in the front parlour. From thence I went to the kitchen on the ground floor; there I found two or three more locks forced, and the maid's tea-chest. From thence I went to the housekeeper's room; there I observed that a window, looking into Mr. Thornton's back yard, was thrown open; the sash was up, and the door of Mr. Thornton's yard was forced open likewise. I found there two chissels, one in the house, the other in the garden. (Producing them.) Russel and Hayward, two of my servants, came down. I sent them into the front yard to see if any body was there. They returned, and said, they had found a man, and that another had escaped. Some table-spoons and some tea-spoons were found in the yard; of which Russel can give a more particular account.</p>

            . I am butler. On Friday morning, about four o'clock, I heard my master's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090040"/> bell ring. I got up, and came down stairs with him. As we were coming down, I heard the hall door clap to. I looked out at the window, and saw two men in the fore court. I asked them who they were. One of them said Brown, or Bromley; I can't tell which; I rather believe it was Brown. I called to the watch to secure the gates, and I went down with my master, and we found the locks broke, as my master has described. After this, the coachman and I went into the fore court; he had a candle in his hand. We found Bromley, the evidence, in the corner of the court. The coachman and I secured him; we took him out of the front gates, and delivered him to the watchmen at the watch-house over the way. Returning back into the yard, I saw a handkerchief with a great many spoons in it. (Producing it.) I can swear these are Mr. Nesbit's property; there is Mr. Nesbit's crest upon them; they were usually kept in cases in the cupboard which was broke open; I had the care of them; I am positive they were safe in the cases the night before when I went to-bed. When I came in again, near the cupboard in the hall lay this coal-chissel, as it is called; a little farther on lay this sharp chissel. I observed in the kitchen a spice-cupboard was broke open; nothing was taken out of it. The sash in the housekeeper's room was thrown up; it was the house-keeper's business to fasten that window. I am sure that all the doors were safe at night when I went tobed. I heard the hall-door shut when I first waked. I could not get out of the hall into the court but at the hall-door, because all the windows were fast that looked that way. I saw marks upon the wall in the back yard of a man's feet who had been endeavouring to get over the wall. There are two doors; the back door goes to Mr. Thornton's passage, the fore door into Basinghall-street. The coachman and Mr. Southwell's coachman went in pursuit of them.</p>

            . I am Mr. Nesbit's coachman. I opened the door at the top of the house to call the watch to go round to the back door. They told me they were gone. I came down, and went out with Russel at the hall-door. We saw Bromley in the corner of the yard, endeavouring to get over the wall. Russel and I took him. He pretended to be in liquor. We delivered him to the watchmen. There were marks of feet upon the wall. The watch and I went round to Mr. Southwell's, and borrowed some cloaths, for I had come down in such hastle, that I had come without my cloaths. While I was dressing myself in Mr. Southwell's kitchen, I heard somebody come over the wall by the kitchen window. Whereupon Mr. Southwell's coachman and I went to Guildhall and alarmed the watchmen. We got candles, and went a-top of the leads; we searched about from about a quarter after five, till five minutes past seven. We saw the marks of feet upon the leads, which we traced from place to place. About ten minutes after seven, when it got very light, we saw the prisoner sitting a top of Mr. Waggoner's leads. Mr. Southwell's coachman went round with the watch to Mr. Waggoner's door; then we went round, and called the prisoner; he came and surrendered; we secured him, and led him down a little ladder through a house in Dyer's court, Mr. Hyde's house, I believe. He was searched, but we found nothing on him.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Southwell. I went with Mr. Nesbit's coachman to the Comptroller's and Town-clerk's, to give the alarm, that the men might not escape over their houses. It had been a white frost that morning, so I could see the marks of feet upon the leads of Guildhall and the adjacent buildings. The Comptroller's footman came out, and said he had heard somebody run over the leads over his head. We followed that direction, and found a rope tied round a chimney, by which it appeared to us, that a man seemed to have got down; it was thirty feet to the bottom of the chimney; I did not care to venture that passage, but went down to the place where the bottom of the rope hung; there I saw the place where a man had jump'd across to another leads that went to Mr. Hyde's house; we went through there, and came to the top of the leads; there we found that this man had scaled a wall seven yards high, by the side of a chimney, to another house. We got a ladder in order to pursue him; we knew we must have him safe there. Mr. Nesbit's coachman went up first; when he got to the top, he saw the prisoner, and said, Tom, here is one. We advised him to surrender, for he could not make his escape. He got on his legs, and felt in his right-hand pocket; I apprehended it was for a pistol, but none was found on him. I left Mr. Nesbit's coachman to guard their wall, while I ran round to secure the passage into Fountain-court; in the mean time the prisoner surrendered.</p>

            . One Hudson, and I, and the prisoner went out one night, I forget what; it was the night before we were taken; indeed, I believe it was Friday morning; it was about four o'clock. We went out to see if we could get any money, wherever we could find it. We did not fix any particular place to go to. We came down Aldermanbury; we saw a gate in a back court. I said to Hudson, let's try to open it. Hudson and I opened the gate with this coal-chissel that has been produced. We got into the yard; then I went down some steps in a narrow place into a kitchen; the door was only upon the latch. We several times tried to open another door which went to the dwelling-house from the kitchen, but it was too strong, we could not break it open. Hudson and I went into the kitchen; the prisoner stood at the door. We found nothing in that kitchen but some stockings. I saw a sash over the way; I went to it, and pushed it up. I lifted up the sash; I put my hand against one inside shutter; it seemed not to be fast; it opened directly. The other shutter was screwed; I opened it; I pushed the blind up, unscrewed the door, and put the blind by the side of the place. Then I went in, and stuck a light. Hudson and I went in together; Smith stood in the alley. I went into several rooms; I opened some drawers, and found some lottery-tickets; I took them at first to be bank notes; I did not meddle with them when I found they were lottery-tickets. I broke open but one drawer; I found the keys for the rest. There was nobody but myself in the house at that time. Then I came to a place like a cupboard; I took this great chissel, and opened it. There were some cases in the cupboard that had in them some spoons and knives and forks. I took out all the spoons but four or five; I pulled my handkerchief off my neck, and put the spoons in. Then I came to the window, and called for Hudson and Smith. Hudson was at the window; Smith, the prisoner, was at the outer door in the alley. Hudson and the prisoner came in; his name is Thumper, or Smith. Just as I was getting in, I heard an alarm of a bell. I ran towards the street-door with a candle in my hand. I gave the spoons to Hudson first; Hudson gave them again to me; then I gave them to Smith. We were all three together in the house then. We tried some time before we could open the door: I pulled back the lock at last: I believe the door was only single locked; and I ran out with the spoons towards the gate; but I could not find any way out. I thought we had been in the street. If we had gone out the way we got in, we should have got off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the candle in your hand?</p>
               <p>Bromley. Yes, they were in the dark; for I had blown the candle out when I came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the door shut after you?</p>
               <p>Bromley. Yes; but I don't know whether Smith or Hudson followed me in the yard. I ran up to the corner of the wall and laid the spoons down; then I heard somebody on the other side of the wall call out, Why don't you come over? I don't know who it was, I was so much frightned; and being a little stupid with liquor, I could not get over; I made answer, I could not get over. Somebody looked out of one of the windows of the house; I said, if you come down here, I will blow your brains out. I said so to frighten them, because I wanted to get away. Two gentlemen came down and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner get over that wall?</p>
               <p>Bromley. I can't say; I believe it must be Thumper, by his being catched there. Somebody got over the wall, but who it was, I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nesbit. The wall divides Mr. Fryer's garden from my court-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks on the wall?</p>
               <p>Mr. Nesbit. The wall had been new plaistered, and there were marks all up the wall from attempts to get over.</p>

I took him to the Bull in Sherborn-lane; I staid there with him about an hour and an half; then I took him back to the comptroller's office. After he came from the secretary's office, going again to return to the Bull, he went to his own drawer, which is in the passage. He unlocked it and took out a bag, which he put up in a blue and white handkerchief. I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said, he was going to give it to Mrs. Whitefield at the Bull. I thought it proper to inform my partner Dupree of this circumstance. I desired him to inform the comptroller of it. He came to me some time after at the Bull, and desired me to take care that Sloper did not make away with it. In the mean time the prisoner delivered it to the girl of the house, and she gave it to her mistress. Dupree came again and demanded the bag, which I saw the servant deliver to the prisoner, and the prisoner gave it to Dupree.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a bag was it?</p>

            . I am a porter at the post-office. Good, who had Sloper in custody, sent for me to the Bull; the person that was to have told me, did not tell me for half an hour.</p>
               <p>Good. He told me Sloper had a bundle, and he thought it proper to acquaint the comptroller. I did; the comptroller ordered me to bring it to him. I went for it, and Sloper gave it me out of the bar. I took it to the comptroller, and I opened it in his presence. This is the bag; here is Flexney upon it; that is the receiving house. There were two bags in the handkerchief. I opened both; they contained 124 letters. These are the letters. This is the letter mentioned in the indictment, (picking out one.) I put my name upon it; they were all paid letters. (Opens the letter.) This is the letter and the bank note. Mr. Parkins the solicitor took out this bank note, and I signed my name on the back of it. I have had the bag in my drawer ever since; they were all locked up in my care, till Mr. Parkins opened them and marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two bags separate, or one within the other?</p>
               <p>Good. Separate.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Potts, please to give an account of the methods you took in this business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. When Dupree brought this bundle of letters, when he came to turn them out, they were observed to be all paid letters from different receiving houses in London. I took them down to the secretary, and they were ordered to rest in Dupree's hands, that there might be proof against Sloper if any thing should arise. They have remained in his hands ever since; I only examined them to see that they were paid letters. I gave them again to Dupree, and the seals were not broke at all.</p>
               <p>Q. From how many receiving houses did the letters in the bags come?</p>
               <p>Potts. I can't say I took that notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are all the letters here?</p>
               <p>Potts. No, there were some foreign letters; they were sent off.</p>
               <p>Court. Look over the letters, and see whether they all come from one receiving house, or several.</p>
               <p>Potts. They come from five different houses, Partington's, Flexney, Jones, Creamer, and Gibson. The prisoner was employed to bring letters from those receiving houses. Here are 13 that have escaped the stamp of the receiver's name, I suppose through the hurry of stamping. Each receiver has a seal with the initials of his name, and he tyes the letters up in a bag, and seals it with his name; the bags are brought to me or the deputy before the seal is broke, to see that they are right.</p>
               <p>Court. Do they never receive letters in their passage to the post-office?</p>
               <p>Potts. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time, in what department of his office must these letters have been taken?</p>
               <p>Potts. The prisoner is appointed to bring up the bye-bags, and is on duty three times a week; the other three days he fetches the bags. The days he is on duty at the post-office, he employs another man to bring them up, who is likewise provided by the post-office; he must have got possession of the letters in facing them. The bags, as I said before, are first brought to me, to shew they have never been opened since they came from the receiving house; then they are carried to the junior officer to open them.</p>
               <p>Q. May they not carry them first to the junior officer?</p>
               <p>Potts. They should not do it; if they did, I should soon know such a bag had not been up to me.</p>

            . I live with Messrs. Berry and Barker, in Leather-lane. I delivered this letter on October 26th, to Mr. Partington himself, at his receiving house on Holborn-hill, in order to be forwarded by the post. I paid the postage, having inclosed in it a bank note of 10 l. I wrote 8 d. upon it myself. This is the bank note that I inclosed in it; it corresponds with the mark I had made. The letter is my own hand-writing.</p>

            . I keep a receiving house on Holborn-hill. The letters that were brought to my house on the 26th of October, were delivered with the money in the bag; they always are delivered at night. I remember very well, I took in this letter, and took 8 d. postage for it, it being represented as a double letter. I put it into the bag with the rest of the letters, and the money with them. I gave the bag to the prisoner or his deputy, I can't say to which I gave it. I marked it 8 d. I have a tool in my pocket with which I mark the money paid for letters; and I have another tool with which I stamp my name. (The stamp for 8 d. and the name are applied to the stamps on the letter, and correspond exactly.) We have two bags. We put the paid letters into a bag, and then that bag into a larger bag with the rest of the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you do that yourself?</p>
               <p>Partington. I do most nights. I remember I did the night that this letter was delivered. I remember receiving that letter particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Price. Did you ever receive this letter in the course of the post? (shewing her the letter mentioned in the indictment.)</p>

            . I have been employed in fetching the prisoner's bags from Mr. Partington's, Mr. Creamer, Mr. Flexney, Mr. Gibson, and Mr. Jones; and I brought the bags on the 26th of October, that was the night when he was on the grand duty, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. I receive the letters for a fortnight, then he receives them for a fortnight. I carried the bags into the room and shewed the comptroller the seals; then I brought them out to the long table in the post-office, and turned them out upon the table; the prisoner was on duty there that night, either stamping or facing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Potts. Is there any post-office stamp upon that letter?</p>
               <p>Potts. No; if it had come to the proper officer, he would have stamped post-paid upon it, and the day of the month on the reverse side.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these 124 letters of different stamps, or the same day most of them?</p>
               <p>Potts. They are not opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they received any stamps?</p>
               <p>Potts. None of the 124 had, only the receiver's stamps.</p>
               <p>Court. You must break open a letter.</p>
               <p>Potts. This is dated the 31st of October. The prisoner, instead of handing the paid bag over to the proper officer, must have every time put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not that have been liable to detection?</p>
               <p>Potts. He ran to be sure a great hazard; there are twenty or thirty officers in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Partington. How many paid letters had you on the 26th of October?</p>
               <p>Partington. We keep no account; we put the money in a bit of paper, and put it in a bag with the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the money would be found if the letter was missing?</p>
               <p>Partington. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. They are laid on the table for the stamper; then the next person to him faces the directions all one way; when they are stamped they are faced up into rows, and the sorter sorts them into the several divisions.</p>

               <p>I leave my defence to my council. I never opened the letter, nor concealed the bag.</p>
               <p>The council in behalf of the prisoner, arged some doubts whether his offence came within the meaning of the statute, as he had not made any use of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090046"/> bank note, nor opened the letter; it rather appearing that his view was meerly to defraud the post-office of the money paid for the postage of the letters.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called a number of persons, who gave him a good character; several said, that they believed he was at certain times not perfectly in his senses. The officers at the post-office said, that they never observed any thing of insanity in him; that he was always capable of his business, but was apt to drink too much.</p>

Last Thursday was fortnight I came to the Royal-Exchange to see for a captain of a ship, with whom I had some business. At about twelve o'clock the blind-eyed fellow picked me up, and called me by my name, talked about my relations, and asked me how they did. He asked me to go with him to take part of a pint of beer. I went with him to a house, one Williams's. Then I went to the Change. He said I must stay till two o'clock; he said I had time enough. I went with him to the Cock alehouse in Sherborn-lane; he called for a pint of beer. He said there was a captain of a ship used that house that had some butts to repair, and being a good hand, he would speak to him that I should have them. Soon after came in a young man with gold-trimmed cloaths, and a gold laced hat, with a young gentleman with him in genteel apparel. They went up stairs. This blind-eyed fellow said, that was the captain; and said he would go up to him, and speak to him. I said, I was much obliged to him. He went up after him; and in a short time after came down stairs, and said he had done it for me, and he bid me come up. I went up; there was he and this gentleman standing by a window, and this Edwards and Morgan there, and four more men. The captain said, how do you do, cooper? I made answer, I was very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the captain, either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Mahoney. No; this man with gold-laced cloaths. He asked me, whether I would go on board to-morrow to repair his butts. I said, I would if he would pay me what he would pay any other man. He said he would. I said, the current price was ten-pence per butt for repairing them. He said I must go with him for five years. I said I had served seven years before, and would not bind myself to any man. He went down stairs, and wished me Good-bye, and the man that was with him. I wish you well, gentlemen, said I. I took my hat, and was going down after them. A man that was with these, came to the door, and said to me, hark ye, d - n ye, I will tell you what you will do. That was not one of these. I went up. There was a man behind the door; he put to the door, and put the key in his pocket. The prisoner was in the room at this time, and three more men, whom I do not know. Then this Morgan came up to me, and patted me on the shoulder, and said, I had been a deserter. I begged him to let me out. Then they all began to swear, and pull me about, and swore I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090047"/> was a deserter. I went, and said I would pull open the door, if they would not permit it to be opened. They beat me to that degree, I was hardly able to stir; and sat down very contented. Up comes a woman and a child; she pats at the door, and the door was opened, and in they both came; and the child came up, as I was sitting in the window, to me, and called me Dadda! The woman clapped her hands, and said, O you villain ! I have been hunting after you these three years! what a good father you are to my child ! - hitting me.</p>
               <p>Court. What age might this child be, that was so well taught?</p>
               <p>Mahoney. I took him to be between three and four years old. I watched my opportunity, and in a short time I lifted up the sash, and threw myself head-foremost out of the window. I was out all but my feet, when they hauled me in again, and they every one beat me very several, except the man that was the turnkey at the door; he had no hand in beating me; and they tore my cloaths; one got out his hand, and tore it with hauling me in again. This was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. They beat me cruelly. I cried out, and the blind-eyed fellow clapped his thumb under my jaw, and swore all the oaths he could, that he would cut my tongue out, and make me stutter ten times worse if I cried out. * Edwards went out, and returned in a short time with a pair of handcuffs, and brought a coach to the door. He said he would iron me. I said I would not be ironed. I asked where they were going to send me. They said they would tell me by and by. I asked for pen, ink, and paper, to send to a friend. Edwards went down for pen and ink and paper. I wrote a note to a friend, and gave it to Morgan. Morgan said, you son of a whore, there are not compliments enough, and tore it to pieces. The blind-eyed fellow hit me with the right hand, and I staggered. Martin came to me, and pulled my feet from under me, and I fell on the flat of my back on the floor, and the blind-eyed fellow kneeled on the pit of my stomach, and Edwards came on the other side of me with the handcuffs. I resisted as long as I was able to stir: At last I was obliged to comply, and give them my hands. They handcuffed me. The irons were too small, and hurt me very much. This blind-eyed fellow put his hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, and took out nine-pence halfpenny in copper. He held the money in his hand, and Edwards asked him, what prey? He said, he is a poor dog. Then he put the money into his coat-pocket. I endeavoured to turn round to get up, and he came to me, and took a silk handkerchief out of my right-hand coat-pocket, and put it into his own pocket. When I got up, he took this clasp-knife (producing it) out of my left coat-pocket. Morgan and Edwards kept me down. Then they brought me down stairs to put me into the coach, and they told me, that if I attempted to cry out, they would cut my tongue out. Two went before me, and two behind me, with bludgeons in their hands. As I came out, the man of the house was coming up stairs. I had not seen him before. The blind-eyed fellow said, here is all I have, and gave him my knife. The man of the house said, I will take care of it for him till he comes home. I went down. As I was getting into the coach, I saw one Mr. Jenkins, a sail-maker, coming by, and three or four gentlemen more. I jumped out at the other side of the coach. They followed me, and beat me with their bludgeons. The gentlemen asked what was the matter: They said I was a highwayman and a deserter. Mr. Jenkins said, if I was the devil, I ought not to be served so. Mr. Jenkins took hold of me, and said he would carry me before my Lord-mayor, that I might have justice done me. I was carried from thence to the Poultry-compter, where I remained till twelve o'clock next day; then we were carried to Guildhall. My young master, Mr. Okely, came there. I have worked for him six months. I have not been ten months in England. The gentlemen appeared that saw me jump out of the window, and two or three more that saw me used ill, and I was discharged. I went to the public-house where I had been used thus, and asked the man of the house for my knife. He went to the bar, and gave it me.</p>

               <p>* The witness has an impediment in his speech.</p>
               <p>Q. from Edwards. Was I in the room when you attempted to jump out at the window?</p>
               <p>Mahoney. Yes, you was; and you hauled me in, and paid me very well afterwards.</p>
               <p>Morgan. He has spoke very right in every thing but one: He says the door was locked upon him; there is no lock on the door.</p>

               <p>Morgan's Defence.</p>
               <p>This man brought the prosecutor to the house to meet one Captain Howard. I looked upon it he was to go servant to America. The captain talked to him about four or five years; I am not positive what. He was going down stairs. I had him called back. I said, did you never belong to the Chatham division of marines? Before I had spoke the words, he threw up the sash, and attempted to get out at the window. He is just like a man I had the description of, that was a deserter. He was very resolute; we were obliged to handcuff him. I know not of any felony.</p>
               <p>Edward's Defence.</p>
               <p>I took him as a deserter. I have an order for recruiting for the 34th regiment of foot. I was not in the room half an hour. I knew nothing of the felony.</p>
