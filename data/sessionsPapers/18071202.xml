The prisoner called after me; I turned back, and the prisoner came up to me on the poney that I bought of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured poney was it. - A. A roan colour, with a white blaze down its face, about twelve hands high; it might be an inch or two more; he asked me to have something to drink; we had a quartern of rum at the Cock public house, Tottenham-court-road, he asked me to buy the poney there, I said I do not know that I shall buy it, I have four by me now, and I have some out to grass, they do not sell very well. I then got upon my mule again and was riding down Tottenham-court-road; facing the Bull's Head in Tottenham-court-road, he said I am going in here for a pair of boots; he told me if I would go into the Bull's Head he would not be gone two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the Bull's Head. - A. I did; he came to me with the mare, and rode under the gateway into the yard; we had there two pints of beer, and in the mean time he said, Newman, will you buy the mare of me; I asked him what he asked for it, he said will you give me ten pounds for it; I said no, it is a good deal more than its worth; I told him he knew horses at this time of year were very cheap; I said it was not worth any more than six pounds to me; I gave him six pounds, and he gave me a shilling back; I paid for one pint of beer and the prisoner the other; the prisoner rode the mare home to my house and left her there with me, and left a bridle and a saddle. I went with him; he said he would call for the bridle and saddle; he did, and my wife stopped him:</p>
               <p>Q. When did he call. - A. On the 31st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mean time you heard something about this horse. - A. The very next day after I had it, it was owned in Smithfield market. I was in trouble for a week about this mare. I keep Smithfield market every week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had you gone down with that mare to sell her at Smithfield market - A. Yes, with other horses; I went to Smithfield market on the 23d; the mare was owned that very day by

               <p>Q. What was the pound of steaks to come to. - A. Six-pence She gave me a shilling; I kept the shilling, and she went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe of that shilling after she went out of the shop. - A. I observed that it was a bad one. I have got it in my pocket now, I have had it ever since. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the shilling is it. - A. It is. She came again on the 13th of the same month for some mutton; the bit of mutton came to thirteen pence; she gave me two shillings, and she wanted more meat to make it up two shillings; I then looked at the two shillings and told her they were both bad. I asked her whether she had any more to change them, she said no; I told her to stop a bit and I would fetch my husband; in the mean time I was gone to fetch my husband she went out of the shop and left the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went for your husband had you told her that she had been there before. - A. Yes; I told her she was the same person that was there the week before; she said she was never in the shop before to her knowledge. Then I went out of the shop to my husband; I gave the two shillings into my husband's hands. When I returned she was gone out of the shop. My husband went after her; he brought her back, he told her if she did not tell him where the two shillings were got from, he would take her up; she said she got them at the pawnbroker's. We asked her at what pawnbrokers, she said she did not know. My husband sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What constable came. - A. Mr. Kennedy; he searched her, and found nothing then.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that the two shillings she gave to you you gave to your husband. - A. Yes.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the post at the corner of Playhouse-yard, after my wife gave me the two shillings; she had left the meat and the money in my shop. This woman saw me come across the road; she made up to Playhouse-yard; she made a run, I insisted upon her coming back; I overtook her, she refused; I got her back and got her searched by Kennedy at the public house, Worship-street; Mr. Kennedy pulled off her bonnet, and in pulling it off a shilling dropped into her bosom; I saw it and told Mr. Kennedy of it. He searched down her bosom and found it; that shilling Mr. Kennedy has got. The two shillings that the prisoner passed the second time Armstrong has got. I am sure they are the same shillings that my wife gave me, I marked them with my steel. When I took her back to the house I wanted to get out of her where she had them from; she was quite pert, I got no intelligence from her; first of all she said she had them from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020005"/>a pawnbroker's, but she would not inform me their names.

               <p>Q. Had you marked any half guineas and seven shilling pieces. - A. Yes, I marked them with a knife; I marked two half guineas, fourteen seven shilling pieces, and two guineas; I put them in the till and locked them up in the iron safe, on Wednesday last, about eight in the evening. On the next morning I came about nine o'clock; the prisoner was there before me; I unlocked the iron chest, I counted over the money, I found there was a half guinea, thirteen seven shilling pieces, and two guineas; there were a half guinea and a seven shilling piece missing; the money was all marked.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended. - A. On the Friday. On Thursday the prisoner told me he had lent his small change to Mr. Turner; he said he had got the half guinea and the seven shilling piece in change of a note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. What day was that. A. On the Thursday before he was apprehended. I have got the half guinea and the seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>ROBINSON TURNER. - Mr. Pooley. Where do you live. - A. At No. 33, Cateaton-street. The prisoner at the bar was my porter, he had been with me about six years.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday morning last did you ask the prisoner to lend you any money. - A. I did; I asked him to lend me half a guinea; after that I considered that was not the money I wanted; I then asked for a seven shilling piece; he lent me them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pooley to Alden. Look at that money, and see whether that is part of the money you put in the iron chest. - A. Yes, it is, I marked it with the knife.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Might not such a mark as this have escaped your notice. - A. It might. Was I receiving a guinea, I might have looked more closely into it to see whether it was good.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Of course you looked at them before, to see whether it was good. - A. Yes; I might have some of this money by me a month; if it has any particular mark on it I might have forgot it.</p>
               <p>Jury. We would wish to know whether there were any other person that went to that iron chest. - A. No. I had the key; it was locked when I went to it, and there is no other key as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any of the other money. - A.Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020006"/>I have the whole.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor no person saw you take the money out. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it entirely rests upon your evidence. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you undertake to say that is the money that you marked. - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney (producing another half guinea.) Can you swear to that mark. - A. It is like it; perhaps you marked that yourself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. If it is a mark exactly alike the other, how can you swear to that.</p>

            . - A. I do, she is my laundress. On the morning of the 29th of October I gave Mrs. Woodbridge half a guinea to purchase fourteen pound of soap. I put three private marks upon the half guinea; I told her to go to the shop about half past four in the afternoon, at the time we went to dinner. I looked at the till a few minutes before I went up to dinner, that was exactly at four o'clock; there was about twenty shillings in the till in silver and halfpence; there was no gold in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner at the bar was a <rs id="t18071202-5-deflabel31" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18071202-5-defend92 t18071202-5-deflabel31"/> to your brother. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the custody of that till. - A. He had; there was a younger brother of mine, he used to serve in the shop, he had access to the till. In the course of the evening I went to Mr. 
               <persName id="t18071202-5-person95">Edgar</persName>
             the constable; when the constable came I related my suspicion to the constable in the presence of the prisoner; I said there was money lost from the till, and I would have every one searched till the money was found. The constable searched the prisoner in my presence; that identical half guinea that I had marked in the morning was found upon him, with some silver and a few halfpence. The constable asked him how he came by that half guinea; he said he took it out of the till, but he had put silver and halfpence into the till for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that at four o'clock you searched the till, and found twenty shillings in silver and halfpence, when did Mrs. Woodbridge give you any information about it. - A. Immediately I came down from dinner I sent my little brother off to know whether she had been and purchased the article; I searched the till again a quarter before five; I found two shillings more than I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the practice of your house to make an entry of what is sold. - A. It is a practice, and very regularly done; I have my journal here, there is no entry of the half guinea, nor of the fourteen pound of soap; there is an entry in the book of about two shillings, the money that was taken till I come down from dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody did you deposit the half guinea. - A. The constable; he would not let me lay hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of looking at it. - A. I had; I have no doubt of it being the half guinea I delivered to Mrs. Woodbridge, and that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The half guinea has never been found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. There is good reason for that; the constable has the half guinea, and says he has lost it now.</p>
               <p>Heseltine. When the constable took it out of the prisoner's pocket, he laid it on a sheet of paper; I saw the mark on the head side, and two marks on the other; I know it was the half guinea I had given to Mrs. Woodbridge. I gave the constable directions to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are talking about a thing that is not to be seen; the jury are to be the best judges of the marks.</p>
               <p>- EDGAR. Q. Have you this half guinea. - A. No, I had the half guinea; when I took it from the prisoner I let Mr. Heseltine look at it; then I wrapped it up in a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a constable of what place. - A. Of Cripplegate ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you constable or beadle. - A. I am ward beadle. On the next morning I went to fetch the prisoner out of the Compter, he requested that I would give him the silver back that I had at the time I folded the half guinea up and put it in my pocket, and went before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce it before the alderman. - A. No. The reason was, because Mr. Heseltine requested that the prisoner might be remanded for a week, and upon that account it was not shewn to the alderman; I kept the half guinea in my pocket three or four days, and then I put it in the bureau; whether it was in the paper when I put it in the bureau, or whether it had slipped out I do not know, I never unfolded it. I put it up with the paper, as I supposed, but there was a hole in the paper and a hole in my breeches pocket. You may think I put it out of my pocket to hinder the prosecution, but it was no such thing, because Mr. Heseltine was endeavouring to prevent the prosecution at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. The prisoner confessed that he took the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Unless you have the half guinea for the jury to see whether it was that half guinea, you cannot bring it home to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Heseltine. What were the very words that passed at the time when the prisoner was taken with the money upon him. - A. I told him that money had been missed from the till; the constable immediately said, your master has missed a great deal of money; I said search Mr. Holland, and all in the house shall be searched till the money is found. When he was searched we found a half guinea; he was asked how he came by it, he said he found it in the till.</p>
               <p>Court. This confession does not go so far as to say - this is the half guinea I took from Mrs. Woodbridge.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOODBRIDGE. Q. You do not know the half guinea do you. - A. The half guinea had a dot on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Heseltine point out any marks on the half guinea. - A. Not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you give that half guinea that you received from Mr. Heseltine. - A To Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Jury. The constable is highly culpable.</p>

On the 27th of October last, about half past seven in the evening, passing through Shoreditch, I saw the prisoner go into the Three Pigeons public house; observing something bulky under his coat I laid hold of him; I said I cannot pass you, I must see what you have got under your coat; I immediately took from under his coat a pillow case, containing seven shirts, all wet. I then took him to the public house adjoining the public office, Worship-street; I searched him.

               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of knowing where it hung. A. Yes. I wanting the girl, I went to the bed room to see for the girl; when I come there I found my key in the outside of the door; I went into the room, but no one was there; directly I missed a box that contained part of my wearing apparel, I thought some one had taken it; I looked in a portmanteau for some plate, it was in a pillow case, just as I brought it from the country; when I looked for the plate I missed it, I went down stairs, the girl could not be found any where in he house; we applied to Bow-street office, and found her soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the girl afterwards. - A. I did, in about two hours afterwards. I then said to her, Peggy, what have you been doing to take these things, she kneeled down and said pray ma'am forgive me, I never did such a thing before. I saw the property at Bow-street that night, Mr. Adkins produced it; I did not miss any one thing; the whole was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you. - A. From the Monday to the Thursday: she was hired from a public office, we had a character with her from a little public house.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer. - A. Yes Mr. Scott came to me at the office a little after eleven o'clock at night, he told me had been robbed. From what information I got from him I went into St. Giles, I went into several houses where I saw light; the last house I went into I went into the garret, and the prisoner at the bar was sitting on the floor in an empty room, with the pillow by the side of her, a great part of the plate was out of the pillow case; she was looking it over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Adkins. I found a box near to her, with a quantity of wearing apparel in it; I charged her with the robbery of her master; I asked her if there was any body with her, she said there was a young man with her when she committed the robbery, she would not tell me his name; I saw no young man, she was alone in the room. I took her into custody, and brought her away, and the plate and box, with the wearing apparel. I sent for Mr. Scott and Mrs. Scott also, they both came and said it was their property, and that was the girl that had lived servant with them. I produce the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at the milk jug, is that your property. - A. Yes, it is marked JMS, it is worth fourteen or fifteen shillings, and the six table spoons are mine; they are worth thirty shillings; the six salts are mine, they are worth thirty shillings; they are all mine. The gown is worth ten shillings, the salt spoons and tea spoons they are worth a shilling a piece; the sugar tongs are worth six shillings; the punch ladle is worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them before the prisoner went away out of the house. - A. On the same day I had been to the portmanteau, and I had seen them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went up stairs for two towels to hem, and when I was returning out of the room, a young man met me at my elbow, I asked him what he wanted, he said what is that to you; he went and looked about the place, I was greatly surprized; he said if I made any noise he would kill me; he took a knife out of his bosom and said, if I went to make any alarm, he would cut my throat; he went to the portmanteau and took the things out, and he took the box; there was a man in the street took the box of him; they dragged me along till they came to this room; the man that took the property went down to get some bread and cheese; he was not gone five minutes before he called William. The other man then went down stairs; the man was not out of the room two minutes before the officer came up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury - The prisoner is charged with stealing in a dwelling house; by law stealing in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020009"/>the dwelling house of another to the value of forty shillings, is a capital offence, and the law is made upon good and sound principles. It is not very probable that any thing of the sort that she pretends did happen; because, in that case, most likely she would have alarmed her mistress, and she would have alarmed the neighbourhood: then that which she pretended did happen would not have happened. She is found afterwards in this room with this property close by her, and nobody is found with her, and it is not very probable that they would leave left her alone with this property in the room, if her story is true.</p>

He walked through the shop into the parlour; I began to suspect him; in about half a minute I jumped off my board and went into the parlour after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the parlour - A. My son, he is about eleven years old, and no one else. I did not see him take any thing, so I gave him a written direction of my shop; he went towards Warren-street. When he had been gone about two minutes a thought struck me about the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your watch hanging. - A. Over the mantle piece in the parlour; it was a silver watch. I gave four guineas for it about eighteen years ago; it was a good going watch. I went into the parlour the moment the thought struck me, I missed the watch; I sent my little boy one way after him, and went another way myself; the boy went towards Fitzroy street, I saw the boy bring him back. I went and met them, he came very peacably by the side of the boy, and no other one with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it. - A. About half past four in the evening, it was not quite dark, it was near dusk; I met them at the corner of Warren-street; the prisoner, myself, and the boy, came into the shop together again.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not lay hold of him. - A. No, he made no resistance; I sent for a constable and searched him, but could not find the watch upon him; the constable asked the prisoner where he lived, he said in North-street; I found afterwards that he lived there, he had been there but a week. I had him taken up again the same evening, about half past ten, by the advice of Mr. Baker. On the next morning the watch was brought to me by Mr. White, a neighbour. I am sure it is my own watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PALMER, JUNIOR. Q. How old are you. - A. Eleven last October.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what an oath is - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are come to speak the truth - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were to take a false oath, what do you think God Almighty would do with you after you were dead. - A. I should go to fire and brimstone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming into your father's shop. - A. Yes; my father desired me to pursue him, I did, and brought him back; he came with me.</p>

               <p>MR. LARK. I am a painter, I was employed to paint lady Macclesfield's house, the prisoner was employed by me to work at the dowager's house. On Monday the 19th of October I discovered the drawers in the back parlour, and the butler's room were broken open; I being at work in the house, I found they had been broken open by a tool that painter's use; I have the tool here; this was the mark of this point of the knife in several places; and this iron was used to poise the knife to force the lock down. There is twenty locks broken in trunks and drawers, and so forth. I discovered this on Monday, and the prisoner not being at work on the Saturday, nor on the Monday, my suspicion fell on him. I immediately applied to Mr. Conant in Marlborough-street, he sent Jackson with me immediately, to see the condition of the house. In Oxford-street we met

               <p>Q. Who pledged that pelisse with you. - A. I believe the prisoner; I have no doubt; he pledged the pelisse for eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. I must have the truth, whether your character is at stake or not, what is it worth. - A. I cannot tell what it may be worth, second hand things sell so bad; it is worth a guinea or more; I never looked at it much.</p>
               <p>Q. Then look at it, what is it made of. - A. Pretty fine cloth.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it not made of ladies' fine cloth. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I shall have the truth at last - upon your oath what is it worth. - A. It may be worth to the owner, perhaps, two guineas; it may be worth more to the owner.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath is it not worth two. - A. It may to the wearer; I do not think it would sell for more than a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath am I to understand you to say you think it would not sell for more than a guinea. - A. No, I do not think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is an answer - is it not made of the finest ladies' cloth - A. Yes, but I do not know how wide the cloth runs.</p>

The whole of it is this; he only wanted money on this for three or four days; he said it was his sister's; of course I said it would do for eight shillings; I lent him that on it, he had never pawned any thing with me before, to the best of my knowledge; he pawned it in the name of

               <p>Q. Suppose your attention had not been called by this circumstance, and you had seen him at any other place, should you have known him. - A. I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, upon your oath, have you any doubt that he is the man. - A. I have no doubt about it; I have very little doubt it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say whether you have little or no doubt. - A. Such a thing may be, I may be mistaken; it was a young man, a painter; I have no doubt but he is the same; I may be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. You shall tell me whether you have any doubt or not. - A. I am not perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him afterwards. - A. Yes, the next evening, the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation passed between you. - A. Very little; only he brought these two shifts; I looked at them a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at him again. and tell me whether you have any doubt or not. - A. As I said before, I may be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you may be mistaken, or you may be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020011"/>something worse - look at him again, have you a doubt. A. I am almost sure; I may be mistaken, I saw so little of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Very likely, but have you a doubt about it. - A. Very little doubt about it; there may be another man like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at him again, and tell me whether you have any doubt. - A. I am not perfectly sure that he was the man; I believe he is, but to be quite sure I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him twice. - A. I did,</p>

Last Monday fortnight, I was going to shut up Miss Heim's shop; I found the shop door half open; I saw the prisoner on the left hand of me, in the shop, as I was at the door, he had got a spencer in his left hand, and part of a pelisse in his right hand; he heard me make a noise with the latch of the door; he chucked the spencer, and part of the pelisse on the ground, he left the other half unhooked; he came to the door, and asked me to let him out; I pushed him in, and shut the door. Miss Heims came in the shop, then he downed upon his knees, and asked them to forgive him; they sent for a constable, he was taken in custody. I did not see him go into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any remarks upon the panes of the window in the shop. - A. Yes, there was a piece cut out of the window, big enough for his hand to go through.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have got in the shop by the door to have got hold of this spencer. - A. Yes, they were in the middle of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. But by putting his hand into this pane of glass, could be reach the door to unlatch it. - A. No, it was not near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found the door a-jar when you went in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GREGORY. I searched the prisoner at the watchhouse; I found nothing about him; I went the next morning early, I examined the windows, I found a pane of glass taken out; there were nothing but some ribbons near it; by what the ladies informed me, there was nothing taken out. I said to the prisoner you little rogue, how came you to have cut the window in the manner you have done; he replied, another did that; he said he was a poor lad, he <rs id="t18071202-10-deflabel63" type="occupation">swept chimneys</rs>

I have got the spencer and the pelisse.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Can you take upon you to say, before you heard the noise of your boy coming in, whether your shop door was shut too. - A. It had been shut too the whole of the evening; there had nobody been in before for half an hour; we always shut our shop door; the shop woman had not left the shop five minutes.</p>

I heard some one run from the door; I looked out, I could not see who it was; Mr. Oats was coming by just afterwards, I told him I had lost a piece of mutton; I then went of the opposite side of the way; I saw the man standing in Mr. Eddington's public house.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you missed a piece of mutton. - A. Yes, it was laying about a yard in the shop window, the window was open; I told him if he did not give it me again I would have him taken up; he made off with it under his coat; I and Mr. Elviss followed him; going up to Mr. Charlton's there stood

               <p>Q. Did you see him throw it away - A. No, Mr. Elviss saw him throw it away. This is the handkerchief he had the meat in; when the constable took him he wanted to make it up with me, he would pay me for the meat, or any thing else; he said he did not take it, but he knew them that did take it. I took the meat back; it matched with the leg of mutton exactly; the fat and lean corresponded exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Seeing this man with some meat in a handkerchief you accused him. - A. Yes, and he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. One loin is very much like another. - A. Yes, but this matched with the leg.</p>

As I went out of the house, I saw somewhat lay in the road, the moon shone very bright; I returned back into the same house I came out of, I told the men that were in the house that I picked up a bit of meat in a handkerchief; I never untied it. This man came in, he said what have you got; I said what is that to you, it is nothing of yours as I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it. - A. In Bishopsgate-street; I understood afterwards it was at the corner of Devonshire-street, when I got before the lord mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man you mean. - A. Yes, he is the man, and Mr. Wessel is the captain that the pocket book was taken from; the prisoner ran away directly and I ran after him and collared him, I told him to give me the pocket book; he with a sneer said there it is, he threw it down; I let him go, and told my son to call out stop thief; I went and got the pocket book; directly I picked it up I gave it to the captain, he was very near me; then I went in pursuit of the man, and when I got to him there was a mob collected, and he was in custody of an officer; I am sure he is the man, I saw him put his hand into the captain's pocket, and he took his pocket book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. You saw two men of suspicious characters - I want to know whether you can take upon you positively to swear whether the book was not taken by the other person, and not by the prisoner. - A. I have sworn that it was taken by the prisoner, and I will swear it if I was going to die this minute; I mean to swear that this man took it.</p>
               <p>- . I am clerk to an upholsterer; I saw the prisoner with the pocket book in his hand; Mr. Woodbine came up to him; the prisoner ran up Devonshire-street, and Mr. Woodbine after him; when Mr. Woodbine catched hold of him he threw the pocket book down on the ground; I was not near enough to hear what he said; I should have ran after him but I fell down and sprained my thigh, I could not get up, soon enough.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020014"/>Q. You saw him throw the pocket book down. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Did you see any other person running. - A. Yes, the other person ran straight on; I took most notice of the prisoner, seeing the pocket book in his hand.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I saw my father lay hold of the prisoner, and immediately the prisoner dropped the pocket book; my father let him go and picked up the pocket book; he said lay hold of him, Harry. I laid hold of him, he gave me a knock on the breast and almost knocked me down; he ran up Devonshire-street, several people attempted to lay hold of him, he made a hit at them, he get out of the way as long as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. He was secured at last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man. - A. Yes; at the bottom of Devonshire-street he turned an alley, and there some barber laid hold him.</p>

On the 16th of November, a little after four o'clock, I come out of my bar to go to lay a cloth on a table; I was about five yards from the bar; I heard a great noise, I turned my head towards the bar, I saw a man with the till in his hand, which he knocked against the corner of the partition and made a great noise; he was going out of the liquor shop door with the till in his hand. I am positive to that man at the bar being the man; he ran down Oxford Arms passage to a baker's that lies on the right hand, and turned too short at the corner, fell over a stone and he and the till fell down altogether. I believe there was a great quantity of copper in the till and some loose silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you following of him. - A. I was. I attempted to secure him at the time he ran down the Oxford Arms inn, and locked himself in a stable, he come out of the stable at another door that opened at the corner, then he was secured by the groom; when he got into the yard another man assisted him, he got loose from him and ran out of the yard into the market; he pulled off his coat and took hold of a glass bottle, and declared vengeance against the man that had laid hold of him; they afterwards secured him in the market and brought him into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same man. - A. I am positive it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go in the pursuit. - A. I followed him with the till in his hand until he fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. You secured your till. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the market after him. - A. I did not; when I was going up into the market I met a man coming in charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he is the same person. - A. I am quite sure he is the same person; I saw his face so plain going out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to strike against the partition. - A. The door about reaches the counter; reaching over his hand to take the till out, and drawing it back, he hit the till against the partition, and on his going out of the door he knocked the till against the door; then I saw his face very plain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say you believed him to be the man. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. I positively believe him to be the man is what he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had never seen him before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you looked in the till so as to enable you to tell what was the contents of the till. - A. I could not tell what was the contents of the till, only what was in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen the contents of the bag. - A. I only know when I took and counted it out to the gentlemen that were there; I can tell there were six seven shilling pieces, and one pound twelve and six pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen it before. - A. I cannot say exactly; it might be half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who goes to your till besides yourself. - A. My wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if she had occasion to go to the till might not she have taken it out. - A. Yes, but then I have kept it in my pocket ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on the money. - A. No, I have the money here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in partnership with any body. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what parish it is in. - A. Yes, Christ Church.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your house. - A. Yes, I am the landlord of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge that is alledged against me; I was sweeping out the warehouse, when the constable and Mr. Bell took me in custody; I told them I had no property belonging to them, or any body else; they said I had. I said then I was willing to suffer for it, if I had; the constable said I smelt of oil, and my hands were dirty; I said a working man could not always have his hands clean; before I swept up the warehouse, I was sharpening some tools, I used some oil for that. He found the basket concealed behind the hogshead; I knew nothing about it; I told them where I lodged, and told them to go and unlock my box to see whether he thought I was robbing of them.</p>

On Saturday the 31st of October, about twenty minutes after six in the evening; I saw the prisoner at the bar lurking about the door; I saw her come into the shop and take a white china tea pot, with a gilt edge, off the counter; I pursued her as far as the Bell Savage Yard, I took her by the arm, and she sat down on the pavement and I heard the tea pot fall from her; I picked the tea pot up, it was broke, and part of the tea pot cover; I brought her back to the shop, and went for the patrol; he came and took her to the Comptor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of ths woman before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober. - A. I am not positive whether she was or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the affair, I was so much intoxicated; now supposing any body might put the tea pot in my hand, and I might think there was liquor in it; I have many times drank liquor out of a tea pot.</p>

By the position that I was standing to him, and by the circumstance of the handkerchief being in his hand, no person could do it but him; I saw him drop the handkerchief; my reason for not seizing him immediately, I saw it was a gang of pickpockets; I was afraid of his being rescued.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar on board the hoy at the time you went to bed. - A. I never saw him till I took him. On the night of the 19th of November I heard the footsteps of a man over my head, I considered it to be the officer that had the charge of the liquor: I got out of bed, I listened, I heard a spilling of liquor or water; I instantly went on deck, there I saw the prisoner at the bar with a bladder in his hand; I asked him what he did there, he said nothing; I said you have a bladder in your hand; he then said he begged I would consider his wife and family</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an empty bladder, or full of any thing. - A. It had a bulk, it had the appearance as though it was full.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bladder. - A. I compelled the prisoner to go down into my cabin; in my forcing him down in my cabin it fell over, or whether he threw it down I do not know; I got the bladder afterwards by the assistance of two fishermen's boys laying at Billingsgate stairs; I called to them, they got a lanthorn and found it; when I came on shore the boys gave it me; I delivered it to Mr. Clark, who keeps the King's Head public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity might there be in the bladder. - A. I cannot say, I looked at the cask, there were two spile holes; when I turned the cask it leaked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. It was impossible for you to tell us what was in the bladder, you neither know the contents of the puncheon that was in the vessel, or whether the bladder that was found was the same bladder. - A. I cannot say any more than I believe it was this bladder, it had a pipe in it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Give us the words what you did say to him. - A. I believe the words were - the will was his own hand writing, I believed there was no difference, notwithstanding the long time I had known him, or to that effect; I do not exactly remember the reply he made; I think the effect of it was, that it was his hand writing; he said words to that effect. I asked him when the deceased died; he told me the day before the application was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit down to write the jurat for the purpose of taking him to be sworn. - A. I did; he and I went to Dr. Parsons, and Dr. Parsons subscribed to the jurat.</p>

Mr. Almond said directly, that is right, let it stand.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his applying to you on Saturday the 13th of June last. - A. He left a note at my house, I cannot be positive of the day, it was in June; the purport of the note was, that on Tuesday, that must be the 16th I think, there would be some stock to be transferred, and that he, the prisoner, had left the probat at the bank; that was for the purpose of being registered.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I shall first begin by saying, that I am innocent of the charge, and they have not produced the probat against me; there is a piece of paper they produce against me that is a will; I am indicted with publishing; how could I publish that will when it was in Doctor's Commons. If I am convicted I hope your lordship will arrest the judgement, that probat not being brought against me.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not be mistaken; it is not necessary in point of law for them to exhibit this probat against you, it is enough to prove that you forged the will. The will is here; the probat has been proved to be delivered to you, and by that witness the will has been proved to be your hand writing, therefore do not be deceived about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Howell does not say positively that the will is my hand writing; there is a person of the name of White, if he was here I am confident my trial would take a different turn.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, it matters not whether the probat is produced or not; if you believe that this man forged the will for the purpose of making a probat, and for the purpose in reality of getting this man's money in the stocks, there is the fraud; and being committed with that sort of intention, it is a clear forgery in law; every part of the evidence proves to a demonstration, that the prisoner at the bar has forged this will; and in consequence of that, he has sold out the stock of

Somebody or other has forged the will; therefore the hand writing being proved to be the prisoner's at the bar, and the witness tells you that he did got a probat of this will; his selling out the stock, and transfering the stock, are facts that prove every thing as clear as ever I saw any thing in my life, the charge in this indictment. Gentlemen, in this case, as I do in all cases where a man's life is at stake; I have looked every way, if there was any thing that occured to me as a fair groud in his favour to state to you, I would state it to you; but I never saw a case more clear in a court of justice; and it would be but trifling with you to suggest a doubt; if you can find out a doubt you will let me have the benefit of it.</p>

In consequence of having only found one, I surmised, having a variety of drawers, that I had mislaid it; I therefore expected that at my leisure I should find it. I expected then to find it in the country; I went into the country, I could not find it. In consequence of a warrant that was taken out to search for other things, the key of my wine cellar was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that key that was shewn to you by Hancock the officer, one of the keys of your wine cellar. - A. I believe it to be one of the keys; I missed a small pocket almanack and other articles.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the officers belonging to Hatton Gardon office. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with a search warrant and when to Manchester-square. - A. I did, I went to No. 18, North-street, Manchester square; I think it was Thursday the 19th of November. I saw the mother there and a little boy; the prisoner said she was her mother, and this was the prisoner's apartment not the mother's; I told the mother that I had got a search warrant against the place for articles stolen from Mr. Dawson by her daughter; she owned the daughter lived there. I was proceeding to search, I observed the old lady go to a drawer and take out a piece of blue cotton and wrap it in her apron to conceal it; I said stop, old lady, you must not take any thing out there, put that down again; I then proceeded to search, she having put down the blue cotton, it is made into an apron; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020021"/>that I searched and found several other articles, which I shewed to Mrs. Spittlehouse, who had been a servant to the prosecutor; she identified them to be Mr. Dawson's.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these things. - A. A breakfast cloth, and a kind of a towel, she held it up to the light and shewed where the marks had been picked out, WD: Mrs. Spittlehouse discerned it; after that I found some more cotton, which Mr. and Mrs. Dawson believed to be their property, and some pieces of Vandyke bordering furniture; there was some of it worked up in chair covers, which I could not bring away; this is the key I found on the second search, the prisoner was present; I told the prisoner it was the key I had seen before.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen that key upon the first search. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take it then, you went back with the prisoner to for that key. - A. Yes; she then offered me the key of a street door; I said not that, it was a bright key I had seen, and I must find it; then she threw herself into a fit. In the mean time Mrs. Spittlehouse said here is the key upon the drawers, and that was the key; I afterwards tried the key to the wine cellar door of Mr. Dawson's, it answered directly and corresponded to the one he has in his possession. (The key produced.)</p>
               <p>Hancock. When I went to the place where I brought her from, York-street, I found these articles where she then was in service. At the time that I took her to the house of correction I should have told you there was a young woman accompanied me down to the house; as soon as I put the prisoner there, the young woman told me some things which led me to go into York-street where she was at service. On my searching Mr. Lucas, he had all her things down in the back parlour; I brought these things away; another apron made out of the same sort of stuff as the other. I found a piece of cotton made into an a apron, and another piece of cotton. In consequence of what I learned at York place, I went to the old lodgings of the prisoner in North-street, there I made another search; the old lady turned her back upon me, I saw her conceal something in her bosom; I searched her bosom and found a duplicate of a broach and a smelling bottle, pledged at Mulcaster's. I went to Mulcastert and saw the articles.</p>
               <p>Q.What did the prisoner say with respect to these articles when they were produced. - A. She denied the bottle belonging to Mr. Dawson; and the broach I think she said she found it; the cotton and the other articles she owned she took.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady and Mrs. Spittlehouse said if I did own to it she would forgive me.</p>
               <p>Court to Hancock. Did you hear any body say to her it would be better for her to confess. - A. I heard Mrs. Dawson say she told her it would be better for her to speak the truth; Mrs. Dawson told me so; it was not in my presence.</p>

During the time I lived there, the prisoner was house maid for three weeks; she was in the town house and I was in the country; this blue cotton was found on our first searching her, which was the time she confessed to taking them; I knew it was the exact pattern of Mrs. Dawson's furniture; that is all I know. The prisoner said to me she hoped I would speak to Mrs. Dawson that she would be merciful to her; I told her if she had really taken the broach she had better confess it. I know the table cloth to be Mr. Dawsons, having a number of stains on it. The prisoner told me it was his.</p>

            . I live in Church-street, Soho. I came from the office after being examined, and was going to the house of correction, the prisoner asked me whether I was a prisoner, I informed her I was not; she asked me whether I would go to her mother's and get a watch and duplicate in a bonnet box; I was to take these things, and if she got free she would give me five pounds for my trouble; she made me promise not to tell Hancock the officer, but to give him the slip as soon as she was in the house of correction, for fear Hancock should be at her mother's before me; I informed Mr. Hancock of it, and went with him to her mother's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mother did not know where I was; I asked her which way she lived, she told me; I said for God's sake go to my mother, and bring me some things to the place, some victuals, and some money, I would reward her for them. The smelling bottle I found, and the broach likewise, going through Cranbourn-alley; the table cloth I took in a mistake to wash along with my own gown, I forgot to bring it back again; one of the bits of cotton was in my drawer in the bed room, I took it home with my things; as for the key it was my poor husbands, it was never in Mr. Dawson's house before it was carried there by the constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. You let him go then upon giving his address. - A.

Yes, between eleven and twelve this man came in the shop, he wanted to purchase some cassimere; I shewed him some; he agreed to have four yards and a half of cassimere, and I was to damp it; there were two pieces of cloth remnants in the window, which this man took out a yard and a half each, one brown and the other black; he measured them, he said they would suit him if I could tell him the price; there were neither ticket nor mark on them; I could not tell him the price; I put them back in the same place where they were; he went away then, and left the cassimere for me to damp; he returned about twelve, he brought a great bundle of cloth with him, he wished me to see whether the cloth that he brought with him and the cassimere matched; he untied one end of his own cloth and put the cassimere to it; he asked my opinion of it, I said I thought it matched very well; he said he would untie it further, and then he should see better, he said then he thought it matched very well; I then went to fold up the cassimere out of the damper.</p>
               <p>Q. In doing that did you turn from him. - A. I did, to the other counter, my back was to him two or three minutes, there was nobody in the shop but me and him at that time; I went to fold up the cassimere, he said if I would give him leave he would, he understood folding better than me, he would fold it; I gave it to him to fold; in the mean time he was folding it, a young man came into the shop and another followed; I left him to serve them, I went to the other counter, the young men stood close to the other counter with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the same side of the counter with them. - A. Yes, all three; one of the young men I knew, he is a tailor; the other I do not know. While I was serving these men Mr. Man tied up his parcel, he wished me a good morning, he went out; he had paid me for the cassimere.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear these two men were standing by you at the time he wished you good morning and went out. - A. Yes, I am positive of that. And these two pieces of cloth I swear to being in the window when Mr. Mann came in.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very clear from what you have said because he took them down. - A. But that was the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Very true; but in the interval of time from his first coming in, and the second time, had you seen them. - A I did, and there had nobody been in the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all that interval in the shop. - A. I was not, I was in the kitchen on the same floor; I could see into the shop, and there is a bell at the shop door, it could not be opened without hearing it.</p>
               <p>Q. When Man was gone what became of the two men - A. They went out one after the other; one purchased a piece of cloth, which came to ten pence; he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. In passing through the door way could he go up to where the remnants were. - A. He could not the door went back between the remnants and the door way, he left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. As the door was open, it in a manner covered that part of the window where the remnants were. - A. It did; then the other man sold me two dozen of buttons; I paid him and he went out, I shut the door after him myself; there was no one in the shop from then till my father came home; after my father came in a gentleman came in to ask for the quantity of one of these pieces of cloth, my father went to shew him the cloth, both the remnants were missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I believe no part of this property has been found. - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. You have chambers No. 5, in Inner Temple-lane. - A. I have; I do not live in them myself, I let one of these rooms to the prisoner, he has possession of the room now, he uses that room for receiving some fixed customers that he has in town, and the convenience of myself in taking in parcels in my absence; he never slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found that he has conducted himself honestly with respect to the chambers and with respect to you. - A. Very much so; he has worked for some of my family and me for some years.</p>

            . Q. You are a workman of Mr. Yates. - A. Yes, yesterday was a week, the prisoner at the bar was ordered to assist me to break a parcel of grain tin; which being done, about four o'clock, he was ordered to fetch me up an hundred weight of old metal, for me to melt. I went down the yard to ask the foreman what I was to have to mix with it, to make it fit for my use; when I came up, I saw my ladle that I was going to cast with, on the pit side, close to where the prisoner stood; it struck me all was not right, I put my hand to the ladle, that was laying bottom uppermost; I found it was hot. I said to him George, what have you been doing with my ladle, he said he was going to skim the metal for me; with that he was putting up the tackling rope, for the space of five minutes, then I sent him down for some metal; immediately he was gone I crossed over to where he stood; on the board were some hot ashes. I lifted up the rope that he had laid over them; I found a lump of metal so hot that I could not hold it; I left it where I found it; just at the time my master's brother came up he got the stamp and marked it, and then he ordered the apprentice to watch; we both left the shop; when I came back, I saw the officer and the prisoner, and some of the men in the yard; in searching about, they found this piece of metal that was stamped, with several others, hid in a corner, between the furnace and the wall on the other side of the yard.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 24th of November, at two o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Red Lion-street, Holborn, I saw the prisoner pull the watch out of her bosom, and walk along the street with it; I saw her put it in again; I had a suspicion that she had stole the watch. I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>ANDREW - . I was constable of the night, the watchman brought the woman to the watchhouse with the watch; I examined the watch; I asked her how long she had had it, she said four or five years. I looked at the inside, who had cleaned the watch; from that I made the discovery of the owner; she said, she had the watch cleaned three months ago in Hatton Garden, that a gentleman had given her the watch that was gone to Bath; I told her that was not the truth, the watch was cleaned at No. 90, Oxford-road. The prisoner and the watch were taken before the magistrate the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was on Monday night coming through Lincoln's Inn-fields, at half past twelve o'clock; I picked the watch up. I went up Holborn there I met a young woman an acquaintance of mine; I shewed it her, I put in my bosom; the watchman was there, he saw the watch; he said he was sure I stole the watch he took me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Birchall. In going home did you go through Lincoln's Inn-fields. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether or no you can say you might by any accident drop it. - A. The watch was very fast in my fob when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home were your clothes all dirty. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had tumbled down. - A. I either fell down or was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how many times you fell down. - A. No, I cannot.</p>

On the 24th of October, about one o'clock, the prisoner came to my house; I had occasion to go into the yard to hand out a quilt, and when I came in the prisoner was gone; the watch and gown was gone; the watch was hanging by the fire place, and the gown was also by her.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before. - A. Yes, she has been in the habit of coming to my house several times, upon account of her husband and my son being in the guards; I have never seen my gown nor watch since; somebody might come in and take them, God knows.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the fact; the occasion that brought me to Mrs. Moore's house that morning, was my husband and her son had been in a French prison for five years; I went to tell her what I heard at the transport office; I came up to Stepney to get my marriage lines; I went out of her house, I intended to return; whether she went in the yard or no I cannot say. I went into the clerk's house, he was not at home; coming along the street, I met with a person that took me in a public house; that detained me. I went into her house no more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss at any time any silk - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was in your service at the time you missed the lace. - A. She was, she was at that time at Brighton, I wrote to her about the lace; she was wrote to, I am not confident that I wrote to her; she wrote for answer, that she believed the white lace went home to the person to whom it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the letter directed to you. - A. It was, and the black lace was in the house amongst some other things I had the house searched by my family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come to find out where the lace was. - A. From her late conduct I suspected she was the person; I sent to Bow-street, and had papers sent round to all the pawnbrokers; in consequence of that I found out where the white lace was; I engaged an officer to meet me at my house when they came from Brighton. The whole of it is in the hands of the pawnbrokers now in court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This young woman had lived with you a long while. - A. Near a year and five months.</p>
               <p>Q. She had the management of your business at Brighton. - A. Yes, for three weeks; I left her at Brighton in the management of my business.</p>
               <p>- AVERY. I am servant to Mr. Baxter, a pawnbroker. I produce three yards and a half of black lace, the prisoner at the bar pledged it with me on the 23d of May, for two pound. I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mrs. Lacomb's house on Sunday last, about six or seven o'clock at night; when I saw the prisoner, I told her I was an officer of Bow-street, I had come to take her in custody on suspicion of stealing some white and black lace, and other things; she made answer and said, what on a Sunday night, I said yes; I told her the lace was found at the pawnbrokers, I knew where it was; I asked her what she had done with the duplicates, she said she had got them in her pocket; she gave me the duplicates of the property which I have related to you.</p>
               <p>Q. How many duplicates. - A. Eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the duplicates turned out to be the duplicate of the three yards and a half of lace. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The others were of separate property. - A. Yes, one of a coral necklace.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving the duplicates you went to the pawnbrokers. - A. Yes, I went to Mr. Baxter's, the black lace was at Mr. Baxter's.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the other ten, were they for property of the same kind. - A. I believe some of them were her own.</p>
               <p>Q. The black lace you got from Avery. - A. Avery has brought it here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you shewed him that duplicate he produced that black lace. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Did not she say she meaned to restore it when she came to town. - A. She said she meaned to restore it, she was distressed when she pledged it.</p>
               <p>Court. She said a temporary embarrassment had induced her to pledge it, and she meant to replace it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That lace is mine, I know the lace, it was hemmed at one end, and not at the other; and when in my possession, it had a custom house mark, but now it has not; I have not the least doubt that it is my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you ascertain the fact, so as to say whether this lace might not have gone to Brighton, and so to be taken by her there. - A. I am certain it was not, this was never sent down to Brighton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make an entry in your book of every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020025"/>thing you send down to Brighton. - A. I do, but I recollect this was never sent down to Brighton.</p>
               <p>Court. Mrs. Lacomb, look at that lace, and tell us what is the value of this lace. - A. Six or eight pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give her this lace. - A. No, it was given in charge of the working milliner, I never gave it into her hand; it was in the work shop where she was.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is your house in Berkley-square. -

            , you and your husband rent the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, all the circumstances in evidence are clear against the unfortunate prisoner at the bar; I have once more told you, that in cases of this sort, I would not wish you to strain the point, but on the other hand, where the property is worth six or eight pounds, meaning to put it very low, it is laid in the indictment ten pounds; she meaning to be quite within bounds, she puts it at six or eight pounds; you will look at it, and I think it would be straining too far to say it is worth less than two pounds; whatever is the consequence, we must do justice. It comes out in evidence, that this woman did tell the officer it originated from a temporary distress.</p>

            , Henry-street, Hampstead road; Tibbey works with me. I went with Tibbey to the place; I made him bring the box to the accompting house where the officer was waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that box. - A. Four five shilling papers in halfpence, and six five shilling papers in penny pieces; we frequently have two hundred pounds worth of halfpence where we take them from. I found in that box two pieces of canvas that had been cut off the pieces, one shilling in silver, and three knee buckles, and several other articles that are not his own, and there was also a twine box of mine in Tibbey's room.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was at Mr. Haynes's accompting house when Tibbey brought this box; he gave me the key of it; I opened the box I saw a great quantity of halfpence tied up in parcels in the box I found all the things that are there except one article, a twine box, that we found in Henry-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Haynes. The halfpence were undone by the clerk at Hick's hall; before they were undone then I could swear to them; we are furnished with them from the tallow chandlers, we serve them with candle wicks, the parcels are not marked; I could not swear to them now; this canvas is made into an apron; we had such canvas. These knee buckles I can swear to them, as being my own, and the twine box is my own.</p>

               <p>The Case stated by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>JOHN CLARK. Q. What are you. - A. I am a Bow-street patrol. On the day laid in the indictment, at seven in the evening, I apprehended a person of the name of Buckney in Vauxhall Walk; I saw him leaning upon a post, I asked him what he had got, he said it was nothing to me; I found upon him this quantity of beans; I believe there are two pecks (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. You took him up, did you. - A. Yes, I apprehended the prisoner on the Monday following at the Blue Last, Salisbury-square, I told him what I apprehended him for, he told me he knew the business; Buckney's master had called him up on Saturday evening and told him I had apprehended Buckney with the beans. I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BUCKNEY. - Mr. Knapp. What are you. - A I live in Battersea.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes. On the 31st of October last, I asked him to give me a few beans upon Dorset's wharf, White Friars, he gave me a few.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he get them from to give to you. - A. That I cannot say, he came up the wharf to give them to me. I took them away. I was apprehended by Clark.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN. - Mr. Knapp. I believe you are clerk to Messrs. Roberts and Thompson. - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of letting that house ready furnished. - A. I have, to one family.</p>
               <p>Q. When you let it ready furnished you let it to one family. - A. Always at times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you do not let it do you occupy it yourself. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 23d of October, was it let then. - A. It was not, I was in the occupation of it myself; I slept in it every night, from the 16th of September until the 23d of November.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 24th of October what time did you leave it. - A. It might be half after five or five, I will not be sure which; I locked the street door, and left the key in the door, in the inside, to preven it being picked as I thought, and likewise bolted it; then I went down into the kitchen; I locked the area, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you locked it. - A. I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020029"/>quite sure of it; I then went up the area, locked that gate and took the key with me; I can be upon my oath that every other part of the house was safe, there was no way of entering of it without very great force. I had secured all the windows. Between seven and eight o'clock I received a letter from my neighbour that my house was broken open, and part of my property taken away; I returned to the person that wrote me the letter; I went with Mr. Simmons, and the neighbour that gave me the information, to the house; I found the street door then open, with the key still in it on the inside, it was unbolted; therefore they must have come in another way; the kitchen door was unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the door that comes into the area. - A. Yes, that is a door which I had left locked and taken the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, did you go up stairs, and what did you find missing. - A. I found two feather beds.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth. - A. I cannot exactly ascertain; I believe the whole of the property is worth thirty pounds to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the two feather beds worth thirty pounds. - A. Yes, and I could not purchase them for that money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the two bolsters worth ten shillings. - A. Yes, a pound; the pillows are worth five shillings. I lost three counterpanes, one was quite new, it never had been washed, it cost me a guinea and a half; the three are worth two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these articles that you have stated to have lost, in the house at the time you went out. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the counterpanes. - A. Two white, and one coloured, it was brown and red, a kind of copper plate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out was it dark or light. - A. It was getting dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a person afterwards of the name of Foy - A. Not very soon; I saw him at Marlborough-street office some days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any keys tried to your door by Foy. - A. Yes, which easily opened my door.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that. - A. It was in the same week; one key opened my kitchen door with the greatest ease.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long have you had this house. - A. Since Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had it before. - A. Mr. Simmonds.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any interest in it now. - A. Not any at all. I purchased the goods of him,</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Simmonds a bankrupt. - A. He is; his certificate has been granted him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was a bankrupt at the latter end of July or the beginning of 
               <persName id="t18071202-37-person409">August. </persName>
            - A. I cannot justly ascertain that.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he kept the house. - A. He has, before I had it, but not since.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, has not there been an understanding between you that the house should be between you. - A. Upon my oath it is mine, I had a lease granted by him at the same rent as he had it.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you slept there. - A. I have slept there at various times when the house has been vacant; the lodgers left it in September; since then I have slept there every night excepting one; Mr. Simmonds lives at No. 44.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that he does not live nor sleep in the same house that you live in. - A. Yes, I positively swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was dusk, the day was not shut in. - A. No, it was dusk, you could not distinguish persons' features, being such a wet night; I could not distinguish persons at the door, because I had been looking to see a person passing by; I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord that it was just dusk, the day it was about closing in, but not closed. - A. Yes, but it was so dark that I could not see at any distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish the countenance of one person from another. - A. Not at any distance.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was light enough, if you had been near you could. - A. It was very likely I could if I had been near enough and had taken much pains I could, but I will not be certain of that.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You are an upholsterer, you live at 44, Southampton-row. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You was formerly the owner of the house at which Mrs. Kinsey now resides. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the afternoon of the 24th of October observe any persons near her house. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from her house do you live. - A. Mine is No. 44, and her house is No. 39 in the same row and the same side.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you observed some persons about this house on the evening of the 24th of October, what time of the day was it. - A. About half after six, to a few minutes, I will not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were you when you observed them. A. I was going from 44 to 37, I was going by her house, I saw two men come out of the house from the front door; I saw them, but to the best of my recollection the door was opening as I was passing, it was either open or opening; there were neither of them out when I passed; I think to the best of my recollection the door was open.</p>
               <p>Court. Neither of them were out of the house at the time when you first saw them, but the door was open. A. Yes, and they came out; one was a tallish man and the other a shortish man.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the shortish man. - A. I cannot say, there was a good deal of difference in the height of the two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing with them when they came out of the door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You could not identify either of the men. - A. No, I could not, they were covered with large bundles on their heads.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. What had they upon their heads. - A. It was something white; I imagined they were sheets at the time when I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which they had upon their heads large enough to be a bed. - A. Full large enough; they went down Southampton-row into King-street, in a direction towards Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had not an opportunity of seeing either of the faces of the men, was either of the men the size of the prisoners. - A. Yes, of the name of Brady; he had a dark coat on and boots, with apparently new tops.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that you are speaking off, that had the dark coat on, and boots with new tops, was that the shortest man of the two men. - A. That was the shortest man of the two men; after I saw them come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020030"/>out of the house, I traced them down King-street, I went on the opposite side of the way; the short man threw the bed down in King-street, a few doors from Orange-street, at a mattrass maker's door; it was darker in that part of the street than any other. The other man was at some distance before; I imagined he went down for Holborn; I went down King-street, towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now speaking of the taller man. - A. Of the taller man, I lost him there, I did not see him. I then turned back thinking I should be time enough to see the short man before he took up the bundle; the whole of the time was not more than three minutes; I came back to look for the short man who put down the bundle, he was missing also, and the bundle. I then went into Southampton-row, to the house where they were taken from, and I saw the street door wide open; it was the same door that I saw the beds come out of.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is King-street from Southampton-row. - A. King-street leads out of Orange-street, into Red-lion-square; there is but one street as you enter out of King-street, that is Kingsgate-street, that is a short one. I then went to Mr. Wilkinson, a neighbour, and I made enquiries afterwards, and I traced the goods into Kingsgate-street; I called upon a neighbour, as Mrs. Kinsey and I were not upon very good terms. I got a watchman and him to go into her house. I then made enquiries, and traced the goods into Kingsgate-street, to a house kept by a person of the name of Fielding. I did not see them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long would it take to go to the house where you traced them. - A. Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the way in which he was going, did he turn to Kingsgate-street. - A. He turned to Kingsgate-street, instead of going down to Holborn, and there it was I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the place where you last saw the tall man with a bundle on his head, how soon could he have got to Kingsgate-street. - A. In two minutes, with the greatest ease.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw this door open, and two men go out at half after six - was it day light or dark. - A. It was darkish, the lamps were lit.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it so dark that you could not see a man's face, was the day closed. - A. The day was closed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Then it was not dusk, the day was closed. - A. It was not dusk, the day had closed.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that positively. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you never saw the face of the two persons at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen them, should you have been able to have known them. - A. Most likely I should by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. But on turning Kingsgate-street you lost sight of them. - A. Yes, but in two minutes they might have got to Fielding's house.</p>
               <p>Q. And in two minutes they might have got any where else at an equal distance. - A. No doubt of that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pooley. Humphries and he came to your house on the 24th of October in the evening. - A. Yes, about seven o'clock, as near as I can recollect, or between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come together. - A. No, not immediately together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came the first. - A. Upon my life I cannot say which came first; when they came first I was asleep at my fire side, my wife awoke me; they brought two large bundles with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they a bundle each. - A. Each of them had a bundle; they said they were beds; they asked me if I would purchase them in some kind of words, but I do not recollect the words; I told them no, and that their bringing such thing to me were nonsense; I told them they would not suit me.</p>
               <p>Q. They knew your business. - A. Yes; independent of that I do a little in the shop in the brokering way; I buy little odds and ends of furniture, not such large concerns as them, because I have no convenience, and I told them that they well know; I desired them to take them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they put them down in your house. - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Court. They put them down perhaps before you awoke. - A. Yes, sir; they were down before I awoke; upon which Humphries turned upon his heel, and said he would call a coach; Humphries went and called a coach; they were not three minutes in my house altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that Humphries went for the coach where was Brady. - A. Standing in my shop by the goods; they then brought the coach a few doors from my house, they came and took the bundles upon their shoulders, and went away, and as I supposed put them in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them put them in the coach. - A. No, Humpries took both the bundles; Brady helped him up with them on his shoulder, and away they went; I do not know where they went to.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Brady. - A. I have heard that he is a sadler and harness maker; that is what I have always understood him to be. I am a man that people is pleased to say can sing a good song; I go to sing a song where I am invited, many people know me.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You live at 32, Eagle-street, Red Lion-square. - A. I do; I am a hackney coachman; I drive for an hackney man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your coach standing on the 24th of October in the evening. - A. At the Pilgrim in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Kingsgate-street is that. - A. It may be forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that evening go to any house in Kingsgate-street. - A. No, I went opposite of Eagle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you called from your stand when you was there. - A. About a quarter past seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that came to you. - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020031"/>cannot tell I am sure; the man came and asked me whether I would like to take two beds; I told him I would take two beds, but I would have a shilling more than my fare, for carrying them, and by this there was an altercation; he said he would give me sixpence more, I agreed to go for a shilling more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go and take up the beds. - A. I did; in taking them there they told me to take them to Broad-street; I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of them, look behind you. A. No, I do not know either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the articles that you took up there fill up the coach. - A. Nearly; one rode on the box, I cannot say whether the other rode or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the men at the time they were putting the things in the coach, were they of the same size. - A. I was feeding the horses; the little man seems to be like the man that rode on the box, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not positively swear to him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been to the house since. - A. Yes. I think I have seen the house since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a shop or private house. - A. A shop, where they make looking glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the person's name that keeps the shop. A. Bainbridge is over the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you seen the name written over the door since. - A. Yes, on the Wednesday I saw the name written over the door; I could not see it the night I took the goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you carried these goods it was on the Saturday. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you saw the name of Bainbridge over the door that was on Wednesday - how far is that shop from Kingsgate-street. - A. About three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be going to it. - A. About ten minutes, or rather better.</p>
               <p>Q. When they took the coach did they till you where to drive to. - A No; after the man got on the box he told me to drive to Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man on the box and you get into any discourse. - A. Yes, we got into deep discourse; I thought they were the peel makers beds, I thought the landlord had better lose his rent than the peel-maker his beds. The man on the box told me he had a large family, and as Fielding and me were neighbours, I thought I would do him a neighbouring action and get the goods off as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that the man went on the box, and the time you have described, do you believe him to be the man - I do not ask you whether you can swear positively. - A. I do not know whether he is or not, I have no belief, only by his size, it being so dark; it was a man of that size.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to stop when you got into Broad-street. - A. The man that rode on the box; I drawed up to the door, the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Who knocked at the door. - A. To the best of my belief the man that rode upon the box, he knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see come to the door. - A. I saw nobody come to the door at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing carried into the house. - A. Yes, two beds what were put in the coach from Kingsgate-street, that were put in the house in Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two men go into the house. - A. What two men? I only saw one man, the man that rode on the box with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man, after the things were put in the house, go into the house. - A. Yes; I took two shillings, and then I went away about my business.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there no light in the shop. - A. No light at all as I saw.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. When you went there who did you go with. - A. With Mrs. Kinsey; I went with her to shew her the house, I did not go in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went in the house with her. - A. Two runners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. At the time you went from Kingsgate-street to Broad-street, it was very dark. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The shops were all shut. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any name over the door of the house that you went to that night. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went with Mrs. Kinsey you went in the day, the shops were all open. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the shops, when they were shut up that night, very much alike. - A. Very much, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you, if you went there of a dark night again, whether you might not mistake one from the other. - A. I might, of a dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Now are you quite sure that when you went at broad day light, when the shops were open, that you did not go to a different house. - A. I am sure that I did not go to a different house.</p>
               <p>Q. By day the shutters were down. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At night, when you went, the shutters were all up, and there was no light at all. - A. There was no light at all.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You are a constable of the police office, Marlborough-street. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Brady. - A. Yes, I know him to be Michael Brady; I have known him this last month, upon no other occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Humphries. - A. I do, I have known him two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are Humphries and Brady of the same size. - A. No, Humphries is considerably taller than Brady.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information, did you on the 25th of October last go to the place where Brady lodged. - A. I did; I went to the second floor of No. 19, Queen-street, Seven Dials; we were searching that place; there were me and three other officers. I observed a woman, while we were searching, go down stairs; I followed her immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you known in the house. - A. I was known by the person in whose room we were in.</p>
               <p>Court. What person's room was it. - A. A person of the name of Hankey; we had him in custody at the time. The woman knew me very well, she went down stairs, I followed her down; she went into the front parlour, she come out again in an instant, and at the same instant she came out a little boy followed her, he had a bundle in his hand: when she came out of the parlour with the boy she was going up stairs, the boy came out and went into the street, I laid hold of him directly and took the bundle from him; I carried him back and the bundle into the parlour, there I found the prisoner Brady who had just arisen from the bed and was dressing himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020032"/>Q. What time was this. - A. Between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday morning the 25th of October, the morning after the robbery had been committed; I asked Brady how it happened that the lad came out of the room with these things; Brady said he knew nothing of it. I put Brady in the watchhouse, and took the boy to be examined before the magistrate; there was no magistrate at the office, being Sunday; I put him in the watchhouse till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy give you any information from whom he had them. - A. He did, on the Monday, before Brady, he said he had given him these implements of housebreaking; there is three double skeleton keys and crows. The boy said Brady had given him them to carry out and to throw them behind a door of a green shop in that street; Brady said it was true that he had done so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to No. 39, in Southampton row. - A. I did, in a day or two after, I think it was about the Wednesday, in two or three days after; Mrs. Kinsey went with me, and Burton and another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there did you find any of these keys to fit the lock of the door. - A. I did; the door of the kitchen that goes out of the area. I made her go inside, double lock it, and take the key out, and then with this end of this key I unlocked it with the greatest ease; here is six parts to these three keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any opinion whether it was that key that opened it. - A. It would open it, certainly. This key is forced with having turned a lock or bolt; in the form I put it in that very form it came out.</p>
               <p>Court. You were very sure that you did not bend it. - A. Certainly not, in that state it opened that lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Mr. Bainbridge's. - A. Yes. I did sometime after this, when the prisoner Brady was brought up for examination, I think about the 6th of November, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. After your house had been broken open, and your goods lost, did you go to the house of Mr. Bainbridge. - A. I did, in company with the coachman; I went to No. 5, Broad-street, Carnaby-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you get to shew you the way. - A. The coachman, Matthews, he told me it was a frame maker's shop.</p>
               <p>Court. What shop did you find it to be when you got there. - A. A glass frame maker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you went. - A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, on the Tuesday or Wednesday after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go two days to the house. - A. I did; on the Thursday, when I went the first time, I saw a person that was called Mrs. Bainbridge, a female, and a tall thin man in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was Mr. Bainbridge present. - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Then you must not tell us what was said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. What did you see there. - A. I saw a feather bed upon another, in a garret; I found the bed myself; two officers went with me. I had a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Petherick was one of the officers. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In that house you found a feather bed that you thought was yours. - A. I found one bed that I thought was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any alteration in the bed then, since the last time you had seen it in your house. - A. There was an alteration in the bed, the binding was taken off; I wanted to fetch the man that I bought it of that was Mr. Simmonds.</p>
               <p>Q. The binding being taken off that made you doubt. A. Yes, and for that reason I wanted to fetch the man that made it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there. - Q. A pair of blankets; I do not mean to swear to the blankets; but with regard to the bed, I had a day or two before dirted the edge of it with my foot; this bed was dirty much in the same place. I then obtained a warrant on the day after, and went with the man that I bought it of, but the bed was then removed; there was one bed only that looked like my property, but that bed was gone; I searched the house all over.</p>
               <p>Court. On the first day you went and saw this bed, you were not quite positive that it was yours; who were attending you in the house besides the officer. - A. Mrs. Bainbridge was in the house both days; I submitted to her both days that I thought it was my bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I object to that.</p>
               <p>Court. I only want to know the fact of her claiming it as her own; you claimed that bed as your own. - A. I did, not only once, but repeatedly; I said, I think this bed is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you went the next day, did you take Mr. Simmonds with you. - A. I did, I went about the same hour, as soon as a warrant could be obtained in the morning; I saw Mrs. Bainbridge there and the man, the same as I did on the day before; I went to the same place to look for the bed; it was removed; I enquired of Mrs. Bainbridge, and I asked the man; I said is the bed here, he said no.</p>

            . - Mr. Pooley. You are a constable. - A. Yes, of St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 28th or 29th of October go with Mrs. Kinsey to the house of Mrs. Bainbridge. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard what she has been stating. - A. I was present with her at the first time she went I went; on searching the house, Mr. Bainbridge was not at home, when we went into the attic story, we went into the front room, where we found two bedsteads with beds on, it was a double bedded room.</p>
               <p>Court. You are speaking of these beds upon the bedsteads, as if they were belonging to the house, to the family. - A. Yes, there were sheets and every thing complete; when I come to one of the bedsteads in the front room, there were two or three beds on that bedstead, and one on the other; at that bedstead where there were three feather-beds, one on the other; Mrs. Kinsey looked at them carefully; when she came to one bed she said this looks like my bed, I think she said this is my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In short she thought one of the beds was her own. A. Certainly, my lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is no case made out against Bainbridge.</p>
               <p>Brady's Defence. I am quite innocent of it; I have people to bring forward that I work for, to my character; I always worked for my bread; these housebreaking things that were found on my premises did not belong to me; the boy that I kept, his father is at sea; and to keep the boy from going to prison; I said that I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020033"/>it to him. I understood they were in the room, and they were brought by another person into the house.</p>
               <p>Bainbridge's Defence. I know nothing about them, I never saw an article brought into the house that evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon this evidence, it does not appear, certainly, that this man was at home when these goods were delivered.</p>
               <p>Brady brought three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

The next day I went to the chandler's-shop where the brewer stopped with his dray, I saw two officers; I told them if they went over to that ground, they would find the pad lock, where he had chucked it over; accordingly they did find it there, where he had chucked it over.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday the 24th of November, this young man came to my house, and said he had been robbed; he seemed to be crying; I went with him to Winfield-street and made some enquiries; I was informed who had robbed him; I went in search of him different times that evening; I could not find him; I was informed the next morning that he was in the Compter; I applied to the lord mayor; they had him there, for what I cannot particularly say; the lord mayor asked me if I had a witness that see him do the robbery; I replied no; he was remanded till I could bring a witness; I brought the witness; this witness told me where the lock was thrown over, I went and found it. I produce it.</p>

I never was in that street that day; I belonged to the royal artillery six years and a half, after that I belonged to the Prince of Wales's royal fencibles at Gibraltar we were all reduced.</p>

When he fell down, the saw at his back flew out between his legs; when we took him over to the public house, his head fell against the wall by his struggling; he said d - n it, do not knock one's brains out.</p>

               <p>Q. We understand that he is deaf and dumb. - A. Yes; when he was between six and seven years, he was taken with a putrid fever; when he got better he was deprived of his speech, a piece of the jaw bone came off and two teeth, he cannot speak, he cannot hear a gun go off; sometimes his head swells and the swelling breaks; that makes him as if he was deranged in in his mind.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a great deal of cunning about him; where a man is deprived of one sense they often have it another way. - A. He is not very clever; sometimes he can work, and sometimes he cannot without his master shewing him a pattern, then he works it off; sometimes he is quite silly; I have never heard him speak since he had the fever. (The prisoner had the evidence produced to him in writing, and denied having the property.)</p>

             informed me that the gown in the indictment was hanging out of Mrs. Conner's window; I saw it myself; I ordered the watchman to go down stairs and throw off his rattle, that we might get another watchman; the patrol and a watchman came, I desired the watchman to see if any thing went of the gown that hung out of the window; I then went up with our own watchman and demanded entrance at Conner's door; at that time they were pretending a sham fight, the husband and wife amongst themselves; they said they had lost the key; we broke the door open, and the gown was thrown in the street. When I went in, to my great surprize we found three young men in the room, and O'Conner and his wife; I did not know of the young men being in the room; we said that the servants had been robbed, and we suspected them; myself and the watchman looked round the room and found some towels that we had been robbed of; by that time the watchman brought up the gown that had been hung up at the window. I charged them all with the watchman, and they were all taken to the watchhouse. After that I brought the officer of the night and searched the room; he found some stockings in a tin saucepan on a shelf over their bed; there were three pair belonging to my niece.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Thursday the 5th of November I was called in by the maid servant, about half past eleven at night, she told me she had been robbed, she shewed me the room where the robbery had been committed; it appeared to me the lock had been forced back by a knife; the bolt was about half undone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot say whether it was locked or only half locked. - A. No. On the same floor there were two empty rooms, I looked them over, there was nothing to be seen there; I observed under the staircase of the two pair of stairs, a great vacancy under the stairs, the maid servant kicked her foot against the dirt that laid there, and the first thing that came to light was one stocking; I turned the dirt over, there were three more stockings there and a petticoat; I informed the landlord, he came up stairs, I shewed him where they were found. The prisoner, with four men, were in the room making a noise, Kensington desired them to go to bed. Mr. Kensington and me came down stairs together; the maid servant informed us there was a gown hanging out of the window, I went out in the street, there seemed apparently to be a gown hanging out of the window; I sprung the rattle and brought another watchman and a patrol. Mr. Kensington desired the watchman to stand under the window to see what fell from the window; the patrol and I went up stairs, I told them I insisted upon the door been opened; we forced the door open; when we went into the room there were four men and the prisoner; when I got into the middle of the room, I said, Peggy go to the window and take your gown in, and as the servant maid was going towards the window, the prisoner turned upon her heel, and throwed the window up herself, she told her to come and see if there was any gown there; the instant the window was thrown up, the gown went from the window into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see it go into the street. - A. I saw it go from the window; we took them all in custody to the watchhouse, then Mr. Kensington ordered them to be taken to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the room when you took them. - A. No, the room was not searched the first time at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that, you have been a watchman a good many years. - A. I cannot say, we took them upon the gown being found.</p>
               <p>Q. Then seeing the gown drop, your suspicions must be encreased. - A. We did not search the room till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Kensington told me you did. - A. There was nothing found in my sight not then.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner went to the window did you go to the window. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went to the window to prevent it from being opened. - A. I had not the thought.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these men. - A. The magistrate discharged three of them, and one was kept upon another indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all in the room, and all charged alike at the present time. - A.Yes, We searched the room after we came back; we found five stockings in a saucepan, upon a shelf over the prisoner's bed; the bed was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that tin saucepan was there when you were there before. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you look then. - A. I had not the presence of mind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barry. When the prisoners were taken to the watchhouse the door was left open. - A. No, Mr. Kensington fastened it with a string in a particular manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you take upon you to swear that this was a gown hanging out of the two pair window. - A. It was apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be something else. - A. It might be something else.</p>
               <p>WINTER BURR. I am a watchman. I was placed below at the window, I saw a gown hanging out at the window; the prisoner I believe dropped the gown and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020038"/>Q. I believe a great many things, and I shall tell the jury you believe there is a forty pound reward - why do you believe, upon your oath, that it was the prisoner, you cannot know, you was not at the window. - A. I do not pretend to say that I was at the window. I gave the gown to the officer Bayliss.</p>

            . I was officer of the night; I produce the property. On searching the prisoner I found the duplicate of the pattens; the prisoner said she picked the pattens up in the yard by the water but.</p>
               <p>Q. to Henley. Is there any thing particular in that patten. - A. I cannot swear to the patten, only the ribbon is a wide ribbon; the petticoat and stockings are mine.</p>

I do: in the beginning of the summer I left town for Chester; I left the prisoner Brown in an anxious care of my house, and that upon a recommendation of her character for sobriety and honesty. On the 28th of October I returned from Chester, I searched my iron chest, where I had deposited bank notes; it also contained from twenty to thirty dollars and crown pieces, and three or four pieces of ancient gold coin. I found the pieces of gold coin taken out of the bag. I then soon after received from the police office this key, it unlocked the drawer. I have nothing to do but to identify the property.</p>

               <p>Q. I know that you know she was not. - A. I do not think she was; the magistrate told her he would not take her evidence, they were all three implicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it done under that impression that she might be an evidence. - A. I suppose it was, the justice would not take her evidence.</p>
               <p>Q.Then what she did, she did it under an idea that she should become a witness. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot receive it. - Gentlemen, if a person gives their evidence against themselves, with an impression that it will be of service to them, whether it is from hope of escaping of justice, or fear of punishment, it cannot be received in evidence, because it is impossible to say how far an innocent person may accuse himself; therefore whether a confession is obtained through hope of favour, that you shall not be prosecuted, this must operate on the mind, whether they shall or not be exposed; or if it is done under terror - I will take you up unless you confess this - this is exactly the same as hope; on the other hand, it is clear that this cannot be voluntary; the confession may be evidence against herself; I cannot admit that as evidence against any body else. - The counsel for the prosecution is against the other woman and the man; there is no evidence against the principal, but what was obtained through hope or fear; then if there is no evidence against the principal, there can be none against the accessories. - They might be indicted for a misdemeanoras aiding and assisting the person that committed the felony.</p>

             came to my house; from his information I was determined to take warrants against all the people that worked for us.

After this, he said if the old rogue was gone he would confess.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not that confession made under an idea that he should be admitted an evidence. - A. There was a misconception; we were all along determined to prosecute. Mr. Alley knows that I said the law must take its course.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a misconception, do you mean that the prisoner misconceived, and made that confession under the idea that he should be admitted an evidence. - A. I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not every reason to believe that it was under that idea. - A. No. He said I am a guilty wretch, I know nothing can be done for me; he wished to make a recompence to his master.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he make a confession before the magistrate. A. He did; the magistrate sent a body warrant, and a search warrant to Smith; we went to his house with Mr.

We set down all the things in a book that were given out of the cutting room; when I returned from Yorkshire I missed this calico.</p>

There was an examination in Marlborough-street, was it not the intention of the magistrate till the last examination, to commit Smith for a misdemeanor, as receiver, and to make Hanssen a witness, did he not, with that impression on his mind, receive the confession of Smith. - A. I cannot tell, it was not my intention.</p>

Hamilton produced his warrant; we found this holland and cotton; my partner after followed; we brought the goods away. Mr. Smith acknowledged having a knowledge of the boy, and having dealings with him. He did not say he bought stolen goods of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I ask you, sir, whether Mr. Brodie the magistrate, did not mean to commit Smith for the misdemeanor, did not he express his surprize after the proceedings, that he was called upon to make both parties felons - give me your answer, did you not yourself then say that you called upon the magistrate to commit both for the felony, as you thought you had evidence against both for the felony. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland. At the time that Hanssen first went to Mr. Meyer, you and Hanssen went down in the room together, when Smith went away, what did Hanssen state in that room. - A. He stated of various articles he had taken, silk serges, brown holland, fine cotton, cassimere, balls of twist, pounds of thread, and various quantities of sewing silks, black and coloured, which he sold to the prisoner Smith, receiving for these articles three shillings a yard for silk serge, from ten pence to a shilling a yard for brown holland, upon an average fine cottons from ten pence a yard to one shilling, thread at three shillings per pound, twist from one shilling and ten pence to two shillings per ounce.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober. - A. Yes. I mean to say that I had something to drink, but I was no ways disguised in liquor; I was walking with a friend, close by his side. The prisoner said something to me, but what I cannot say. She then turned instantly round to me, catched me round the waist, and as soon as she let go of me I suspected that she had robbed me; I put my hand in my pocket, I found my money was gone; I instantly said you have robbed me. I took the rest of my money out of my pocket, to see if it was gone; I found the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How much. - A. Five half guineas, two seven shilling pieces, three shillings, two sixpences, one was a bad sixpence, a three-penny piece, and three pennyworth of halfpence, and a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all in a purse. - A. No, they were not; the gold was in one pocket, and the halfpence in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to take from both pockets. - A. She did. I immediately laid hold of her and charged her with robbing of me; I catched hold of her hands, because I thought she would make away with it. The constable, when I called watch, he catched hold of the other hand; we took her to the watchhouse; I asked her whether she had robbed me, the said she had not; they took the pocket from her side and found the half guineas, the seven shilling pieces, the three pennyworth of halfpence, and the bill in the pocket; she said it was hers.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not picked her up at all - A. I will be upon my oath I had not; I do not recollect changing a word with her till I charged her with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you felt her hand in your pocket, and so strong was the impression, that you put your hand into your pocket immediately. - A. I did put my hand into my pocket immediately.</p>

            . I am a patrol of the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On this gentleman coming down Holborn, I heard a cry of Watch, I made way over to him as fast as I could; he said the girl had robbed him of upwards of seven pounds; he gave her in my charge. I took her by one hand and the gentleman by the other. When we came to Red-lion-street she was unwilling to go any further; she attempted to put her hand into her pocket, I heard the money rattle, I supposed she wanted to throw the money away. I took her hand out of her pocket, the constable of the night searched her at the watchhouse; the constable found the money in her pocket, she pulled off her pocket herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he described the money before. - A. He described that it was upwards of seven pounds, all in half guineas and seven shilling pieces; he could not tell exactly what it was till he had looked over his pockets.</p>

            . Q. You were constable of the night. - A. Yes; this money (producing it) I took out of the woman's pocket, five half guineas, two seven shilling pieces, and a bill for two pounds odd, two sixpences, a three-penny piece, and three pennyworth of half pence.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my bill, it is a bill of parcels for two hams I bought on that day, I can swear to it; likewise one shilling; the three penny piece I had in my pocket near a twelvemonth; all the money I know very well. I can swear to a remarkable piece, with RB upon it, and likewise a bent half guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday night I met this gentleman and another gentleman, he asked me if I could take him home to my lodgings, I told him I could not; after possession was accomplished I asked him to make me a compliment, he said he had no money, but he would see me the evening following, and then he would make me a compliment; I was greatly surprised at his not offering me a compliment; as I went from him I saw a piece of paper laying on the ground, I picked it up at the top of the street, he came up to me and said he had lost his money; I told him I had no money of his, he said he had no money; he said I had, and if I did not give it up he would take me to the watchhouse; I told him I was willing to go, for what money I had I would shew to the constable of the night. I pulled off my pocket, and gave it to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Jury. We would wish to ask him whether his friend was with him the whole of the time. - A. Yes.</p>

I cannot recollect the day of the month; I was coming along, the woman stopped me and asked me where I was going, I told her home; I asked her to let me have connection with her, I went up Plough-yard, I turned down with her again; I missed my pocket book and the pound note that was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your pocket book again. - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not drop it. - A. Yes, because I had my hand in my pocket when I went up the yard with her; when I came down I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped some time. - A. Yes, I stopped the value of five minutes, and then I missed my pocket book; I am sure I did not drop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. No, I was a little in liquor, but I was not so much gone but what I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before. - A. I never saw her before to my knowledge; I gave charge of her and took her to the watchhouse, when I found I had lost my note. The pound note was found upon her, but not the pocket book. The officer sent me out to look for the pocket book; I could not find it any where.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her. - A. Three pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>- SWAIN. I am the constable of the night; as soon as this woman was brought in I sent one of the watchmen and the prosecutor out to look for the pocket book; I searched the woman, I found a one pound note in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the note before you found it. - A. No; before I shewed him the note I asked him whether it was a clean note or a dirty one; he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020041"/>thought it was a cleanish one; it turned out to be a tolerable clean note; the woman at first said it was a note that she had received from her husband for his wages, of Mr. Rhodes; however it came out afterwards that she had no husband.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny ever saying that I had a husband, I never had a husband.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to the number nor the date of the note, I only know it by the black on the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out, I met a man that I had a child by him, he gave me a pound note and five shillings; if I had taken that young man's money I should not have surrendered myself up to the watchman; I never saw his pocket book nor the pound note.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your money. - A. Last Sunday three weeks; I lost it from Mr. Sparrow's where I lodged, in <placeName id="t18071202-54-crimeloc335">George-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking it away. - A. Another man took it away, and Allen received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Allen in company with the man who took it. A. Not then; they knocked my head and stopped my breath, I could not call out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Allen there when this was taken from you. - A. Yes, he was; Allen was up and counted the money by a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that another man took it, and the prisoner was not present, were they both in company together. - A. Yes; they took two guineas and two seven shilling pieces from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was this. - A. In the upper room, where there were five beds.</p>
               <p>Q. How many laid in the room. - A. There were two in one bed, and two beds but one in a bed; Allen and the other man laid together that took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it. - A. They pulled my trowsers from under my head; I laid hold of the pocket, and it came off in my hand; they pulled the trowsers from me and pressed my hand and took the money from me.</p>
               <p>- LAWRENCE. I slept in this house. On the evening of the 8th of November, the prisoner and another man came up, they laid hold of this man's trowsers; Allen pulled them from the side of the bed, and put them in again; he went down stairs and lit a pipe; when he came up again he swore that the poor old man had the money in his hand; the old man got out of bed naked, he called murder; the other man stopped his mouth with his fist; this other man had got the purse, the old man said he had five guineas when he came from the country, and when he came to London he had two guineas, four seven shilling pieces, and two or three shillings. This other man put the halfpence and the silver back into the purse; the gold he kept; he said he should have it all in the morning. They did not give it him, they went away before five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You were all in the same room together. - A. I slept there but two nights.</p>
               <p>JOHN HIMM. About six minutes before eight o'clock, there were these two men in the room; the man that lodged along with the old man wanted to get the old man's money; the prisoner said he would give the old man his money in the morning; in the morning he quitted the room before five; instead of giving the old man his money he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other man take the money away from him. - A. I saw him force it out of his hands, and then he delivered it to Allen and Allen counted it; I cannot tell what money there was, it was only a small bit of candle that lay on the floor, I only saw copper. Then Allen said whatever deficiency there was it should be delivered to him in the morning. The old man said if it was so, he would give them a glass of gin or any thing they required.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made good to the old man. - A. No. Mr. Sparrow got up hearing them make a noise and laughing as they went down; in the morning he asked me if any thing was amiss, I told him the old cake man had lost his money; Mr. Sparrow found two seven shilling pieces about and two shillings and sixpence in silver; the old man said he had four seven shilling pieces, he was two guineas and two seven shilling pieces short.</p>

            . Q. This house of yours you let in lodgings. - A. Yes. I did not know any thing till the morning of the 9th of November; I live in the house myself. A man came down in the morning and shook the door of my apartment; in about half an hour I heard the prisoner and the other man go out, they left the door open; hearing them talk louder than common curiosity led me up stairs to know if any thing was amiss; they told me there was a robbery of the old cake man of two guineas and four seven shilling pieces; I told them it was most exceeding strange that they had not given me an alarm before; I searched the bed, I found in his purse two seven shilling pieces, about half a crown in silver, and about six pennyworth of halfpence. On Wednesday the 11th me and Mr. Griffiths apprehended the prisoner; when he was apprehended, he said he was innocent of the affair, he would go quietly with us to Lambeth-street office.</p>

            . I was in the room, I distinctly saw that this man that is not taken forced the money from the old man's left hand, and handed it over to Allen; he counted it over, and said whatever was missing he should have in the morning; apparently according to the account of the old man, he walked away in the morning, and did not give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lawrence. You saw none of this man's money. - A. Yes, I saw him take out a piece of paper wherein I saw a guinea and two seven shilling pieces; I saw it in Allen's hand after he put the silver and halfpence in the purse; the end of the candle went out; that is all I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Sunday evening, I was sitting at the George drinking a pint of porter, this old man came in, he drank out of the pint, he asked me after I had the pint of porter whether I was going home, I said yes. When we came from the public house it wanted about a quarter to nine o'clock; when we came up stairs the old man was in the bed; this man went to the old man's bed he said this old man always sleeps in his trowsers; I said if Mr. Sparrow knew it he would not suffer it; after that he put on the old man's coat; I said to him take it off; I took the coat from him; I said here, father, take care of your coat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020042"/>after that he takes his pipe and goes down to the George and lighted it; immediately I went into bed he came up again with his lighted pipe; he undressed himself and went into bed to the old man; he took his trowsers off, and finding that he had the money in his hand, he wrenched it out of his hand; then he jumped out of bed directly; I catched hold of the purse, the old gentleman said their was a little purse in the big purse, the little purse fell between the sheets; I took it out and counted it out before the old man; I gave it the old man again; I said, I dare say if you have lost any thing, he will give it you again. The other two men persuaded the old man to get in bed again, there was nobody would wrong him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Before she said any thing to you, had not you told her she had better tell you. - A. No, I never promised her nor threatened her.</p>
               <p>Court. In short, did you use any expressions to her to induce her to say that which otherwise she would not have said. - A. I desired her to tell the truth, and then I asked her what she had done with the bill of exchange of forty two pounds; she told me that she had given it to a Mr. Dawson of Wandsworth, but whereabouts he lived in Wandsworth she could not tell me. I then asked her how she could think of stealing the purse at a time the family were in such distress from the fire. I asked her what this purse contained, she said nothing more than the bill of exchange; I then asked her where she found this purse, in what part of the house, she said she found it on the stairs as she was coming down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did not deny being in the house. - A. Not at all; she confessed that she picked up the purse, she heard it jingle; I said it is very unlikely that a purse would jingle if there was nothing in it but a bill of exchange; she then confessed that she had paid away two of the one pound notes the same day she had stolen it to her landlady. These were her words; I then asked her what she had done with the rest; she replied, that she had got drunk and lost them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BAXTER. I live in Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. I am a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, have you ever seen her before. - A. Yes, I have seen her many times before, I have known her for years, she is a married woman, her husband is a shoe maker. On the 24th of October, I think, in the morning, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another woman, were in the shop, I did not see them come in; the woman that was with the prisoner was pledging a ring; the prisoner had got a piece of paper in her hand, and she was shewing it to some of the customers that were in the shop; I asked to look at it, she gave it me, she said she supposed it was worth nothing. I told her it was worth nothing to her, I looked at it; I asked her how she came by it, she told me she found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she found it. - A. I do not recollect. I looked at it, and found it be a promissory note.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at it, and found what you thought a promissory note. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a bill of exchange. - A. I told her she had better take it to the acceptor, and by that means she would find the owner, and get something for her trouble; I then gave it her back again; that was on the Saturday. On the Monday following I saw it advertised, that it was stolen from a house; I thought the ring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020043"/>might be stolen likewise; I took the ring that the woman that was with her pledged down to the house of the prosecutor, and the Wednesday following, on the 4th of November, the prisoner came again to the shop. I told her I must detain her till I sent for the gentleman that belonged to the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce the bill then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She had not left the bill with you. - A. No, I gave it her after I had looked at it; immediately, the first time I saw it. She asked me if it was advertised; I told her I must detain her. I did not ask her what she had done with the bill, she told me she had given it to Mr. Dawson. On the Friday following, in consequence of information I had received, I went to the room where the prisoner lodged, I saw a man there, I asked him if his name was Dawson, he said it was; I told him I wanted that bill that he had of the prisoner, the prisoner was in custody; then he took it out of his pocket book; he said he would not give it me, but he would give it to her husband; the husband said he knew nothing about it, and immediately gave it to me. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mayston. This is the same bill.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a remarkable one, I am sure you cannot be mistaken. - A. No, it is the same bill, Maria Lavender paid it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that it was upon the table. A. It was upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loose upon the table, or was it never out of the purse in your sight. - A. It was never out of the purse from the time I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. What I wish to know is this, whether you are sure you left it in the purse on the table, or whether you saw it upon the table, or about the house at any time, out of the purse. - A. I never saw it out of the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Not on that day. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you never saw the prisoner before. - A. I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us likewise that you did not see her in that room where the purse was. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did see the prisoner in the house that day. - A. I met her on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the door of your room from her when you met her on the stairs. - A. I met her about the third stair from the house door, she was going up stairs and I was going down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where you went after you passed her. - A. I went into the kitchen to see after the fire; I saw her again after I missed the purse, and I saw her at the top of the house in the garret; that was two stories from the room where I left the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her in the garret you had missed the purse - A. I had not missed it then, I had missed the purse after the fire was put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her after you missed the purse. I saw her in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was in the kitchen that you asked the servant about it. - A. It was, and in her hearing; she said she was the only stranger in the house, she would leave her address.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you accuse her of it. - A. I had suspicion of her; my mistress and I went up stairs and accused her with taking of them; she said she had not seen them. An officer was sent for, he searched her room, and found a bit of the gown in her cloak; the gown was in an unfinished state, it was a bit that was left; we searched her pockets and found four shillings and sixpence in money upon her, and the key which she had opened the door; I had lost that key for a week. I had another key to the lock. When I fetched the children down, about nine o'clock in the morning, the things were in the room; I locked the door when I came out of the room. I am sure this is a piece of my gown.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier, I live at No. 2, Marmaduke-street, St. George's in the East. On the 28th of October near two o'clock, I was in Mr. Lawrence's tap room, I saw the prisoner take one pot; then I saw him take another. The first pot he put in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the tap room besides you and him. - A. Yes, two people; I do not think any body sat in the same box with him; in about four or five minutes he took another pot and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the man before. - A. Yes, I had often seen him in the tap room, but never to have any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing him take one pot and then another, what did you do. - A. Nothing; he went out of the tap room into the privy, he was there some time; he returned into the tap room again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform the people of the house or speak to him. - A. No, he got up and went into the street; I followed him till he came to an iron shop, near a quarter of a mile from the public house; I followed him into the shop; I saw him in conversation with the mistress of the shop inside of the counter, I accused him of taking Mr. Lawrence's pots; I laid hold of him and searched him, and a bricklayer I met, I asked him to go with me as a witness, to see me take the property from him; I took the half pint out of his pocket and the bricklayer took the pint out; some gentlemen came up and asked me whether I had any authority to take him; we let him go and told Mr. Lawrence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever you see a felony committed, always take them up, you have as much right as a constable - what did the prisoner say. - A. Not a word; he went away as fast as he could.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Hatton Garden. On the 7th of September I apprehended the prisoner at the bar near Bagnigge Wells, at her father's house. I charged her with the offence; at first she strongly denied it. I told her I had but very little doubt but what she had taken the things; she at last burst out in tears, and said I have; she said her father had got the duplicates. I took the father in custody; he delivered the duplicates up to me before the magistrate. The shoes I found in a box at her father's; she said she did it in distress, she said her father took them away from her, and said how could she do such a thing. The whole family seemed to be in the greatest distress.</p>

               <p>Q. You did very properly indeed - what became of the young man. - A. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both together when you laid hold of the prisoner. - A. No, the young man might be twenty yards from the prisoner; I seized the prisoner by the collar, I says that is not your property, come along with me; he said I shall not run away; I said I will take care you shall not; I took him into the Opera tap, and asked who owned the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found an owner for the box. - A. Yes, I held the prisoner till the officer came; the box was delivered into the bar of the Opera tap. (The box produced.)</p>

When I saw the people were running, I did not attempt to run away, I was looking to see where they were running to. I did not know but what the man that gave me the parcel belonged to the cart.</p>

               <p>MRS. TATTERSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner. A. Yes, I let the lodgings to her; the house is in <placeName id="t18071202-61-crimeloc379">Frying Pan-alley, Spital Fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she relate herself as a single woman. - A. No. I let the lodgings to her on the 4th of November, and she quitted it on the 27th of June; it went at three shillings and sixpence a week; it was a furnished lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the use of a pair of sheets, a feather bed, bolster, and two chairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a wooden pail and an iron pail. - A. No, it was a wooden pail with iron hoops; she had also a tea kettle and a saucepan; all these things she had for her use in her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay you the rent. - A. Yes, very well for a considerable time; she owed me about nine shillings when she went away. The last week we could not get into the room, we were afraid they were doing something they should not; my husband went up to her room about nine o'clock on the 27th of June, the daughter asked if it was her mother; he got in the room and I went in after him; we looked about the room, we perceived the things were gone; we got possession of the key. We saw the woman no more till she was taken up; we have only found one sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in the lodging with her. - A. Her daughter; there was a man there, I should not know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRICE. I am a pawnbroker, Wentworth-street. On the 8th of June last we had a sheet pledged in the name of Mary M'Lane for half a crown. I have no recollection of her person.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never pawned any thing but that one sheet; my husband offered to pledge the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020046"/>things; I told him he had better not. I pawned the sheet for half a crown and brought my husband the money; I was married in the year eighty-one; the tea kettle was not worth twopence, it run; when the things were taken away, my husband told me he would fetch them back.</p>

            . Q. You I believe are the mansell. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to a room over the Charter house building over Dr. Fisher's house. - A. I did, I went on that roof; when I got to that roof a slater met me, I observed that lead was taken from two different parts on Dr. Fisher's house; from information I went to the prisoner, he was in the hall of the Charter house; I desired him to follow me, he followed me up to the roof. I told him he had taken some lead, as we were going up stairs; he told me he had not; I charged him a second time, he still denied it; I told him a person saw him, he said who; I think, I said the slater; after a short space of time, he said he had taken the lead; he went with me, and shewed me where he had deposited it, he went to Mr. Barber's water-closet. In that water-closet is another closet; there he said was the lead; he attempted to pull it out but could not conveniently, it was rather dark at that time; I said let it remain; I took him to Dr. Fisher, he was afterwards given in charge of a constable; when the constable came I went with him to the same spot the prisoner had pointed out; there I saw the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there. - A. About twenty eight pound; the constable afterwards fitted it in my presence to the place where it was taken from; it corresponded nail for nail.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it taken from that part of the Charter house in which Dr. Fisher lives. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Barber. - A. The receiver of the hospital. Mr. Barber's house adjoins Dr. Fisher's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the young man at the bar. - A. Yes, he is a son of a respectable tradesman in the neighbourhood, a plumber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. I believe you know he is a young man of good character. - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this lead jagged at the edges. - A. Yes, as if it had been ripped up from nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any business on the premises. - A.None in the least; there were other workmen. they were slating and tiling; there was no plumbing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had any lead been stolen from the Charter house. - A. Not long before.</p>
               <p>- TRIGGRY. - . Mr. Knapp. You are a slater. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you employed on the 23d of November, about the Charter house, as a slater. - A. Yes, I was employed to slate the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw him upon the roof of Dr. Fisher's house, he was measuring a pane of glass by a sky-light; I saw some lead laying in the gutter very close to him, rolled up; I acquainted the bricklayer's labourer of it; he went down and acquainted Mr. Dixon. When I saw him on the sky light I went into another gutter to get some slate. I was gone away half an hour; when I returned he was gone and the lead. I did not see him go away nor the lead.</p>
               <p>- MARTIN. Q. You are servant to Mr. Barber. - A. Yes, he is the receiver of the Charter house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in the course of that day we have been speaking of, the prisoner applying to you to go through the house and up the trap door. - A. Yes, about half past two on the 23rd of November, he said he wanted to go to the top of Mr. Stewart's house. Dr. Fisher's house is between Mr. Stewart's and Mr. Barber's. I gave him leave; he said he was going to do something upon Mr. Stewart's house, he did not say what; they had lost the key of their trap door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Dixon coming to your house to enquire for the prisoner. - A. Yes; the prisoner was at the top of the house at that time. Mr. Dixon went and could not see the prisoner; Mr. Dixon went up the second time, and then the prisoner came down; I asked the prisoner whether he had seen Mr. Dixon, he said he had not; he had been up stairs about half an hour.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday afternoon the 23rd of November. I was going through Charter house-square, a man asked me if I was going to the Charter house, he said there wanted some repairs at Mr. Stewart's house on the leads, but I could not get out there, there was no trap door at all, and the windows had bars across them. I went to Mr. Barber's through their trap door, I found the lead laying in the gutter, I doubled it together and put it in Mr. Barber's house; I was going home, the young woman said Mr. Dixon had been looking for me, she asked me if I had seen him, I told her no; I waited at the door till I saw Mr. Dixon, then he told me what had happened; he accused me of taking it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the lead (the lead produced); what is the value of the lead that was applied to Dr. Fisher's. - Mr. Banner. There is about fourteen pounds; it is worth about eighteen pence.</p>

               <p>Q. What distance may Mrs. Crouch's be from the prisoner's house. - A. I suppose a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name of Greenway mentioned by the prisoner while you was there. - A. Yes, he said he had received a letter from his brother Jonathan in London, saying that he had seen circular letters from Greenway begging for time; he said it would be impossible for him to go on, that he, Mr. Tucker, must stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about any person being about to look after him there. - A. He looked at the window frequently and pointed out from the window several persons whom he called bailiffs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said by him or you on the subject of an arrest. - A. Not on that day; on the 20th of the same month there was, at Wellington; in Somersett, he sent to me to come to Wellington; when I saw Mr. Tucker at Wellington, I asked him what made him go away in that sort of a way, I told him he was very muck talked of; he then said, that d - nd rascal Hutchins thought to have arrested him in the castle yard. Mr. Winter and myself advised him to go to Honiton, to transfer some collateral securities he had at the house of Messrs Smith, Brookes, and co. which he had in contemplation some time; he replied that he should be liable to be arrested at Honiton. I replied, not if his friends knew he was to be there. We all went to Honiton that evening, they transferred the security; we went to the Golden Lion inn; the security I understood was executed in London.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did the commissioners wait for him. - A. Till two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. That was two hours beyond his time. - A. Yes. He was then proclaimed in the usual form.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue to attend at Guildhall the whole of the day. - A. I continued from half after ten in the forenoon, till past midnight, at Guildhall; if I was absent for five minutes I left Mr. Hindmarsh, clerk of Mr. Savell, there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bankrupt come during the whole of that time. - A. He did not. The proclamation was made at half after two o'clock. The commissioners signed a memorandum of non attendance before they went.</p>
               <p>Q. to Savell. On the evening of the 17th of August did the prisoner come to your house. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In the interval between the 4th of July and the 18th of August, had the prisoner access to his books and papers in the presence of your clerk, and occasionally in your presence. - A. Two or three times.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the name of your clerk. - 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person631">A. James Hegan</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of August the prisoner came to your house. - A. On the evening of the 17th of August, upon my return in the evening, I found the prisoner at my house; he informed me he understood I had received some instructions from the country, and these instructions were to hang him, if possible. I told him I was not aware how he could be in possession of any instructions which I had received, but that I should pursue those instructions I had received, not telling him what they were. He then said he had a family, and he hoped some mercy would be shewn him. I told him to entitle himself to mercy, he must do what was correct. I then asked him for some bills of exchange which he had taken from Hegan, one of my clerks; he said that the bills of exchange were destroyed. I told him I should expect he would bring these bills of exchange to his commissioners on the following day; he said he could not bring the bills, because they were burnt, but that he should attend his commissioners, and endeavour to finish his examination. He went away soon after. I told him if he did not attend he would be proclaimed as a selon, and that he would be liable to suffer death.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke of some bills he had from Hegan, your clerk, had he access to the proceedings. - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present on the 18th of August when the commissioners met. - A. I was, I remained there about half an hour after the commissioners left. I staid till between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. We have been told that the commissioners signed a memorandum of his default. - A. They did, I signed it, I was the subscribing witness; the memorandum was written by my clerk Hegan. On the 19th I went before the lord mayor, I was obliged to take the memorandum in order to obtain the warrant to take the prisoner; I left the memorandum at the lord mayor's for my clerk Hindmarsh to bring it back again when the warrant was granted. I have never seen it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. to Page. Do you remember that summons being signed by the commissioners. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner producing that summons. - A. When he first came up he produced a summons, by virtue of which he attended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the commissioners put an endorsement on the back of that summons. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawes. You saw a paper in the possession of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw it in the usual way, in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Not reading it, you cannot speak accurately to its contents. - A. It certainly was the regular summons, or the commissioners would not have signed it. I have no doubt but it was the original summons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, in point of fact, whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020049"/>or was not. - A. I do not; I saw it on the first meeting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Savell. Do you remember the prisoner bringing his summons or his protection. - A. At one of the meetings I asked the bankrupt whether he had his protection; he said he had it endorsed upon his summons, but what summons it was I do not know, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawes. Have you yourself made any search for the bankrupt's summons. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any search for the warrant on the 18th of 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person638">August. </persName>
            - A. I have. On the bankrupt being taken up I looked in the proceedings, I found that memorandum was gone. I have searched almost every paper in my office, every drawer, and every closet, and I have not been able to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present at the time of the last examination on the 18th of 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person639">August. </persName>
            - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this unfortunate man at the bar. - A. I do, I have known him for many years, his brother married a sister in law of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You are solicitor now under this commission, and solicitor in this prosecution against your relation. - A. I am, if he be a relation at all; if I had known that he had been such a man I would have had nothing to do with it. I do not consider myself any relation.</p>
               <p>Q. I think not by your manner; there was a number of bills of exchange out of the bankrupts. - A. As solicitor to the commission I had bills to the amount of a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds. In my absence from town I understood that the bills were given to him for the purpose of his giving them to me when I came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a number of bills out, did you know of their being forged. - A. I have heard there were forged bills, but I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not an imputation that he had defrauded bills. - A. No, but that he had defrauded the revenue. I have not heard that they were forged bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the clerks was it that you gave the instructions to, that if this man appeared he certainly would be taken up for the forgery. - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that your clerk told this man that if he did appear the officers were waiting, and he would be taken up for forgery. - A. I never heard such a thing until after he was in custody. The prisoner himself, when he was before the magistrate at Bow-street, said he had been advised by one of my clerks to absent himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at Guildhall on the 18th. - A. I did not see him there, I was not there the whole day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not given any directions to your clerks on this subject. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In point of fact had you any order to apprehend him for a forgery. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In conversation with him the night before, had you hinted to him that he would be apprehended for a forgery. - A. I told him he conducted himself very ill. He said, if a man put a knife to his throat, he had a right to take it away. There was a charge against him about the stamps.</p>
               <p>HINRY HINDMARSH. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Savell, the solicitor to the commission. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner on the evening previous to the 18th of 
               <persName id="t18071202-63-person640">August. </persName>
            - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing him on the morning of the 18th. - A. No, I was there with Mr. Savell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the defendant that it was better for him not to appear on the subsequent day. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him there were persons there for the purpose of arresting him if he went there. - A. I did not. On the 18th at Guildhall yard I saw

               <p>Q. I do not understand you what you mean by bills. - A. Bills out, by which a man might get arrested. I did not deny that there were no more bills out; he was told of it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, the prisoner had some reason to believe his conduct would be enquired into respecting some bills. - A. I dare say he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did not you say if he did come, he would be taken up. - A. No. Hegan was in the coach; he said all the way along, if I was to see Mr. Tucker now I would tell him not to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hegan communicate his opinion in your presence that he had better not come. - A. Not in my presence.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 5th of November we were called in upon another service; after we had taken the prisoner and the other people that were in the room to prison, I went back with Mr. Bayliss and found the boots. The prisoner first told me that he picked them up in the street on the morning the fire was; afterwards he told me they were given to him by a man from a window of a house where the fire was.</p>

               <p>PATRICK M'CONNER. He said he brought them from the fire, they were handed to him there to keep for the owner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DALEY. I lodged in the same room. Smith brought the boots in he said he had them from a man in Fleet-street at the time of the fire; he desired that if any body called for them at his lodgings to give them the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the day the fire happened that he brought the boots. - A. No, it was not; he was only five nights there.</p>

Yes; between one and two o-clock I saw the prisoner standing at my father's street door, I saw the prisoner go towards the tap room, he turned back and went into the parlour with something white in his hand not a bundle; in about ten minutes after he came out with a bundle under his arm; I called to my mother instantly, I had heard my mother say that she lost things before; I knew that he did not call for any liquor. He went out. I went to the door and looked after him, he went towards Crown court.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother then went into the parlour to see if any thing was missing. - A. Yes. He was brought back, he had candles in the bundle. I am confident he had no bundle when he came in, only something white in his hand.</p>
               <p>- WARREN. I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 26th of November, about two o'clock, I was going to dinner in Carnaby-street, I met Mr. Cloney he had hold of the prisoner by the collar, he delivered him over to me and charged him with stealing of candles.

               <p>Q. When this charge was made he was removing his goods to a sister-in-law of his. - A. Yes; I assisted him in removing his goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Then of course it cannot allude to this transaction; was it a day or two before he was taken up. - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I kept an eating house in Marybone-lane; through breaking my leg, and upon account of letting the house, I was obliged to move; I moved some of my things to my sister-in-law, among which were some candles; my sister in law lives near Mr. Cloney; and my taking of lodgings I had occasion to take some candles. I had told an acquaintance that I should be at Mr. Cloney's; I went to my sister's, I brought them candles; Mrs. Cloney says they belong to her. They do not belong to her. I went into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020051"/>parlour; finding that my friend was not in the parlour I went into the tap; not being satisfied I went backwards, and finding that he was not in the house, I didnot call for any thing to drink; I went out; I was pursued by these people, who brought me back to the house they insisted upon them candles, I insisted upon not giving them up.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutor. Prior to the candles in question, had you missed any out of the box. - A. Yes, eight days before; him and the other man was in the house on that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the shop at the time this dowlas was taken away. - A. Yes, the dowlas was kept in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken. - A. Yes; about five o'clock the prisoner came with two other boys, and asked for a pair of gloves, one came with him and the other staid at the door; I shewed him some, he said they were too little, and the boy that was with him, called him by his christian name, he said chuse them large enough. There was nobody serving in the shop besides me; the boy that was with him seemed to press to the window where the dowlas was laying; I kept on this side of the counter, in order to guard the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect that they were about something of this kind. - A. I did, when he said choose them large enough; I handed the prisoner another sort of gloves; while I was doing that, the second boy put his hand behind my back, and snatched the cloth from the window; I saw it, I had not power to stop him, he ran immediately off. I detained the prisoner on suspicion of being an accomplice; I cried stop thief, my lodger was in the parlour; he pursued the other, he could not catch him; my cloth was lost, I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped this boy, did he offer to stir from the place. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boy who stood at the door. - A. He ran off with the other. This boy wanted to pay for his gloves and go, he had fixed on a pair; he was searched at the office before the magistrate, he had money enough to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this seventeen yards of dowlas. - A. Twenty five shillings. The prisoner denied knowing the other boy; the other boy calling him by his christian name, that is the reason I detained him. They knocked at the door and all three came in company together to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called him by his christian name, did he seem to be familiar to him. - A. Entirely so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this boy before. - A. I never did; at the office he gave his name

I lost my guinea out of my pocket book, I kept my pocket book in the till of my box; I marked the guinea, as I had missed some guineas before; drilled a hole in the D, on the head side of the guinea; the lock of my box must have been picked, to get the guinea. I found the guinea at Mrs. Chase's.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodges in the house. - A. There were four or five lodgers in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. to Beale. Had you any more lodgers in the house. - A. I had seven or eight. The prisoner came into the house afterwards.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen, from the evidence, it appears the house had seven or eight lodgers, how it got into his possession we cannot say; nobody saw him with a false key open the box; how he got it out of the box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020052"/>has not been proved; there is to be sure suspicion about it; it has been proved to have been in his possession, but you all know how soon money passes from one hand to another.</p>

The prisoner and another woman came into the shop about half after twelve; they had not been in but a few minutes before Mrs. West said, Mr. Hill there is one of them women taking something in your shop; I said which of them, she said the one in black, meaning the prisoner; I then laid hold of her by the shoulder, the cloak was partly in her hand; it appeared to me as if she was putting it in her pocket; she let it fall, I went round to the other side of the counter and picked it up; I turned the other woman out of the shop, and desired her not to come any more, and I was turning the prisoner out but she was so insolent, I was obliged to send for the constable.</p>

            ; on the 19th we went out without any success; on the 20th, we arrived at a place near Weybourne; where we laid in wait till between seven and eight in the evening. I left two officers about a mile and a half from my station. About nine o'clock I heard some carts coming, and I went for the other officers, Cambridge and Gosling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Weybourne is on the sea coast in Norfolk. - A. Yes. I went for Cambridge and Gosling; it was more than half an hour before I came back, it might be near an hour; we followed them to a place called Castenwood-row-house; the carts stopped there, it appeared as if they were shifting their casks from them; when they went from the house, we followed them about the distance of a quarter of a mile from the house, there we come up to them; I suppose there might be ten or a dozen carts, loaded with half anchor tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how many horseman that attended. - A. There might be three or four or more of them, and some of them were on the carts, and some dismounted; there might be a score of footmen; when that were on foot, and on the carts altogether, besides the horseman; we rode on till we come to the foremost cart; Mr. Gosling stopped the first cart and seized the goods, and told the man, that the first person that attempted to rescue them he would shoot them; the man jumped on the cart, told him he might shoot and be d - d.</p>
               <p>Court. The driver of the goods. - A. Yes, the driver of the goods. I stopped at the second cart, the driver he got upon the cart and dared me to fire; we wen immediately round by the horsemen; I suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020053"/>then there might be six, seven, or eight, I do not know exactly; the carts turned round, the horsemen filled up the road to prevent us from following them; we told them we were determined to follow the carts and to seize the goods, or we would fire upon them; they swore a great many oaths and dared us to fire upon them, and said we should not go any further; we broke through their ranks and passed them, and followed the carts, which had taken another road. The horsemen passed us and headed us again; I ordered every man belonging to me to cock his pistol; there were me, two officers, and an assistant, we came up close to them and headed them; they then ordered the footmen to come forward, there might be upwards of a score footmen; they came forward and encouraged the horsemen to unhorse us, we were on horseback; they said we should not have the goods, they knew of us being out, and they were prepared for us; we told them we were determined to have them, or we would fire upon them; they ordered the blunderbus to be brought forward, they told them to put in an additional ball; we advanced; and dared them to fire upon us; then the horsemen began to brandish their weapons over our heads.</p>
               <p>Court. What weapons were these. - A. Large sticks and bludgeons. I pointed my pistol into Abel's breast. Then there was another horseman with a large stick over my arm; I told 
               <persName id="t18071202-70-person699">Abel</persName>
             I should certainly shoot him, and I felt myself justified in doing it, if he would not let me pass. I asked him if there were nobody that wanted him; I knew he had a large family of children; he called me of one side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I will not trouble your lordship any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the defendant. - A. I do not.</p>

             GOSLING. - Mr. Gleed. You are an officer of the excise. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 20th of October were you out with the last witness. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information you received from him you followed the smugglers with the carts A. I did; at the time we came up to them I suppose it might be between ten and eleven; it was a bright moon light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon coming up to the carts how did you dispose of yourselves. - A. I was on horseback; Alsbrook and I went first; the other two were behind; how near I cannot say; I stopped the foremost cart.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were passing along to the foremost cart, was there any person that you paid particular attention on. - A. Yes, the prisoner at the bar; I observed him, he was upon my left hand, the moon reflected upon his face, I had a full opportunity of seeing his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Having that opportunity of seeing his face, have you the least doubt of his person. - A. I have not the least doubt; he called out as we rode past; the words I have many times endeavoured to recollect what they were.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the substance of the words. - A.Hallon, how are you, gentlemen, good night; it was that, or similar to it; his standing up in the cart first attracted my attention; before he spoke I did not observe any one standing up in the carts but him, and the moon shone upon his face. I am sure of his person, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time had elapsed before you saw him again. - A. I cannot say; I took many opportunities to endeavour to see him; I went down to Hedgfield for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did this transaction of you and the smugglers take place before you were obliged to abandon the carts. - A. About an hour. In the course of that hour I do not recollect seeing him again. I had an opportunity of seeing some of the footmen, that I should know again; after the horsemen headed us again, I cannot say I was in any fear, though I considered myself in danger. They prevented us from seeing of the footmen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Some time after this you went to the house of the defendant. - A. I did, he lives at a village called Hedgfield, he keeps a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the spot where this took place. - A. I never went back from that road; I believe from the observations that I made on the map to be seven or eight miles.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information you went to the defendant's house at Hedgfield. - A. Yes, I saw him; I cannot recollect what month it was in. I had been down several times for that purpose before I saw him, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now come to the time when you did see him. - A. The time I am not positive, I made no memorandum. I went into the public house; as soon as I got there that time I saw the defendant in his house; Mr. Alsbrook was with me. Upon my seeing him I knew that he was the man that I saw upon the cart; I have not the least doubt but that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Subsequent to this did you ever go to the same place with a warrant on purpose to apprehend this man. A. Once, Mr. Alsbrook and Mr. Tubby was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Hedgfield did you see him any where. - A. I saw him at work at a muck cart, on a piece of ground, it comes up to his yard, about twenty yards from his house; I saw him, I was in a one horse chaise with the supervisor; Mr. Alsbrook was on horseback, he rode in the piece, and rode till he came pretty near to the defendant; then the defendant ran through the hedge, leaving the cart and horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake him. - A. No, Mr. Alsbrook ran after him, he did not bring him back at that time; the defendant escaped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mr. Gosling, you tell me you cannot say what time it was you went to the defendant's house and saw him, was it spring or autumn. - A. It was summer.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you can tell me whether it was the middle of summer or the latter end of the summer. - A. I cannot speak to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether it was six months after the transaction or one. - A. I suppose it to be more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you come to give evidence upon supposing, I can give evidence upon supposing as well as you. - A. It was a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to apprehend him. - A. I do not recollect, that was after Upcraft was taken; Upcraft was taken in October; to the best of my recollection I believe it was a few days before we were ordered upon Upcraft's trial.</p>
               <p>Q. The indictment of Upcraft was preferred in September, the trial was in October, you speak of this being a bright moon shiny night. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The moon was in the first quarter. - A. I looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020054"/>in the almanack; the moon was about nine days old.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The moon was in the first quarter. I sent out for the almanack for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. How long after this transaction of your being obstructed in seizing these carts, did you see this man in his house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It was in the summer; he cannot remember the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. This transaction was in October preceding.</p>
               <p>Court. How many carts were there. - A. I cannot tell the number, they were all loaded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. to Alsbrook. At the time you went into the field after Wiseman, did you tell him the cause of your coming after him. - A. I could not without holloa- it out loud.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went away without your explaining the cause of your coming after him. - A, He knew before.</p>
               <p>Q.When Wiseman made his escape did you tell him any thing. - A. I did not; he had told me he would give himself up whenever I came for him; he told me he was at an auction that night; I saw him alone, when he told me that he came to me in the summer some time before.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of October do you remember being at any sale. - A. Yes, it was about a mile and a half from the prisoner's house; the sale began pretty nigh twelve o'clock. It might be over about five or six; I went to Wiseman's house in the evening, somewhere pretty nigh eight; I was there three hours, I staid there till between eleven and twelve, to the best of my recollection; Wiseman was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out any part of that evening while you was there. - A. Not half an hour; I do not think he was for three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason was it you went to his house and staid so long. - A. A young man of the name of Bishop told me he would meet me there; he did not meet me, and that was the reason I staid so long.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the man's name of which the sale was. A.Brettingham; here is one of the bills, I got it from the Three Horse-shoes, Bristom, it was stuck up in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this to be one of the original bills. - A. Yes. I should not be so confident of the day if it was not for the date on the bill. If it was not for this bill I would not attempt to say when the day was at all (The bill read.) To he sold by auction on Monday the 20th of October.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. When was it any body told you it was necessary for you to remember your being at Mr. Wiseman's house on this day. - A. I went into Wiseman's house, I go there sometimes; I went out of door to see whether the waggon was there, Wiseman followed me; he says do you remember being at my house on the 20th of October, I said I do not; he said you recollect coming from Brettingham's sale, he told me many things that I might not recollect wrong; he told me he was sworn against wrong; I said do not ask me any more questions, I am not able to make you an answer now. On the next day I was thinking about it, I recollected seeing this hand bill on the settle, I went in and had a glass of ale, I saw the sale was on the 20th of October; I afterwards sent word to Wiseman there was such a bill stuck up, and he was right; Wiseman sent a man for me. I took the bill down from the board last Sunday sennight.</p>
