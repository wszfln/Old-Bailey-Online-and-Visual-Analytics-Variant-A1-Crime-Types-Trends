I took it to Mr. Lee, a currier, and the prisoner remained in the shop; I got change there, and gave the prisoner the difference; I think it was twelve pounds odd shillings; I asked him where I should send the shoes; he said, he would send word by the gentleman who was with him, of the name of John Nabbs, whom I knew to be a Manchester gentleman, a friend of mine having empowered me to settle a debt of three hundred pounds with him, and seeing the prisoner with him, I did not inquire about him; when I had given the change, they went away; the shoes lay in my shop for some days, when he sent a written direction by this gentleman to send the shoes to the Angel Inn, Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand, to be left at the bar for Mr. John-Webb Elkington. I did not send them for two days after, and, in the mean time, he sent a porter for them, who took them away, but brought them back on Saturday, and said, he had taken the shoes to the Black-Dog, Mile-End-turnpike, but the landlord would not pay him; I thanked him, and paid him; the prisoner, in about two days after, called; and said, he was very sorry I had the trouble, but he would pay all the expence of carriage, which he did, and took the shoes; this was about seven days after his first purchasing them. On the 10th of September, he came to me a second time to purchase the same quantity of shoes for one Captain 
               <persName id="t18011202-1-person52">Williams</persName>
            , a relation of his, who was going to America; they were to be at the Dundee Arms by twelve o'clock; he presented a bill for fifteen pounds; I said, I had no change; he said, he was going to an acquaintance where he could get cash for the note, and he would call and pay me in cash; he went away, and came again about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; he said, he was disappointed, as his friend was out, and had I not got so much change in the house; I said, I had not; he went away, and called a third time, about seven o'clock; I told him, if he would leave the bill, I would get the cash, but I could not do it sooner than the morning. O surely, says he, you are very welcome, and he indorsed it immediately in his own name; he called upon me about eight o'clock the next morning; I said, I had not got the change, but to call a little after nine; he called at ten, when I was out; I went into the City to inquire about the bill, and found it was a bad one; he called again at eleven, and I asked him how he could be so cruel as to come to me a second time with a bad bill; he said, a bad bill! that cannot be, I am not afraid of it, I am certain it is good, and I will make it good to you; I told him, I hoped he would do so; the second parcel of shoes were in the shop; he wrote a note to some friend of his in Rosemary-lane, a Mr. Postlethwaite, at Mr. Beaumont's, but he never came; the prisoner was taken into custody on the 11th, and on the 18th he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When this man first came to your shop, he came with Mr. Nabbs, whom you knew? - A. Yes, or I should not have given him credit.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon all the inquiry you made afterwards, did you not discover the account he gave of himself was true? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020004"/>Q. Did he not tell you he had the bill from a person of the name of Carter? - A. He said, a man owed him near fifty pounds, but I cannot recollect the name; I did not see any body but the prisoner and Mr. Nabbs.</p>
               <p>Mr. JOHN HORNIDGE sworn. - I am clerk to Esdaile and Co. (Looks at the bill.) This is not the acceptance of Esdaile and Co. I accept alone for that house; the partners accept, but no clerk but myself; I write only John Hornidge; the partners accept for Esdaile and Co. This is not their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know whether the partners have or not given authority to some other person to accept as well as yourself? - A. I never understood they had; none of the partners are here.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill is indorsed in his own name? - A. Yes.(The bill read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I received those bills at Birmingham of one Carter, who is a carpenter and joiner; I don't know his Christian name; he owed me a little money when I was with my father, in October last, but I cannot say justly the sum; he gave me those bills for that money, and I advanced eight guineas on them; when I came to London, I took one of them to Mr. Williams. who is a distant relation of mine, and he wanted three dozen of shoes to take to Africa with him; that he said he should not received any money till he got into the Downs, and could not pay for them; I told him I would advance it till them, which I did; he wanted some stop things, which I also ordered for him but, when I found the bills were not good, I ordered the shoes back again; the stop things I never had.</p>

Hopkins and Gray, in Change-alley; I said, he was stranger to me and I to him, but that it was customary, when people looked out goods, if they did not pay for them, to leave some deposit, and asked him if he would leave me a guinea; he said, he had no objection, and felt in his pocket, but said he had not got any small change; and at last concluded that he would leave me this bill, which he did, and I took care of it form that time to this; he was to call again, but I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020005"/>him till about ten days after at Bow-street, when I was bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What business do you carry on? - A. A slopseller.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the goods come to? -

            This is not-the bill? - A. Yes, it is; he gave me a bill, which I returned, and he put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that he took out the second time is the same bill which he took out at first, you cannot undertake to say? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. When he produced a bill the second time, that he deposited with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he left that with you for the purpose of enquiring as to the validity of it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him any thing for it? - A. No; he said he would leave it with me while he went and got change.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did he shew you this bill the first time? - A. To the best of my knowledge, but I cannot say; it was addressed to Sir James Esdaile that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark any thing on it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whether the bill you saw the first time was of the same amount as the second? - A. I believe it was, but I cannot take upon myself to swear it; I understood it to be the same.</p>

            Suppose you accept a bill by mistake, are you not liable, and would it not fall on yourself instead of the house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MINCHIN sworn. - I know a person of the name of John Ruggles, at No.9, Downing-street; he calls himself an army-agent or broker; I was a sort of porter, who opened the door and took messages; the prisoner was at the house several times; he used to come for money that Ruggles owed him, as I understood. (The bill shewn him,) This is the same bill I saw at Hatton-garden; the prisoner brought it to Mr. Ruggles for acceptance; he at first objected to accept it, saying, he had no correspondence at Manchester; the prisoner said, he was a very good man, a respectable man, a responsible man, at Manchester; and, at last, Mr. Ruggles accepted it; I verify believe it to be his writing; this must be about May or June; Mr. Ruggles has lodgings at South-Lambeth; Downing-street was the Agency-Office. Agency-Office was on the brass plate on the door; only the lower part of the house was furnished; there were some officers came at first to buy and sell; Mr. Ruggles continued there till the bills became due, and then he kept away from the house, and got another person to come there in his stead, of the name of Kelly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you first went there, there was some agency business? - A. Yes, there were some officers who called; there was a person employed there as clerk, I don't know his name; there were two rooms, an antichamber and office; the bill was accepted in the office; I opened the door as porter, but was sometimes called into the office; I will swear, upon my oath, I was in the office when the bill was brought in for acceptance; I was not in when it was accepted, but it is his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Is there always a loss in remelting? - A. A trifling loss; but it is impossible to say what.</p>

            Is an ingot of gold of nine ounces four pennyweights, the same ingot? - A. It may be the same gold, making an allowance for melting; there is nothing in the look of gold by which I can tell whether it has been melted once or twice, or five hundred times.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-6-person105">Q. </persName>
            Is there any thing by the view of this ingot which the prisoner brought to you, from which you could tell it had ever been of nine ounces nine pennyweights? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-6-person106">Q. </persName>
            Half a grain would make a difference between two ingots? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person107">A. </persName>
            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell by this, that it was ever melted from any other ingot? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is nothing by which you can contradict the account that it had been melted from buckles, rings, and other gold? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will gold alter in its quality by repeated melting? - A. Yes, get better.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know what was the thickness of this ingot the prisoner brought to you? - A. I don't know; I have it here. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. That which was lost from Mr. Aldridge's was about the eighth of an inch thick - therefore there is no similarity between that lost by Mr. Aldridge and this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing in the appearance of this by which you can ascertain that it was ever an ingot of a greater size? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he came, the bill of Mr. Aldridge's loss lay on the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mr. Aldridge's flatting-mills from your house? - A. Next door but one.</p>
               <p>Q. He wanted twenty pounds? - A. Yes, but he asked for twenty pounds before he saw the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. He left the gold with you after seeing the bill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had full notice of the robbery, and it was the subject of conversation? - A. Yes, the bills were laying there.</p>
               <p>Q. It was advertised with a reward, and still he left it with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-6-person108">Q. </persName>
            Did he call, agreeably to his appointment, next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the same week before this transaction paid him for some metal? - A. Yes, for some silver, and that was the only time I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was very lame, was not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And not likely to whip off with a thing in a minute? - A. No; he sent his son, but I refused to settle with him, and said the prisoner must come himself, which he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person109">Q. </persName>
            (To Richards.) Supposing the gold to be remelted, what, in your opinion, would be the deficiency arising from it? - A. I should think it very well melted if it was not more than three pennyweights, or should I be dissatisfied if it had been five pennyweights.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say, from any belief you have, whether it is or not the same gold you lost? - A. I am satisfied it is the same gold, from the quantity and quality, which I made known to Mr. Aldridge prior to the assay being made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at that ingot, and answer upon your oath - will you swear that has been melted more than once? - A. I think I may say it has; because gold, in its pure state, must be melted more than once to be of this quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear it has been melted from one ingot into another? - A. I may venture to swear it is the same ingot.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear it has been melted from one ingot into another? - A. Certainly not; no man can.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot swear this was ever your ingot? - A. I certainly cannot, but I verify believe it is; it is impossible to swear it was another ingot.</p>
               <p>Q. The ingot you lost was about the eighth of an inch thick? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person110">A. </persName>
            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Your ingot, if ever it was melted again, might have been either nine ounces three pennyweights or three ounces five pennyweights, might it not? - A. We could not tell to a pennyweight what it would turn out.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-6-person111">Q. </persName>
            Therefore your ingot, if ever it was lost from Mr. Aldridge's, might be of the weight of nine ounces three pennyweights, four pennyweights, five pennyweights, or any other? - A. I should have thought it might be very slovenly melted at nine ounces three pennyweights.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, might not your ingot, if ever it was remelted, have been only nine ounces three pennyweights? - A. I can only say it would be slovenly melted if it was no more; they might lose half of it by carelessness; I should think it a great deficiency; if I had melted it myself, I should have expected it to have been nine ounces five pennyweights, or six pennyweights.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-6-person112">Q. </persName>
            Even then you, with the greatest care, might remelt it at nine ounces five pennyweights, or six pennyweights? - A. Just so; more or less might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020009"/>adhere to the melting-pot; I should have thought it a great deficiency if it was less, and should have been dissatisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Even your ingot in re-melting might have varied a penny-weight if it was done by a skilful man? - A. It certainly might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you swear it is your ingot? - A. I do not swear from the quantity but the quality: I think that five thousand quantities of gold might have been made that would not turn out that precise quality.</p>
               <p>Q. But in your re-melting it might vary a pennyweight? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person113">A. </persName>
            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose I gave you two bars of gold of 90z. 9 pennyweights each, one might come out 90z. 5 and the other 90z. 6 pennyweights? - A. They might, but I should find it in the ingot; I admit they might vary, but I say I should find it within a very few grains.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-6-person114">Q. A. </persName>
            few grains make the difference between two different ingots? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person115">A. </persName>
            Certainly; but I do not admit that one ingot put into the pot lighter than another would turn out the lightest, for it might turn out the heaviest; what is lost in the ingot may be in the pot.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to tell what will be the precise weight? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person116">A. </persName>
            Certainly it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not speak to the ingot by the quantity but by the quality? - A. By the quality.</p>
               <p>(To Mr. Aldridge.) Q. From the quality stated, as a person conversant with gold, can you form any believe as to that being the gold stolen? - A. I cannot have a doubt in my own mind, though the shape is altered, that it is Mr. Richard's gold, from the quality of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were informed of the quality of it before this was assayed? - A. Yes, and it turned out the same in quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did the quantity turn out the same? - A. No, it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how many times that has been melted? - A. It may have been melted many times.</p>
               <p>Q. And from buckles and rings? - A. No, it is not of that quality, it is almost impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it impossible? - A. It is not impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. From a variety of gold, some of one alloy and some of another, may it not produce that? - A. I am sure any body who knows any thing of metal would not have an idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body say that this has been in the shape of an ingot one-eighth of an inch thick, skilled or not? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person117">A. </persName>
            Surely not; I cannot by looking at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you by quality or weight ascertain that has ever been an ingot of one eighth of an inch thick? - A. Certainly not; to say that upon oath is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. In melting the same ingot might it not produce, under different melters, different weights? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ROBERT ALBION COX, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person118">Q. </persName>
            Speaking as a man conversant with the quality and nature of gold, is a person able to speak from resemblance to the quality of gold? - A. To quality I think he is, but with regard to the shape, I don't see how it can be identified.</p>
               <p>Q. In re-melting a piece of gold, weighing nine ounces nine penny-weights, how many pennyweights would it lose? - A. I should conceive from two to three penny-weights; the melting may vary from the different heat you give it, and some of the grains may remain in the crucible.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. There is nothing about this from which you can say it ever was an eighth of an inch thick? - A. Certainly not; it may have been in a hundred shapes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-6-person119">Q. </persName>
            Or can you say whether it is the produce of buckles or rings mixed with other gold? - A. It is impossible to say; if I had seen the gold before, I could tell tolerably well.</p>
               <p>Q. An ingot of nine ounces nine penny-weights, might, by one melter, produce nine ounces seven penny-weights; and, by another, only nine ounces five penny-weights? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ALDRIDGE, Jun. sworn. - On Thursday, the 12th of November, I received an ingot of gold from Mr. Richards's servant, flatted it in the mill, and delivered it back.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of the City; I searched the prisoner's house, in Plumbtree-court, Shoe-lane, on the 14th, and found some crucibles, charcoal, a ladle, in which both gold and silver had been melted, and some dross of silver in a tea-chest; the prisoner's name is Flint, I never knew him by the name of Lee.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. 
               <persName id="t18011202-6-person121">Q. </persName>
            (To Mr. Richards.) Are those the sort of things used in melting? - A. Yes, I use them myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Aldridge. There is the appearance of nothing but lead in the ladle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a goldsmith and jeweller by trade, and in the course of my business buy and exchange old gold and silver; the gold now produced I melted myself; I received it from a gentleman at Portsmouth, with one hundred and fifty-one ounces of silver, which I melted the day before I left it at Mrs. Cowie's, and for which she gave me thirty-five pounds, and paid me the remainder the next day; on the Friday following, I left nine ounces four penny-weights of gold with Mr. Clayton, to be assayed, and the next day I sent my boy for the money; on which Mr. Clayton said, he had better send his master; in about an hour after, I called myself, and, when I went, they took the liberty of saying it was the gold that was lost;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020010"/>it is very unlikely that I should go to the next door to sell gold I had stolen; you may be assured, I received it it in a fair way; when Mr. Aldridge was before the Lord-Mayor, he swore that gold had been melted in the ladle, though no such thing could be done; if you attempted to melt nine ounces five penny-weights in a ladle, you would lose three parts. I hope, Gentlemen, you will take my case into consideration, as I am not guilty.</p>

             BLAQUIRE sworn. - The prisoner has lived with me six or eight years; for some little time past I have missed money and linen, but I certainly had no suspicion of him at first; I have been pretty correct in my family accounts and money matters, and have been long in the habit, when I have had money from the bankers, of putting it into a box or drawer; very lately I had occasion to suspect I was robbed; I missed, among other things, some trisling articles of linen, particularly within this week or ten days, a parcel of neck-cloths, which could not be taken without something like infatuation on the part of the prisoner, for there were twelve brought home only within the week, and he took eleven; I missed also some Bank notes which I had marked; having this suspicion and missing them, on the Wednesday morning I went to the Magistrates, who sent an officer to apprehend the prisoner: I think it proper to say, that though I did not think myself at liberty to pardon this man, yet till this happened I have found him one of the most honest and most diligent I ever knew in my life; during our troubles in Ireland, and the discussion of the Union, I am sure my property and my life have been in his power, and I believe I owe it to him that I enjoy my life.</p>
               <p> - HAMILTON sworn. - I belong to Marlborough-street office, and apprehended the prisoner; I searched him and found a one pound note and a key of his trunk, which I took to the office, and in it were three notes and the other articles mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner voluntarily selected these and a variety of other valuable articles belonging to his Lordship, saying he had stolen them from his Lordship, and wished they might be returned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say but that I am extremely sorry I have been guilty of such behaviour to so worthy and so good a master.</p>

I had ten shillings in the morning, and in the evening I had two guineas; I had a guinea and a half in gold, and a seven-shilling piece, which I changed; I cannot say what the reckoning came to, we had a good deal to drink, but I was quite sober; I paid half-a-crown where I slept after, for I had half-a-crown and some halfpence left; I had sold my watch, made me have the money; I had bought a pair of second-hand shoes out of it, but never said I had bought two pair of new shoes; I know Mr. Anthony, but I never said to him that I had no more than two shillings in my pocket, and was angry because I accused him of robbing me, but I had done it for the reward; I never said so to any body.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you came up, the prosecutor was on his knees? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he jumped on his loins; I should think he might jump upon his legs very well, but not his loins? - A.

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prosecutor about the robbery? - A. Yes; he said he was to have board and lodging from the watchman till the trial came on, if he would prosecute the prisoner; the prosecutor came with James Naill to my house to look for a lodging; they were both much in liquor; Smith wanted to go out again, Naill advised him not, and said, he wanted to go among the girls, but that he himself wanted to go to bed.</p>
               <p>JAMES HENRY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a sailor; I had some conversation with the prosecutor; he told me he had pledged his watch in the morning for a guinea and a half; he said he had lent the boatswain of the ship that he came over in half a guinea, and bought two pair of shoes; he paid the reckoning 1s. 6d. for which he changed half a guinea in my company.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a half-guinea? - A. Yes; he had a seven-shilling-piece in change; the boatswain asked him to lend him half-a-guinea more; he said, no, I lent you two shillings, I have nine shillings left, and you may have that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see your servant again? - A. No; they took me to Bow-street; but at last I found her in Durham gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any of the articles stolen? - A. Only a watch I found in Durham.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY STAFFORD: sworn. - I am a constable at Sunderland, in the county of Durham, and took the prisoner up on the 3d of October; I searched her but found nothing, on her; I asked her if there was any thing at the house where I took her; she said there was a watch belonging to her, and directed me to go to a person in the kitchen for it; I examined her, but she denied, she had it; I then took the prisoner over to my own house, and about one o'clock in the morning the person I had examined brought the watch to me, but I would not take it; she delivered it to one of the overseers, at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch when the woman brought it to your house, though you declined receiving it? - A. I did; I went to the Magistrate, and told him where the watch was; he told me to demand it, which I did, and got it; this is the watch. (Produces it).</p>

I then unbuttoned his close coat, put my hand behind his back, and pulled my coat out.(The coat produced.) I took him into the room to the others; they were all Irish, and began to talk in the Irish language, which I said was not behaving like gentlemen; he struggled very much to get away, till I called assistance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifford. Q. Did you serve them with any thing? - A. Half a pint of gin; there were no other people in the room but them; I know one of them to be a master tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some dispute about a five-pound note? - A. He sent his friend to get change while he stole the coat, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got his change back when he took the coat? - A. He had the change, but he said he had not the four one-pound notes; he found a half-guinea, silver, and halfpence, and then he said he had given the notes to his friend; I gave the change to his friend, and did not know it was the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>MARTIN BREUNAGIS sworn. - I lodge with Mr. Trott: On the 15th of November, I saw the prisoner come to the house with some others; I met the prisoner in the passage; he said, holloa! to me, as he passed me; I saw the steeve of a coat hang down behind; I went to Mr. Trott, and asked him if he had lost a coat; when he looked, he said he had, and went backwards to see where the man was; he met him, and took the coat from him; the prisoner said, he thought it was like a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020017"/>coat he lost some time before, and he took it to look at it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Is it likely I would go away with that or any other coat not worth over three shillings, and leave my 5l. note in his hands; I had lost a coat some time before that, and I took that coat to look at; he met me, and asked me whether it was not his coat; I said, I had taken it to look at, but it was not mine.</p>

            , who was an entire stranger to me, at the door, which he opened, and put in the piece of carpet; Mr. Corney, who was also a stranger to me, followed him; my mother, being very deaf, did not hear what he said; he asked me to give him the piece of carpet which lay on the floor; I did so; my mother never saw him till such time as he was going out with the carpet; when he was going out, he said, John, I have long had a suspicion of you, and now I have found you; then he turned round to me, and said, you, madam, shall be looked into; I made answer, that I never knew the man, or had any dealings with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How old are you? - A. Near eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you left boarding-school? - A. I have not been there since eleven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father and mother keep an old iron shop? - A. They deal in brokery and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is a stranger to you? - A. Yes, and to my mother, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a frequent thing for persons to come in to the parlour without knocking? - A. People very frequently come in when I am in the next room, because my mother is deaf; I was scouring the room, and did not hear; not seeing any body come to him, I suppose he opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that frequently happen? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect the oath you have taken, and tell us, how the carpet came on the floor? - A. The man put it there, it never was on the counter; he had it in his hand in a roll when I got up, then he laid it on the floor, it was not open at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear it never was open while in your room? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any table? - A. There was a table at the lower end of the room, and another under a sash window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stoop, or throw it down? - A. He threw it down, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way goods are usually thrown into that room - you know the business of the shop? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask what he wanted? - A. The man had no time to speak, because Mr. Corney followed him in immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see your mother, when Mr. Corney came in, lay hold of the carpet, and throw it down? - A. No, Mr. Corney has made a mistake; it was me who gave him the piece of carpet off the floor, my mother was at the other end of the room, washing the tea-things.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is a mistake if any body has said it was thrown off a table? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did? - A. Nobody that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Corney could not see the man throw it down? - The man threw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it is a mistake that he said to his man, I have caught you? - A. He did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that when he came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say just now, it was not till after you delivered the carpet? - A. That was when he was going out; he said, John, I have had a long suspicion, and now I have found you out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home when the officers took your mother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Justice all this? - A. I never was at the Justice's; the officers said, she was wanted at Marlborough-street, to speak whether the man said any thing when he came in or not, and she went.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew your mother was going to the office, and you could have told all this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much carpeting had you in the house at this time? - A. We had none but some old pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you assisted your father and mother in the shop? - A. I am not always at home, and am not very fond of the business; I have been to a day school part of the time; I served sometimes, but very seldom.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. I cannot tell; I went out to learn the business of making straw bonnets for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020019"/>two or three months, and I have been at work in Wardour-street, and have been at an aunt's in the Borough.</p>

He said he had received this and several other sums and had gambled it away, but as soon as he had received his bounty, as he had enlisted as an East India soldier, he would pay me; I have found upwards of nine pounds deficient.</p>

R. on it, as the name of the person who served us with beech; I ran to the shop and asked whether any had been sold; I found there had not, I ran back, and before I got to the place where it stood I saw the prisoner take it on his shoulder; I asked him where he was going with it; he said he was going to take it home, and he found it in the street; I asked him where; he said in a street by Mount Pleasant; I am positive it was our plank, because we had several out of the same tree, and it is an inch and quarter plank, which we gave a particular order for, and I rather suppose there is no such thing in London beside.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Broad Sanctuary, Westminster; I have eighteen silver handled knives and forks; the prisoner pawned some of them with me; I don't know that I had seen her before; she said they were her own property, and I advanced thirteen and six-pence on the whole.</p>
               <p>(The property was identified by Mrs. Dougan.</p>
               <p>JAMES-BRAZIER LE GRANGE sworn. - I went to Mr. Cheraneau's, and found the knives and forks wrapped up in four different parcels; the wrapper struck me to be very like a gown I had seen the prisoner wear; here is a piece the same as the wrapper; I immediately knew the plate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Beside examining the prisoner's pocket, did you examine the bag into which the filings had been put? - A. Not particularly, but I took out the cuttings of the coffee-pot; I took out all he had left; he could not have filed any large quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you did not put that in the pocket and that in the bag into the scale together? - A. The silver in the bag would not come off the pot in that stage of it; there were no scrapings came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner worked at home you cannot speak to? - A. He had no tools.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy deliver these things? - A. I did not; but it was impossible he could take any out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Aldus. When they were before the Magistrate, Ward said the other woman had nothing to do with stealing the watch; and she was to give her a pair of shoes for helping to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Murphy's defence. This young woman, about half past eight, met me, and asked me where I used to pawn, as she had got a watch, and would give me a pair of shoes if I would pawn it for her, as she was not known; I always used Mr. Aldus's shop, and took it to him.</p>
               <p>Ward's defence. I wish to say that this woman knows nothing of the watch; I will take it all upon myself; I had the gown and apron on me, and I gave the watch to her to pledge; she knew nothing of it,</p>

            Look at that box, do you know it? - A. I think I have seen this box before; I am positive I have; it was about the middle of last January; when I was sitting in the Blue Boar, in Rosemary-lane, a stranger came into the room with this box; first he came up to me, and looked at several articles I had got to sell, but nothing would suit him; he went from me to the next box, where the prisoner set with his clothes; he looked at several articles, and at last had a waistcoat, which Wolfe valued at five shillings and six-pence, and he paid him down six shillings and six-pence besides; they valued the box at twelve shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a man was he? - A. A man about half a head taller than I, or thereabouts; I cannot justly recollect, it is so long ago; he might be five feet four or five inches.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dress? - A. I declare I cannot recollect; there are so many people coming backwards and forwards, it is impossible to recollect every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the colour of his clothes? - A. I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. This man went to the other box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be attending to the other box? - A. As he left me I had nobody standing with me; I did not follow him, I only looked round to see whether they dealt or no.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it? - A. About half past two o'clock, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there beside you and those two? - A. I suppose there might be a dozen people, and strangers; I don't know any body in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know one of them by name? - A. I don't recollect just now any one. (The Court had ordered the other witnesses out of Court.) I have seen the man out of Court, but have no acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was there? - A. Yes, I saw him.</p>

            , Jun.; the prisoner came to their shop on the 29th of October, about six o'clock, to buy an eighth same of an Irish lottery ticket; I shewed her some, and after chusing one, she presented me a 20l. note for payment, (the note produced); this is the note she presented; it appears to be a Guildford bank-note, there is no stamp on it; upon taking it into my hand, I thought it was not regularly signed, from it being signed Sparkers and Co. by only one of the partners.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the signature of the Guildford bank-notes, and did that give you suspicion? - A. Not particularly that, but it is quite irregular to sign notes so; I did not say any thing to her, but shewed it to Mr. Alder, and said, I should take it over to Messrs. Esdailes' the bankers, to inquire whether it was good; I said that in the presence of Mrs. Solomons; she said, very anxiously, she would not trouble us to take it over, for she had got a smaller note, which would do as well, and she seemed to wish to have that back; I went over to the banker's, and shewed it to one of the clerks, who immediately discovered it to be a forgery; I went back and asked her where she lived; she said in Houndsditch, and kept a shop; I asked where she took the note; she said it was impossible to tell, as she had dealings at different parts of the country; after that I asked her again if she could possibly tell, and, after some hesitation, she said, she had taken it of a man whom she had sold some cloth to; Mr. Messenger came over, and put the same questions to her, and she returned the same answers she had done to me; I gave the note to Mr. Alder; he went over to Esdailes' house, and she went with them.</p>

Yes; when I went over I saw Mrs. Solomons, and asked her if she had given a consideration for the note; she said she had; I asked her what; she said she had given two pieces of Irish linen and the difference in money; I asked her if she knew to whom; she said no, that in the course of her dealings she often sold goods to people she knew nothing of; I told her I was sorry to inform her it was a forgery, and asked her where she lived; she said in Houndsidtch; I told her I must trouble her to go over to Sir

               <persName id="t18011202-29-person314">Q. </persName>
            Where do you live? - A. At No. 9, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; I attended before the Grand Jury on this indictment. (The note shewn to the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. You know it is said the prisoner had that note from you - was it ever in your possession shortly before the 29th of October last? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it in your possession? - A. From the 26th to the 28th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. I have no right to ask you whether you offered that note to the prisoner; but I ask you did you not purchase two pieces of cloth of her? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It went out of your hands on the 28th of October? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I buy clothes, and keep a little shop, and have near seven years.</p>

                  <persName id="t18011202-29-person315">Q. </persName>
            Has any misfortune happened to you in that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me, within half a dozen, how many times you have been in custody in the course of that time? - A. It is a question I don't think proper to answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any objection to tell how many times you have had the good fortune to be admitted King's evidence? - A. I believe I can recollect once.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you say you cannot recollect more than once? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not like to tell me how many times you have been in custody charged with felony of different sorts? - A. No, I don't think proper.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the prisoner being taken to the Mansion-house, I believe you were lent for before the Lord-Mayor? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you had been brought before the Lord-Mayor at first, that you found yourself at liberty? - A. The Wednesday following, as I was taken on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the subject of this very note? - A. Upon this note, and another one.</p>
               <p>Q. You then contrived to get you yourself at liberty, and get the prisoner committed? - A. I did not contrive it, because the late Lord-Mayor saw my life, by a conspiracy, was to be sworn away, and admitted me to bail.</p>

            May I take the liberty of asking where you got that note? - A. Yes, of a young man, who calls himself Flinc.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same Mr. Flint who was tried here the other evening? - A. No, a son of his; he calls himself so.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Flint, of Shoe-lane? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That young man has absconded since? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, that man came to me, and bought two pieces of Irish, and gave me the note; I did not think any thing of the note being bad; I did not know his character at that time, or else I would not have taken it; but, since that, I have heard a very bad character, and am very sorry that ever I took the note of a person of that description; I am innocent, and it is that only which supports me to speak; I sold him two pieces of Irish linen, of twenty-five yards each, at three shillings and two-pence per yard; and I gave him a ten-pound note, a two-pound note, to the best of my recollection, and, I believe, one shilling and eight pence, or one shilling and four pence, I will not be sure which.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t18011202-29-verdict149" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing? - A. Yes, my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there another with him? - A. Yes.</p>

            Who took the watch? - A. The other; this man held me; the other took the watch, and away he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stop you from going after him? - A. Yes, and then they both ran away; I went into the public-house again about ten minutes after he had robbed me, and found him at the bar of the White-Lion, St. Catherine's-lane; I am sure he is the same man; I have never seen the other man, or the watch again; the young man with me said he was the same man, and he was taken into custody; mine was a silver watch and chain; I felt it go out of my pocket; I had seen it but a few minutes before in the public-house; I had got but two or three yards from the door before they came up to me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020027"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Do you mean to swear, that, during all the day, you had no liquor except this glass of rum? - A. In the morning I had a glass, a pint of beer to my dinner, and, at seven o'clock, another glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you had with your girls? - A. I had no girls; I saw some to be sure; there were plenty in the house, in another room; we were in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not near any of the girls? - A. Yes, I do; I had nothing to do with them; they were in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. This was very dark? - A. It was dark, but I could see the men very well; there was a light through the window and door; it was before the door was shut; I could see that man as plainly as I see any body here; I don't know the other; this man laid hold of me, and the other pulled the watch away.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a foreigner, and perhaps your English friend told you about a reward? - A. Nobody told me about any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never heard of forty pounds reward? - A. Never before now; nobody told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, if you could get a sum of money, you would swear against no man? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-34-person337">A. </persName>
            I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Flying-Horse public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say so there? - A. No; the prisoner's father said, he would pay for the watch, and all expences, and offered me ten pounds; and he paid me ten pounds down, which I gave to Mr. Griffiths, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What else have you got? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-34-person338">A. </persName>
            Nothing else; there were some notes, some guineas, and some half-guineas; I believe I gave the officer six-pence more than I got from his father.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER FIELD sworn. - I am a sailor, and belong to the same ship with the last witness; I was with him when he was robbed in St. Catherine's-lane; we were both sober; it was about half past seven in the evening; we went to the White-Lion about seven, to see Mr. Gibson, the landlord, who is an acquaintance of the prosecutor's, and we had one glass of rum a-piece; there were women in the house, but we were with the landlord; they were in one room, and we in another.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after you had the rum? - A. Three men went out just before us; they came out of the same house; I was the last out; they had not been in our company, but was in company with the women; I saw the prisoner go out before me, and he laid hold of the prosecutor by the breast, and the other took his watch; I did not see the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took it? - A. I saw them just run from him; the third man, I suppose, stood to receive the watch; the other two ran away as soon as they had got the watch, and then the prisoner let him go, and ran after them; I am sure he is the man; I saw his face, which made me know him, for there were then three standing before us drinking at the bar, with one girl with them, and the prisoner was in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had the prosecutor got out of the house? - A. He might be about three yards from the door; there was a light in the bar-window, right facing where he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face in the street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go up the moment they got out of the house, before the door was shut? - A. Yes, before the door was shut, they had hold of him.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-34-person339">Q. </persName>
            If you did not see his face in the street, how could you know him again? - A. I saw him in the room, and saw the brown coat he had on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come out of the house? - A. Yes; he went directly up to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me, correctly, how you all went out? A. I asked this young man what o'clock it was, and if it was time to go a-board; he looked at his watch, and said, let us go; the three men were then just before the bar; then we were bidding the landlord good night, and these men went out; the Prussian followed them, and I followed him; I had just got upon the step when they laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. By the time you got out, were they walking on, or in waiting? - A. They were waiting for us.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as the Prussian got out, did you see them stop him? - A. Yes, upon the opening of the door, as they went out, we went out one after the other; there were other people passing and repassing, but not near us; I never lost sight of the prisoner from the time he left the house till he run away, after holding the prosecutor; I swear he is the man, I know him by his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not see his face in the street? - A. I know him again by the size of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you find him afterwards? - A. We went about ten minutes after to the house again, and found the prisoner standing before the fire; I had asked the prosecutor if he would go back, and see if the landlord knew the man; I was asking the landlord, and the prisoner stood there, and spoke to me; he was holding his head down at first, and I did not see his face, but I asked the landlord if he knew the young men that were there, because they had picked this young man's pocket; then the prisoner asked me who was the man that had lost the watch; I told him, he was the man who took it; he said, he was not; I asked the landlord if he knew him; he said, he did not; the landlord is not here; we then sent for an officer, and the prisoner told the officer he knew the men who had the watch;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020028"/>the officer told him, if he did not find the men who took the watch, he would take him; the prisoner then took us to some place, in Whitechapel, I think, about three miles, to a house, and said the man lived there who had the watch; he enquired for a man who was not at home; then we took him to the watch-house; he said he knew the gang that went every Sunday night stealing watches and what they could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. When the prisoner said he would endeavour to find the man, he was in the officer's care? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you got? - A. I had had a glass of rum in the morning, and one in the evening, I had nothing at my dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it told you about a reward? - A. Nobody; I never had such a job as this in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body has said that the door of the public-house was shut before the Prussian was held, that is not true, is it? - A. No; the door was not shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had seen this young man before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went back to the public-house, why did not you know the prisoner again? - A. I did not see him at first.</p>
               <p>Q. There were people passing and re-passing? - A. Yes, on the other side; there might be three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment the two other men run away, the man that held the Prussian let him go? - A. Yes, and went after them.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS sworn. - I am an officer; the prisoner was brought to Lambeth-street office on Monday, and committed for examination on the Wednesday following; I know nothing against the prisoner, except that the prosecutor gave me this paper, (produces it), saying, he had it from his father; I had six guineas, five half-guineas, a shilling, a one pound Bank of England note, in all amounting to ten pounds and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Bank-note, three seven-shilling-pieces, half-a-guinea, and some silver, because I had just taken it; Mrs. Dyster got up again, and cried out, stop thief, he has robbed the woman; upon which a gentleman caught him, and brought him back; I am sure that is the boy, because he was right before my face; the box was never found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. It was very dark, and this happened momentary? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You never had seen the person who took the box before? - A. No; but his clothes were particular.</p>

               <p>- MALLOWELL sworn. - I am a weaver, in King-street, Spitalfields; I was opposite to Tuck's shop, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner, with one or two persons behind him, as he was crossing to run down Old Nichol-street; I caught him by the collar, and another man immediately got hold of his collar, and begged me to let him go, for that he had him in custody; I said I should not, for I did not know what was the matter; he kept hold of his collar a little way, but I missed him soon; I did not first see the prisoner till he was about thirty yards off Tuck's shop; I believe he fell down, for I heard a splashing, and when I laid hold of him, he was all over mud; I took him back, and he was taken into custody; he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. There were several people running? - A. There were three or four behind, he was the first about four or five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first time you saw the young man you caught, and that was thirty yards from the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - I belong to Worship-street; I was sent for to take the prisoner; Mrs. Tuck said, he was the lad; I searched him, and found in his pocket this piece of crape, a glove, a knife, and a penny piece.</p>

               <p>Q. It often happens that it don't lock? - A. It might so, I cannot say whether it was locked or not, I locked it as I usually did.</p>

            Rimes's place was searched, but nothing found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were you drinking that day? - A. He sent for me to the corner of the street, it might be about ten minutes before two.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS sworn. - I am journeyman to Mr. Salkeld, No. 423, Strand, (produces a gown and shawl); they were pawned between five and seven, on the 9th of November, for ten shillings, by Scully, in the name of Edward Smith, No. 1, Bull-inn-court, Strand: On the 10th the prosecutrix came, and I shewed her the things, which she claimed; she went and got an officer and we took Sculty; nobody persuaded me to swear to him; he is the man to the best of my knowledge; but I was extremely busy at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. I have some little doubt.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMERICK sworn. - I am one of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020030"/>Bow-street patrole; Crocker, the prosecutrix, and I went to Rimes's house, No. 1, Queen's-head-court, Strand; we did not find him then, but we saw Bullock and him arm in arm in the street; the woman said, pointing to Rimes, that is the man I have a suspicion has robbed me; I took him and Crocker stopped Bullock; we took them to Rimes's house and searched him (Rimes), but did not find any thing; Crocker was searching Bullock, but he would not let him do it quietly; I went to his assistance, but before I got to him he whipped this ticket into his mouth, (produces a duplicate); I tied his hands and untied his leather apron, and in his breeches there was this old pocket-handkerchief; we took them to Bow-street; I went to Bullock's lodgings in Marigold-court, and found some other property.</p>
               <p>- CROCKER sworn. - I went with Limerick to the house of Rimes, and found this bunch of small keys, some have been filed; one of them opens the lock of the prosecutrix's drawers; I afterwards met Scully and searched him, and in his right hand breeches pocket I found two skeleton keys, one of which undoes her parlour door. (Produces the keys).(The prosecutrix identified the shawls, gowns, and handkerchief).</p>
               <p>Bullock's defence. About eight o'clock in the evening, on the 9th of November, as I was coming from work I kicked something before me, which I picked up, and it was a few old rags, two pocket-handkerchiefs, and a duplicate; I carried them home, but did not then know what they were; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Scully and Rimes were not put on their defence.</p>
               <p>Leman. I would give a guinea for the gown, half-a-crown for this shawl, and one shilling for the blue shawl.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp, (Counsel for Walsh).</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it fince you saw him? - A. I suppose a year and a half; he has followed the sea fourteen years; he never was sent abroad near Botany Bay; he is now on board the Kent, of 74 guns; I never saw Blake till he came after the house in October, when he came with another person, but I am sure he did not stop all night: on the night of the robbery there were plenty of people in the house, and I called loudly, but they did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the dining-room over the tap-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any men in the house? - A. I dare say a dozen below.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart, (Counsel for Blake). Q. You say you never saw Blake till the 22d of October? - A. I never saw him but three times before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in the coach, who went out to him? - A. The coachman came, and asked for a quartern of gin, and said, a gentleman wanted to speak to the mistress of the house; I went out, and Blake said, don't you know me, my name is Evans; then I said, oh then, Mr. Evans, you mean to have the house; then he told me to take the reckoning out of that piece of paper, or to take it out of that which was in the paper. (Produces a gilt ring).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he go up stairs, without Walsh? - A. Yes; but I was not above two minutes up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been to see Blake since in prison?-A. His wife has been to me to offer twenty pounds, thirty pounds, or any money to go out of the way, and not appear against him, and I went to him in prison two or three times, for the poor woman came and cried, and said, she was with-child, and had three children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never offer that you would not prosecute, if they would give you fifty pounds? - A. No; I said, the truth I would stand to the longest day I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. What prison did you go to? - A. I never went without the woman; I went twice to Tothillfields, and no more, and once to Newgate, when they begged me to keep away, but I said, I would take no bribery; I did not eat or drink with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these notes? -(Produces several letters). - A. No; I can neither read or write.</p>

             sworn. - I am a draper: On the 4th of November last I was at the Plough, with a few friends; I saw the prisoner, Blake, go out of doors, and Mrs. Thompson after him, calling for assistance, as she had been robbed; I ran out, and seized Blake, and brought him back, and detained him till the patroles came; he made a great to do to get away; I went up stairs to look at the door; it seemed as if it had been forced, for one of the screws was started three parts out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see Blake come into the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the other came in? - A. No great time, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise up stairs? - A. I did, but could not presume what noise it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I take it for granted, when a woman cried out, murder, or that she was robbed, in your hearing, you would give your assistance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought so, you appear like a man of gallantry - now, did you hear any thing like that at this house? - A. I heard a noise of Mrs. Thompson singing out for assistance, for that she had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes, as she was going out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a noise over head? - A. I heard a noise over head, but I could not say what it was, I was busy with my company; there might be between twenty and thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Walsh? - A. Yes; he was in the tap-room once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. When you saw Walsh in the tap-room, where was Blake? - A. Up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the landlady? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lock of the bed-room inside the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write any notes for Mrs. Thompson? - A. I did not write any, but there was a note or two wrote by a young man, an attorney, I cannot say who employed him; I heard them say they would give Mrs. Thompson money to make it up; but she said, she would tell nothing but the truth.</p>

             sworn. - I am apprentice to Mr. Fleming, and wrote these tickets; I think it was Walsh, I have not much doubt about it.</p>
               <p>- BLY sworn. - I am a constable, and apprehended Walsh on the 11th of November; I searched him, and found this duplicate, (produces it); the Magistrates desired me to take care of this letter, directed to the worshipful Magistrates at Queen's-square, (produces it); Walsh acknowledged it to be his writing.(The property was produced, and identified by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>Blake's defence. Wanting to take a public-house, I went to the Plough, and asked that woman the terms; we could not agree about it then, and on the 22d of October I took a friend with me to see whether he liked it; I had 98 guineas in my pocket, which I took for to pay in case we agreed; she took us into a back parlour, and brought in a bottle of brandy, of which we all drank; I went to pay, but she said, she had no change, and I had better look over the house; she then took me up stairs, and at last shewed me into her bed-room, where she kept me for about two hours, and there said, meet me at 4 o'clock to-morrow, at the Crown and Thistle; in the Haymarket, which I did; she kept me out drinking till between eight and nine o'clock and then she told me to call myself Evans, as she knew a captain of that name; we went home in a coach, and she took me up stairs, and locked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020033"/>me into her bed-room; by and by she came up, and stripped off, and made me go to bed with her; she had brought up a bottle of brandy, and she and I had three glasses a-piece; in the morning I asked her for change, she said she had not got any, but, says she, here are three rings, and I will meet you between ten and eleven o'clock, at Westminster-bridge; she gave me the three rings, two of which I sold and gave her back the other, on which I had had my name and her's engraved by her desire: On the 4th of November, when I got to the door, I told the coachman to call for a quartern of gin, and desire the mistress to come to me, she did, and I said, here is the ring and the money I borrowed of you, I cannot stop now; but she took hold of me, made me get out and go to her bed-chamber; then she ran down stairs, brought up the brandy bottle, and she and I drank about six glasses a-piece; she then said, there is a man of the name of Wade, who is a young man, and lodges in the house; I will leave him and go with you; you can tell the maid the person in the coach is your mate, and he can draw up a letter to shew to Wade, and I will go along with you this night; I told her that would not suit me, but I would think of it, and as I was dry, would have a pint of beer; she run down stairs for it, and when she came up, she took up this parasol, and said, I will go with you, and will throw these things to your friend in the coach; I opposed her doing it, and said, I would not agree to it; upon which she charged me with robbing her; I thought she was joking, till this very man, Wade, came up, and knocked me down, saying, you rascal, I will get forty pounds for swearing your life away; they then sent for a patrole and took me away; while I was in Tothil-fields, she said, if I would give her fifty pounds, she would forgive me.</p>

               <p>Walsh's defence. My Lord, on the day this circumstance happened, I met with Blake, who asked me to go to the Plough with him; I agreed, and we took a coach at Charing-cross; he desired the coachman, when at the Plough, to tell the woman of the house she was wanted she came, and Blake took something out of his pocket, desiring her to take charge of it, she then began exclaiming, "my dear husband, where have you been so long from me?" and so on, and made him get out of the coach; after I had sat a considerable time in the coach, near to falling asleep, I heard a tapping at the coach door, and Mrs. Thompson said, she wished me to walk up stairs; on coming into the room, "is this the mate of your vessel," said she? "yes," says he; we sat down and had some brandy and water; what passed between them, upon my word I am ashamed to relate, it was so bad; I was obliged to go down stairs, where I saw Wade; the way they went on, forced me to come down; soon after, the maid called out, saying, her mistress wanted me up stairs; I went up, and she said,"Mr. Walsh, see how your friend has robbed me, all these things I have taken from his person;" "I don't think," said I, "that he would be guilty of it, if I thought so, I would give him up;" yes, says she, he has, and you must go to prison with him; as to the duplicate I never saw it till at the Magistrate's; the officer picked the ticket off the ground, for Mrs. Thompson came up to me and laid hold of me in a very violent manner; she certainly put it under my coat; it was not pledged till six days after, and it is very unlikely that I should keep it in my possession so long, if I had stole it.</p>
               <p>Bly. When we searched him, he made a slip, which I suppose was intentionally done, and the papers fell on the ground; the woman was against the door, she could not possibly do it.</p>
               <p>Blake. I wish to call Elizabeth Lamb.</p>

            .(The case was opened by Mr. Knapp.)</p>
               <p>HENRY SIMMONDS sworn. - I live in Paternoster row: On the 9th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the top of the houses looking into St. Paul's Church-yard when the procession went by, and I found between the ridges of the houses, in a gutter, a small mahogany box; it was between the house of Mrs. Nicholls and my uncle's; the backs of the houses adjoin; the box was not near any window; there are two ridges that go with a descent, and between them I found the box in a gutter; from the top of Mrs. Nicholls's house there is a descent, which goes upon the leads, and on the leads there is a parapet wall and a ladder; when I was up there, I saw the gentleman at the bar and two or three others there; the box contained a paper, which was folded up; I opened it, and in it was about a dozen duplicates, which I took to my uncle; the box, when I took it up, fell to pieces in my hand, but I took the pieces and the duplicates to Mr. Gaimes the next morning, in the state I found them, as near as I could, and I left them with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went up there to see Lord-Mayor's Shew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prisoner, and two or three more, on the top of Mrs. Nicholls's house? -</p>
               <p>Q. That is some distance from the place where you found the box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses are there from which persons might arrive at that gutter? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they from half-a-dozen? - A. Yes, one way.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GAIMES sworn. - I am the proprietor of three shops, in St. Paul's Church-yard; I carry on the jewellery business at No. 54, the cabinet business at No. 53, and at No. 51 principally cutlery; at No. 51 I occupy the ground-floor only; the house is Mrs. Nicholls's, and I rent the lower part; at present a brother-in-law of mine manages the business in it; and when the box was found, Benjamin Collins managed it; Peregrine Parry always sleeps there; I know the prisoner, he lived with his mother, at No. 51; the front windows are secured by shutters, which are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020035"/>fastened on the inside, but cannot be opened on the outside; on the 10th of November Simmonds came to me, and brought me a number of duplicates, some of which had my name on them; I went to the pawnbroker's with those which had my name, and after I had made enquiries, I gave them all to Kimber, the constable; in consequence of his going to Fleming's, the pawnbroker, Fleming's man produced twelve knives, thirteen forks, and the pouch; before the Lord-Mayor I swore to the knives and forks, by their having a mark and my name on them, and to the pouch, by my private shop-mark: upon resorting to my shop, at No. 51, I discovered they were missing; I have some of the same sort left that I had at the same time from Salt and Co. of Sheffreld; I had either two or three dozen of deserts, and the same of table; those produced were never accounted for to me, nor had I ever sold them to Mrs. Nicholls or the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have three shops, Nos. 54, 53, and 51, in St. Paul's Church yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the whole houses, Nos. 54 and 53? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>

            Then as to the sale or disposal of the effects in No. 51, you leave to some other person? - A. I am often there myself, perhaps a dozen times a day; I attend very little behind the counter in either of the shops, but I think less at No. 51 than either; I did the careful part of it:</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you there in February? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person412">A. George Young</persName>
            , who is here.</p>
               <p>Q. You have another shop in Cornhill, have not you? - A. Yes, and another at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Campbell, who is now dead, had a share in your business, I believe? - A. He never had; I am the sole proprietor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did it happen that Mrs. Nicholls had occasion to distrain for rent? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person413">A. </persName>
            Last quarter but one; Mr. Campbell hired the shop, and I paid him again; I did not know it had happened till he told me; they were not there ten minutes, for I gave a check on my banker the moment I heard of it; it was thirty-seven pounds ten shillings, for a quarter, at one hundred and fifty pounds a year.</p>

               <p>Q. Nos. 53 and 54 have access to the tops of the houses, have they not? - A. Yes, at 53, but there are no leads at 54.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being called upon to make good damage done by your servants for getting over the tops of the houses? - A. I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-43-person414">Q. </persName>
            Is the sale of your curlery confined to No. 51? - A. No, there is as much sold at the other shops; though I say the shops are divided, there may be as many desks sold at 51 as 53 or 54, and so with cutlery at the others.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the knives had your name on - is not the name of Gaimes generally put? - A. No. only on the very best.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, upon your oath, will you swear that those knives or forks were not sold at 53 or 54? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that you could not tell that they had not been sold? - A. Yes, but I have never been accounted to for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. 
               <persName id="t18011202-43-person415">Q. </persName>
            Explain that? - A. When before Mr. Alderman Combe, I was asked to swear positively whether those were the articles I had been robbed of; I said, I could not; but, since then, I have examined my books, and from my own servants I am enabled to say they are; for table-knives and forks we have no room in either of the shops, than in No. 51, they never were placed in any other.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KIMBER sworn. - I am a constable, and produce some duplicates which I received of Mr. Gaimes; I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of November, about half past eleven at night, at No. 51, St. Paul's Church-yard; he did not say any thing; I searched for a person of the name of Hunt, in White Rose-court, Basinghall-street, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were sent by Mr. Gaimes in the evening to apprehend this young man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A good humane thing to apprehend a boy at midnight? - A. He desired me to take him up when I saw him.</p>

             sworn. - I was employed by Mr. Fleming, in February last, as his shopman, in Newgate-street. (The duplicates shown the witness.) This is my hand-writing, dated the 12th of February; I know the prisoner, and I received the pledge of him; I have no doubt of his person, as I have seen him more than once as pledging and redeeming things at our house.

               <p>Q. You speak from recollection of a person ten months back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a young lad, growing, and features of lads of that age alter considerably within six or seven months? - A. Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a possibility of a person being deceived as to a growing lad? -

               <p>Q. Not only every servant you may have, but have had, and every visitor, must pass through your shop at No. 51? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE YOUNG sworn. - I was servant to Mr. Gaimes, at No. 51, in February last; I know these knives and forks, having cleaned them, but I never sold a table-knife or fork, or desert knife or fork, all the time I was in the shop, or ever missed any.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave them? - A. In September; I did not look to see whether they were there or not; I was there in January, and saw them afterwards; I cleaned them all as soon as I got to the shop, but cannot say the last time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What time was it in January you went to Gaimes's? - A. The 20th of December I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was it customary to clean them? - A. When we saw them dirty; sometimes in the course of a month or two.</p>
               <p>

            Suppose you had heard nothing about the 12th of February, and I had said, when did you clean them, what whoul you have said? - A. I do not remeber cleaning them but two or three times at first; I am sure I had not cleaned them for more than the last two or three months; Mr. Wenman used to serve as well as me about a month or two before I left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Campbell sell any thing there? - A. He has once or twice in the present year; but he never sold any knives or forks as I know of.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have twice found things hid in our cellar; a thread-case, a pair of razors, and a desk, which I informed that young man of, as I thought it was proper Mr. Gaimes should know it.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>AUGUSTINE RAYMER sworn. - I live at No. 2, Prospect-place, Newington Butts, and knew the prisoner about eight years ago; I had not seen him for several years, and he is so much altered, I should hardly have known him had I not seen him at his mother's; Mr. Gaimes succeeded me in that shop.</p>

               <p>MARY DYE sworn. - On the 16th of October last, between nine and ten, this man met me promiseuously in the Strand, and asked me if I would have any thing to drink, which I did; he then took me to a house called the Ship and Horseshoe, East Smithfield, and called for a quartern of gin; he said, he had no money; I presented a seven-shilling piece, which proved to be bad; I gave another, which proved bad also, innocent of me; the landlord then called in two watchmen to know how much more money of that kind I had about me; I had no more of any kind; I then presented my silver watch for payment, but the landlord would not take it; after that, the prisoner called for another quartern of gin; I did not like the appearance of the man, so I took the watch, and put it into my bosom; when the gin was drank, we went out; he led me up a yard, and drew the watch from my bosom; I said, where is the watch; upon which he knocked me down, and I was left insensible on the ground; the watchman found me, and took me to the watch-house; I challenged the prisoner on Tuesday following at Somerset-house, upon which he run away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long were you in company at this house? - A. About three quarters of an hour; I can swear he is the same man who drew the watch from my bosom; I lost also a cloak, a silver pencil, and a pocket handkerchief; my pocket was turned inside out when I came to myself.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, and keep the Ship and Horseshoe; I remember the prisoner and prosecutrix coming to my house on the 16th of October, between eleven and twelve at night; I am sure they are the persons; he knocked at the door, I said it was too late; my wife said, it is Cochran, he wants his crutch, which he has left at our house; he had been away fourteen or fifteen months, but had just come back again; I served them with the gin, and the girl offered me a seven-shilling piece to change; I said it was a bad one; she then tendered me another, which was bad; upon that, I snatched both up, and said I must have her searched, and called in the watchman; no other money was found, except one farthing; she tendered me a silver watch for payment; I refused it; then he said, bring us another quartern, which I did; says he, don't take and lend the poor girl away, I believe she is very innocent, though I never saw her in my life before; says I, my dear, are you an unfortunate girl; she said, she was; and as such I let her go; he said, he believed she was innocent again, and paid for the gin; they then went out of the house, and bid me good night; it was between eleven and twelve when they came, and about twelve when they went away; I could not see that she was any way in liquor; they had three quarterns of gin, or two, I cannot tell which; about three o'clock the headborough rung, and asked me if a man and woman had been there; I said, yes; he asked me if I knew where they lived; I said, I did not; he said, the woman had been robbed by the man who had been drinking with her, in Black-Horseyard; about two or three days after, the prisoner came back to the house, and said to me, have you heard any thing about this piece of work? I said, what; he said, about this girl; I said, yes; he alied for half a pint of gin, and said, is there any danger in my being here; I said, I don't know; that was all he said; I believe he is a sea-faring man.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH RAWLINSON sworn. - I am headborough; just before three o'clock on the 17th of October, alarm was given of the robbery; I saw the woman about five o'clock, and she appeared as sober as she is now; I went to Etherington's, who described him to me, and his name, by which I knew him; I went to search for him, but could not find him, and I gave informa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020038"/>tion to the officers; Black-Horse-yard is a very bye-place.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS sworn. - On the 18th of October, I received information of this young woman being robbed; I desired Nowlan to go with me; a day or two after, I had two warrants against the prisoner for beating two women; I carried one to the Thames-Police, and we were informed he was in custody for robbing a ship, but we were told there was reason to suppose he would be discharged; and we attended again, when he was delivered over to us; Nowlan had a warrant to serve elsewhere, and the prisoner and I went together to the Ship and Horseshoe, the corner of Nightingale-lane; I saw the landlady, and asked her if that was the man along with the young woman; she said, it was; going along, I asked him how he came to rob her; he made very little answer to that, but said, he did not hurt her; says I, you knocked her down in the passage going to Black-Horse-yard, and robbed her of her watch; he replied again, he did not hurt her, and hoped he should not be hanged for it; I said, I hoped not; says I, the young woman saw you at Somerset-house, going there to receive your pay; he made but little answer to that, but, going along, he said, if I could only be transported for it, I should be glad to take that now for my chance; I then took him to the Office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is not in my power to say any thing after what they have said, for they have said that which is most false; I leave it to God and the world to judge of my innocence; I left the woman sitting on the steps; as soon as I came out, I said, my good girl, I will leave you here, I don't think proper to go any further with you, as you had liked to have got me into trouble about the bad money; I then left her sitting on the steps, for she was so drunk, she could hardly stand; indeed we were both drunk together. If I had been guilty, I should have gone away, but I never slept one night out of the parish; I was not one night out of Rosemary-lane; I left her on the steps, and never walked with her after; my crutch I had left off but two days, after having used it for nine months, with a bad leg, with sixty holes in it, which I got by a wound on board a ship.</p>

               <p>Q. Are bladders the common mode of keeping them? - A. No; about a quarter past eight in the evening, I concealed myself; we had placed Mr. Holdsworth outside the door, where he was to wait for a signal, when he was to stop the prisoner; I saw the prisoner take the bladders one by one out of the box, and put them in his pocket; after that, I saw him return them into the box again; I should suppose they were too large for his pockets; the next day, about twelve o'clock, I examined his boxes, and found the bladders reduced in size, and, in the corner of the same box, I found a brown paper containing preserved apricots; in the evening I concealed myself as before, and saw the prisoner take the bladders out of the box, and put them in his pockets; Mr. Holdsworth was outside the door; my brother gave him the signal, and he brought the prisoner in, and searched him; he fell on his knees, and begged for God's sake we would save his life, and he would confess his guilt; upon his finding, that would not do, he fell flat upon his face, kissed our feet, and begged we would save his life, and he would confess every thing; I made answer, that his conduct had been too infamous for him to expect any mercy; there were two bladders containing preserved apricots found upon him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WARRINER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are an Excise officer? - A. I am inspector of the Excise watch: On Friday morning, the 13th of November, between twelve and one'clock, just after midnight, I was upon the quays; I saw the prisoner come on shore from the craft, his employment was to watch from six o'clock till twelve, when his partner was to relieve him; there were thirty-three casks of Spanish brandy in the craft just off Custom-house-quay, within five yards of the shore; I saw the prisoner come out of the craft when his partner came to relieve him; I took hold of him and rubbed him down, when I found a bladder in his coat pocket; he said, what do you mean by that; I told him he must go with me to the office; he went with me to the office door and then he got away; he ran up St. Dunstan's-hill as fast as he could; I cried out stop him, and he was stopped by two men in Cross-lane; I was very near him; I took hold of him again, and a watchman took hold of him on the other side and we brought him to the watch-house; I there searched him again, and found on the other side another bladder, the two bladders contained seven quarts of Spanish brandy; he then pulled out a gimblet and a tin tube, and said he supposed that was what I was looking for.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that tube a perfect one? - A. No, it was a piece of one; the watchman afterwards produced another piece, which made it perfect; the next day I saw the casks gauged, and found six gallons deficient in one cask, we took off one of the hoops that we had a suspicion of, and found a large deal spile; the casks belonged to Mr.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I went on board the craft I found my partner very much in liquor and three other men with him; when I came they went away; he was so much in liquor that I was obliged to assist him up the ladder; I found several spiles in the casks: he went away, and I walked about the lighters till after ten o'clock; I then had my supper and smoaked my pipe, and as I was putting my pipe down at the head of the barge I found these bladders; I put them in my pockets with intention to take them to the Surveyor's office; about ten minutes after twelve my partner called to me from shore, and I went on shore, and as I was crossing Porter's quay Mr. Warriner laid hold of me and said he should rub me down; I told him I had got nothing but what I had found; he then threatened to send me to prison, and put me in a very great terror, which made me try to get away; they had my name and place of abode registered in their books.</p>

               <p>JOHN WOOTTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What is the firm of the Messrs. Maitlands? - A. John Maithland, Robert Maitland the younger, Henry Sterry, and John Nettleship; I am their warehouseman; they live in Balinghall-street; the prisoner was employed by his father in the looking-over room; his father had been employed many years in that house: On Saturday, the 31st of October, between four and five in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner coming down stairs into the warehouse; I observed something stick out behind him under his cloaths; he went down the yard into Mason's-alley, which is opposite the warehouse gate; I went after him, clapped my hand upon his back, and said, Deacon, what have you got here; he said a bit of kerseymere,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020041"/>for God's sake forgive me and don't tell my father; I told him I could not forgive him; I took him into the drawing-room, and, from under his waistcoat, I took four yards of drab-coloured doublemilled kerseymere; he said, he got it out of the superfine warehouse; I desired him to go with me, and shew me where he had it from; William Elton and I went with him; I missed a piece from a pile that he shewed me; we went up stairs again into the looking over room, and, in his right-hand coat-pocket I found two yards of the same; in his left-hand coat-pocket two yards more; and the rest I found in a drawer, of which he gave me the key; I found in all thirteen yards and three-quarters, (produces it); and the constable found two yards more in his hat, which made exactly the quantity in the piece that I missed; I asked him where the end of the piece was with the manufacturer's mark, and he took it out of his breeches-pocket; it is marked Stephens and Co. with the number; they are our manufacturers.(William Elton corroborated the testimony of Wootton.)(James Prior, the constable, produced two yards of cloth, found in the prisoner's hat.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a waterman, employed by the Thames Police Office? - A. I am: In the night of the 18th of November, about a quarter before three in the morning, I saw the prisoner taking some hemp out of the lighter belonging to Mr. Lucas; there was another man with him; he put it into a boat that was lying along-side; I had seen the prisoner before that, a little after two in the morning; they saw the Police-boat coming, and they ran across the boats to the shore; we pursued them, and overtook them; we brought them back to the boat they had left, and found in it seventy pounds weight of hemp; I knew the prisoner before, I am sure he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At what distance were you from the wherry at the time you suppose you saw him? - A. About six or seven yards.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you told the men with you who the man was? - A. I told the man that sat next to me that there was Whitehead stealing hemp from the boat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You don't know that the man you afterwards saw was the prisoner? - A.

I am: On the 6th of November, I, in company with Read and other officers, met the prisoner in Upper Thames-street, about six o'clock in the evening, with this basket, containing two pieces of spermaceti, (produces them); I asked him what he had there; he said, spermaceti; he said he brought it from one Weston's, in Bridgwater-gardens, of whom he had bought it; we were not satisfied with that, and took him to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Weston before the Lord-Mayor? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fit that spermaceti with any block that you afterwards found at Messrs. Enderby's? - A. Yes, and it fitted the block exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner did not conceal it at all, but told you readily it was spermaceti? - A. Yes.</p>

I am their foreman: On the 7th of November, Read brought some spermaceti to our warehouse; I saw the officers fit it to the block,(produces the block); about three or four days before that I had seen the block whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell it cut, or broke? - A. Sometimes cut, and sometimes broke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. During those three or four days, did you see whether that block was broke or not? - A. I did not, till the officers cames.</p>
               <p>Q. Will yo venture to swear, that, during that time, this spermaceti might not have been sold in that state? - A. I cannot say we did; I cannot say one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the night of the 6th of November? -

            , gave me information there was some beef gone; I had seen the beef altogether a very little time before in the tray, I think not more than five minutes; I sent my young man to see if he could make any discovery; he returned in about ten minutes, saying that he had taken two pieces of beef from the prisoner; I know them to be mine by the cut, and the fellow pieces corresponding with it; I did not see any thing of the prisoner for more than a month afterwards, I saw him at the office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do'nt you know that the prisoner came of himself to Worship-street to answer this charge, without being apprehended or taken there by an officer? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you cut your beef different from all other butchers? - A. I cut off the fore rib different from any other butcher, I think, except one.</p>
               <p>Q. That one butcher, perhaps, lives in Lezdenhall-market? - A. His stand is next to mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Then will you venture to swear that that cut is different from his? - A. I know it by the cut and the corresponding pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that if your neighbour has beef of the same cut and the same quality, that you can distinguish one from the other? - A. I have no doubt it is my beef; I admit it is a possible case; but my neighhour did not lose any that morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are beasts so much alike that a piece of one beast will correspond with a piede of another beast, though cut alike? - A. They will not in every particular.</p>
               <p>DANIEL THOMAS sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Barnard: On Saturday, the 24th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I missed two pieces of beef from a tray; I went into the hide-market to look after it, and saw the prisoner and Sparrowhawk very busy just by a truck; I saw the prisoner help Sparrowhawk up with the beef in a tray; I stopped him and asked him where he was going with it, and he said it was Mizzered's; I desired him to carry it back; and the prisoner said, d-n my eyes, is it your master's; says I, yes it is; he said, oh, I thought it belonged to that sat b-r over the water, or else I would not have taken it; I took it back and gave it to my master.</p>

            Sparrowhawk was taken before the Magistrate, was not he? - A. No; he came to our house, and when she prisoner was found he went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped Sparrowhawk the prisoner did not run away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SPARROWHAWK sworn. - I am a butcher's porter in Leadenhall-market: On the 24th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing in the Hide-market behind a truck; he asked me if I wanted a job; I said, yes; he said here are two bits of beef, leave them for me at Mr. Draper's; I took them up, and just as I turned the corner of the Hide-market Mr. Barnard's lad stopped me, and I brought the beef back; I said, Mr. Muzzered you have brought me into a nice predicament, I shall acquaint Mr. Barnard how I came by them; he said to the boy, d-n my eyes, do they belong to your master, I did not know that, or else I would not have took them, I thought they belonged to that fat b-r over the water; I then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020044"/>by the story you have now told you save yourself from being prosecuted? - A. That is more than I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Who first gave you any alarm that your house had been robbed on the 12th of November? - A. The prisoner, between seven and eight in the morning she came up, and said, Ma'am, you are ruined intirely, for your desk is broke open, and all your money gone; one of the closets is broke open in which the plate was, and that the plate was gone. The plate was kept in two closets, one in the from parlour, and the other in the back parlour; she begged I would not go down, for it would frighten me very much, and desired I would let her go for my son; I told her to go to Upper Berkeley-street for him; when she was gone, I dressed myself, and went below stairs; I found the plate-cupboard open, the key of which was in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who had locked the cupboard the night before? - A. I had double-locked it the night before, and she stood by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the lock appear to have been picked or forced? - A. There were no marks of violence at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of plate did you miss from there? - A. A large quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the rest there were six silver tablespoons? - A. Yes, which I have seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you observed, did you send for Mr. Meller? - A. Yes, and by his advive I sent for Crocker, an officer, from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Crocker come before the prisoner came back? - A. Yes; when she came home, she looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020045"/>about, and said, every thing is gone; she went down to shew Crocker the place where she thought the thieves had got in; after they had been gone down a little while, Crocker called out that he could not hold her, and I must come and assist him; I went down, and found the prisoner on the floor, and Crocker had hold of her; Mr. Meller then came down; they took off her pockets; and opened them in my presence; a silver nulmeggrater and half a dozen silver table-spoons were found upon her, with my name upon them, H. S. P. my late husband's name was Hugh; they had been osually kept in the closet in the parlour, which had been broke open; I had seen them a day or two before.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are an officer belonging to Bow-street? - A. I am one of the conductors of the patrole: On Thursday, the 12th of November, I was sent for to Mrs. Penfold's house; the prisoner told me she had been robbed, and likewise her mistress; she said, she had been robbed of a two-pound note and her cloak. I looked at the premises, and observing something suspicious, I asked her where she had lost her cloak from; she shewed a drawer; I then asked her where she had lost the note from; she shewed me a place in the kitchen drawer; she said, she had lost it out of a letter; I then suspected her, and said, my girl, perhaps in your sturry, you have put the two-pound note in your pocket; she said, no, she had not; I desired her to be sure, and search; she put her hand in her pocket, and was unwilling to pull any thing out, which strenghtened my suspicion very much, and I said, stop a minute, and let your mistress search you; there were two other maidservants by; I went to lay hold of her, and she immediately resisted; in the struggle, she and I fell together, I sent one of the servants to fetch some gentleman to my assistance, and I kept her hunds fast, that she should not throw any thing away; Mr. Moller then came, and held her hands; I got at her pocket, and took six silver table-spoons out, which I have had ever since. (Produces them.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the house had been broke into from the outside? - A. People might have got in the way she shewed me, but it was the most unaccountable robbery that ever was committed if they did; there was a ladder in the yard, and there were such very small marks of violence, I suspected very much some person in the house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>

I am a constable, appointed by the Commissioners of the Customs, to attend the quays: About half past four o'clock on Thursday, the 19th of November, I was going down Bear-Quay, I saw the prisoner go to a bag of wool, and take out this quantity, put it in his apron, and run across the quay; I pursued him, and stopped him with the wool under his apron; the bag was close to a cart that was then loading, I believe it touched the wheels; the bag was very much torn.</p>

             sworn. - On the 27th of October I had left my place, and was going to Westminster, about eight o'clock in the evening, it being star-light; I had a bundle, containing the articles mentioned in the indictment; as I was going through the Park, a soldier came up to me, that is the man (pointing to Gann;) and laid hold of me, and asked me where I was going? I begged him to let me go my way; he would not, but held me by the arm; then another soldier came up, which is Haywood; he wanted to catch hold of me, but the other would not let him; then the other prisoner gave him a wink.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you see him wink? - A. Yes; then Haywood went behind, and snatched the bundle from under my arm, and run away; I squalled out stop thief! Gann held me while he went to a distance, a quarter of an hour or more, and told me to hold my tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not threaten to do you a mischief, did he? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not afraid of their using you ill? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man that held you? - A. He run away towards Knightsbridge barracks, and I walked after him as fast as I could; a corporal then came up to my assistance, who is not here, and we went after them to the Barracks; I kept them in sight all through the Green Park.</p>

Smith burnt on it.(Jeremiah Linch, the watchman, corroborated the evidence of the prosecutor, as to finding the cask).</p>

             sworn. - I am warehouseman to Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman: On Tuesday, the 3d of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I employed six men with knots to remove this fruit to No. 90, Lower Thames-street; the prisoner was one; we numbered the knots, and No. 5, did not come in; I went out and met No. 6; I had information that No. 5 was gone up St. Mary-hill; I went up St. Mary-hill into Gracechurch street, but could not see any thing of him; I then returned home and found the prisoner it our house; he had been stopped; it was a barrel containing raisins, weighing 100 cwt. and 4lb.; the prisoner said a woman desired him to carry it to No. 54, Milford-lane; the cask is marked F. P. L. and the other barrels that were landed that day had the same mark; my master is liable for the goods as soon as we take them up from the quays.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk with Messrs. Clarke and Anstey, fruit-brokers, Philpot-lane; I met the prisoner on the 3d of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in Philpot-lane, which is about half a mile from the quay; he had a cask of raisins on his back, which I knew by the mark to belong to a parcel then laying at Ralph's quay, which were to be warehoused at Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman's, from which I suspected he was not in the right road; I asked him where he was going with it; he told me to No. 54, Milford-lane; I asked him where that was; he said through Temple-bar; I asked him to whom there; he could not tell me; I then took him to Mr. Aylwin's, and left the cask at No. 40, Philpot-lane; I left him in custody, and the constable fetched the barrel. (Lindsey, a constable, produced the property).</p>

I am: On the 11th of November, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner on board the Britannia; I was on board the Rocksea; I saw him go down into the cabin; I then saw another man go to the cabin door where the prisoner was; then I saw the end of a sail launched by the prisoner to the other man; as soon as this man had got half the sail upon deck he went away and left it; he took hold of the other end and laid it down by the companion; he directly went down into the cabin and put his coat on; he came up again with his coat on, and he went to the head of the ship and looked round, and then to the stern; I then went on board the Britannia, seeing him rather confused, I said hold of the end of the sail and asked him what he was going to do with it; he said his master had ordered him to take the sail on shore to be aftered; I looked outside the ship and saw a boat with a sail in it; I then went into my own ship, and in a few minutes saw Johnson take the sail and put it over into the same boat where the other was; Johnson then got into the boat and went away towards Rotherhithe; the ship laid at Limehousehole; when the Captain came on board I acquainted him with it.</p>

             sworn. - On the 10th of November I came to London to receive my wages at Somerset-house; my father lives at Finchley; I received my wages, and was going home down Gray's-Inn-lane, when I met a boy, who asked me what ship I belonged to; I told him none; he asked me what ship I was last on board of; I told him the Irresistible; he asked me where I was going; I told him to Finchley; he said, he was going my way, and would walk part of the way with me; going past the Pea-hen, he asked me to go in several times to drink; I had never been there before; at last I did go in, and then came in the prisoner Bowers and a parcel more people with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Bowers? - A. The further one; and as soon as I went in, the boy rose up from the box I was sitting in, and said he has got a watch; he has got a watch; he said that to the peopel that came in; with that they all sat down, and Bowers next to me, and Serjeant next to him; they asked me several questions what ship I belonged to, and I told them; they said, they knew the ship very well; I had never seen any of them before to my knowledge; I saw Serjeant's left hand coming round Bowers, and as soon as he saw that I saw his hand, he snatched his hand away; I thought he intended to rob me; I afterward, found I was mistaken; I rose up then, and bid them all good bye; I told them I lived at Finchley, that I had a great way to go, and bid them good bye; Bowers said, what hurty are you in? I was getting out of the box across the vaule, and directly I rose up, Bowers made a snatch at the watch-chain; he could not get it out; it was quite tight in; he could not get it out the first pull, nor the second; then he dragged me out of the box; I kept fast hold with my left hand of his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020051"/>collar, and with my right hand I took the banknotes I had received out of my waistcoat-pocket, and put them in my bosom; then he got the watch in his hand, and the chain was hanging down; he dragged it out, and got it from me; I made a snatch at the chain, and, after some trying to get it, the chain broke from the watch, and fell upon the ground; I immediately sung out, he has got my watch, he has got my watch; he then ran out, and three or four people absconded the house; one of them had the watch; I have never seen my watch since; it was worth five pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that either of the prisoner? - A. No; soon after that there came in several more, they sat down in the box on the right hand side; Gale came into the box first, and they sat down to the right hand in the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they close to him? - A. No, they were two or three off him; Bowers was next to him; Serjeant sat next but one to Bowers.</p>
               <p>Q. Next to Bowers? - A. No, they did not sit on the same side of the prosecutor.</p>

            (To Gale.) Did you not tell me Bowers sat next to Serjeant? - A. Yes, I was very right; this man is wrong.</p>
               <p>Snosell. If you refer to the first examination before the Justice, you will find what I say to be true.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Indeed, Sir, you are mistaken, I have the information, and the information is exactly as that boy has now represented it? - A. It was so, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. I should rather believe him than yougo on, Sir.</p>
               <p>Snosell. Then one of them called for a pot of purl; they drank part of it, and I then went towards the bar; one of them holloaed out they wanted a quartern of gin put into it and a pennyworth of sugar; I put a quartern of gin and a pennyworth of sugar into it; I asked them who was to pay me for it; Serjeant paid a pot towards the reckoning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Serjeant before? - A. Yes, and another paid a pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that other? - A. I don't know; it was ne'er a one that is here present; then I asked them who was to pay the other pint; at first there was no answer; then one of them made answer, and said, the sailor was to pay the pint; I asked him for it, and he said he did not see what business he had to pay; then I said, I suppose I shall have it of some of you; upon saying that, Gale started up to go away; he said he had got to go as far as Finchley, and he could not stop; what is your hurry, says Bowers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Bowers before? - A. I had seen him once before that morning, but never before; Bowers said, what is your hurry? clapped his hand to his breast, and pushed him down in the box again; he statred up again, and said, he must go, he had so far to go, he got up to attempt to get over the table; Bowers rose up, and laid Hold of his watch-chain, and, I believe, with the hustle and his getting out of the box over the table, the watch came out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got over the table? - A. Gale; the prisoner Bowers then had it in his hand; I laid hold of him with both my hands, and collared him, and said, give the young man his watch again; he made me no reply; I kept him in hold, and one side of his waistcoat gave way; I then took the opposite side, and tried to get the watch out of his hand; he then stretched his hand out rather farther than my reach was, and he gave it to some one behind, and two or three then ran out at the door together; I then still held him in custody; upon that, there was a person lodged in our house, who had been a publican, came in; I commanded him to aid and assist; he then laid hold of him from me; I then told him to hold him while I went for an officer; I ran out directly to look for an officer, and I met one coming down Tash-street,

               <p>Q. You know him to be a glazier, and living in that neighbourhood? - A. I know him to be a glazier, and to live in Brook's-market.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Serjeant called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - On the 24th of November I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw some people gathered together at the corner of Maddox-street; I went up, and found the prosecutor accusing the prisoner of stealing a boot; he said, he had seen him take it, and had never lost sight of him; I then said, I belonged to the Public Office, Bow-street, and he must go with me; the man very readily came with me; he said it was very hard he should be accused of stealing a boot that he was innocent of; the prosecutor said, he lived over the way; I took the man there, and the prosecutor searched to see whether he had lost a boot or no, and he said he had, but the prisoner had no boot upon him, or any thing of the sort; while the prosecutor was looking outside to see the situation of his boots, the prisoner talked about his family, and I said, perhaps the man might accommodate his temper bye and bye, and he might make it up; I called the prosecutor in from the door, and put the prisoner into a little shop that the prosecutor had, and left him there with the prosecutor and his man; I heard him offer something or other on account of his family, and he would not take it; the prisoner said, if he would make the other boot, he would leave a guinea till it was done; I said, my friend, I don't think you have got a guinea, you had better go before the Magistrate; he said, yes, he had got a guinea, and he threw it down upon the boots that were there; then I picked up the guinea, and said, I don't know what to make of the business; I desired the prosecutor to take the guinea, after I had marked it, which he did, and then I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When the prosecutor came back to the shop, he searched to see whether he had lost a boot or not? - A. Yes.</p>

            Then he was not certain whether he had lost a boot or not, till he had examined? - A. I cannot say as to that`.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman charged me with stealing a boot; I told him if I had stolen a boot, I must certainly have it about me; I know no more of it than the child unborn.</p>

               <p>THOMAS TEMPEST sworn. - I am manager of the smith department to Messrs. Perry; Sebly was in the copperas manufactory, near the prisoner's house, which was in Poplar; Messrs. Perry had about thirteen or fourteen tons of Dutch filling nails, which they used in making copperas; I believe they had sold part of them, but I cannot say particularly: On the 11th of September, about seven o'clock in the morning, I went to Henderson's premises, with the officer, and saw him go out when I was within about one hundred yards from him; he is smith by trade; I saw two bags of filling nails brought out of his house, and were produced at Sebly's trial, and they are of the same kind as Messrs. Perrys'; I saw them in the back parlour, and believe them to be part of the stock; I understand the prisoner absconded, nor did I see him since the 11th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Will you swear he has absconded? - A. No, I cannot; I don't know whether there were scales where the nails were or not, there might he; there were two parcels in bags laying on the floor unconcealed; I should not have known any of the nails had been lost, except these had been found; when they break up a Dutch ship a great many of the nails fall out as they strip the bottom.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN sworn. - I am an officer, and searched the prisoner's premises on the 11th of September; I was told Mr. Henderson was just gone out; in the middle room, called the back room, I found a large quantity of filling nails, I suppose four or five hundred weight, tied up in bags, and a quantity loose; we brought them away as they were, and they were produced on the trial of Sebly; I had been at Henderson's on the 7th, and I think I saw them then; I made search for the prisoner, but never could find him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TELLKAMFF sworn. - I am clerk to the Magistrates of the Shadwell Police-office, and solicitor to this prosecution; I don't know what intimation the prisoner had of the indictment, he had none from me; he gave notice a day or two after the last sessions that he would surrender the first day of this; but after that notice I sent to apprehend him because he was under no recognizance; it was my duty, and I would do it again; search was made after him, but he could not be found; the charge existed before October, and he might have surrendered the last sessions.</p>
               <p>ANN WHEELER sworn. - The prisoner is my father; I have seen such nails as these at his house; I remember some for years in a basket in a room where he kept old iron behind the shop, not applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020056"/>to any other purpose: On the 5th of September Mr. Wheeler and I only were in the house, a man came with a quantity of nails in parcels in his apron; he said he had some old iron to sell; I said my father was in Buckinghamshire, where he was gone to settle about his house; my father went away on the 12th, and a little while after the officers came; I knew my father intended to leave off business, as his brother had died and left him the house in the country; he desired me to take no orders or buy old iron; and when I told him the man left the nails he was very angry, and if the man called again he was to take them back, as he should have nothing to do with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What kind of man was this? - A. An oldish man; he said he should leave them.</p>
               <p>(Samuel Wheeler corroborated the testimony of the last witness).</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SANDERS sworn. - On the 11th of September last I was an officer of Excise at Yarmouth, and went to <placeName id="t18011202-79-crimeloc419">St. Olave's Bridge, in the county of Suffolk</placeName>

I suppose the pistol inlimidated them, as they seemed more peaceable afterwards. I went to the goods, and they all kept hovering round us; the prisoner was one. It was so light, that, before we stooped the goods, we could see them before we came up to them, being piled up very high; when we examined the harness, it was so cut that we saw there would be a difficulty in getting the goods to Yarmouth; it was cut, no doubt, by the smugglers, for if it had been cut before, the horses could not have travelled; the collar the shaft-horse was nearly cut away; seeing that, I called Mr. Milner on one side, and said, I was afraid we should have a difficulty in getting them to Yarmounth, and we had better put them in one cart; seeing a parcel of dry goods in one cart, and that they were light, I threw them upon the tubs of geneva; we took out three bales, which proved afterwards to be tobacco, of eighty-four pounds weight, which we put upon the cart that had two horses, and endeavoured to go on; we left the small cart, because we were afraid they would obstruct us in going up a very steep hill that we had to surmount; we were close by a public-house, and would have put the goods in there, if the people would have got up, but they would not; we drove about half a mile from the place, leaving the one-horse cart behind, and about eight or ten casks in it; when we had got about half a mile, we were stopped, on account of the harness, and the little horse being wounded; we en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020057"/>deavoured to push it up the hill, but finding the shaft-horse hurt, and would not draw, we unloaded twenty of the casks and the tobacco, to lighten the load; finding we could not get up the hill after that, we dispatched Mr. Share for assistance to the next country village upon the wounded horse; he came with two men and a fresh horse, with a spare collar; we then reloaded these goods, and proceeded for Yarmouth. The small cart we left in the place; we don't know what became of it; they did not go away when we did; I did not know Bensted or May before; I saw Hawke afterwards before the Magistrate at Beccles, where he was summoned as one of the smugglers, about a month after the seizure, and I had a full opportunity of seeing him, and he acknowledged he was there.</p>

            Did he say any thing when he came up to the Court? - A. No, he did not; before the Magistrate he first pleaded not guilty, but he afterwards said the goods did not belong to him, but that he was hired as a labourer by those smuggers to carry the goods home, and he said he only did it by way of getting a few shillings towards his support. After I knocked down the second man, Hawke came up with a stick or whip in his hand, that was the first of my seeing him, and, supposing he came to obstruct me, I struck at him before he ever offered to molest me; he did not say or do any thing but come from the goods up to the scussle.(Thomas-Frederick Share and Michael Milner corroborated the evidence of the last witness.)</p>
