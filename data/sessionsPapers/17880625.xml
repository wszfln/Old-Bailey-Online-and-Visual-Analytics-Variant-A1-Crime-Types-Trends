               <p>Between the last of May and the first of June, about half after one in the night, I was going out on some family business for my master, and I met with this unfortunate prisoner and she asked me to treat her, which I did.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - To the best of my knowledge I never saw her; I met her a little on this side a place called New-gravel-lane; she asked me to give her something to drink, and it being late, I took pity on her, and gave her something to drink; I took her to a public house, and we had each a glass of gin, and then we went out of the public house; I paid for the gin; we went on together for a good way, till we came to the place called the <placeName id="t17880625-1-crimeloc3">Match-walk</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17880625-1-crimeloc3" type="placeName" value="Match-walk"/>

                        targets="t17880625-1-off1 t17880625-1-crimeloc3"/>; then she seemed to stop me, by way of crossing me; I seeing her a stout, sturdy body, being late in the evening, I did not date to refuse her; there were little or few words; what passed I cannot, in conscience, mention, but she stopped me, and untied my apron, then she took off my bonnet, then she rifled both my pockets; I do not know whether she rifled my right or left pocket first.</p>
               <p>What did she take from your pocket? - As near as conscience will give me leave to speak, about 14 d. I then went home; I was in hopes to find her on Monday; I am but a poor woman; I could put nothing in force against her; I went back from her; I could not go any further with her; I was going to London-street with her; I cannot recollect the words-that were said; I think I told her I was a Welch woman, and she was going to rob me; to the best of my knowledge, I never saw her before; I can give but little account, but I think she seemed rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>How came you to go along with a strange woman to give her gin? - I did it out of pity.</p>
               <p>There was no pity in giving a drunken woman gin you know? - There are two apprentices in the family where I live, and they had had words and were gone out; one was a resolute boy, and I went in search of him; the apprentice boy was brother to my master.</p>
               <p>Was your master at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you taken any steps to find this woman? - I had searched at several places; I only wanted my property of her; I found her at one Mr. Anderson's, a public house by Smithfield; I do not know the sign; when I saw her there, I did not know her immediately; when I went in, on her speaking, I immediately knew her voice; I said, you took my property; she turned about, and said, me, Madam; I said, yes, my dear, you to be sure; I went to get a watchman; when he stopped her, she attempted to run away, but he took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>What time was it that you took her? - About half past ten in the evening; she said charge for charge, which I did not understand then; the officer of the night detained me two nights and a day with her in the watch-house; I was taken before the justice; there I gave the same account as I have here, and she was committed to prison; I am sure as far as conscience will permit me to speak, it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of it? - I am sure it is the same person that took the things from me in Match-walk; when first I saw her, when I took her, her back was towards me; I did not know her, but by her voice; but when she looked over her shoulder, I knew her.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober when you came out of the public house? - I was quite sober, and quite sensible; I would not belie my conscience for the world; I had drank a little in the course of the day, but nothing to hurt me; I was truly sensible of what I was doing; I cannot recollect any words she said when she took the things; she was a strapping sturdy body to me; and I am rather of a faint spirit; and there was nobody in the street that I could see.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Am I the person that took your property? - Yes, my dear, you are.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250004"/>Oh! do not say it? - Yes, but I will fly it.</p>

               <p>Was there a good light? - It was the 6th of this month; there was very good day-light; I am sure the man that was brought back was the man I saw with the bundle; I am positive of it; he had not the bundle with him then; when he came out, I might be half a yard from him; I saw his face.</p>

               <p>I found the bundle in a narrow lane, about a hundred yards from the house, I picked it up, and walked along with it thinking no harm in the world, these men pursued me, I did not know what they were running after, I heard them cry out, stop thief! and as I picked up the bundle, I thought whether or no it might not be on that account, and I made my escape and dropt the bundle, and went away about my business thinking no harm, and they took me to a public house and brought me to the justice. As for the fire-arms, five weeks ago last Sunday, I was coming along about a mile and a hall beyond Edgware, in a very heavy thunder shower, and there was a barn unlocked, I went in for shelter, and there was a little straw and hay on the floor, I tumbled it about to lay down, and out-tumbled these arms, which I knew nothing about; I was surprized to see them, I put them in my pocket without thinking any harm in the world; I have no witness to prove these things, I expect people to my character every minute, one's name is Alsop, and the other Reave.</p>

               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, as soon as I got up to him, he had hold of one end of the stick; and Mr. Imberty the other, he threw him on the ground, when I came up to him, Mr Imberty let go the stick; I turned round to assist Mr. Imberty, I saw him strive to get up, but he fell down again, I lifted him, the prisoner got off and ran down Nags-head-yard, and turned up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250013"/>London-mews, I saw him jump down an area, the left hand side of Queen-street, I was pursuing him all the way, I did not see what became of the stick; we knocked at the door, the gentlewoman came with a light, he was laying in the area, he got up, he said he had not robbed any body, I caught hold of his collar, then we took him, and he began to swear till he saw we were resolute, then he dropped down on his knees, and begged pardon; he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Had you threatened, or promised him any thing? - No, he never was out of my sight, he did not set off to run, till I got Mr. Imberty upright, he never was out of my sight till he jumped into the area.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you took him to the watch-house, you gave him in custody of the serjeant of the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - He was not at that time.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor accuse him of robbing him? - He gave charge of him.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw this gentleman; two men were using him ill: Mr. Imberty struck me with a stick, and I laid hold of it, I know nothing of the handkerchief; the next morning he said it was a silk handkerchief; then he said it was a kind of a cotton handkerchief, worth about six-pence; then they fell a beating me over the shins, and I was taken; I expected my father here, but his business lay another way.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Recollect you are upon your oath, and that man's life is in danger; in this business, did you or not strike at any body, before you was knocked down? - No, I did not speak, or strike with my fist, or my stick.</p>
               <p>Did you strike him on the shins at any time? - I might in my struggle, but I do not remember it, I did not strike at him.</p>
               <p>Did he speak to you, and say why do you strike, in that way? - Not a word, not one person spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman was in liquor? - I was not quite sober; but yet I understood what I was about.</p>
               <p>Jury. In the charge that you gave to the officer; did you give charge as for an assault; or as for a robbery? - He gave it in, that he had lost a handkerchief and stick.</p>
               <p>Jury. Then I conclude from that, that the man immediately searched him; because we are very particular upon those matters; I am one of the vestry of that parish.</p>
               <p>Court. We have such instances? - Mr. Imberty did not take upon himself to say, that this man had taken his handkerchief; I saw him take the stick myself.</p>
               <p>Did you see what he did with the stick? - No, I did not, nor I did not see what became of it at all.</p>
               <p>Court. What was was the value of this stick? - I gave a shilling for it.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The first of my making application to Maycock for the mare, I went to him and spoke to him several times; Maycock was always complaining Mr. Clapstone had taken him in, and that she was not worth near the money; he had given twelve guineas for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maycock. I have the receipt in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That she was not worth the money, and that he had no objection to part with her, provided he could get enough for her; and one afternoon more particular, I believe when I was up at his house, Mr. Clapstone put the question to him, said if you are tired of your mare I believe Mr. Newby can get you a customer for it; Clapstone lodged at Maycock's house at the time he was very ill.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he lodge there at the time this affair happened? - No, before that a week or a fortnight, Maycock was saying he was taken in, and Mr. Clapston said, I believe if you will give Newby a guinea or something to that purpose, he can get you a customer for her; I do not recollect positively, whether he at that time said he would part with her, but he had said he would part with her, for he had her to let out; as to all the evidence that had been given, I must admit of with respect to Maycock and also Landin, only whether Maycock does not recollect that I hired the mare, and Mr. Clapstone would prove that I certainly made application to Landin knowing the mare, and he very well knew that Maycock had been taken in; that she was not worth near the money; in consequence of that, I went and got the mare in the way that has been described, by hiring it; I was to give three shillings for the hire; she was so lame I dropped in at Landin's house, and told him I had bought the mare; I believe I might say so.</p>
               <p>Court. But this is exactly the same story that the witnesses tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is my Lord, I believe if I had made a return of the money, Maycock would have been satisfied.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go off with the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My intention was to make a return, if it had not been for serving a friend, to whom I lent a part of it; I expected to be tried last night.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is your master Mr. Clapstone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not believe he is here; I believe I have made him an enemy on some business upon which the court was moved, and I made affidavit which I wish I had not done.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot see any reason to distinguish this case from a similar case decided by the judges,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250017"/>and acted upon ever since, which was a case of a person professing to him a horse, pretending to get that horse for the purpose of going to a certain place, to return that horse, and immediately going to sell the horse, without going to the place for which he had hired it; the jury found that prisoner guilty; upon which it was left to the judges, to say whether they were of opinion under the evidence, that he got possession of the horse merely for the purpose of converting it to his own use, under pretence of hiring it, and with a felonious intention to get possession of it, and the judges were unanimously of opinion, that in point of law, that was a felonious taking, although the delivery had been obtained from the proprietor: upon the authority therefore of that case; if you, gentlemen, are of opinion that this young man applied to Maydock for no other purpose but to get the mare into his possession, in order to sell her afterwards for money, and convert that money to his own use; upon that law which governs this case, it is my duty to tell you, that if that is your opinion on the evidence, the prisoner is guilty of the felony laid to his charge, in point of law; the question is, whether the evidence said before you, clearly satisfies your minds that the pains which this young man used to get Maycock to entrust the ward to his possession, under the pretence of going to Turnham-green to serve a subpoena, was a mere pretence, without any such intention in his mind at that time, and only made on purpose to get possession of the mare, in order to obtain the money by selling her; upon that the evidence to be sure is very strong, for in this case, the evidence of Landin proves an intention in the prisoner to sell the mare, before the first time of wanting to hire her to go to Haunshaw; and on the very same day he was applying to Maycock for the mare, on this very same day he was treating with Landin for the sale of her; one cannot help observing the extreme folly of the fact, for this unfortunate young man was known to both the persons with whom he was practising; he know he was personally known to Maycock; he knew he was personally known to Landin; they lived near each other, they knew each other; he told Landin it was Maycock's mare, therefore it was impossible he could have escaped detection, and he seems to have committed the fact with his eyes open in very uncommon degree; he made use of no false pretences to escape Landin; Landin knew the mare before, so that the utmost he could obtain by this, was the temporary possession of this money, at the risk of his life, and the chance of keeping out of the way; that extreme folly, to be sure, makes the story less probable, and renders stronger evidence necessary; but on consideration of the whole of the case, however foolish, and absurd, and mad the conduct of this young man has been, if it is sufficiently proved to your satisfaction, that the facts are true, the law must follow on those facts.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; that day, after I had called round my heat at three, it is general with us to patrole the other quarter till the half hour comes about; I was walking along Bell yard, facing Mr. Carter's house, and I saw the handle of something sticking up through the pallisadoes; I had the curiosity to put my hand, and lift it up; it was very heavy; I found it was a hammer, and I put it down in the same manner; I could see nobody; I stood at the door and saw the name of Mr. Carter, book-binder, and I judged it to be a beating-hammer; I went my beat, and came back again, and thought, what shall I do with this hammer? I will put it down and hide it; as I was putting it down, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, through the window; I spoke to him; says I, do you belong to the house? he made no reply, neither did he wag or stir; I thought he might belong to the house; I saw the casement open, and I said, why don't you take the hammer in, somebody will steal it, or take it away; he made no reply, and I rather spoke louder, I thought he might be hard of hearing; he still made no reply; I did not know what to do with the hammer; I cast my eye round, and saw one of my partners, a watchman; then I let the hammer lay, and went towards the watchman; says I, a hammer lays here, and I have spoke to the people of the house, and they will not take it in I turned back to she him where the hammer was; one jumped out of the window, and jumped over the rails, a young lad in light coloured clothes, that was somebody that had been with the prisoner; I could not lay hold of him; I only saw the colour of his clothes; then the prisoner came out, very close after him; I saw him come out; then says I, I see what you are at, I will take care of you; he said, he was doing nothing at all, only getting down there to pick up a halfpenny; I alarmed the house and took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Was any thing said to you before you was knocked down? - There was nothing said at all that I heard, I was stunned with the blow.</p>
               <p>What was you knocked down with? - I took it to be a fist, they both held me down and rifled my pockets.</p>
               <p>What did they take from you? - My watch, a crown piece, and 6 s. 6 d. in silver; the handkerchief off my neck, and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did you call out? - No, I could not, being stunned with the blow; I laid there for half an hour, and never could see any more of them.</p>
               <p>The men ran away? - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk? - A little, but not so drunk but I could remember something of it.</p>
               <p>Did the man that knocked you down come behind you, or on one side of you, or meet you? - They met me.</p>
               <p>Did you see the person that met you before he struck you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the persons so as to know them? - Yes, I knew them directly as soon as I saw them.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - Not very dark.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your watch again? - Yes, my wife found it as a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>How long were they rifling your pockets? - Not five minutes.</p>

               <p>Were not you frightened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that fright, being in liquor and stunned with the blow, two men you had never seen before, and in the night, can you pretend to say you know them again? - I know something of them.</p>
               <p>When did you see the men again? - This was on the 25th, I saw them at the Justice's on the 27th.</p>
               <p>For that two days you had not seen them? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Place. Will you venture to swear I was the man that knocked you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that, if you saw neither of them till after you were struck? - I did not remember them till afterwards.</p>
               <p>But how can you tell if you are knocked down by a man that you don't see, and rifled by another, how can you say which it was that knocked you down? - I believe that was the man and I always shall.</p>
               <p>But I want to know the reason of your belief? - I am sure he knocked me down, and the other rifled my pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harris. Did you ever see me before? - Never before you picked my pocket.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer; I had an information that two sweeps had knocked down a man on the Sunday night; I went on the 27th to the prisoner's lodgings, they lodge together in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's, I found Place at home, I told him I wanted him, he said what for; I told him for a robbery; I tied his hands, and seeing a box in the room I asked him whose it was, he said it was Harris's; the box was opened and I found twenty shillings and a duplicate of a watch. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>To Tomlinson. Is that your duplicate? - It is.</p>
               <p>PLACE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at a public-house; this young man came in and chucked down a guinea and asked me to drink with him, which I did, he said he had found a prize, I asked him what, and he said a watch, and, that he had pawned it for twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>HARRIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found it under some mud early in the morning, I had it several hours, I did not know what to do with it, and I pawned it; the prosecutor said before the Justice that he could not swear to us.</p>
               <p>To Billing. Did you say that before the Justice? - I did, I thought to have my property again without any farther trouble.</p>
               <p>Then you chose to swear falsely to save yourself trouble? - I swore nothing that was not true.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to them better now than you could then? - I have recollected since.</p>

               <p>Did you undress yourself? - Yes, I put my breeches under my head, and the rest of my clothes on the bed, and my shoes and buckles and hat under the bed, I waked about seven o'clock in the morning, and found all my clothes gone, and I was locked into the room; I could not tell what to do, I would have jumped out of window, but I could not get down; I found a poker in the room, with which I broke open the door, and a soldier that lodged in the under room lent me some clothes to go home in; he and I went about to try to find my clothes but could not find them; as I was going home I was told that the woman was taken, I went back and found the prisoner Hardiman in custody; she owned where Hoddy was, and then Hoddy was brought to the office.</p>
               <p>You only saw Hoddy the night before? - No, I went with Hoddy to a woman's where she had sold my shoes and hat; the Justice gave her the shoes and hat till the trial came on, and she has since run away, I found all the other things and they were produced before the Justice the next day.</p>

               <p>I am a coach-maker in Camomile-street; on Friday the 30th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning I observed the prisoner passing my house with a quantity of coach glass under his arm.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Yes, I have known him twenty years, he is a journeyman coach-maker, having heard but an indifferent character of him, I suspected him, and watched where he went to, he turned into Mr. Dick's a joiner, about half a dozen doors from me, I went there but he was gone, he had left the glasses; Mr. Dick was not at home.</p>
               <p>What glasses were they? - Two carriage-door glasses and some broken pieces, I desired he might be stopped when he came again; in the afternoon he came and told Mr. Dick he was very well known to me, and Mr. Dick brought him to me, I asked him how he came by the glasses, he said he had them of his son-in-law, I asked him what business his son-in-law was, he said he was in the horse-hair manufactory, I told him I thought it was strange such a person should have coach-glasses to sell; I told him he could have no objection to Mr. Dick's keeping the glasses till he fetched his son-in-law, he said he thought it perfectly right, and he went away; he came again on Monday; in the mean time I heard Mr. Wheatley had lost some glasses, and he was stopped on the Monday, and taken before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dick confirmed the evidence of Mr. Eades, and deposed, that when the prisoner came again on the Monday, he brought a young man with him, who said he had used him ill in stopping his property, but not the person that he pretended was his son-in-law, that he was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>(The glasses produced in court.)</p>

               <p>To Wheatley. Have you any mark by which you can know these glasses? - No, but I have some of the broken pieces that were left behind (producing them), the edges of which when laid together exactly correspond with those the prisoner left at Mr. Dick's.</p>

               <p>On the Thursday night I went to Oxford Road, to an old master of mine, to endeavour to get into the Charter-house; I met a coachman that I had known fourteen years ago, with these glasses under his arm; I bought them of him for a guinea, I thought I should get a shilling or two by them, though I did not very well know the value of it. I have worked with Mr. Eades when he was a journeyman.</p>
               <p>To Wheatley. Did the prisoner ever work for you? - No, he had worked at the next shop below mine.</p>
               <p>Where were the carriages standing from which the glasses were taken? - In the shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250029"/>Jury. Was the door broke open? - No, the prisoner had been seen about the shop over night, and in the morning the shop door was found open, we had heard a great noise in the night, and I got up, and searched the shop, but among such a vast number of carriages as we have, a person might easily conceal himself.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to prove that? - No, I did not wish to take his life.</p>
               <p>To Seeker. Whereabouts was it you saw the prisoner that morning? - A very little way from Mr. Wheatley's shop, he was going towards the city.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; he worked for me about six months; I found a parcel of things, as many as a man can stand under, at his lodgings, by a search warrant.</p>
               <p>(All the things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner was taken into custody; he fell a crying, and begged for mercy; said he would be a faithful servant to me, and never serve me so again; he said, I should have no reason to repent of overlooking it, if I would be so good to forgive him, and take him into my service again; I asked him how he could expect forgiveness from me, when I had been so very much distressed; I told him, I could not do any such thing; I had been almost ruined; I was present at the apprehending of the prisoner, and I knew the things.</p>

               <p>No man upon earth can swear to that piece of iron; it is a piece of new bar-iron; that watch-case that lays there, the boy brought out one day to burn, and he gave it me; I took it home, and had it repaired, and kept it on the mantle-piece, and the half-boots he was going publicly to sell to the shop's company; they were all mouldy; I bought them for six pence; the witness knows that; as to the other tools, Mr. Smith knows that he never checked me for carrying tools in my pocket; I had several articles; I was paid off from a man of war; I have a whole chest of tools; and I did my endeavour to do a little business for myself when I was out of work; I never took any thing with intent to keep it; the Monday before I was taken, I went to six a gate, and I did not return to the shop that night, there is a whole chest of tools now at the justices.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the apprentice boy offer to sell the half-boots? - I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Were these half boots left about the shop, mouldy and not used? - I never saw them mouldy.</p>
               <p>Were they left in the shop for the apprentice to do what he pleased with? - No, they were left off to be mended, and the apprentice might wear them; I cannot say he did not; I never saw him wear them; he seldom works with me; I know nothing of the watch-case.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to the prosecutors; on the 22d of May, about three o'clock, I was in the back ware-house; and a young man, fellow for handcuff shirt, requested me and said, there were two women and a girl in the shop in company together, whom he had suspicion of; I came forward, and the prisoner was being served with some Irish; I looked at them for about two minutes, and not observing any thing, I went to the other side of the counter, and saw the girl pick a piece of chintz cotton up from off the ground, and on her being observed she put it on the counter, and said it had fallen down; this confirmed my suspicions, and I desired them to walk backwards that I might send for a constable to search them; on the prisoner's going backwards, she went rather stooping as if endeavouring to conceal something; I desired her to walk along, and on her rising, I saw the piece of muslin which her clothes hid before; there was nothing else found on her, or the other two; I sent for a constable, and they were all taken to the compter; I delivered the goods to the constable; the grand jury, I have been informed, did not find a bill against the other two.</p>

               <p>I carried the mourning ring to Mr. Bunn's, I got it from the prisoner between the hours of five and six, I chare for her; I was passing by the door, and she asked me if I would go of an errand to pledge the ring for her, I took it to Mr. Bunn's and he refused it, I told him I had it from the prisoner; I then went back, and the prisoner sent her daughter, who is about ten years of age, with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was the first that was stopt with the ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And desired to give an account of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came Mrs. Wylae to ask you why you did not come on the Monday, was not she angry with you? - She was.</p>
               <p>Did not she use hard names? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>I shall soon make that appear, will you swear she did not? - She did not.</p>

               <p>Well, do not you know, that if you had not shifted this ring to Mrs. Wylae, you must have answered for it, and been tried for it? - I do not know, she took it off her finger and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Court. When you was first questioned about the ring, did not you know that unless you produced the person who gave it to you, you would have been liable to have been tried for it yourself? - Yes, my Lord; I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What do you mean by your having said you never was in a scrape before; do you mean you never was taken up? - I never was.</p>
               <p>When you returned from Bunn's, was she at home? - She was.</p>
               <p>You was taken into custody? - I was; I was in the Counter from Monday till Saturday.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure that the crown that was found in his pocket was yours? - Yes, the prisoner owned it.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made to him to induce him so to do? - No, Sir; there was nothing said, he said he looked upon it to be my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. You said that he looked upon it to be your property, that was what he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he say at the same time that he had found it in the yard? - Yes, not in the yard, he said he found it laying down by me.</p>
               <p>Why do you not tell us all that he said? - Tell it all!</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When the judge asked you just now whether any thing was said; you said, why no, nothing was said to induce him: was not it said that he had better tell the whole story, and no harm should come to him, and that he should not be hurt? - No, Sir, there was nothing said of that sort, there is no harm come of it.</p>
               <p>He told you he found the bag in the stable, and looked upon it to be your property? - Yes, when I first came home he was in the tap-room, he appeared to me to be sober enough.</p>
               <p>Was he sober when you went and took him? - As sober as I am now, and I am sure I am not drunk.</p>
               <p>Was the stable door open the whole time you was there? - The stable door was open, it was not dark.</p>
               <p>Jury. When did the man own he had thrown the bag away in Milk-street? - After he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the stable? - The Three Cups in Bread-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you known this man? - I cannot say how long, he did live at our house as horse-keeper.</p>

               <p>Had he any hat on? - No, he had not any hat on in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Had he any hat on when you first saw him? - I do not recollect as he had, to the best of my remembrance he had not; he struggled to get away, and I got him down as soon as I could and called for assistance, and the watchman came, and we took him to the watch-house; it was very well I happened to take him, if I had not, this truss of cloth would have been lost; my master might have thought ill of me, and I might have lost my place and my character as long as I live afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether this truss would not move by jolting on the stones? - I am very sure it did not, because it was so closely stoved in, I am sure it could not.</p>
               <p>Court. What distance might it be moved? - A yard and half.</p>
               <p>Was it tied in any way? - No, but it was packed in as close as could be, no shaking would ever have moved it.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was in it? - It is here, here is the man that sent it into our inn.</p>
               <p>Court. The yard and half that it was moved was backwards, towards the end of the waggon? - It was moved backwards as close as it could be, except it had been put out.</p>

               <p>Was he ever out of sight before Mr. Meakins took him? - Yes, he had turned the corner, he had got rid of the things, they were never found, except the trimming of the cloak which he dropped in the passage of the house.</p>
               <p>Are you certain he was the person? - Yes, I know him by his walk and his dress.</p>
               <p>Was he running? - No, walking very composedly.</p>
               <p>How far were you from him when you saw him going down the steps? - About a dozen yards.</p>

               <p>Did you see whether he had the things when he turned the corner? - No, I could not, because his back was to me, but if he had got rid of them before he turned the corner I must have seen him.</p>

               <p>Last Friday night was three weeks, I had lost an horse out of my own stables; and in going after her, I caught the prisoner with my neighbour's horse.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him with your neighbour's mare? - As I was coming up to London, he overtook me between Chadwell-street, and Illford, between two and three o'clock in the morning; I asked him whether he came through the town; he said yes; then I asked him whether he had seen a man on a brown mare with a white jacket on; he said he had.</p>
               <p>Did you know the mare at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near do you live to Manders? - A mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Manders's mare? Yes, I had known her above a twelvemonth; afterwards I heard Mr. Manders had lost his mare; and we pursued after her almost as far as the Rising-sun; I asked him how he came by her; I told him it was not his property, it belonged to a neighbour of mine; he said he had her from the Lion at Rumford; my man who was with me said, no, for you came through the turnpike with her at the same time I did, and that is beyond the Lion; then he said, his master had sent him overnight to fetch her from grass, and if we would go, he would shew us where his master lived; he said his master's name was Bushell, that he lived at Holywell mount; we let him get on the mare, and we followed him as far as the Red-lion, Whitechapel, and there we stopped him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was your neighbour's mare? - Yes, I will take take my oath of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 6th of June, I was at the Seven Stars in Whitechapel, about four o'clock in the afternoon. (Newell and Shepherd ordered out of court.) The prisoner came in and asked what time the Rumford coach went out; I told him it was gone, or nigh upon going, just at that minute the coach came by, and he left part of the beer he was drinking, and got upon the roof of the coach; on the Saturday morning, between four and five o'clock, I was going down Whitechapel-road, and saw him driving a mare before him towards town.</p>
               <p>In what manner was he driving her? - He was walking behind her with a postilion's short whip.</p>
               <p>Was she saddled and bridled? - There was no saddle.</p>
               <p>Was there a bridle? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>At what rate did he drive her? - Very slow, I was on the footpath and he in the road, I suspected him, because he went down with the Rumford coach but the night before, and I followed him; just at this side of Red-lion-street, Mr. Newell and his man came up and stopped.</p>
               <p>Were they on foot or on horseback? - They were on foot.</p>
               <p>Which way did they come from? - From Whitechapel Church; but when I first saw them they were standing at Mr. Crabb's, the butcher's door.</p>
               <p>Did you see them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before? - Not above a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner with the mare when you saw them at Crabb's door? - Passing by.</p>
               <p>They followed him then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far from Crabb's door was it that they stopped him? - About twenty doors, they stopped him at the end of Red-lion-street.</p>
               <p>How near were you to him when they stopped him? - I was opposite them, they in the road and I in the foot way, when they stopped him, I went up to them.</p>
               <p>Did they call you? - No, I went of my own accord, when I went up they were asking him how he came by the mare; he said it was his master's, he had fetched it from grass; I asked him if any body thereabouts knew him, he said the landlord at the sign of the Tewkesbury Church.</p>
               <p>What did Newell say? - He said it was his neighbour's mare; we took the prisoner to the Tewkesbury Church, the landlord said he knew nothing at all of him; I asked him where his master lived, he said at Holywell-mount; I told him he was going from Holywell-mount; we took him before a Magistrate, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in Whitechapel-road was it you first saw him? - On this side of the hospital.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the place where he was stopped? - It is about four furlongs, near half a mile.</p>
               <p>(Levi ordered out of court.)</p>
               <p>Newell called in again. Where was it you first saw this man? - Between Rumford and Ilford.</p>
               <p>How far from Whitechapel? - About nine miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250046"/>Were you on foot or on horse-back? - On horse-back.</p>
               <p>Was Shepherd on foot or on horse-back? - On horse-back.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner on foot or on horse back? - On horse-back.</p>
               <p>Then he went on before you? - Yes, my man went back after our own horse, and then I heard that Manders had lost his; then I went to meet my man and we both followed him, and overtook him at the Rising Sun.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Whitechapel? - About four miles and a half, he galloped as fast as he could and we after him.</p>
               <p>After you overtook him, at that time did he ride slow or fast? - He rode gently, he could not get the mare on, he had rode her so hard he was obliged to get off and drive her.</p>
               <p>How far from Whitechapel did he get off and drive her? - Some where about Bow.</p>
               <p>Did you keep with him? - After him.</p>

               <p>Near Red-lion-street? - I cannot say whether it was beyond, or on this side of Red-lion-street, but it was as near Red-lion-street as could be.</p>
               <p>Were you on foot or on horse-back then? - I had got off my horse, and my man held all the three horses while we went into the Tewkesbury Church.</p>
               <p>How came you to go in there? - Because he said he knew the man that lived there.</p>
               <p>Did you take him into the Tewkesbury Church, before you fetched the constable? - He went in of his own accord, and we followed him.</p>
               <p>Did any body there know him? - No, the man that did live there I understood was gone.</p>
               <p>It was after that that you went over to the constable's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How was the shop secured? - The shop is nineteen feet from the ground, it is open in front, there is no door to it, it stands upon a wall in a yard, which is fastened with gates.</p>
               <p>Then any body that gets into the yard may get into the shop? - Yes, there is a lower shop in which we keep deals, and there is a step-ladder which goes from the lower shop through a place left open in the cieling into the upper shop; my master's house stands in the yard.</p>
               <p>After they are in the yard, they can go into the shop without opening either door or window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you miss your tools? - The next morning; my tool-chest was broke open and some of my tools gone, I found a window on that side the shop that looks into the garden open, and a pane of glass broke.</p>
               <p>Was it a sash? - No, a casement.</p>
               <p>Where did it look into? - Into a Mr. Salter's garden.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether that window was shut down when you left the shop? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the pane of glass was not broke before? - Yes, I am; I saw the impression of a ladder's foot on the ground under the window; I desired the people the garden belonged to, to let me examine it, which they did; I traced a man's foot to a wall eight or nine feet high on the further side of the garden, it is a wall that runs between two gardens, on the other side of that wall I traced the foot again across the garden to another wall next the street, which is about ten feet high on the inside, and about six on the outside, there I found the ladder lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>What length is the ladder? - Seventeen feet four inches; on the inside of the wall next the street, there was an impression of a man's foot six inches deep where he had jumped over, it was wet weather and the ground was soft, and that foot I traced to the work shop and back again; I suspected the prisoner, and enquired where he worked, but I could not learn; on the 20th of May, I went to Mr. Childs's, where the prisoner lodged, and there I found part of my property, I found a plane and square at the building where the prisoner was at work at Knightsbridge; I got a constable and took the prisoner into custody, he said he had bought the tools.</p>

               <p>I heard of the prisoner being taken up, and came to town to have a particular account of it, and on the 29th of May, I went to the shop where the prosecutor was at work, he said he did not want to hurt the prisoner, but he could not get him to make it up he was so obstinate; he said he had been for advice to a lawyer, and he asked the lawyer whether the shop and house being on one wall was not both as one, that the lawyer told him it was; he said he was in hopes he should be hanged, and then he should get 40 l. reward, which would pay him for the loss of his tools.</p>

               <p>And afterwards that he hoped to convict him, and get the 40 l. reward? - Yes.</p>

               <p>To Hodgson. Is this true? - No, this man came to me and wanted me to make it up, I said it was out of my power, that justice must take its course, that was all that passed.</p>

               <p>Did you know Young before? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I am very certain of it; when Lockey came he claimed the shoes, and we put him in the way to find the old man Ruff, and he gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250056"/>up the young one; I believe the old man is rather impaired in his intellects.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of June, I had my house broke open; about a quarter after 4 o'clock in the morning I heard a noise, I thought some of the servants were got up to washing, and I did not take my further notice of it; but when the servants got up about 6 o'clock, they informed me that the house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Who was last up the night before? - I believe the house-keeper was last up, but I was up till 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Were the doors and windows all fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know that yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was it in the morning? - The kitchen door was wrenched open, which opened into the yard; the adjoining house is an empty house, through which we suppose they came; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, the copper was taken out of the brick work; I heard that a person had been stopped at Clerkenwell with a large pot, I enquired and found the man that had stopped him.</p>
               <p>Who was he? - His name is Isaacs.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of this month, about a quarter past 5 in the morning, I was going out about some business, I saw the prisoner Lee, with a copper upon his head going down a court opposite to my house, where Hyser has an apartment; I immediately went up to him and took him into custody, I took the copper from him, and as I was taking the copper home to my own house, I saw the prisoner Hyser, about twenty yards from me with a large black pot upon his back, upon seeing me he ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250063"/>back again with the pot; I took Lee to prison immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Hyser that you saw? - I am very positive it was him, when I came back from taking Lee to prison, I saw Hyser coming out of the court towards Turnmill-street without any thing, I took him into custody immediately; there was the mark of the black pot upon his back, and I took him to prison; the prosecutor afterwards came to my house and claimed the copper, I went and tried it into the brick-work, and it fitted exactly.</p>

             at Brompton; I am her maid; I resigned the key up to this man to bring away some wine, likewise some empty bottles, and the key of the house, and several articles which were in the house, which was to be removed to the house in James-Street, Westminster, which she left, the third house on the Terrace, on the right hand; I cannot rightly tell the day, but to the best of my knowledge, I think it was about this day fortnight; Thursday evening I gave him the key of the house, to bring away the things remaining in the house; two dozen of wine, some empty bottles, some pickles, and several articles which were left in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250068"/>What was the prisoner? - He assisted in moving the furniture from James-Street, to Brompton; he waters the horses at Buckingham-Gate; he has been a Hackney coachman.</p>
               <p>What was your place in the kitchen? - I am cook.</p>
               <p>Does your lady keep a housekeeper? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor a maid of her own? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>How came you to be trusted with the key of the house? - My mistress entrusted me with the key; I packed up the wine myself; I was removing the furniture, and was in the house last; I have lived with her between four and five years; I packed up the wine in a large hamper; I left it in a house behind in the yard; gave him the key on a Thursday; he was to bring the things at his leisure times; there was no particular time set for him to bring them; on the Sunday evening he came to Brompton; I asked him where the key of the house was, and the reason he did not bring it, and the things he had to bring, he said, he had delivered the key up to the landlady, and there was no wine left in the house; I asked him where the remainder of the things were; he said they were a pack of d - d dirty rubbish, old trumpery things, that he had given them to an old woman about the streets; I expressed the wine particularly; he said no, it was not there, for he helped the wine into the cart himself when we were moving; I told him if the wine was not there, it had certainly been taken away out of the house by him, or somebody that he knew; on the Monday I went to fetch the wine, and the man with me, and I thought it must be some where there, but there was not any thing in the house, but two or three bottles of stuff that was not of any consequence in the least, and two bottles of salt water.</p>
               <p>How did you get into the house? - I went to the landlady for a key, with the man with me to fetch the wine away, neither of them would do any thing; then it was almost nine at night, on Sunday evening; on the Tuesday, I went to Mr. Wright's office, and took out a warrant against him, and we found the man watering the horses at Buckingham-gate; we asked him particularly as we went in, whether he knew any thing of the wine; he expressed very much that he knew nothing of it; we took him to Mr. Wright's, and had his apartments searched, and found thirteen bottles of liquors in his apartments; I cannot rightly say what, and several things which we did not expect to see, was there, such as pictures, two of them green birds, which I cannot swear to, and my mistress's coat of arms, and my mistress's crest, I think it was; a cannister, and a great many things I do not chuse to swear to; these pictures were my mistress's; there was something more left in the empty house, which was locked up in an empty closet, which was some empty bottles, that was all that was left in the house, and likewise a napkin.</p>
               <p>What liquor was it? - I cannot tell, it was different sorts; I am pretty sure it is my mistress's, but I do not chuse to swear to it, but the pictures I am sure of; I have some here that will pattern them in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Mrs. Sibley, this lady was moving? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Most of her things had been moved? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The rubbish was left to be moved by this man at his leisure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No particular time fixed? - No, no particular time fixed, as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of all the things left behind? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of this old towel? - It is valued in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Because you are a judge of it; you belong to the kitchen; do you think it was worth three-pence or four-pence? - Yes, Sir, and a great deal more; it is not an old towel.</p>
               <p>A young one then; now cookey, this towel that has no darns in it, and these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250069"/>other things, this man was to bring when it suited him, and when it was convenient for him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You found him at his work at Buckingham-gate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he worked there, cook? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him working there without any sort of imputation on his character, cook? - I have known him working there.</p>
               <p>Is not there a little matter of vails to the cook upon moving? - That I do not understand.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him: half a year? - More than that.</p>
               <p>Two years? - Near two years.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, Mrs. Cook, and you seem a choice spirit too, did you ever hear any body whisper any thing against the man's character in your life? - I will not be upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, woman, during the two years this man was working there daily and nightly, did you hear any thing against his character? - I never heard any thing against his character till he came to move our goods, never in my life, my mistress sent for him.</p>
               <p>She had employed him during the time she had lived in James Street? - Yes, he had been in the house for some weeks waiting on a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Mrs. Cook, had not there been a little misunderstanding between you and this man that had been in the house for some weeks? - I knew nothing of the man.</p>
               <p>But he knew something of you and something of some other man, was not there some misunderstanding? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes, Sir, I will swear that there was no misunderstanding at all that I know of, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Had you never any words with him before you quitted James Street? - Yes Sir; no Sir; not any thing particular at all.</p>
               <p>Neither in anger nor otherwise, do you mean to swear, because he will contradict you if you do, that you had no misunderstanding, no dispute, no quarrel with this man before you went out of St. James's Street? - No Sir, none at the time of moving that I knew of.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that after this man was brought into the house of your mistress, you and he never had any words of any sort? - No words, not to my recollection in the least; I do not recollect any words.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you had words with him, and quarrelled with him? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you had none? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No dispute of any sort? - No.</p>
               <p>No words with him of any sort? - None.</p>
               <p>What place did you find these things in his lodgings? - In his bed chamber.</p>
               <p>Were they concealed? - No, they were hung round about his drawers over a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Had he brought any thing to Mrs. Hervey's before you went to his room? - No Sir, he had brought nothing.</p>
               <p>Was not the first charge you made against him for taking a washing stool, a hair broom, and a tray? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not it in answer to that; that he told you they were such rubbish he had given them away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, at that time was there one syllable mentioned of any wine? - Yes; I asked him where it was, he said, he saw no wine.</p>
               <p>Did not you before the magistrate first accuse him of this washing stool, this hair broom and tray? - Yes, because he owned to nothing else; the washing stool is in the landlady's yard, the man told me so.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of it? - It is of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Was there any permit for moving this wine, was not the man to carry the wine as he could so as to avoid the Excise officers? - He was to bring it to our house at his leisure; I do not know there was any particular time; I cannot tell whether he was to bring it two bottles at a time.</p>
               <p>Were not these his instructions, to bring it a few bottles at a time? - No Sir, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250070"/>instructed to bring it two bottles at a time, his instructions were to bring the wine there was two dozen.</p>
               <p>Was not he told if he attempted to bring the two bottles at a time it was liable to seizure; was not he so told? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear that? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Never in your life? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he was expressly told so? - No Sir, I do not know that; my mistress gave him his orders to bring the things, she told him to bring the things; he was to bring them at his leisure, I suppose there was no particular time mentioned; it could not be a great while, because the key must be delivered up at such a time on quarter day.</p>
               <p>When did you give it him? - This day fortnight, all the things were cleared out, and the key delivered up a fortnight ago almost.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I only know that the man was employed to assist me in removing the goods from Brompton, I slept in the house at Brompton a week before Mrs. Hervey went into it, after all the things were moved except two dozen of wine, he had the key, he never came near the place till Sunday; I do not know of my own knowledge what things were left in the house; on the Monday evening my master lay dead in the house at Brompton, the next morning I went with this servant girl to Mr. Justice Wright's office, who granted a warrant to have him taken up on suspicion, when he went before Mr. Wright in the coach, he first of all denied the wine, I told him we did not wish to have any thing done to him, if he would only tell what was done with it, as the maid was accused; he said he knew nothing of the wine, but he had the washing stool, the broom and the tray; a search warrant was granted, we went down to bring these things, and when we went into the house, to our great surprize we found the property in this hamper which is a part of the wine; fifteen bottles of something I cannot say what it was, there was one empty pint bottle with a label of my own hand writing, lavender.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is not in the indictment? - They are now in the hamper two of them the officers and the people present drank; and the thirteen were in the hamper, one of the bottles was red port, I did drink of it, I cannot say what the other was; Mr. Wright tasted it, he said it was wine, but did not know what sort; there were seven pictures framed and glazed, and three that I can swear to, as having the fellows of them, I have often seen them besides, here they are.</p>
               <p>(Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Do you know this little picture? - Yes, by having the fellow to it; this I brought with me yesterday morning from Brompton.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know them or not? - Perfectly well by sight, I am perfectly clear they were Mrs. Hervey's, they were hung up against the wainscot in the prisoner's room, and I had hung them in Mrs. Mervey's room.</p>

            . I know them perfectly well, I am very sure they are the very same.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the prisoner say when these things were found? - When we came before a justice nothing was said, he was committed for re-examination; all the articles besides those have been removed before, every body knew he had those to remove, he spoke of the wine when the cart was at the door; the prisoner said it was not well pack'd, let it lay, and he would bring it with him; the wine was to be brought by the prisoner, it was no secret.</p>
               <p>No particular time was fixed I understand, for the time he was to remove them, was at his leisure? - Undoubtedly, yet Sir there would have been very great satisfaction in having it brought.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250071"/>Then you allowed him from the Thursday to the Monday, and then you got a search warrant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mrs. Sibley? - Ever since I knew Mrs. Hervey.</p>
               <p>Had there been any little misunderstanding in the family? - No, he did clean shoes and go of errands for a gentleman in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He was a very welcome guest, a great man likes to have a deputy always; was not there a little misunderstanding between the cook and him? - How am I to understand what you mean?</p>
               <p>Do not you know that before you quitted James-street, this man and the cook had had a misunderstanding? - I never heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - Three or four months, I have known Mrs. Hervey's family three or four years, I went to assist in apprehending him, I found him in his usual business, he had been spoken to on this about the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath down to the time was taken into custody by the advice of this justice, who is deaf and hears nothing you have said, did you ever hear any thing against his character? - Never, if I had heard any thing against him, I should not have wished to have had him about me.</p>
               <p>Every body knew he had the care of these things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I was at the moving of these things from James-street to Brompton, the maid servant had the order to give the key in, she gave me the key, and told me not to let her mistress know any thing about it, and I kept the key a day or two, and the owners asked me to resign these things up, I kept the things to carry them at my leisure time, for which I had an order; I was asked to go out with a coach for a master I lived with because his man was was taken ill.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to deny that you had any of these things? - My meaning was to carry them home.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four respectable witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>How long? - From the time she was at school, I can say nothing against her; she came from Drury-lane, and called upon me, and begged I would lend her a guinea to go down to Manchester, and I did.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I cannot tell the day, I know very little of the prosecutor, I never heard her say any thing against the girl.</p>

               <p>I have been here yesterday, the prosecutor said to me that she would wish to have the girl cast, that she might get 40 l. by the prisoner; that is all that I know of it.</p>
               <p>Court. How came she to say this to you? - She knows me, and I know her, so she came up to me and said, you are intending here? I said, yes, I am obliged to intend here; says she, I wish to God that my prisoner would weigh forty; says I, what does she mean? to another woman; says the woman, she means to hang her: I know the prosecutor very well, I did not know the girl.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never spoke to her; she set some bad women upon me, and I was obliged to give charge to the constable of her, I never spoke to her, never mentioned a word to her, I never knew her, only she passed by my house several times; she has been at my house, I keep a shop, she has bought garden-stuff of me; the constable is at the gate in a kind of claret coloured coat, but I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>The prisoner is my daughter, this woman was over at the King's-Head, at Stratford, in Essex, and sent for my child and told her there was a place for her; she went and came home and said, mother, I have a place, I will go to it to-morrow; I lost her for twelve days, I happened to go down Church-street, and saw her there, I said, Sally, Sally, have you got to Mrs. Breeds? because she had a child by a man of that name who lived at Stratford, our parish allowed her 2 s. a week; a young woman that is on the outside now, went on the Monday, and she told her as soon as ever she could get an opportunity she would run away, she took half her things and half she left behind her, and her boxes; and this woman that swears against her, has keys that unlocks her box and her little trunks; she lent me her keys to unlock them; when my daughter run away she went to her sister at the other end of the town, and borrowed a guinea to go down to Manchester, then she came up to me, and they came and took her into custody; they turned and tossed all my things about, I lost a silver tea-spoon, a pair of white cotton stockings, a silver three-pence, the things all lay about the room when I came in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prosecutor come to your house to enquire after your daughter? - Yes, she came and asked me if my daughter was come home, I said no; oh! says she, she has robbed me; says I, she has not been here, nor has she got half her things as I am informed; says she, here is my bunch of keys, and you may unlock the box and see, which I did.</p>
               <p>Had your daughter been in her service before? - When she was big with child with this last, a chance child that she had by young

               <p>Jury. Is this your own daughter? - Yes, and she served seven years in the charity-school, I have but two alive; I have another whose husband belongs to the India-house, and rents a house of 50 l. a year, she did not tell me the second time where she was going to live, for I knew her to be a bad woman; the first time she enticed her away from one Mr. Jourdan's in Spital-fields, I did not know where she was.</p>
               <p>Your daughter did not behave very well, I doubt? - Why my Lord, she is but young, very young, and she was brought up in the school.</p>

               <p>Have not you a recollection then? - I think she told me that her husband was a creditor.</p>
               <p>Did she say that her husband was the executor? - No, she did not, I believe, she said her husband was the attorney of the executor, the I told her it was necessary her husband should come himself; I dare say I asked her name, but I cannot recollect I did, all that I recollect was that her name was Murphy, but I am not sure to the christian name, because I always called her Mrs. Murphy.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she tell you that her name was Murphy? - Yes, I believe she has told me so; I do not recollect the time, but in the course of the business she told me her name was Murphy.</p>
               <p>During any part of the transaction afterwards, did you see the other prisoner with her? - I have since that time.</p>
               <p>Did they pass as man and wife then? - I always understood and looked upon them as man and wife.</p>
               <p>When you told her that she not being the executrix of course could not prove the will, what did she say? - I do not recollect what she might say, I suppose she might say she would bring her husband.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not suppose, tell us what she said, tell us what passed on the occasion, what you said and she said? - I think at the time she came and offered the will, I finding she was not the executrix, I enquired I suppose -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not suppose about it, tell us what you know and no more? - Perceiving she was not the executrix, I naturally asked her if she had not a husband.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask her that? - I am not certain, but think from the nature of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250076"/>business I must, I told her when she told me that her husband was the attorney of the executor and was a creditor, I am sure she told me that, I told her he must come and take administration with the will annext, as the attorney of the executor; she told me at the time her husband had a power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Did any thing else pass between you by way of question, from your observation from her where the executor himself was? - I made enquiry after the executor, I am not sure whether she said he was at sea or in Ireland, it was either one or the other, I think it was in Ireland.</p>
               <p>What more passed between you at that time? - I believe nothing more.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she leave the will with you? - I have it not in my recollection whether she did or not; she came in a day or two with Mr. Landy who was my clerk at that time, he spoke to her, I did not see her, I did not see her some time after that, for Mr. Landy did the business; several times afterwards I saw her again.</p>
               <p>Did any thing particular ever happen at any of the times subsequent when you saw her? - No, I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Did any thing pass between you and him? - I do not recollect any thing.</p>
               <p>What did he come for? - He came at different times afterwards, finding a caveat was entered by two proctors.</p>
               <p>Had you yourself in consequence of this, taken any steps in the business? - No, I did not take any steps.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing that ever passed between you and Timothy on the subject.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever heard the husband say any thing about it, one thing or the other? - I have several times since the administration was got under seal, the husband first came, in some time after her application to me, it was before administration was granted.</p>
               <p>Did the husband when you first saw him come with the wife or not? - That I do not recollect, it is so long ago I cannot tell, I have seen him at different times with her and without her, but the first time I do not recollect whether he came with her, or without her, he came the first time about this business, I do not recollect what he said.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you heard him say any thing about this? - The first time, I cannot recollect the exact time, but I recollect that he, upon representing how the business was to him.</p>
               <p>At the time you are going to speak of now, did he come with the wife or alone? - He came so often that I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>I want to know when he first interfered in this business, and said any thing to you about this will, or whether he ever did? - Several times, but he came so often I cannot say whether he came alone, he came oftener alone, sometimes with his wife.</p>
               <p>When did you first understand from himself that he had any thing at all to do with this will? - It must be some short time after the wife first came to me, but how long I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Then when you understood that he had any thing to do with this will, what did he say about it? - I do not recollect the words that he said.</p>
               <p>Can you tell nearly, can you tell the exact particular part of what he said? - He asked me once who the parties were that entered the caveat, I told him.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - I told him the nature of the proceedings in our court in those cases, and upon that he told me to warn the proctors to the caveats.</p>
               <p>Did he himself make use of that expression? - I told him the nature of the process of our courts; accordingly the proctors to the caveats were warned.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the husband Timothy ever tell you what he had to do with this will? - He appeared as the attorney of the executor.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any power of attorney? - He did produce the power of attorney in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250077"/>my office, I have not got it, there is a gentleman who has it, who is a witness, I saw it afterwards, I did not see him produce it at that time.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any talk with him about that warrant of attorney afterwards? - Not in particular any more than as the attorney of the executor, I was to warn the other proctors to the caveats, and assign a time to appear before the court accordingly; I do not recollect whether I appeared that day on the court day or not myself, but both proctors were assigned to exhibit proxies as the proctors for the creditor was to exhibit affidavit or shew bond; accordingly after the form of the court, there was a proxy exhibited by Timothy, authorizing me to appear as proctor.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect about when that was? - The date of it will shew.</p>
               <p>Did you take any step yourself when you was apprized of the caveat being entered, did you enquire at all into the ground why a caveat was entered against this will? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you do the business yourself or your clerk? - I was ill at the time and the clerk did the business.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>We understand from the last witness that you are the principal man in his office? - I suppose I was rather accurate in the business.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect either the prisoners or one of them coming to Mr. Christian? - I can recollect particularly the woman, she came first to the best of my recollection, I was there when she first came, she produced a will, this is the will, there are some figures upon it of my writing.</p>
               <p>What was said to her? - I am afraid I shall not be able to recollect the circumstance; we found the will could not be proved from the account she gave, I do not know whether I can attempt to particularize the words; we found that there was a power of attorney, and soon after it was brought.</p>
               <p>Who brought that power of attorney? - There was such a group of them, there was

                  Philip

            , and there was the two prisoners; I do not know which it was that came first, I am sure I cannot swear positively to the power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Did any of them bring a power of attorney? - Yes, there was one brought, but I cannot tell who brought it.</p>
               <p>How soon after

             had been the first time was it that this power of attorney was produced? - Some few days after; then the prisoner Timothy came and Philip was with him once or twice, but whether Timothy came alone that time I cannot say, I have seen them altogether repeatedly; they gave proper instructions that a proxy should be drawn.</p>
               <p>Is that the proxy, and are you a witness to it? - This proxy is of my own engrossing and executing.</p>
               <p>Did you see Timothy execute that? - I cannot recollect positively, it was some little time after this proxy was signed.</p>
               <p>Are you in the habit of witnessing things that you do not see signed? - We see them signed, but we do not take any particular notice of the parties.</p>
               <p>Court. Then all that you know is, that you saw somebody sign this? - A Timothy Murphy did sign it; to the best of my belief it was the prisoner, but I cannot swear positively, because there was another person, Philip; I should know

             instantly, the prisoner was not Philip, I have seen the prisoner Timothy in that office.</p>
               <p>Had they any business at that office, but relative to this will? - No other that I know of; I left his service almost immediately after that proxy was signed; he has no clerk now that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Then understand that you cannot swear positively that the prisoner was the person that signed this? - I cannot; I can swear positively, that I have seen Timothy at that office, but whether or no he signed this proxy, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>To Christian. Who is the other witness? - He has left my service, I do not know where he is at present, I shall very likely see him, I do not know where he went to from me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was clerk to Messrs. Bishop and Weller, I have seen both the prisoners before at the office of Messrs. Bishop and Weller several times.</p>
               <p>Upon what occasion, and upon what business was it that you saw them? - A caveat was entered in the month of January. 1786; in May, the same year, Mr. Jenner entered a caveat also; and about two months after that there was a caveat entered, they both brought in their wills.</p>
               <p>Which will did the prisoners both or either of them bring? did they bring you any will? - I cannot say, we were not for them, we were for a creditor, Ryan.</p>
               <p>Upon what occasion was it that you have seen the prisoners, or either of them? - By reference from Mr. Christian, I believe they were referred to me from Mr. Christian.</p>
               <p>Did they come to you? - Several times, some times together, and sometimes otherwise.</p>
               <p>When you saw them separate, what was the business they came upon? - About the business of Ready.</p>
               <p>In what character? - As the attorney, I fancy.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not fancy, tell us what they said? - If you will give me leave, I will tell the circumstance; Mr. Christain, I believe, was arrested by some of his creditors, and he was under confinement for some considerable sum, during this confinement I believe Mr. Jenner declined proceeding, the prisoners came with a power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Did they produce any power of attorney? - The power of attorney which I have brought, this is it.</p>
               <p>Who produced that power of attorney? - They were both together.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you know this power of attorney by? - I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Then you are sure that is the one that they produced? - Yes, I then told them that I should do nothing; I went in to the register, and looked at the will, and the appearance was not very well, and I told them I should do nothing for Mr. Christian, or them in business, unless I was satisfied it was a fair and proper will; and I told them there had been a great many frauds, and bad wills that were brought, and I should do nothing without I was satisfied; they told me they did not know whether it was a fair will or no, but there was one of the witnesses in London, but it had been delivered to them by a man who had made a power of attorney to them.</p>
               <p>Were they both together then? - Yes, I believe they were; I did not prepare a warrant till I was satisfied in my own mind that the will was proper, and had been inspected before it bore the seal of the office; still I suspected it; some time after this, they brought a person who said he had witnessed the will; I asked him a great many questions about it, I did not shew him the will, but I asked him to wrote his name.</p>
               <p>Were the prisoners present? - I cannot say particularly that they were, but I could almost venture to say that they were, because he could not know where to come without them; the man wrote his name to this paper.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot receive that as evidence against the prisoners, what he said; when you are sure the prisoners were present you may tell us. Were the prisoners both or either of them present, when you had this conversation with the witness? - I should rather think so.</p>
               <p>But you must be sure of it; will you swear it? - I may venture, I think, with safety so to do, I cannot say; I know I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250080"/>a long conversation with the witness, and I will tell you his answer.</p>
               <p>Court. No, we cannot hear that? - I am sure that one of the prisoners brought the man to the office.</p>
               <p>But was either of the prisoners present, and in the hearing of that conversation? - I should not choose to swear positively that they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot hear what he said? - In consequence of this I

               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you send Mitchell with the parties? - I rather think Mitchell did not attend the swearing; I rather think that one of Mr. Christian's clerks did.</p>

               <p>Is that the one? - I cannot take upon myself to say.</p>
               <p>To March. Did you send that plate to be repaired? - No Sir,</p>
               <p>Who did? - Messrs. Mount and Page, I cannot say whether this is that that was repaired, I have had it in my possession these five or six years.</p>
               <p>To Gale. Have you a doubt about it? - I have not a doubt but this is an impression from this plate in the state it is in at present; it appears to be a repaired plate, here is a mark in the plate that has been done by some accident, and the motto is wrong, it is officie instead of officii.</p>
               <p>Court. Then this is the very same plate that was attempted to be proved here before on another trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Yes, my Lord, it was, and it failed.</p>
               <p>March. I do not keep in memory when we send our plates to our employers.</p>
               <p>How long have you had that plate in your possession in the state in which it now is? - I believe four or five years.</p>
               <p>Can you say that it was not longer than that? - No, I do not think it was longer.</p>
               <p>Have not you had it in your possession nine years? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>To Gale. When did you alter the plate? - I do not know when it was altered, if it is the same plate, it was the 2d of April, 1783, but whether this is the same plate I cannot say.</p>
               <p>To Davidson. Had you ever any altered but this? - We had but one, I can't recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Court. We tried at it before.</p>
               <p>What became of the plate that was altered? - It was repaired and was sent to Mr. March.</p>
               <p>Mr. March. I have had the plate I dare say four or five years, I have had no other will plate but that, I really cannot say how long I have had it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. Pray Mr. Byrne how long had you been at the Hummums? - How long had I lived there?</p>

               <p>Did you hear my question? I will explain it? - I had been at the Hummums,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250088"/>I believe about a month; my master lodged there, his name is Hilton, he is a Lancashire man, I believe he is at the university of Cambridge; I had lived with him two years, and travelled abroad, I am almost sure he is at the university of Cambridge, I was, discharged on account of attending this prosecution, he said I might come down to him again if I chose.</p>
               <p>Was your master at the Hummums at that time? - He was not.</p>
               <p>How long had he been absent from the Hummums? - He comes there in the course of twenty-four hours, for about an hour or two.</p>
               <p>You, I take it for granted, had a proper room appointed for you to sleep in at the Hummums? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was too much a man of fashion for that; do you usually carry all your money in your pocket? - No, Sir, never; I generally carry about a guinea in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Upon this occasion you happened to have it all? - Not all the stock.</p>
               <p>You had been in the city? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been in company in the city? - I had been at an ale-house, opposite the mansion-house.</p>
               <p>You was drinking a little matter? - I drank, I believe in the course of an hour or two a pint of beer, and an overtaker.</p>
               <p>That is a thing that makes one drunk, overtakes the little intellect one has and puts it to rest: So you had walked from the mansion-house to Bridges-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were quite sober I take it for granted? - I was sober and sensible.</p>
               <p>And therefore having picked up a woman and going to a house where they would not take two women in wish you, you went home to deposit your cash, and left five guineas, and brought the rest out; then you picked up the same woman and went to the same hotel, and asked her to go with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She said lord! lord! did she not say my lord? you was the Italian Count that night, was not you? - I was Mr. Byrne.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you represent yourself to be an Italian Count; now, I ask you seriously? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I am upon my oath now.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you did not that night at the hotel, represent yourself to be an Italian count, a foreign count? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>A foreign nobleman; upon the oath you have taken did not you represent yourself to be a foreign nobleman? - No, for the third time I did not.</p>
               <p>So then you had the usual compliments on these occasions, cakes and wine, and so on: Did you ask for change for a 50 l. note when you went into the house? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then of course you were not answered by the waiter, that you had better change a one and twenty shilling piece, instead of a 50 l. note? - The waiter came in when I called him, and says I, what have we to pay, that was after we had been two hours there, I gave the waiter a guinea, and he gave me change.</p>
               <p>Then you swear you did not say any thing about changing the 50 l. note? - I might mention something to the girl about changing a note, but I do not know what I said about it.</p>
               <p>Do not talk about might, what did you say? these gentlemen do not let any foreign noblemen so impose upon them? - As I have been a clerk in the city, I perhaps might mention something.</p>
               <p>Where was you clerk in the city? - At several places, at Martini, Martini, and Company, in Winchester-street, about four years ago; and that is the reason I might talk about bank notes, and things of that kind.</p>
               <p>So when you get to a bawdy-house, having been clerk to a banker, you talk always regularly about bank-notes? - No, I might say some trifling matter; I have already said what I have to say on the subject.</p>
               <p>Court. You have already told us, you did not ask for change of a 50 l. bank-note?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250089"/>- No, I did not, we were in conversation and singing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. To what tune do you set your conversation about a bank-note, Mr. Count, which of your Italian tunes? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>You must recollect, as I shall presently have my Lord's authority for desiring you, and we will judge about your sobriety presently? - I tell you again that I really do not recollect what I might say; I might say something about it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know you did? - I certainly know I did, I know I might say something.</p>
               <p>What did you say about a bank-note? - I really do not know what I said about it, it might be some trifling matter of no consequence, upon my oath, I do not recollect what I did say, I might say something about a bank-note, I know very well I might say in the course of conversation.</p>
               <p>Court. He says they were singing; who else was there? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was a duet then? - Only us three.</p>
               <p>And you were amusing yourselves singing for two hours? - Part of the time singing, part of the time drinking, part in conversation.</p>
               <p>Attend, because your answers are taken down in short-hand: Did not you ask for change for a 30 l. note? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask for change for 30 l. and you was answered by the waiter if it was a 50 l. he could give you change? - No, I was not so answered, I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner Hughes say, she supposed it would come to a 10 l. note, and at last to a twenty-one shilling piece? - I do not recollect any such conversation.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it did not pass? - I do not know what conversation she might have with the waiter.</p>
               <p>Will you swear she did not? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Now, will you go further and swear that no such thing passed, because to this there are two witnesses, that you asked for change for a 30 l. note, and was told if it was a 50 l. they would change it, and the woman said it would come down to a twenty-one shilling piece? - I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that no such conversation passed, because a man so flush of money would have said, I do not want change? - I had more prudence than you might have had perhaps in such a case.</p>
               <p>Therefore you left five guineas at home, and carried out twenty-seven; however that was your prudence which you take to be very much above mine? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did not that conversation pass that I have stated? - Conversation about what?</p>
               <p>You have forgot it? - What about the bank-note?</p>
               <p>Aye, about the bank note? - I'll swear I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Was not this the conversation that led to your giving the man the guinea to change, after flourishing with all your countships about 50 l.? - I paid him a guinea.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit the service of the banker? - I wished to travel, my character is known here, I went from there to Mr. Butler's a lawyer in Lincoln's Inn, the editor of Coke upon Littleton, and lived with him for about two years, and Mr. Butler recommended me to this young gentleman; no part of my money was ever found.</p>

               <p>Where did you pick her up? - By the side of Fleet-market, when I awoke missing her, I suspected I had lost something, I found my watch was gone and a shirt from the top of the bed, I applied to some man of St. Brides, he took me to her lodging on the Friday night, and on Saturday night she was taken, they called on me, I said I believed her to be the person from her appearance and voice; she then promised that she would bring the property the next day, saying she had pledged them; we depended on her word, but she never came; we found her again and took her before Alderman Sanderson, he questioned her about the matter, and she said she had sold the watch and pawned the shirt, in consequence of which he committed her, there were no threats of any sort, she said she had pawned the shirt, she said she gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250093"/>it to the person that lodged in the same house by the name of Elizabeth; I never saw the watch since, she said she had sold it to a person in Chick Lane.</p>
               <p>You was drunk I suppose at this time? - Rather so, I should be sorry for an act of that kind if I was sober.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that that is the girl? - Quite so.</p>
               <p>You was not quite sure when she was taken first? - I said I thought her to be the same, and I believed her to be the same.</p>

               <p>One of the Jury. My Lord, before the alderman he said he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. You was very drunk? - I do not know what you mean by very drunk, I did not tumble about; I had lost the faculty of my senses.</p>
               <p>Where did you come from? - I had been in Poppin's-court, but I went part of the way with a friend.</p>
               <p>Where had you been drinking? - In Poppin's-court, the sign of the Bell.</p>
               <p>Did you meet with any other woman? - Not a soul that I can take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had your watch when you came in? - Quite sure, I saw it some little time before I quitted the company, and I have a custom of putting chain and all into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did not you lose it chain and all out of your pocket in the street? - I know from nothing else but her own confession.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure you had it when you came home with the girl? - I am as sure as I am here, I let myself in and fastened the door on the inside, so she let herself out; I had seen the woman before.</p>
               <p>But she had never been at your lodgings nor you at hers? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you know her name? - I think she told me her name was

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Mr. Davis, a person may very well without any fault have the misfortune of being robbed once or twice, but it is very extraordinary your lodgings should be exposed to these frequent robberies; if they really are true, take a little care of your property; you will not come with perfect credit before a court of justice, if you come so again.</p>

               <p>I am father of this child.</p>
               <p>What age is this child? - She is six years and eight months, seven years old the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>Is the child capable of knowing the nature of an oath? - No, I really think she is not.</p>
               <p>Is she a quick or backward child of her age? - She is very quick, very artful.</p>
               <p>But not of knowledge enough you think to know the nature of an oath? - I do not think she is.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of this business of your own knowledge? - No further than the prisoner being a very intimate acquaintance; he took the child out on the Sunday, in the afternoon, last Sunday was a week, I lodged in his house for some considerable time before this, not now; he took her out about half past two, as near as we imagined, and she came home between five and six, he always sent her home by herself; she would come home when he put her into the way, she had been out divers times, he frequently asked my wife to let him take her out, he knows the child better than I do myself, she came home between five and six, I did not observe any thing was the matter with her, she said nothing at all; on Wednesday in the evening my wife was looking out the foul clothes for washing, and she saw the child rubbing herself at bed time, I was in bed, in the same room, and she says Kitty, what is the matter with you? she thought the child might be chased; Oh, mammy, says she, I am so wet you cannot think, and my wife took up her clothes, and found her thift in as terrible a condition as could be, and she said, she was afraid she was ruined; my wife shewed me the linen, and I said, I really think the child has the foul disease upon her, it had that appearance; I observed a very great running, and a very great stiffness upon it.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the person of the child? - After I had taken the prisoner into custody, I did, but not before; I took him into custody on Thursday last, about twelve, that was the next day, I went to the prisoner where he was at work; I said Mr. Fyson, I want to speak with you; and the man was ready to sink into the earth; oh, says he, Mr. Sweetman, I am sorry for any thing I have committed; says he, Mr. Sweetman, a guinea or two shall not be deficient; pray do not mention it to any body; says I, how came you to use the baby in that manner?</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing to him? - I said, Mr. Fyson, I am very sorry the affair should happen, you doated on the child so, more than I did myself, I charged him with the action, says he, I handled the girl, I cannot say what possessed me to do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250101"/>it; I really do not know; says I, Mr. Fyson, it is not a guinea or two will satisfy me, I will have you before a magistrate, so come along; says he, Mr. Sweetman, I'll follow you with all my soul; and he went with me out of the shop, he wanted to go over to the Horse and Windmill; no, says I, and I delivered him into the officer's hands, he confessed it to the officer, I heard him; says he, I am very sorry for the affair, I cannot deny but I am guilty of the matter.</p>
               <p>What matter? - Of the injury he had done the child, he said, he had handled the child.</p>
               <p>Did he ever say any thing more? - No, we took him before the justice immediately when he was examined I insisted upon it that the child was foul, he denied it intirely; Mr. Wilmot sent for Mr. Brown, he could not come for a considerable time, and with a deal of patience, he came, then he had the man examined in court, and found him to be foul; Mr. Wilmot said, you villain, where did you get this disease? says he, I caught it of the prosecutor's wife about six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Was that true! - No Sir, my wife said, if the gentlemen will withdraw, I will be examined, she was within an hour or two of being delivered; she was delivered last Sunday, she was here on Saturday all day, the midwife is not here; here is a woman here, that was at her delivery.</p>

If I had known as much of the case as I do now, I would have put off the trial to the next sessions; did the man ever acknowledge to have done any thing else to the child but handling her? - No, no further; I went last Sunday, and the child shewed me the place where the affair was committed, upwards of two miles off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. You seem so candid, Sir, I shall only ask you a single question. The child was out of your company, and out of your house? - Yes, I was at home all the time.</p>
               <p>She could not have been at home without your knowing of it? - No.</p>
               <p>You said nothing more to the prisoner at first, than what you have mentioned? - No.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon; this child was brought to me on Thursday morning last, I examined it, and thought there were some symptoms of a venereal complaint.</p>
               <p>Were the symptoms such as enabled you to pronounce with any certainty? - I thought it really was so; I thought there were some symptoms of a local complaint, it had all the symptoms of a venereal complaint, not a lues, but a gonorrhea.</p>
               <p>Might no other cause of inflammation produce the same symptoms? - There might such things happen.</p>
               <p>Have you, either then or since, been able to ascertain with any certainty, whether it is a venereal complaint, or might it proceed from other causes? - I have often known children to have similar complaints, and I have found afterwards that the parents had something of that complaint upon them.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say with certainty from whatever cause the venereal complaint proceeded, that the complaint is venereal? - According to some symptoms.</p>
               <p>But I ask whether all the symptoms might not be occasioned from inflammations proceeding from other causes? - They might have originated from other causes.</p>
               <p>Would not a greater length of time have enabled you to pronounce for certainty, whether the child's complaint was venereal or not? - It might so, I never saw it but that once.</p>
               <p>Then probably from your examination, you are not able to pronounce with certainty, that the complaint is venereal? - I had only a slight investigation of her.</p>
               <p>Let you have seen her once, or twenty times; let your investigation have been slight or minute; are you able to pronounce this for certainty, that the complaint is venereal? - I really thought it to be material.</p>
               <p>Do you think so still? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250102"/>Are you sure in your opinion? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Would not an inflammation in those parts, arising from any other accidental cause, produce the same appearances, from over exertions; suppose now for instance, from very violent exercise of any kind, the child had been hurt in those parts, might not the same symptoms appear? - They might.</p>
               <p>Then it would depend on time and observation to ascertain, whether the complaint was venereal or not? - I have often observed complaints of a similar kind, I never could account for it, but some times I found out that the parents had a venereal complaint, and it might have been contracted from the parents.</p>
               <p>Were those infallible symptoms, or such as might arise from any other cause? - They certainly are doubtful symptoms, but I really supposed it to be venereal.</p>
               <p>Do you give a certain or a doubtful opinion? - A doubtful opinion, but my opinion is, that it is venereal.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards attend at the justices? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has he any venereal complaint? - He has some symptoms of a venereal complaint likewise.</p>
               <p>Are his symptoms more or less certain than those of the child? - They are local; but his is certainly a venereal complaint.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the prisoner said he had got it from the prosecutor's wife? - Yes, the woman was present; she said she would suffer herself to be examined; she was not examined.</p>
               <p>Did you hear this man say any thing what intercourse he had had with his child? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Does there happen to be any medical gentleman besides Mr. Brown in court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Ball I understand is a gentleman of skill.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Ball. Will you have the goodness, Sir, to withdraw with Mr. Brown into the Lord Mayor's parlour, and examine this unfortunate child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ball. Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>I live in Well's-street, Mile-end Town, with Mr. and Mrs. Sweetman, I know the child, she sleeps with me every night.</p>
               <p>Did the child complain of any disorder before last Sunday week? - No, I do not know that I ever observed any thing on the child in my life, before last Wednesday morning, I did not observe the child's linen before then discoloured or stiffened, last Wednesday morning about seven or eight, I was getting up, and dressing myself I saw something on the child's shift, says I, Kitty what is this? says she, it is the child has puked over me, that is the child I have in my arms, then I went out to work, and thought no more of it.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the person of the child at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you know nothing more but what the child told you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did the child ever complain of any ill treatment from the prisoner? - No never, but always was extremely fond of him.</p>
               <p>Was the child kept pretty strictly at home? - No Sir, I cannot say but she is a very forward fond child.</p>
               <p>She runs about and plays with great boys? - I do not know, I go out at seven in the morning, and come home at night.</p>
               <p>Does she not run about the neighbourhood with a strict attention of her parents? - Yes, she does.</p>
               <p>And is some times hours together without the knowledge of the parents? - She is.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever observe any thing particular in the prisoner's behaviour to the child? - No Sir, but always very fond of her.</p>

               <p>You have examined this child? - I have.</p>
               <p>Has she the venereal complaint? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it manifestly so? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Brown. Are you of the same opinion? - I am.</p>
               <p>Are your doubts removed now? - Yes, it is very clear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Mr. Brown? Is not it possible for a venereal taint to be got or acquited in different ways than from a man's penetrating a child or woman? - I have observed that children have had it in that manner without the least penetration.</p>
               <p>Court. It certainly may, and clearly by contact, without penetration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It may be got by sitting on a seat at a necessary, or by touching a child with his finger? - It may be.</p>
               <p>Court. You have had now two opportunities of examining this child; is there any appearance of laceration? - Not in the least, no laceration of the parts.</p>
               <p>Then you perceive from the appearance of the child's person this crime could not have been committed, could she have been penetrated by a grown-up man? - I think not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Ball. (The same question.) - Why my Lord there is certainly no appearance of laceration, nor should I hardly have supposed there could have been any, I do not see any thing like that laceration having been made, nor any wound that has been healed, it seems to me quite unaccountable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Mr. Ball. Would it not in a child of that age if penetrated by an adult be exceedingly visible? - I should apprehend so.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner express more particularly what he had done to the child? - He said he had put his hand to the child's private parts.</p>

               <p>The Jury upon giving a verdict guilty of the attempt, and being informed that they must either convict or acquit the prisoner under the indictment, which was for the complete crime, and not for an attempt, the foreman pronounced the word Guilty; upon which the learned Recorder thus addressed them: - Gentlemen, In order to find the prisoner guilty, you must be satisfied on your oaths, that the prisoner has completely entered the body of this child, and has had the same knowledge of her that any of you have had of your wives; I feel some anxiety that you should clearly understand this case, and the question which you are to determine; leaving the determination of it to you. The verdict which you first delivered in, I confess, appeared to me to be a declaration of the truth of the fact according to the evidence; it appears that this man has been guilty of a very gross and brutal attempt, to do an act, which neither has been nor could have been completed; if that is so; if that is your opinion of the fact, (for you are to judge of the fact and not me, I am only to tell you my opinion of the law) I can tell you with confidence, that if your opinion of the evidence is what you have now stated, you are bound to find him not guilty; you do not acquit your consciences and your oaths as Jurors, if believing he has been guilty of the attempt, you find him guilty of the complete charge; but if you are certain from the evidence that he is guilty of this complete crime, you will declare so by your verdict.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Although I could not help feeling some anxiety about the event of this trial under this indictment, because I always wish the law to be administered dispassionately, yet till this very respectable jury had declared their verdict, it was not proper for me to say any thing of the motives which excited so great a doubt in their minds, who would not have entertained any doubt under other circumstances; (but the nature of good men's minds is so much offended at that conduct that has been clearly committed by you) and my opinion of these gentlemen is not altered by their finding that verdict; and I am happy in knowing that the consequence of that verdict is not a total impunity for your offence, for the law prescribes a different punishment although under a different prosecution for the offence that has been proved against you; and these gentlemen having done their duty, and repressed those honourable feelings which led them to be under some little danger of going beyond their duty, I shall certainly take the opportunity of bringing you to that punishment which you deserve; therefore I shall certainly order you (the Grand Jury being discharged) to be detained till the next sessions, in order to be prosecuted for the attempt. This poor man, the prosecutor, cannot afford the expences; I shall therefore make him a liberal allowance. Allow the prosecutor five guineas for the expence of this prosecution, and bind him and his witnesses over, to appear and give evidence on a bill of indictment against the prisoner, before the Grand Jury at the next sessions, and let the prisoner stand committed till the next sessions.</p>

               <p>The case was opened by Mr. Silvester, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. This is an indictment against Nicholas Ready Ledwich, whom you see there, and the indictment charges him with wilful and corrupt perjury. Gentlemen, I must claim your attention to the case which I am going to open, because in opening that case, I shall discover such a scene of iniquity as men of your description are not acquainted with; and you will see from thence on what tenure it is, that you keep either your lives or your properties lafe, if a man of this description can be let loose on the country after being guilty of the facts, which I trust I shall be able to prove before you in evidence: But it will be necessary for me to begin the transaction a little further back, that you may understand the whole of the case, see the force of it, and observe the purpose for which it was done, and the iniquity which was intended to be perpetrated in the hands of this man, who is an attorney. Gentlemen, when I say an attorney, it is to call your attention more particularly to the case; because men of his description are not to exercise their power to the ruin of their fellow subjects, and to the disgrace<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250109"/>of the honourable profession to which they belong; therefore, I say it behoves you and the court to watch more attentively to their conduct. Gentlemen, in the end of the year, 1786, a Mr. Gale, who is the prosecutor of this indictment, who then lived in the Hay-market, and was a leather trunk-maker, and was acquainted with a person of the name of Sweatman (Sweatman was a coach harness-maker) he applied to him, and told him he had an opportunity, if he would but lend him a few pounds, to make a very advantageous bargain; that a person of his acquaintance had a pair of coach-harness to sell, which he offered him five guineas for, and that he should have three guineas profit: at first Gill was unwilling to lend him the money, but the profit being so great, and this man being at the same time in necessitous circumstances, and he telling him I will put in your hands the security of two guineas due to me from a Mr. Davis who lives in Long-acre, and the moment I have sold the harness, I will pay you: A short time afterwards he paid him the three guineas, but on application being made to Davis for the two guineas on the note, Davis either unable or unwilling to pay it, did not chuse to pay it, upon which Gill returned the note to Sweatman, and told him it was of no use; Sweatman received the note, went away and he heard no more of him for sometime: at that time Gill was perfectly unacquainted that there was such a man in existence as Mr. Ledwich, he had never heard his name, or seen his person, and was surprized one day being applied to by Mr. Ledwich, who asked him if he had settled Sweatman's affairs, he said no, he knew nothing of it, he owed him two guineas; because says he, he has brought an action against Davis, and the moment I recover it, I am to pay you. Sometime after Ledwich sent to Gill, and got him to the coffee-house; unfortunately, gentlemen, there is a coffee-house where men of Mr. Ledwich's description meet, and where I do not think it safe for any other man to go, because the company he meets with there are of that description as always to be ready to watch to take advantage of what is said. Gentlemen, at this coffee-house Mr. Ledwich told Mr. Gill, that unless he paid him a sum of money down, the action which he had brought in his name on this note of hand would be nonprossed; Mr. Gill was astonished! alarmed! he had returned the bill to Sweatman, he had never seen Ledwich, nor ever gave him authority to sue at all, and was much surprised to hear from him that he had with at any authority whatever made use of his name to bring an action against Davis; he did not take any notice of it, or pay him the money; some time after that, this poor man for the good-natured action of having lent three guineas to Sweatman, was arrested and obliged to pay 10 l. for not going on with an action which he knew nothing of; he applied to Mr. Ledwich immediately, who informed him Mr. Sweatman was at Kentish-Town; and at last after frequent enquiries he found that Sweatman and the defendant Ledwich were intimate friends, countrymen, and cronies, that they had been together at the house of one Addison, that they were often together, and that Sweatman acted sometimes as attorney for Ledwich; when he found that, this poor man, by the advice of his attorney, paid the money, and he then arrested Mr. Gill for 14 l. 8 s. 10 d. for costs for going on with that action; as soon as he was arrested, he put in bail, but not wishing to try the cause, he got an assignment from the sheriff, and that brought the parties before the Court of Common Pleas; when they came before the court, Mr. Gill opened the whole transaction, stated every fact, that he had lent the money, and had only taken this note as a security which he returned as invalid; that he never directly, or indirectly gave Ledwich orders to prosecute on the note, or bring an action on the note, and was perfectly ignorant of Ledwich, and that he shrewdly suspected it was a contrivance between Ledwich and Sweatman to rob him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250110"/>of his money; this was the affidavit made by Mr. Gill in the Court of Common Pleas. In answer to that, Mr. Ledwich did not as is usual, produce an authority in writing from Mr. Gill, but he made his affidavit, and said he had been employed, and that as to this person of the name of Sweatman he did not know him nor bad any connection with him; he said that Sweatman was then an entire stranger to him; these are his words;</p>
               <p>"And this deponent further</p>
               <p>"denies that he ever was in company with</p>
               <p>"the said Sweatman, at the house of one</p>
               <p>"Addison, in Hanover-street, Long-acre,</p>
               <p>"and absolutely denies, that he</p>
               <p>"ever had any intimacy, connection, or</p>
               <p>"familiarity whatsoever, either directly</p>
               <p>"or indirectly with the said Sweatman,</p>
               <p>"nor had any knowledge of him before he</p>
               <p>"called on him at his chambers, for the</p>
               <p>"purpose mentioned in his affidavit." - Yet he would have the court believe that a man whom he was entirely ignorant of, had come to his chambers and picked him out from all the rest of mankind to bring an action, not in his own name but in the name of Gill; why did he swear this? because he was charged by Gill, that it was a contrivance, a trick of his, planned by him and his countryman Sweatman, for the purpose of robbing Gill. Gentlemen, the action was brought on this note, which he must know at the time he could not recover, for it was invalid in point of law, but he knew at the same time he was playing a safe game, and if once he could get the costs from Gill, it was perfectly immaterial to him whether he recovered or not; if he recovered against Davis, he was sure of recovering his costs from him; if he failed, he had nothing to do but to institute a suit against this gentleman Mr. Gill, stating himself to be employed by him, and by an affidavit rob him of that money which he was not intitled to. Gentlemen, this is the iniquity which this man has been guilty of; you see the deep laid plan which every one of you as well as myself who speak to you are liable to at this moment; if men of this description who have art enough, are wicked enough to put that art in force. The transaction between Sweatman and himself (which Mr. Gill says, was a contrivance;) Mr. Ledwich denies, and swears positively to the employment, and thinks he is safe, because one witness cannot convict a man of perjury; but there are fortunately for the country, and fortunately for all honest men not only one, but many witnesses who will contradict that fact which Mr. Ledwich has sworn, and which he himself knew was false. Gentlemen, I will prove to you that Mr. Ledwich in company with this man, went to the sheriff's-office, with a person of the name of Hargrave, whom we have not here at present, that Sweatman and he dined together every day in the week, that he was the go-between that man who was in goal and the plaintiff; that they belonged, I believe to a club, and were in the strictest habits of intimacy; and notwithstanding Mr. Ledwich has sworn that he was not on a certain day at Addison's house, Mr. and Mrs. Addison will tell you that he was there, and that they saw him. It is lucky for the public that men of this description have not always their senses about them, therefore they give an opportunity to bring them to justice, which otherwise in this case we should not have had. Gentlemen, I shall produce his affidavit, in which he states, his perfect ignorance of Sweatman, and his not having been at this place; that I shall contradict by several witnesses; and I must make one other observation which is, that not one of the witnesses I shall call to you are or will be interested by the event of this cause; they are neither to get nor lose by your verdict, therefore they come before you unimpeached and disinterested: I have no objection, gentlemen, that Mr. Ledwich should sit there, if it can avail him to sit in any part of the court; because I do not wish for your verdict, unless it is founded on the evidence I have to offer, I do not wish that any thing I have said should influence your judgements against Mr. Ledwich, all I wish is to direct your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250111"/>understandings to the point in issue, and when I have proved my facts, I call upon you as honest men for your verdict of guilty: If on the other hand he can make a defence which will avail him, and convince you that he is innocent of this charge, I shall rejoice in his acquittal; but if I convince you that what he has sworn is absolutely false, the justice of your country requires you to do your duty (although it is a painful one) and pronounce him guilty.</p>

               <p>(Mr. Silvester read the note.)</p>
               <p>Court. You must prove Mr. Ledwich's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ledwich. My Lord, I do not want any thing unfair, I will acknowledge it, I will look at it, and see that there is no interlineation in that part that affects me; (looks at it) this is my hand-writing, and I believe this to be Mr. Justice Gould's hand-writing.</p>

This objection was over-ruled by the court, together with two other objections, one of which that they had not set out a whole sentence in the affidavit, but had garbled it, was reserved till it was seen to what the evidence should amount.</p>

               <p>Mr. Blades. He was called, and I saw him come out of the gallery, and I would not let him come in.</p>
               <p>Have you been in court? - I was up in the gallery.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that all the witnesses were turned out? - I was there not thinking any harm.</p>
               <p>Court. He was in court contrary to order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you heard any of the witnesses examined? - Not one, I was the first called, and I went out of the gallery.</p>
               <p>Who was it took you up into the gallery? - An acquaintance of mine, he would persuade me, and we both went up.</p>
               <p>Who was he? - Davis.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me what passed between you and Davis, why did you go into the gallery? - Because we had been standing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250114"/>so many hours here, and we wanted to hear the debates.</p>
               <p>Was not you in court when an order was made, that all the witnesses should withdraw? - I never was in court till I went into the gallery.</p>
               <p>When did you come into the gallery? - I believe it was directly when the order was given for going on with the trial, and I was immediately called and came out.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the jury was sworn? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Silvester spoke to the jury? - I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Was you in the gallery? - I was no where else; I might be about ten minutes, or a little better before I was called, the gentleman persuaded me to go up into the gallery, I denied it two or three times, but he persuaded me to go up into the gallery to hear the debates, whether the bill should be thrown out or not; I cannot recollect the words, that gentleman was talking to my Lord; I dare say Davis thought no more harm than I did.</p>
               <p>(Morgan Davis called.)</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take Addison up into the gallery? - Nothing but curiosity, we were not five minutes before Mr. Addison was called, I never heard the order.</p>
               <p>Court. Both parties have neglected to call the witnesses together, which they ought to have done, I think in point of justice I ought to hear what Addison has to say, he has in fact not heard any thing.</p>

               <p>I live in Hanover-street, Long-acre, No. 16, a private house; I have kept a house there above thirty years.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Ledwich? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - I cannot ascertain that, not thinking it of any consequence; it was near a twelvemonth ago, or thereabouts; I have a shop in the back buildings; I am a truss-maker; I was called down stairs; when I got into the back room, Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Sweatman were there.</p>
               <p>How came they there together? - Mr. Ledwich came because I had made a truss for him.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. Sweatman there? - I do not know, I know Mr. Sweatman before, I had seen him many times.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Sweatman were acquainted? - No more than what I tell you, I never saw them but that once together, I am sure of that, I never saw them any where else together.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with Ledwich about Sweatman? - No, none concerning Sweatman, not that I can recollect, there was no conversation passed then about the matter, and I believe that Sweatman did not speak a word while he was there.</p>
               <p>They came together? - They went away together, but I was called out of my shop, and they were in the parlour; I do not know how they came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ball. Do you know of any acquaintance, connexion, or familiarity between Mr. Ledwich and Mr. Sweatman? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You were called down out of your shop into your parlour, there you found two persons, one that had particular business, and the other came to ask you how you was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think that Mr. Ledwich had any knowledge of Sweatman at that time? - No further than that they were both together in the room, and went away together.</p>
               <p>Did they go out as if they were going to any place together? - I do not know that they were.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of their being acquainted with one another? - No more than going away together; Sweatman had no business with me that I know of; I immediately went back to my work.</p>
               <p>Was you subpoened on an action depending between Mr. Ledwich and Gill in the Court of Common Pleas? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did Mr. Ledwich<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250115"/>and Sweatman stay with you? - Not many minutes.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between them two while you was there? - Not a word that I can remember.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear Mr. Ledwich call Sweatman by his name? - No, I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ball. Do you think if at any time within these six months, if Mr. Ledwich had spoke to you, and asked you how you did, you would have known him, or even since this indictment was found? - That is just as it happens; I am rather forgetful of people's faces, but I think I should.</p>
               <p>Court. He knows him now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ledwich. I spoke to him to day.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any other witnesses that have seen him at Addison's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Addison. Is your wife here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you have not got a step further, unless you had another witness; there is no evidence to go to the Jury; where is Hargrave?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He is down at Colchester.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury; this last witness carries the case no further, for his evidence is upon the distinct assignment of perjury, that Ledwich never was with Sweatman at the house of Addison: now, if what Addison has stated, was proved by two witnesses, I should certainly leave it to your consideration, whether you believed the assertion of Mr. Ledwich in his affidavit, to be knowingly and corruptly false, or not; but in the crime of perjury, the law requires two witnesses to convict, even on a distinct assignment of perjury; and the law does not leave it to the Jury to determine, whether they will believe one witness or the other, where there is but one each way; because the person indicted for perjury, has already sworn one way; and if there is but one witness that swears the other way, the law will not suffer the person indicted to be convicted: I am therefore not permitted by law to put the question to you, whether you believe Addison's evidence; upon the rest of the case, there is no evidence at all, for the evidence that at a public-house, where there were a number of people, and Mr. Ledwich was twice in company with Sweatman in the same room, without any proof that he spoke to him at all, or was acquainted with him, that is certainly much too slight to be taken notice: therefore, to be sure there is no evidence in support of this prosecution.</p>

Upon your trial here there was no doubt of your having done the thing with which you were charged; but it appeared that James Gibson, whose will you was said to have forged, was alive and produced as a witness: I was in some doubt whether you could be convicted of forging the last will and testament of a man alive, his will is in his own power till he is dead, therefore no will can be said to be a man's last will till he is dead; I was in some doubt about whether that which had the similitude of a last will could be regarded as coming within the act of parliament. The case was laid before the Twelve Judges, who were all of opinion, that the doubt was without foundation, and that in reality, if a thing purporting to be a last will and testament was forged, uttered, and published as a true last will and testament, the man being said to be dead, (for you said the man was dead, and got the executorship and probate of that will) that is as much within the act of parliament as if Gibson had been really dead; and this opinion is founded upon preceding practice: there are several cases found; one of the King and Murphy, in the year 1753, where Murphy was indicted for forging a seaman's will, and he was tried and executed, though the man whose will was forged, was then alive. There is another case of the King and Stirling, who knew that his laundress had some money in the public funds, he made a will for her, and got her money; some time after the poor old woman went to receive her dividend, and found that her money had been taken out by some other person; enquiry was made into it, and Stirling was taken up and executed; and, indeed, if it had been otherwise it would be dangerous to keep any money in the funds. - There is another case, the case of

            . was made a capital felony; there was no doubt about your guilt, but the judge who tried it thought fit to respite your sentence, on a doubt whether the testimony of one of the witnesses was competent; he had been himself indicted for taking a false oath in the same business, you were indicted for procuring that oath; M'Daniel was indicted and found guilty, but no judgment was given against him, and he received his Majesty's pardon before he came to be tried; he was offered as a witness, and was received by the learned Judge, who when he received it, entertaining some doubt of his competency respited your judgment in order to take the opinions of the Judges. Your case has been laid before the Judges, and they are of opinion, that if the man had not been pardoned, there would have been some doubt, but as he was pardoned, that that pardon not only respited him from punishment, but absolved him from the crime, and restored him to credit. There is a case in Lord Chief Justice Hobart's Reports, of Waddington, and something I don't exactly recollect the name, in which the same doctrine is held, that where a party has been pardoned, it not only takes away the punishment, but restores the person to credit. The Judges were of opinion that the witness was rightly admitted, and that you were rightly convicted.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250116"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>Mr. HODGSON (without the smallest Imputation on the Systems of his Cotemporaries, whose Merits he chearfully acknowledges) pledges himself to take nothing for his Transcripts, if any Gentleman who solicits a cause, or the Counsel whose Arguments he prosesses to take, are not compleatly satisfied with his Performances.</p>
               <p>A new Edition (being the third) of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND, which is a sufficient Instructor of itself, is just reprinted, and Mr. Hodgson in order to accommodate all sorts of Purchasers, has reduced the Price to Eighteen pence only; also his new Publication, entitled, "SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System of</p>
               <p>"Short-Hand; to which are added, a Comparative Table of Short-Hand Alphabets,</p>
               <p>"and two Extracts by way of Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price only 2 s. 6 d. are sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No. 35, Chancery-Lane, will receive immediate Answers, and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law and others, immediately attended to: Addressed to Mr. Hodgson, at his House, No. 13, White Lyon Row, Islington, or left for him, at No. 35, Chancery-Lane.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on Mr. Hodgson's Plan, wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing: Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice, (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has just bound up a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last sixteen Years, which he will dispose of; or any person wishing to see any particular Trial, may have an Inspection of the same, or take a Copy of it, at the usual Prices.</p>
