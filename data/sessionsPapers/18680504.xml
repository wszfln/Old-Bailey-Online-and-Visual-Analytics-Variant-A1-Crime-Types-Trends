                  </hi>. I am manager of the ships' stores, at Greenwich—on the evening of 9th March I saw the prisoner there—I had never seen him before—he showed me these two bills for 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and asked me to change them—I told him I could not, I did not keep such an amount. in my house—he then asked if I would advance him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not—he said he wanted to go on board the ship—I told him I would advance him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the waterman to row him down there, and I did so—the waterman had brought him in—the waterman asked where he was going to—he said he was going on board the <hi rend="italic">Somersetshire</hi>, that arrived on</p>

               <p>5th March—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the bills, which I kept in my possession—I asked him his name, he said Barnard Tyman—I saw the name of Henry Coleman on the bills, and I asked him how it was that the name of Henry Coleman was on the bills and his name was Barnard Tyman—he said he took his mother's maiden name—there was no endorsement on the bills at that time—he called daily at my house after that—he said he wanted to go to the War Office, in Pall Mall, to see about some property he had, and he thought about going back to Australia again, and would I advance him more money—I said I was not in the habit of doing such a thing, but as the bills were his I did advance him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., just as he wanted it, to go to London, and I paid a man to go up and down with him, until he got about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my debt—when he had been there about a week I asked whether he would go to the bank and get the bills changed; but previous to that I showed them to Mr. Bernard, a gentleman who came from the London and County Bank at Greenwich, in the prisoner's presence—he said if I liked he would send one through to Threadneedle Street, to see if they were good—I asked the prisoner if he would endorse them; he said he could not write—he got the waterman to write "Henry Coleman," and he put his hand to the pen and made a cross—I gave that bill to Mr. Bernard to send it through the bank, and they sent it back, saying the third one was accepted—I told the prisoner of it, and he said he would go to the Bank of Victoria with me—I said I could not go then, but I would send the waterman with him—I gave the waterman the bills, and told him not to give them up unless he got a satisfactory answer about them—I did not see the bills again, nor the prisoner—I have not got back my 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I only got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am accountant and chief clerk at the Bank of Victoria, in Threadneedle Street—on 5th March, the prisoner came there with the first and second of these bills, there is a third of the same date; they are drawn by our head office at Melbourn, and made payable at our bank here—I asked the prisoner if his name was Henry Coleman—he said it was—I told him that the third had come forward and had been accepted, and it was down at Norwich—I gave him the address of the bankers in whose hands it was, the Provincial Banking Company; and also the Rev. Mr. Cooper, who had interested himself in the case, and told him he had better make his way down there and establish his claim to the accepted bill—I asked him if he knew William Coleman—he said he had a brother of that name—I also asked him whether William Coleman had a son in the colony—he said he did not know, that he had been twenty years in Australia and had very much lost sight of his relations in this country—I gave him back the two bills—on 26th March he came again, accompanied by another man—in the meantime I had received information—the man gave the bills up to me—the prisoner said he had not been to Norwich as I had advised him, and he would be glad if he could have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the bills—I again asked</p>

I am us innocent of this as the babe unborn. If I had wanted to act the rogue on a creature like that, I could have put it in my pocket at any time; no one knew anything about it on board but him and me. When I came ashore I got drunk, and got locked up. When I was liberated, I went to this landlord's house; I was under the influence of drink. I gave him the papers, and some jewellery belonging to a lady, to take core of. I remained there I don't know how many days in a stupid state. I went and received my pension, and gave it to him to pay for the grog I had had. When I went to Fauncett St. Mary's he wrote to the authorities there, and had me taken into custody.</p>

I am manager of the business of Thomas John and Joseph Smith, wholesale stationers, 83, Queen Street, City—Crosby has been in their service about two years as light porter and warehouseman—his duties were up stairs on the second floor, in the stock room, where the leather is kept—Krickeldorf has worked for the firm about twelve months out of doors—among other things he made purses and pocket-books—previous to 22nd April the practice was when he received an order he told me what quantity of leather he would require, and if I thought he might have it, I should instruct Crosby to give it him; Crosby would write out an order to the clerk in a book—in consequence of something after 21st April I made more stringent rules—I know those rules were acted upon by Crosby on the morning of 22nd, because he signed tickets for leather he had given out on two different occasions—tins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the tickets—it has my signature and Mr. Astins' to it; both those signatures would be re<lb/>quired before the leather was delivered—it would be brought from the second floor, where Crosby was, to the receiving room on the ground-floor, where Astins would deliver it to the workmen—Astins would sign the ticket, bring it to me for signature, and then file it; the file was kept in the receiving room—on 23rd April, about 11 o'clock, I saw Krickeldorf on the ground floor; he brought me a sample purse—I told him I would take three dozen of them, but it would be necessary for him to get better ivory tablets—one skin would have been plenty for those if of one colour; if of two colours, two skins; two half-skins would do, but we do not generally give out half-skins—I did not see Crosby at that time—about 215 that day, I went into the passage that leads to the lobby, and there ob<lb/>served Crosby and Krickeldorf in conversation—the moment Crosby saw me, he went up stairs into his room, and Krickeldorf descended with a brown paper parcel in his hand—I asked him to go up stairs to the first floor, where</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Smith—on 22nd April a new regulation was made as to delivering out materials, and I told Crosby that when he had any leather out he would have to give it to me first, and not to deliver it to the person himself—the following morning two skins of leather were delivered out and he gave me the leather in—that produced is one of the memorandums referring to it—I took it first to Mr. Downs, and he signed it, and then I put my initials to it and put it on the file in the receiving room, where the materials were delivered out—Crosby did not come to me on the 23rd April, with reference to any leather for Krickeldorf—I did not know of his taking these seven skins—I saw Krickeldorf at 11 o'clock that morning, in the lobby on the ground floor—I did not see Crosby there—about 2.15 or 2.20 I saw Krickeldorf in the lobby—I did not see anything with him—I afterwards received a communication from Downs, and found a brown paper parcel in the corner behind the door in the lobby—I brought it inside and tore off a corner to see whether it was leather—I saw that it was, and I went up stairs and communicated to Mr. Downs—the parcel was afterwards opened in Mr. Smith's presence—this is it—I know nothing of the file up stairs, or of the ticket on it—Crosby did not show me this ticket—I did not see it before it was brought down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, of 4, Reynold Street, King's Road, Chelsea—on 21st April I was in Thames Street about 3 p.m., and at the South-Eastern Railway Arch I saw a parcel of boys, who threw stones at me—I turned round with ray stick, and touched one of them in the eye—a boy in the mob laid hold of me, and said he would give me in charge, and while the policeman was hearing the story, Dorney put his hand in my pocket, and took my watch—I told the policeman, and he began to search him, but he passed it to Atkins—I did not see him pass it, but a witness did—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw Atkins drop it; a witness picked it up, and gave it to me, and I gave it to the policeman—my name is in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman to Messrs. Lemons, Old Swan Lane—on the afternoon of 21st April I was employed at the bottom of Old Swan Lane, near the railway arch, and saw a number of boys surround the pro<lb/>secutor—one of them threw a stone, and he put up his stick over his shoul<lb/>der, and hit the boy in the eye, and then I saw the prosecutor's chain hanging down, and he said, "I have lost my watch"—I said, loud enough for the prisoner to hear, "Either the big one or the little one has got it," and seized Dorney—Atkins was held by somebody else, who took him into a warehouse opposite, and when he came out I saw the watch drop from his trousers between two casks, about four yards from the prosecutor—Mr. Reid picked it up—he is not here—I saw him give it to the constable.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 59, Gillingham Street, Pimlico—I occupy the house and sleep in the back parlour down stairs—about 5.30 on Sunday morning, 12th April, I heard a noise at my bed room door—I called out "Who's there"—I received no answer—I saw the door open, and jumped out of bed and caught sight of two men, they ran away, the prisoner was one of them—I followed and met a policeman, and the prisoner turned back and I followed—the policeman missed the other man and followed the prisoner—I went home and put on my clothes—I lost nothing—my house was safe when I went to bed—I was last up at night, and I am quite sure I shut the door, and none of my lodgers went out afterwards—the door must have been opened by a false key.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Church Street, Twickenham, and am housekeeper to Mr. Stedwell—on Sunday evening, 26th January, I was with another servant, named Matilda Hurrell, in a back room on the ground floor, between 9 and 10 o'clock; I am sure it was after 9—we were sitting together, and the door was pushed open—I jumped up, and went to the doorway, and saw two men in the passage: one went towards the stairs—one said to the other, "Is your pistol ready?" and the other answered, "Right"—the male prisoner then came into the room, and said, "Not a word, or I will blow your brains out"—he then showed me an iron bar, and said he would dash my brains out if I halloaed, or made any noise—he then said, "You have the keys?"—I said I had not; it was not very often that servants were trusted with the keys—he said that would do—he then asked me what money I had about me—I said I had none at all—he asked how many stories high the house was—I said, "Two"—he then said if I moved or called out, that he would dash my brains out with the iron bar, and he put the iron bar towards my face—he asked if I valued my life—I said, "Of course I do"—he said, "Then hold your noise"—I heard the other man up stairs all this time—I heard some breaking of things—after some time I heard a box fall—the other servant said to me, "That is the cash box"—I said, "No, it is the plate box," and the prisoner said, "Not a word"—the other man then came down stairs, and came into the room with a gun, and said to the prisoner, "Take this, shoot them: spare no lives"—the prisoner took the gun, and laid it on the parlour table—he said, "If you attempt to go to the window I will shoot your brains out through the window"—he then went out of the room, and looked the door—I gave evidence against the other man last sessions, or the sessions before; he was convicted, and got eighteen months—some time after they had gone I went up stairs—my room was all upset, and the clothes about the room—a small box had been broken open, and was empty: it had contained three brooches, two pins, and other articles—I have no doubt about the prisoner being the man—he was in the room about three-quarters of an hour—there were three gas burners in the room, full on.</p>

About 2.15 on Saturday afternoon, I saw the prisoner Hooper go to a broker's shop, and I watched him—he remained there some time, and when he got a little way from the house I stopped him, and said I should take him into custody—I found on him six teaspoons, with initials on them corresponding with the initials on the ether property—he made no remark at the time—I took him to the station—he afterwards sent for me to the cell, and made a statement to me which I took down in writing, and he signed as a voluntary statement—I read it over to him and he said it was correct (<hi rend="italic">Statement read</hi>: "Robert Hooper, 7, Adams' Mews, Grosvenor Square. Molyneux Street Police-station, April 5th, 1868. A young man called <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> came in on Saturday morning, about 9.30, and sent up for me. I was in bed at the time. I sent for him to come to me. He asked me if I had got a bag to lend him; I gave him one. I dressed myself, and we went out together. He went away, and I waited till he returned, and we went home together. He asked me to take charge of the bag, and I put it under the bed. He then took six spoons from his pocket, and gave them to me to sell. I was then taken into custody. The bag and contents is now locked in my room, but I do not know what it contains. The man is suspected to live in North Row, on the left side. This statement is made by me, Robert Hooper.")—I then went to the room of the prisoner, and found all the property now produced in a bag under the bed, with the exception of the six spoons—they were identified by the prosecutor—I went to Pembridge Gardens, and examined some footmarks with the prisoners' boots—I found four different footprints, and I made an impression on each side with the boots of both the prisoners, and they corresponded exactly—they were the footprints of two persons.</p>

               <p>and others who have gone away, but they may be caught yet—I was not acquainted with Farrell, not to speak to him—I saw the prisoner pay money to the deserters—I don't know their names, there were so many of them—I should know them if I were to see them—some American officers were present on one occasion when he paid them, Deasy, Burke, and others—I will he a witness against us many more Fenians as I can get hold of—I think I am doing more for my country now than if I had remained a Fenian.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mill Hill, Acton, in the county of Middlesex, and am a builder—I know the prisoner, and a person of the name of Hart—in December, 1867, I had a house and shop to let in Mill Hill—a Mr. Hart called—I ultimately let him the house for a term of three years, at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he referred me for reference to a certain firm from whom I received the letter produced—I could not swear it is in Meyer's handwrit<lb/>ing—the house was fitted up by Hart, and goods were brought there by a carman named Bailey—the house was not finished at the time, and I took care of the goods—about a fortnight or three weeks after the delivery of the goods, Meyer came with a horse and cart and took the goods away—he said that Fenianism being in action, he was afraid of the goods being there—they were the same goods brought by Bailey—on the day they were taken away another lot of goods were delivered, by a carrier I don't know—there was a label on, which Meyer took off.</p>

               <p>went to see if the house was a suitable one—the business he intended to carry on was that of a pawnbroker—when the house was taken he gave me a list of firms in the City from whom I was to purchase goods—I told him it was usual to pay cash in the first transaction, and he said I was to tell them I wanted to open a monthly account, and if they wanted a refer<lb/>ence I was to give them the name of Haines and Co., Carpet Works, Thames Ditton—there are no carpet works at Thames Ditton—I went to Parnall's and gave them the card and reference, and an order for goods amounting to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also gave them my own card—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>—"S. Hart, Dealer, Jeweller, and General Salesman, Mill Hill Road, Acton, W.——Money advanced to any amount. Fire-proof Safes for the security of valuable property"). The goods were delivered at Mr. Stock's house because the shop was not finished—the prisoner afterwards removed them, as he said, because of a Fenian affray which had occurred at Acton—they were then taken to 18, Shadwell Road, Holloway, and the next morning removed to Hatton Garden—I went away to Manchester, and he wrote to me to say that he would send the goods again to Acton—I saw some of them there—I have not kept any of the letters which I received from the prisoner—I also went to Messrs. Dawes', upholsterers, at Upper Street, Islington, by the prisoner's directions, and ordered a set of drawing-room furniture, asking for credit, which the prisoner said I should be able to get, owing to his knowing Mr. Dawe junior—he said, "Tell them you are going to get married, and give them one of my cards"—I had been married two and a half years previous—I went and acted as he told me—I had no intention of committing bigamy—the bill for the furniture came to about 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was taken to his house at Shadwell Road—I told Messrs. Dawe that was my house—these goods were removed to Clapham a few days before Christmas—that was another of Meyer's houses—I took it for him, under very similar circum<lb/>stances to the one at Acton—the letters produced are in the prisoner's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Two letters were read, one from the prisoner to the landlord of the house at Clapham, dated 5th December</hi>, 1867; <hi rend="italic">the other dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th De<lb/>cember</hi>, 1867, <hi rend="italic">was addressed to the landlord at the house at Acton.

I threw them hastily in the bureau—I did not know they were there when I gave the letters to him to classify: they Were among a heap of papers in the bureau—they were mostly from Mr. Elzinger—they were merely from members of the committee.</p>

I am a stonemason, and live at 105, Lambourne Build<lb/>ings, Finsbury, and am a member of the Shoreditch Lodge of the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons'—it is not an enrolled society—I was a member in June, 1867, when the prisoner held the office of secretary—he was appointed in September, 1866—his duty was to transmit the money to the Central Committee that was over what was used for sick members—the Central Committee was at Bolton—there is an entry in this book, "June 18th, 1867. Sent to C. C., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is in the prisoner's handwriting—the money was kept in a cash-box—the secretary had one key, and the treasurer another—it was kept at the Griffin Inn—they kept a certain amount in the box, and transmitted anything beyond to the Central Committee—it was his duty to send a copy of the entry in the book and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Central Committee—William Hickie was the treasurer at that time—here is an entry, for the 5th November, in the handwriting of the prisoner, "Sent to C.

C., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," also in the prisoner's writing—the salary of the prisoner was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—there were something like 130 members to the lodge—the prisoner was one of the members—a person only has to pay his entrance fee, and pay something yearly, to become a member; and he remains a member as long as he continues to pay—sometimes the prisoner received the money, and sometimes the treasurer; but he had to hand it to the treasurer.</p>

I am a hosier and general outfitter, at 32 and 33, Aldgate—on Wednesday, 22nd April, in the afternoon the prisoner came to my shop—I was sent for from upstairs, and came down, and found him there—he said he had just come from New Zealand, and he required an outfit—he said he had been out there four years, sheep-breeding—he required to go off to the country that night by the mail train, to see his parents—I said I should require a good reference before I could part with any of my goods—he said, "I can give you a good reference; I can refer you to my father's banker's agent in London; I have transmitted home large sums of money to my father from New Zealand"—I said, "That will do, no doubt"—I looked at the clock, and found it was past 4—he then stated that he had some friends in Croydon, and said, "If you like to go down there with me, if you do not feel satisfied with my reference,—I can give you another"—before this, he had written down his father's name and address; it was, "R. H. Davie, Solicitor, Wellington, Somerset"—I went down to Croydon with him—we took a cab, and we were going to a friend's house—he did not tell me the name at first—he pointed out a house after leaving the Croydon station—we were going in the direction of the house when we met a Mr. Hooper—the prisoner said, "Here is one of my friends; he will be able to satisfy you what I am, and that I am the person that I represented myself to be," and he called the young man by his Christian name—Mr. Hooper got into the cab with us, and we went back again—the prisoner said he would rather not go into the house, he was not dressed sufficiently well—I understood that he was paying his addresses to the sister—Hooper seemed to know him well, and was quite surprised to see him back from New Zealand—I was satisfied with what he said—we then went back to the shop, and he had the outfit he required, which came to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—he asked me whether I could take him to a-place where he could get a good dinner, and I took him to the Bell, in Aldgate—it was</p>

               <p>then late, and I stopped with him—after dinner he complained of being dizzy in the head, and he said he would not go down that night, but would go early in the morning, and he asked the waiter if he could be allowed to stop all night—he came to me early the next morning, and said he had altered his mind, and he should not go down to Wellington that morning—he then had a suit of the clothes on, and he said he should go down and make a proposal of marriage to Miss Hooper—I did not feel altogether satis<lb/>fied, and I said, "I am going down to Croydon, and I will drive you down"—we went down to Croydon, and he asked me to meet him at the hotel at 4 o'clock—he had a riding horse on our arrival, and rode over to see Miss Hooper—I did not get back till 5 o'clock, and I found him sitting at the bottom of the gig, intoxicated and almost insensible—I drove him home—he said he should go down that night, that he felt very much better, and should go down by the mail train; and he left to go to Wellington, as he said—he wanted to buy more things of me before he went, and I said, "You have quite enough; if you require more when you get there, on receipt of your cheque I shall send them down to you," and I took his measure for that purpose—he wished me good bye, and instead of going Leadenhall Street way, he went down Fenchurch Street, and that excited my suspicion, and I sent a man to follow him—in consequence of what he told me I went at 6 o'clock to his lodging in Poplar—I said to him, "I thought you were at Wellington by this time"—he said he had altered his mind, or something to that effect, I forget the words he used—I then said, "You are deceiving me, I shall have my goods back again"—I said, "You have got into another suit of clothes, perhaps you will be kind enough to take them off, for you spoilt one suit in Croydon"—while he was taking them off he said, "I assure you it is all right, my father will pay the account, and if you like I will go down with you, and if you like to stop a few days I shall be very glad of your company"—I agreed to go with him—he said, "Will you be kind enough to take an umbrella I bought of you out of pawn," which I did for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., purchased of me the day before for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid his fare down to Taunton—we telegraphed at Paddington for his father to meet us—I paid for it—when we got there his father was not there—he said, "I will go to meet my father, will you go over to the Royal Hotel and wait there till I have had the first meeting with my father, and then I will introduce your account"—he came back about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and stated that he had not seen his father—he went out again, and came back in a few minutes, crying, and he said that he had heard that his father was seized with a paralytic stroke yesterday afternoon; that he would never forgive himself, and went on more like a madman than anything else—he said, "It won't matter, the clerk will give me a cheque, and I shall come in for all the property"—we did not go to Wellington that night, because he said that his father seeing him might give him such a shock that it might be fatal to him—during the evening he said he had seen a gentleman who had seen his father, and contradicted the statement that his father was ill—the prisoner said that to-morrow was Saturday, and would be market-day, and his father would be driving that way—I did not see him, and I said I could not wait any longer, "I shall go over and see him"—he said, "If my father breaks his promise and does not pay you, I will pay you myself; as my father promised to give me this outfit, I would rather he would pay"—he went out and brought back a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I took to the bank, but got no cash for it—he had all the goods at this time—I had not received any back—he</p>

               <p>made an appointment with me to go and see his father on the Sunday, and we hired a cart and went to Wellington—it was Monday I presented the cheque, he gave it me on Saturday—when we got to Wellington on, the Sunday we put the horse up, and he said he would go and get over the first meeting with his father, and would give him the account, and settle it—he returned in a few minutes, and said he had just met his father walking with a gentleman, and his father could not go into the account that day; and he made an appointment to meet me at the Castle Hotel, at 11 o'clock next morning—I went back to Wellington the same evening, and saw his father about 7 or 8 o'clock—I told him who I was, and what I wanted—the prisoner was not there—I did not receive any money from the father—I went a second time to his father with the same success, and on the Monday evening I gave the prisoner into custody—before I gave him into custody he gave me a note, which I took to his father on the Monday—this is it—I took it once and gave it him, but with the same success—he said he would have nothing to do with it—I then gave the prisoner into custody—I told him that everything he had stated from beginning to end was false.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Anerley—on the 11th of October, I bought five pipes of wine of a Mr. Cohen, at that time lying in the Metropolitan Docks—on the afternoon of the 16th, I saw Maude in Cannon Street—he was carrying on business in Water Lane, as Garnant, Nunn and Co.—he said he was a partner—he wanted the wine, but could not pay cash, and would give me a bill for 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him the bill would be useless, as I had no means to discount it—he said he knew some persons and would write to them—on the following day he showed me a letter, and tore off the top, which he gave to me, on which it said "Ladell and Co., Merchants and Commission Agents, 86, Hatton Garden, Holborn, London, 12th October"—the purport of the letter was, that they would discount his acceptance at five per cent per annumn—it was signed "Ladell and Co."—an arrangement was made to meet at Hatton Garden, at 11 o'clock on the 17th—I went and he said Ladell was out, but would be in in half an hour—we went into the Bell—he there asked for a receipt stamp, which I said I had not got—he went out to see if Ladell was in, and remained about twenty minutes and said he had got a receipt stamp—he asked for a receipt—I said "Wait till I have been to Ladell's"—I had drawn the bill</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186805040078"/>
               <p>the day before—it was produced at the Bell—I had the warrants, and accidently left them on the table at the Bell—I left Maude there, too, while I went to Ladell's—he was not in—I was coming out and met Meyer in the passage—I said "Mr. Ladell"—he said "Yes, walk in"—I said "I am come for the money for this bill"—he said "Come again in an hour"—I said "Mr. Maude told me you would give me the cash for it at once—he said "Where is Mr. Maude"—I said "Just round the corner"—he said "I will go and see him"—we walked round into the coffee room at the Bell, but Maude was gone and the war<lb/>rants too—Meyer said "I thought you said Mr. Maude was here," and laughed—I said "I left him here"—he said "Where is he?"—I said "That I cannot say, he has got my warrants"—he then said "Well, I would not discount his bill for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has no account at the bank, besides, the drawer of the bill was represented to be a person I knew; but you are a stranger to me, wait and I will make some inquiries"—he went away for ten minutes—I said "They were my warrants," and I would go and stop them—and I at once took a cab, intending to do so—I did do so, as far as I could—I searched for Maude, and met his son, who went with me; but we did not succeed in finding old Mr. Maude—I can't account for leaving the warrants—I did not intend to part with them—I had no suspicion—I called in at Ladell's on the following morning, at 10 o'clock, and he said "Well Mr. Halford, things are not so bad as we thought yesterday, and I do not say that I will not discount the bill, but understand that I am not going to discount it at the bank rate; if you will look in at 3 o'clock, I will tell you—I went, and he sent the boy somewhere, who was gone about a quarter of an hour, and returned and said "Yes"—I don't know what that meant—Meyer said "You see, Mr. Halford, it is all right; and I will do the bill—I will give you 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—I said "Certainly not, I can't take that, but I don't mind giving you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the discount"—after a little haggling I made it 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he agreed, and said "To show you I am in earnest, I will give you a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "If you will come at 11 o'clock to-morrow, I will give you the balance"—I went on the 19th—he said "What do you want with me?"—I said "It will be 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he drew a cheque, handed it to his clerk, and said something in German which I could not understand—he said "You have not cashed the other cheque"—I said "No"—he said if I would put my name on the back he would give me the money—he laid down the money—he then sent the clerk out with another cheque—he returned in five minutes, and said something again in German—he then said "Well, Mr. Halford, this is a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> transaction"—I said "Clearly sir, because Mr. Maude has got my warrants, "Well, give me a memorandum to that effect"—and he wrote out that memorandum, and gave me a copy—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:—"London, 15th October, 1867, five pipes of wine sold to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I was an inmate of the infirmary—I am an engine-fitter—I saw the deceased in bed in the ward on Friday—the prisoner was a warder there—he had to assist in giving out meals and medicines—on the Sunday afternoon, at 2 o'clock, the deceased was a little troublesome getting in and out of bed—the prisoner came and forced him down in bed with both hands—he put one hand on his neck and raised the other, clenched, in the air—the deceased said, "Oh, don't strike me"—he said, "I will give you something to-night that will make you quiet, you won't be so troublesome getting up to-morrow—he said that very angrily—it caused both me and the rest of the patients to watch his movements all that day—when he gave out the medicine he reached the morphia bottle from the shelf—I knew it was the morphia bottle, because it was labelled so, and one tablespoonful one dose—I had been convalescent about the ward, and knew almost every bottle about the place—I am underrating it when I say the prisoner poured out half a cupful—it would be four tablespoonfulls—I was within a few inches of the man's mouth when he had it, for I reached my head over to look into the cup to see the quantity, because I was suspicious on account of his threat that afternoon—when the prisoner offered it to him, he said, "Here is a nice drop of port wine for you"—morphia is very unpalatable—the man seemed to be almost stifled as he took it, it almost choked him—he seemed to be suffocated in his throat in swallowing—as the prisoner walked away from his bedside he said, "You have got it in your guts now"—after the deceased had taken it he became very jocular, and then fell asleep—he never woke again—I was conversing with him up to about 10.30 he had had the medicine about 7—between 3 and 4 in the morning the night nurse was at his bedside—she was trying to rouse him—she said, "I cannot make this out, this patient snores so loudly"—the prisoner was then in bed in the ward—the deceased appeared to be sleeping like a man who was heavy in drink—his breathing was laborious and painful—my bed was about eighteen inches from his—when the prisoner gave the medicine his face was towards me—I looked over to look into the cup at the time I saw the prisoner pour it out from the bottle first—I did not interfere—I left it to the other patients—I could not tell it would poison him—I thought it would merely make him sleep—on this occasion he gave it in the nurse's absence—I believe it was her Sunday out—I cannot say how long she would be away—I do not recollect having seen the prisoner give anyone else medicine—the bottle was a pint bottle, and I should think there was a good half-pint in it at the time—there is a certain place for the morphia bottle on the shelf—I had had a dose of it myself on the Friday by the nurse's directions—there are six or eight medicine cups in the ward like this produced—I had only been three days in the ward on that occasion, but before that I had been there three weeks—the prisoner had only been left on one Sunday before this to give medicine, to my knowledge: he did not give it in the nurse's absence—I believe Mr. Burton should be present to give out the medicines in the nurse's absence—I had taken the morphia on the Friday out of a cup similar to this—I was very ill, and I asked the nurse to give me a composing draught; and she gave me a dose of morphia, I think somewhere about a tablespoonfull and a half—I did not at that</p>

               <p>and adherent to the left side in its whole extent—the heart was tolerably healthy; rather flabby—the aorta was sacculated, the valves empty, the chambers entirely empty—in the cavity of the pericardium there was about an ounce of discoloured serum—the intestines were healthy—they contained about half an ounce of liquid, and partly digested food, in which there was no odour of opium or any drug—there was just a small patch of congestion on the inner surface—the post-mortem examination was made on the 10th—the man had died on the 6th—there being no trace of opium in the stomach, I concluded it had been absorbed into the blood—my con<lb/>clusion certainly was, that death was caused, if not accelerated, by an over<lb/>dose of opium—I formed that opinion upon the state in which I saw him—no communication was made to me, or to the house surgeon, about his state—I first learnt his condition in going my rounds—had I not heard Smith's evidence, I should certainly have concluded that the man died from a new access of paralysis—the abscess I found had evidently existed for some time—there was an unusually serious condition of brain—there was a softening of the brain, not of long standing—the man was in that condition that he might have died at any moment—what I say about the morphia having accelerated his death, is entirely from the account given by Smith—morphia acts differently upon different persons—there is a case on record of a young man, a medical student, in a fit of despair, taking sixteen grains; but upon the application of the stomach-pump, and other remedies, he was recovered—the ordinary dose is a quarter of a grain.</p>
