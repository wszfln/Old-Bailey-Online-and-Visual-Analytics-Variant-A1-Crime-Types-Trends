            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Tavistock-square on the morning of the 13th of December, and saw the prisoner about half-past two o'clock, with a bundle; I asked what he had got - he made no answer; I followed him, and then he turned back - I asked what was in the bundle; he said a pair of boots - I asked where he got them - he said from his master's, in Holborn; I found some books there also - he said they were his own; I asked where he got them, and he could not tell me; he resisted being taken to the station-house, but I at last got Payne's assistance, and took him there - he was searched, and a pair of boots, four books, a brush, and a decanter were found on him, and another broken decanter was in his pocket, and he had three spoons.</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE. These boots have my name in them, and this Prayer-book and Bible; it is part of the property I lost; and these other things I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking in company with two young men till twelve o'clock, and from there I went to Oxford-street, to get something to drink; I heard a young man say he had got some things at his master's house, and as his master and him had had a few words, he did not like to fetch them in the day time - I waited in Little Coram-street, and went to sleep in a doorway; in about half an hour they came to me, roused me up, and gave me the articles - I said I thought they had been doing wrong - they called me a fool, and told me to go along; one of them gave me two keys, telling me it would be too late to go home, and to go with them, and have some breakfast.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On a Monday in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030004"/>July last, while I was at work, I saw the prisoners in the sitting-room up stairs; I knew Gladden, and can speak to him, but cannot exactly speak to the other - I am sure of Gladden; they were sitting in the room, having a glass of gin and water - the eldest man, who I cannot speak to, told me to bring up the newspaper; when they had been in the house a quarter of an hour mistress told me to fetch a pair of slippers out of her bed-room, which is on the same landing-place; the bed-room door was locked then - I unlocked it to go in, and locked it when I came out; I gave the key to my mistress - every thing was safe in the room; the two men were in the sitting-room at that time - I saw them there; they went away about half an hour after that - they could see the bed-room door where they sat; the sitting-room door was open; I did not see them go away - I went up stairs before they left, and met the eldest man on the first flight of stairs, next to the sitting-room door, exactly at the turning of the stairs turning up to master's bed-room, and within two or three stairs of the bed-room door - he told me to bring up a glass of gin and water; I did not see the other man at that time, and cannot say whether he was in the sitting-room; I went down for the gin and water, and while I went into the tap-room to get the hot water for it, the two men came down, and said they did not want it, as it was not ready - they paid for what they had had; I did not see them go out - they went away, that is all I know; I afterwards found a pair of gloves in the sitting-room where they had been, and three weeks afterwards I found two keys and a crow-bar in the sitting-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose a great many persons had been in the sitting-room during that three weeks? A. Yes - I never saw either of the men before, but I kept Gladden in my memory, and described him to the officers next morning; I kept his features in my memory, and described him as a tall thin spare young man, with high cheek bones, and pock-marked a little; Gladden wore a new hat, but I cannot say whether he had it off or on in the room; I gave the gloves to the officer.</p>

            . I am a publican, living in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. I went into the bed-room on the 30th of July, and put three or four sovereigns into a drawer in a bureau; I put them into a canvas bag, in which there was about 38l. partly in silver, about 11l. in silver, 23l. in sovereigns, and about eight half-sovereigns, and there was some plate in a handkerchief close to the bag - it was tea-spoons, table-spoons, salt-spoons, butter-knives, and some plated articles, which were a pair of gravy-spoons, a fish-slice, and one or two pairs of plated nut-crackers - they were all safe when I went into the room about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon; I locked the drawer of the bureau, put the key into my pocket, and locked the room door, but left the key in it - I went up a story higher, and laid down; about half-past five o'clock I was called by my little boy - I went down to the bed-room door, and the key was gone; I called for it - it was brought to me, and I found the lock hampered: I could not open it with the key, and I at last forced the door open, and found the drawer, which I had left safe, forced open, apparently by some iron instrument going between the top of the drawer and the bureau, and the handkerchief, plate, and canvas bag were gone; a pair of the plated gravy spoons have since been brought to me by Collyer, Policeman 94

            . I am a constable. On the 21st of November, the day after we apprehended the prisoners, I searched a house, No. 8, Frances-street, in company with Murphy - the prisoner Williams lived there - I found a pair of Gravy-spoons and a quantity of other property, and housebreaking implements, one hundred and five skeleton and other keys - when we took the prisoners I found three keys on Williams, which will open Harper's bed-room door; I found thirty-three keys on his person, but three of them opened the bed-room door - I was one of the persons who apprehended him on the 20th of November, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, opposite the chapel in Pentonville - Gladden was with him - Serjeant Miles was with me; they were walking, and as soon as we got near them I observed Gladden throw away a dark-lantern and a crow-bar - he threw the lantern over the rails of the chapel; I got over the rails, and got the lantern and crow-bar - I produce them: I afterwards went to search Williams' house - here are the two spoons found there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was about half-past eleven o'clock at night - had you a light? A.

             lived in the house - I was alarmed in the course of the night I sleep up stairs: I heard a noise - I came out of my room on the staircase, and saw two men; I should know them again - neither of them were the prisoners; one was on the stairs, and one at the bottom - one had a hatchet, and the other a candle; they said nothing - they went away immediately; I alarmed my aunt, and she got up: I went down stairs before her, and found the property was stolen; the back door was ajar; how it was opened I do not know; there did not appear to have been any force used; I missed two table-spoons, four tea-spoons, a silver bodkin, the tea-tongs, the top of a pepper-castor, a bottle of brandy, and a pair of spectacles - the men were gone when I got down stairs; I knew the prisoner Price before this, by his coming to do the garden - it was light enough for me to see the faces of both the men; I did not know either of them - neither of them was Price.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Price worked in the neighbourhood? A. Yes, I saw him frequently; he once worked in my aunt's garden.</p>
               <p>Sampson. She swore to me at the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you swear to Sampson at the office? A. I was frightened at the time when I said so; I did swear to him, but I recollected my words afterwards, the second time I was called up.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police, at Bromley. On the morning of the robbery, between four and five o'clock. I was out; I saw the prisoners together, about a quarter of an hour before I heard of the robbery - they were at the corner of Devan's-lane, in close conversation together, Price with his hands in his pockets: I did not speak to them, but looked at them very hard - they passed on, and I soon afterwards heard a scream; the wind blew very hard - I went from there into the Bow-road; I went to Mrs. Price's, and found a robbery had been committed, and on examining the premises, I found there was no marks of violence - they could not have got in without violence, if the house had been secured, and there was no marks of violence - outside; I then went to a coffee-shop in New Bromley, and saw the prisoner Price sitting down with his hat on, and his hands in his pockets: he took his hat off, and put it down by his side - Sampson was sitting by him; he put it down on the opposite side, not where Sampson sat - there were between thirty and forty other persons in the coffee-shop; I said, "My lad, I want you:" Price got up - I said, "Now I want your pall;" and Sampson immediately got up - he had his hat on, I believe; I desired every person there to sit still, and I reached over and took the hat, which Price had taken off his head, and I am sure it was the hat he had taken off his head a minute or two before - I am positive of it; on my taking it up, and while I was in the act of taking a handkerchief out of it, he snatched at the hat, and said something, which I did not hear - I pushed him off, and took out the handkerchief; I examined the hat, and there were two table-spoons, four tea-spoons, a pair of sugartongs, a pair of spectacles, a bodkin, a case, and cruet top; I took them out in his presence - he said nothing to it; I took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not some persons in the same box with the prisoners? A. There is no box, it is a round room; there were other persons near them - two persons could not have gone out, for the serjeant was placed outside; I cannot myself swear two persons did not leave the room - I had not an opportunity of seeing; I had returned Price his hat when he got to the watch-house - he made no remark when I gave it to him; he said publicly at the office afterwards, that it was not his, but not to me - that was between eleven and twelve o'clock the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say the hat was too large for him, and that his was a silk hat? A. He said so before the Magistrate; I believe it was a silk hat which I returned to him: he said it was too large for him - he put it on, and pulled it over his eyes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did it appear to be his hat? A. I cannot say; such men are not particular what hats they wear - I have a letter written to Price; the last witness acknowledged it to be her hand-writing - I have had no conversation with Price about it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was out on the morning of the robbery, between four and five o'clock, and saw the prisoners in the coffee-shop; I went in with Garde - I searched them; when I first went in Price had his hat on his head - he took it off, and put it down by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030006"/>side of him; I saw Garde take a handkerchief out of the hat - Price made a snatch at the hat; I laid hold of him by the collar at the time, and pulled him away - I am sure it was the hat which Price had taken off his head, and put down; it was examined in my presence, and these things taken out - I searched both the prisoners; I found 2s. 9d. on one, and 3s. 9d. on the other, and under the bench was a bottle, with a portion of brandy in it - they were taken to the station-house; I examined the premises - there was no marks of violence outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether it was a silk or beaver hat? A. I do not know; it was on his right-hand side on the bench - there was nobody between me and the prisoners, nothing but the table - I had my Police dress on; he could see me as I came in - his hat was turned upwards.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What fastenings were there inside the door? A. A bolt top and bottom, and a latch in the middle; they must have got through the wash-house door, and then to this door - if the outer door had been bolted, it could not have been drawn back outside; I examined other parts of the premises, and found no marks of violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suppose the prisoners were admitted into the house? A. I have no reason to suppose so; I cannot tell how they got in - the place must have been left unfastened, or they must have been let in.</p>
               <p>Price's Defence. What that man has said is false; when he came into the room, my hat laid on the bench, but this is not my hat, nor is the handkerchief the property was in - if you will look at that man's features, his countenance changes in telling the lie he has told about seeing me take the hat off my head; I am innocent.</p>

On the 16th of December I went to bed about twelve o'clock; I was the last person up in the house - I went down stairs, and saw my windows and doors fastened - I did not examine the bolts: about four o'clock in the morning I was aroused by my wife, and thought I smelt fire; I lighted a candle, went down into the dining-room, found the dining-room door open, and a kind of wooden box on the table, which did not belong to me - I found one of the windows up, the shutters open, and all my plate gone from the sideboard; the wooden box was a kind of clumsy dark-lantern, with a candle in it, which no doubt was what I smelt - I had left on the sideboard the plate stated in the indictment, which was a silver snuffer-tray and other plate, which is my property, to the amount of nearly 70l.; the dining-room is on the first-floor: I went down into the kitchen, and found the kitchen door fastened outside - I went into the stable, and found Miller with a light in his hand; I said, "Miller, this will not do- I must know all about this;" he was dressed - it was long before his usual time of being up; he made no answer, and an alarm being given by my wife and servants the Policeman Green came almost immediately; there was neither threat nor promise held out to Miller, in my presence - Mrs. Thomas was not present; I was the first person who got to Miller - I had got out through my surgery window; I remained with Miller until the Policeman came - I neither threatened nor made him any promise, nor did the Policeman; the Policeman came up to him, and asked him some questions about the property - the Policeman then turned round to me, and said, in his presence, "The property is on the premises, you may depend," and the prisoner said, "No, it is gone;" the Policeman searched in the stable, and afterwards I dressed, and went into the yard - I found nothing in the stable; some of my property was brought in by the Policeman - Miller said nothing in my presence that morning at the station-house; I now remember that at the stable Miller said he had let three men into the hay-loft the night before - he said so in the stable before we went to the station-house; he said he had admitted three men into the hay-loft over the stable the night before; I had found the surgery window up, the shutter not bolted, and at the station-house I asked Miller how he dared to get in at the surgery window, knowing that my assistant slept in the surgery - I knew he must have come in there, as every other part was fastened; his answer was, that he chanced it, and he mentioned at the station-house the names of the three men he had let in - I left him with the officers; I did not see Hutchinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you say, "I will give you 10l. to tell me where my property is?" A. No, nothing of the kind; my shopman slept in the surgery- I had him taken up - he was discharged, and I discharged him from my service; he slept in the room, the window of which was opened - the kitchen window was also thrown open; it was the shopman's duty to fasten the window - I know myself that it was shut down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been about various parts of the house with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030007"/>the prisoner before he said the property was gone? A. No - I had not left him; he was in the stable - he knew I had been robbed, because I charged him with it; I have two female servants.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 16th of December I was called to Mr. Thomas' house, and went into the stable; I found Miller and Mr. Thomas in the back kitchen, adjoinding the stable - Mr. Thomas said, in his presence, that he had been robbed, and had nobody to suspect but his servant; I asked what he had lost - he said his plate off the sideboard; I asked Miller if he had robbed his master - he made no answer; I then told him I must take him into custody - he made no answer; I went with him into the stable; I saw him put his hand into the cornbin, and shake the corn about; I asked what he was doing there - he shook his head, and said "It is gone;" I went into the shop with him, and I there again accused him of robbing his master - Mrs. Thomas was there; she did not say, "I will give you 10l. if you will tell me where the property is," before he said what I am going to say; he said he only wished for one thing - I asked him what that was; he said if he was allowed to go about a mile and a half he would get the property back - I told him I could not allow him to go out of my sight, if his mistress allowed him to go; I would not allow him to go out of my custody- I was going towards the shop door, and Martin, my brother-officer, produced a basket containing some plate; before that I consented to go with Miller as far as he wished me to go - he said they had put him in the hole, and he would split upon them, meaning he would say where they were; by putting him in the hole, I understood they did not take the property away as he expected - Miller said nothing when the basket was brought in; previous to my taking him to the station-house he admitted that he had let three men into the stable, and in consequence of what he said at the station-house I went to search for Hutchinson among others, and found him in Globe-fields in the evening, and apprehended him; I told him what I took him for, and he said, "What, for that concern?" and asked me if they had taken any person else - I said I had, and then I handcuffed him; in our way to the station-house (he had the handcuffs on) I saw him feeling about his bosom two or three times - I asked him what he did it for; he made no reply - I said, "You must have something there;" he said, "Take it from me," and I took this snuffer-stand from his bosom - I took it from him, and the precise words he said were, "That is all I have got - I have had no more."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you and Miller alone when he made the observation about splitting? A. Yes - it was in the shop; Mr. Thomas was not present, that I know of - he was in the stable when he made some observations to that effect, and when he said he would take me to where the property was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Where are Globe-fields? A. In Bethnal-green, about a mile and a half from where Mr. Thomas lives - I took Hutchinson between six and seven o'clock in the evening - he went willingly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could he have escaped from you? A. He could not.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. -On the night of the 16th of December I fastened all the doors; I did not fasten the surgery window - I saw that the window was down, and the shutter closed; I am quite sure the window was down - there is a cellar-flap to the house; I saw that closed by my fellow-servant - I went to bed near twelve o'clock; I had seen Miller the last thing at night - he bade me good night: he did not sleep in the house - the cellar-flap was only shut down; Miller slept over the back kitchen, which is not connected with the house - I observed the surgery window open next day, when the alarm was given, and the kitchen window and the dining-room window were all open; I heard Miller say he had let three men into the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Who slept in the surgery? A. The shopman; I do not know when he went to bed.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS. This snuffer-tray is mine - the initials on it are J. B. W.; it belonged to my wife's family, who are now deceased - the tea-pot is mine, and all the plate is mine; it is all silver except the knife-rests.</p>
               <p>Miller's Defence. Mr. Thomas speaks false with regard to coming down and meeting me in the stable; he met me in the stable first - I went into the kitchen, and saw a Policeman; Mrs. Thomas immediately put her hand on my shoulder, and said, "Edward, for goodness sake tell me where the property is, and I will give you 10l.;" I made no answer - Mrs. Thomas begged hard of me to tell, and said if I did not the others would tell of me, and then the Policeman brought the property in.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson's Defence. Miller made it known that I slept in his master's stable; what he had been at I do not know - he cannot say before my face that he let me into his master's stable, for on the Sunday previous, at nine o'clock, I left my master's, and went home to my mother; she wished me to go to my aunt's, at Chelsea - I got there, and found she had left the house; I proceeded home - it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030008"/>was late: I cannot say the time, but it might be between one and two o'clock - I got up on Sunday morning, had breakfast, and walked into Hare-street-fields, about ten minutes' walk from where I live; I there found the property which was found on me - I had it on me all day, and in the evening Miller's brother came to my house, and asked if I was coming out; I came out with him about one hundred and fifty yards, and saw three men walking sharp behind me; I looked round, and said to Miller's brother,"I should like to call at my mother's;" I was crossing the road, and a Policeman came over, and said I was his prisoner - he says I said, "Is it for that concern?" which is false - I only said I was willing to go with him; he handcuffed me, and two Policemen, who were with him, left; as we went along he asked if I wished to know what I was taken for - I said I did not mind, not having done any thing; he said, We want you on suspicion of some weights;" I asked what he meant by weights - he said,"I suppose you don't know;" I said, No, I never heard the word in my life - he said he wanted me on suspicion of being one of the party concerned in Mr. Thomas' robbery; I said I knew nothing about it - I was taken to the station-house, and gave him up the property, without his uttering a word to me; he did not ask what I was doing about my bosom; I was trying to button my coat several times - that is all I did: had I been inclined to put away the property, I had plenty of time - I am entirely innocent.</p>

               <p>Five witnesses gave Miller a good character, and Six deposed the same for Hutchinson.</p>

On the 5th of January I went to bed at eleven o'clock at night; I sleep in the back room, on the parlour floor; I was awoke about half-past two o'clock in the morning, by my wife, who had heard a noise for some time - we have a cat and dog in the room, and thought it was the cat playing with the weights of the clock; I listened, and heard them moving and then the clock stopped - I got out of bed, and heard my room door shut; I opened my back parlour door, and saw the clock was gone, and five drawers pulled out - the parlour window wide open, and the half-shutter wide open; I saw a Policeman, and asked him if any body had gone out - he said No; he came into my room, and said the property must be on the premises - he turned his lantern round, and there was a red comforter on the second stair; the privy door is behind the street door - I pulled the privy door open; the Policeman turned his lantern round, and the prisoner was sitting on the seat of the privy, with my clock, tied up, at his feet, and a bundle at his feet, tied in a red handkerchief; the clock was going when my wife awoke me - he must have got in at the window, which was shut safe when I went to bed; here is the clock and the two bundles - it is all my property.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Q. Which knife can you swear to? A. This one which is worn; I cannot tell whether my master had two dozens or one dozen like it, but five dozens and a half were missing in all - I have no hesitation in swearing to this one; they were not all worn as this is.</p>
               <p>Jackson. Q. How can you swear to the boots? A. By their being worn at the heel, and by their general appearance -I have no doubt about them at all.</p>

               <p>MR. WADE. I know this pair of shoes to be mine - they have been a good deal worn since they were taken from me; they had been mended, and I did not wear them afterwards - I cannot swear to the boots, but I can to the shoes, by the binding and mending.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q. Are you a shoemaker then? A. No, but I speak to them from having worn them, and it is natural to take notice of shoes that pinch.</p>

             (Police-constable N 149). I went to Mr. Wade's on Sunday morning, the 23rd of December; I found a pair of boots and a pair of shoes there, which I have had ever since - I have since tried the shoes on Taylor; they fitted him exactly, and he said he had no doubt they would fit - we wanted to try the boots on Game - he said if we wanted them tried we might try them ourselves; there is no doubt but they would have fitted him, but he kept moving his leg about, and would not let us try them.</p>
               <p>MR. WADE. These boots and shoes were left in my house - they are not mine, nor never were.</p>

               <p>Rogers' Defence. The boots they took from me I bought in Sheffield, before I came into this country; all the tools they found at my place were there when I went there.</p>

               <p>MR. WADE. I can swear to these shoes by the binding and mending.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH PERRY. I keep the Crown and Horse-shoe, Enfield-chase-side; there is a bridge over the New-river within three yards of my door. On the 19th of December last I saw both the prisoners at my house, and I saw the deceased there - I first saw them about eight o'clock at night - I went into the tap-room, and saw the deceased, the prisoner Johnson. Fare, Cooper, Wagstaff, Taylor, and Jackson; nobody else was present, I believe, at that time - I went into the tap-room, and saw Fare laying along a bench, apparently asleep; Johnson laid on two chairs, with his lead on a bench opposite him, and another man named Wager was laying on a bench also - I went to Fare or Wager, I cannot say which exactly, and told them I would not have any sleeping there, and I disturbed the whole of them; I aroused them all, and Fare was angry at it - Fare said, "D-n your eyes, you would not serve me so, but you think I cannot pay for a pot, but I have money that will pay for a gallon;" he put his hand into his pocket, and showed me what appeared to me to be two shillings and a sixpence; I understand he was at that time receiving assistance from the parish - I knew he was not in employment; the deceased, Wagstaff, Taylor, and another, were playing at dominoes at the time - they were playing, as I understood, for a pot of beer; only two pots of beer were taken into the tap-room until ten o'clock; I went into the tap-room at ten o'clock, and the dominoes were taken away - the party still continued in my tap-room, and just afterwards I saw the deceased and Fare tossing for some beer - I went up stairs about a quarter to eleven o'clock, having told them before I went up that it was time to go; the shutters had been shut up at ten o'clock, and I had told my wife not to serve them with any thing more - just as I got to the top of the stairs I heard Fare call for another pot; they said they would go if they had half a pint of gin, and I then heard them go away together - the deceased pulled out a purse several times during the evening; it was a silk net purse, with steel slides and tassels - I had seen it on other occasions in his possession; he took a shilling out of it to pay me for half a gallon of beer, and I afterwards saw him take it out, and take a shilling out to toss with; by the appearance of it there were from twelve to fifteen round coins in it, whether shillings or sovereigns I cannot say, but none of them were larger than a shilling - I saw nothing more of them: about eight o'clock in the morning I was informed of the murder - during the evening the deceased was showing the number of pockets he had in his dress; he appeared to me to have two suits of clothes on, and pockets inside and out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you seen the person several times before at your house? A. At my own house, and at other houses; he has been at my house before - I never saw Johnson in his company before that evening - when he showed his pockets I heard an observation made about it, but do not know whether it was by Cooper - I do not think he was present; Cooper did not come in till past ten - I believe Cooper was the only person who came in; he worked at the brewery opposite - now I come to recollect, it must have been after Cooper came that the pockets were exhibited, as they played at dominoes till ten o'clock, and it was after that; one of the party said, "D-n it, what a number of pockets he has got - he has got sixteen:" but I am certain it was not Cooper's voice, as it is so familiar to me - if he had mentioned it I should have recollected it; the others were in the habit of coming there, but I was not so familiar with their voices as Cooper's - I might see them once in a week or a fortnight, but was in the habit of seeing or hearing Cooper all day long; he used to make my house almost his home.</p>

On Wednesday, the 19th of December, I was in the service of Mr. Perry, who keeps the Crown and Horse-shoe; I was in the tap-room that evening - Johnson was in the tap-room with the deceased; I first saw him there near upon seven o'clock - one was sitting on one side of the fire, and the other on the other;

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you in the room when the deceased showed his pockets? A. No; he was the last person who went out of the door - I cannot say whether Cooper went out first, for I did not notice; Wagstaff lives about one hundred yards from our house, in the road the deceased would have to go - he would have to cross the bridge; I gave him into the care of Fare and Cooper, and they took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you speak to when you gave up the care of him? A. Fare was the only name I mentioned, but Cooper came, and took hold of him as well; Wagstaff at that time had stopped for a particular purpose - he was on the same side of the bridge as our house stood; he stood just at the corner of our house, before you go over the bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not Johnson at that time standing by Wagstaff, talking to him? A. No; Wagstaff was by himself -Johnson was not above five or six yards from him; he was with the others - Wagstaff was not talking to any body when I came out of the house; when I returned from taking the deceased over the bridge, he was at the corner of our house, and Johnson was over the bridge on the same side of the bridge as the deceased - the bridge is not above three yards long; it crosses the New-river - I only went just over the bridge with the deceased.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at Chaseside, Enfield. On the night of the 19th of December I was at the Crown and Horse-shoe, playing at dominoes with the prisoners, the deceased, and others - at ten o'clock the dominoes were taken away; I continued there with them, and a little after eleven we went away - I went out first, and the rest followed; I observed the deceased - he appeared sober when he was in the house, but when I went out, I went to make water by the side of the house, and when he got out, the pot-boy called on Jack Cooper, and Sam Fare, to see him home - he did not use their surnames, but said, "Jack and Sam, for God sake see him home, for he is so drunk, he had liked to be in the river;" Johnson was with the others - after I had got over the bridge, Johnson and Fare had got hold of the deceased, leading him, and Cooper was standing by the side of the bridge; I know Mr. Addington's house - they led him towards there - Cooper went with them: I saw them as far as my house: when I got to my house, which is in the way from the Horse-shoe, to Addington's - I went to the bottom of the garden, took up a loose post, put it over the gate, and at that time, the deceased was making water by the side of the gate; Johnson and Cooper were standing alongside him, and Fare was about six yards off, leaning against some paling - I bade them all good night, and went in doors; I saw no more of any of them that night -Fare was farther on in the path, nearer to Mr. Addington's house; when I saw Cooper was coming out of his way home to go with the deceased, I said, "Are you going with them?" he said Yes - I said, "Take my advice, and go home, and have nothing to do with them, for I think they are going to rob him;" Cooper and I walked together up to my house - we were after them; they were before us - Cooper said he would go with them; I said he must do as he liked - I went in, and shut my door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. This is not the first time you have been in the Court? A. No; I have been in trouble before, and that is the very reason I gave Cooper the advice - I told him I thought the man was going to be robbed, and advised him to go home; I did not mention my suspicion to any body, nor call a patrol - there was none, and when he said he would go with them, I thought there would be a third person, who would be a protection; I was tried here two years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say both Sam and he just now? A. Yes; about half a minute after, as we were going down the road Johnson put his foot out behind the man, and threw him on to me, and I fell into the ditch; the man's head and shoulders fell on my head - Johnson fell too; I did not remain under the man above half a minute - I had a cap on when I fell, and when I drew my head from under the man - my cap came off; it was left behind; when I got my head out I felt for my cap, and got it - it was underneath the side of the deceased's face; it was wet when I got it out - blood was on it; when I observed the blood on my cap I said to Johnson, "What have you been doing? don't hurt him - don't do any thing to him; don't kill him!" Johnson was uppermost when we fell - I could not see any thing done by Johnson before I got my head from under the deceased; when I said to Johnson, "Don't hurt him, don't kill him," he said, "I have done him;" I then got out of the ditch, and went and stood in the middle of the road - when I got out of the ditch, Johnson had his knees on the top of the deceased's breast, and his hands on his head; Johnson got off the deceased, and came to me; the deceased did not struggle - I heard him make a noise once; he did not make a noise in his throat then - it was a groaning; Johnson came from him up to me, and said, "You take this knife, and go and finish him; I have began him;" I said, "No, I won't;" he had a knife in his hand - that was the first time I observed him with a knife; it was open - after I said, "I won't," Johnson went up to the deceased, and said to him, "What will you give?"</p>

               <p>Q. Had the deceased then done any thing? A. Yes, he held up his head, and said, "Oh, don't hurt me; Oh, don't," and Johnson said, "What will you give?" the deceased said, "Any thing;" I could then see that he was all over blood - I could see it on his face; when the deceased said, "Any thing," Johnson went and cut his throat; I heard him gurgle in his throat as I stood in the road - Johnson stood by the deceased about half a minute - he took a handkerchief out of the deceased's jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030013"/>Q. When Johnson said, "You go and finish him - I have began him," did he say any thing to you besides? A. Yes, he shook his fist, and said, "Don't you say a word - don't tell any body;" that was before he cut his throat - his fist was doubled when he said this, and he held it at me; only the deceased's head and shoulders were in the ditch - his feet laid towards the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you interfere to prevent this? A. I was afraid - I was afraid of my life; after Johnson got up from the deceased, we went down the road together, down Holt White's-lane - as we were going down the lane, Johnson kept saying, "Don't say any thing to nobody - don't know any thing about it, don't say a word;" when we got into chase-side road, there is a way across the fields which will lead to the back of the house opposite Addington's; when I came to the turning, I wanted to go down the road, and he said, "Come this way across the field, don't go along there," and I went across the field with him; it is called Corney's-fields - the way across the fields leads back again to Perry's house the back way; we must cross the New-river bridge before we get to Perry's house - it is a small bridge close to the one we went over before; they are both on the chase-side road of the house - we went over that bridge together; when we got over Johnson stooped down, and washed his hands in the river, and the knife - we then came over the same bridge as we crossed coming from Perry's - it is called the Horse-shoe bridge; we then went away to the left, that leads us in the direction to Giles' house (there is a lane from the Horse-shoe bridge); we turned to the left, and went along the river side - when we had got about forty yards along the river side, Johnson took a handkerchief from his pocket and threw it into the river; the stream runs towards Giles' house - this was about forty yards from Perry's; we did not go twenty yards on together after he threw the handkerchief into the river; there is an alley leading into the chase-side road below Perry's house, down the river side- when we got to that turning, I went up the alley home, and Johnson went over the iron bridge, towards his home; I turned to the right, and he to the left - his home is not far from Giles' house; it is in that direction - the iron bridge is opposite the alley; I was not taken in custody till ten o'clock next morning, Friday - it was Friday, I believe; it was the morning after this happened - I went home about twelve at night, and was taken at ten o'clock the next morning; I was taken on the road towards Potter's-bar - I was going with my master's dray; Mead and Watkins took me; my cap was examined - I was asked some questions about the cap, and gave some answers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said true? A. Why I had been carrying some dog's meat the morning before - I do not know whether that made the blood, but I told them so; about an hour after I was taken I made a statement to Dr. Cresswell, at the George, at Enfield - I made the statement I have made here; I have been in custody since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. At what time did you go to the public house that night? A. Ten o'clock, and staid till after eleven; I had never seen the deceased before - he took out his purse once while I was there; it was a brownish colour - it had some slides on it, and appeared as if it had money in it by the look of it; I saw that - I am quite certain he did not take it out more than once while I was there; he did not unbutton his coat or show that he had a good many pockets while I was there; I never saw him do it - they had just done playing at dominoes when I went in; I staid in the room from that time till we all left together - he did not show me his pockets, nor did I say what a many pockets he had, nor did I hear any body else say it; when we left I was the first person that went out - I went on the bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the rest came out of the house? A. No, they were close behind me; my way home would be over the bridge - the others came out close to me, the deceased came out last; the deceased first took hold of my arm just before I got to Sheffield's, just after I had passed Wagstaff's - that was the first time I had any thing to do with the deceased, I am sure, either leading him or taking his arm; Matthews did not put him in my charge, he said,"Sam take care of him," and Sam went to lay hold of him - I never heard him say Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, "Jack and Sam take care of him, for he has nearly fallen into the river?" A. I never heard him say that - he left him with Fare and Johnson; I had not hold of him at all, I am positive - I took the candlestick home with me, and took it to the brewhouse next morning; I always take it home at night, to bring a light in the morning to light the fires - it was not lighted; I cannot take it home lighted, as it has got no cover - I cover my apron over it in the morning; I have not five yards to go - I do not want the light at night; all Wagstaff said to me was, that I had better go home, it would be better for me - he did not tell me that the man was going to be robbed, or any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. You say after you left Wagstaff's they pushed each other about, what do you mean by that? A. They pushed against one another as they walked along.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did? A. Fare, Johnson, and the deceased; it was in that pushing that Fare fell down - their pushing him about did not raise my suspicions that he would be robbed; I did not think any thing of the kind; when we got to Addington's, Johnson asked the deceased to go on and have a pint of beer - I dare say that was near upon half-past eleven o'clock; I went on with them, under the notion that they were going to have more beer - I knew the place would be shut up, but I thought they would call them up, or something - the beer-shop is kept by Pinnock; we turned back before we got there - the deceased said, "Are you going home?" I said Yes; I did not ask why they did not go on to the beer-shop - when they turned I turned; when we got back eight or nine poles, Johnson said, "Be d-d if Sam has not robbed him;" this was down Holt White's-lane - it was after we had turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, as far as you could learn, Johnson appeared to be impressed with the idea that he had nothing to be robbed of? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed whether he had put his hands to his pocket or not? A. No; I cannot tell whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did I understand you to say Johnson kicked the deceased? A. He tripped him up - he made a blow at him with his foot; his foot struck him on his feet next the ground - Johnson had hold of him at the time; the tripping threw him against me, and I fell into the ditch, which is not above a foot deep - his head im<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030014"/>mediately came on mine, and prevented my seeing any thing till I got it off; when I drew my head from under him Johnson was on the top of the deceased - it was a star-light night, and it froze quite sharp; there are no lamps in the lane - when I took hold of my cap my fingers were bloody; I could see that by the light of the night; it was quite light.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afraid of your life when, after getting into the road, you went with Johnson across the field by a path? A. No, I did not think any thing about it then, not when he was talking to me, my fright had gone off; we went about twenty yards along the road before we struck into the path; it is a public road; I never saw a patrol there; I did not pass any house on the road, nor meet any body - I got home about twelve o'clock, or it might be later; I went to work at five next morning, as usual - my master came and called me up; I was taken into custody at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You was dreadfully shocked, of course, at what you had seen? A. Yes I was; I had no rest - I did not mention a word about it to my master, nor to any body, till I was taken; I had the cap on my head when I was taken, with the blood marks on it - I was asked how they came there; I said I had been burying some dog's meat for master, and the blood dropped off that on the cap - the deceased appeared to be very much in liquor, quite incapable of offering resistance - one person might easily overcome him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, when you got to the corner, after you passed the two strangers, did not Johnson separate from you and go home? A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did Johnson live? A. His father lived in Stafford's-row, and I believe he lodged with him - that is near Giles'.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was you dressed that night? A. The same as now, except this ffannel jacket - I had this fustian jacket on; Johnson had on a black coat and trousers.</p>

I was at Enfield on the 19th of December, and was returning home to my father's about a quarter before twelve o'clock; I was at the end of the road leading to Holt White's-hill, and saw two or three men standing together up the lane - I saw two more a little further on, towards the Holly-bush; I was on foot; I did not see their faces at all, and cannot describe them.</p>

On the 19th of December I was passing along the road, from eleven to half-past eleven o'clock at night, and when I got to the bottom of Holt White's-hill, I saw two men standing across the road - I only saw two; I passed them, and said nothing - they said nothing to me at all; I was going towards the Holly-bush - there was a young man with me; they were standing at the corner of the lane - the one I passed had on a kind of jean coloured dress, but I did not take particular notice, for I was rather alarmed, seeing them standing in the road, and not talking together; I was glad to push on home as fast as I could - they were standing close together, side by side, right across the road; they never moved all the time they were in sight - neither of them said a word; it was a young lad, about fifteen or sixteen years old, named Frencham, that was with me - I was walking home, and asked his father to allow him to walk with me, not liking to go alone; the men stood across the road at the bottom of the Holt White's-hill, at the four road ways.</p>

I did not speak to either of the two or three persons I saw in Holt White's-lane, nor did they speak to me; I did not see more than two up the lane, or it might be three, and two towards the Holly-bush - the first two were eight or ten yards up the lane, and the other two eight or ten yards up towards the two up the lane, or it might be three, and two towards the Holly-bush - they were two men, not a man and a boy; I think one of them was in a dark dress - the two were about ten yards from the others; I did not notice whether one of them was a youth.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 20th of December, at half-past five o'clock, I went up Holt White's-lane, towards Parsonage-lane, to my work; I passed by Pinnock's beer-shop, along Holt White's-lane, and I got about half way down the lane, about three hundred yards from Pinnock's; there is a ditch on the left hand side of the road, and in that ditch I saw the body of a man laying on his face - his face was in the ditch, and his feet in the road; I kicked it, thinking it might be a man in liquor - I called to him several times, and got no answer: I pulled him, but could find no life in him, and judged that he was dead - I went back towards home, and met

               <p>Q. If you were coming down Holt White's-lane, from Pinnock's, towards the four lane ends, should you come to the gates or the body first? A.

            . I am one of the horse-patrol of Bow-street, stationed at Enfield. On Thursday, the 20th of December, at twenty minutes to seven o'clock, in consequence of an alarm, I went to the Serjeant public-house, Parsonage-lane, and saw a dead body; I went to Holt White's-lane, and observed some blood on the side of the road, and in the ditch on the right-hand side of the lane - the ground appeared to be disturbed about that spot: in consequence of further information I went with Mead to Johnson's father's house, and took him into custody; I asked where he was last night, and at what time he came home - he said, "I don't recollect what time it was;" I told him there was a murder committed last night, and I apprehended him on suspicion of being one implicated in it; he said, "That I know nothing of;" I took him to the watch-house, searched his person, and found on him a small iron box, containing fifteen duplicates and a shilling, nothing else - I locked him up; I afterwards accompanied Mead towards Potter's-bar, and apprehended Cooper - I took off his cap, and observed blood both inside and outside it, and the blood inside was wet; a conversation took place about it, and he gave an account about some dog's-meat; after he was taken a message came from him, from the George - I took him before Dr. Cresswell, where he made a statement; I observed Cooper's clothes - there was dirt on the back part of his trousers, and on several parts of his waistcoat; it was a sleeve waistcoat, and there was some on the elbows - he has the waistcoat on now; on the following Saturday I took Johnson to the New-prison - he then wore the same clothes as he wore when he was taken into custody; as I took him along, I saw several spots of blood on his trousers - I borrowed a pair of trousers at a public-house, and when I arrived at the New-prison, I took Johnson's trousers off, and gave him another pair for them; I have had his trousers in my custody ever since(producing them); he had a drab great coat and a black one under it when he was taken; here are some of the marks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030016"/>on the trousers now, but the blood is very faded - here is one spot; the marks are the same as when I took them off - the blood is in front, below the knee; it was three days after the murder that I noticed it - I see very little difference in it now; I examined the bottom of the trousers, and found there was a square piece torn out of them - I showed the trousers to Dr. Astbury, at the Coroner's Inquest, on the following Wednesday; here is a piece torn off the bottom - I observed that as soon as I took them from the prisoner; I searched his coat pocket on the same Saturday, at the same time - I found a glove in his coat pocket; I did not take particular notice of it till I got home - I then looked at it, and found marks on it, which I believe to be blood; there was very little blood on it - it is between the thumb and the fore finger; I showed that to Dr. Astbury at the Inquest - I received a piece of cloth from Mr. Perry, the same Wednesday, at the Inquest; I compared that with the bottom of the trousers, where a piece is wanting, and it fitted - I observed a dull spot of blood or two on that cloth; it was dirty, and had been trod on, and torn off as it appeared; I returned the cloth to Perry again.</p>

Yes, and returned them to him - they were all his own, I believe; I cannot tell what amount they were pawned for - I first went to the spot a few minutes after seven o'clock; the body had then been removed to the Serjeant - it appeared to me that there had been considerable struggling on the part of the person; there was trampling of feet there - the ground was a great deal disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it present an appearance of a person having fallen into the ditch, or of a person struggling? A. I cannot tell - there had been many persons there before me.</p>

            . I went to the spot on the 20th of December, where the murder had been committed - there were two or three people there; I found that piece of cloth there, about two or three yards nearer to Pinnock's than where the deed was done - I gave it to Perry; there was blood on it when I picked it up - it seemed fresh blood - this is the piece of cloth; I saw marks of blood on the ground, and in the ditch - it was about three yards from that place.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Enfield. I have seen these trousers and this piece of cloth before, and have matched the cloth with the rent at the bottom - I believe this piece of cloth formerly formed a part of the trousers: I have no doubt of it whatever.</p>
               <p>MR. ADDINGTON. I know this cap well - it is the cap the deceased wore on the night of the 19th of December, when he left my house - he had rough sailor's trousers on outside, what are called pea trousers, and he had black trousers on under them; I myself picked up that piece of cloth on the spot on the morning, before the witness found it, and threw it down again, not thinking it of any consequence - neither of the pairs of trousers which the deceased wore were at all like that cloth, and his trousers were not torn at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you find the cloth? A. About twenty minutes past seven o'clock - it was on the spot where the deceased was found; it laid in the path, not a quarter of a yard from the ditch - I handed it to Cuffley, who said it was of no use, and threw it down; he and I both had it in our hands at once, looking at it, and threw it down together; and as we came away we met Budd very near the bottom, going towards the place.</p>

            . I have come here casually, not as a witness - I have examined the cloth; I am a Blackwellhall-factor, and have had an opportunity of examining cloth for twenty years; I should say the trousers and cloth were of the same fabric, decidedly - I have not examined to see if the piece fits the place - I should say the colour is the same, and the quality is the same; that is, that it is black milled kerseymere, and they appear to have sustained the same degree of wear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you a manufacturer of cloth? A. No; I receive cloths from the manufacturer, and sell them - I heard his Lordship express some doubt as to the identity of the pieces; I did not volunteer my evidence, but was asked by Mr. Alderman Venables to give an opinion as to the texture of the cloth; there are a great many black kerseymeres manufactured - in my opinion the piece is the same as the trousers.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Is there any thing about the stitching or sewing of these trousers which enables you to speak to the cloth being the same? A. Yes, they are turned up at the bottom, and sewn to secure it; the sewing at the bottom of the piece corresponds with the sewing at the bottom of the trousers - I should say decidedly they have both been done by the same hand.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. On the piece of cloth has not every stitch been separated - is there one stitch which holds both ends together? A. No; here is the sewing on the piece, it is where the hem has been sewn, but has now become separate - it is the turn up at the bottom; I should think this sewing and that on the trousers have been done by the same person, but the trousers are worn in that state I cannot tell - the legs of the trousers should be of an equal length.</p>
               <p>Q. One of these legs are considerably longer than the other? A. There is a piece gone off all round the bottom - (here the witness pinned the piece of cloth to the trousers.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that at least half an inch longer than the other side? A. I should think it is not one-eight part of an inch different - you cannot account for half an inch, because in these sort of trousers sometimes one leg gets stretched down longer than the other, being trod upon, and different things - they are sewn with silk, and so is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030017"/>the piece; trousers of this kind are usually sewn with silk.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the silk of the same texture and fabric? A. Yes, and both are worn the same.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Enfield. On the 20th of December I was called in to see the body of the deceased; there was a wound on the right side of the cheek - there was a wound sufficient to cause his death on the right side of his neck; it was produced by a stab from a sharp instrument, which, in passing into the neck, transfixed the common carotid artery, which would produce death instantly; the beadle showed a pair of trousers at the Inquest - there appeared to me to be two distinct spots of blood on them; I have not a doubt that it was blood - they also produced a glove to me, with a mark of blood on the fore finger; I saw the piece of cloth - it is marked with blood and dirt.</p>

            , of the Holly-bush; this knife I returned to him directly after we had opened the stag - the blood of the stag spirted over our clothes; we had the pluck of the stag and 2s. for our trouble - my clothes were much torn in getting through the hedges; myself and the others, who had opened the stag, were afterwards in Holt White's-lane, where I pulled out of my pocket some of the stag's pluck, to show to some people whom we met; in my pocket there was also a piece of cloth I had torn from my trousers a week before, and as I did not afterwards find this piece in my pocket, it is by no means unlikely that it dropped out at that time: we then went and dined at Gosling's, at Windmill-hill, off part of the inside of the stag - this was about two o'clock; about half-past five I went to the Horse-shoes public-house to get a pint of beer; at that time no person was there but the pot-boy - about half an hour afterwards the deceased came in; I had never before seen the deceased - Jackson came in soon after the deceased; they asked me to play a game at dominoes, and I played part of a game with them - I do not recollect at what time Wagstaff, Fare, or Cooper, came in, but I think they were all there by nine o'clock; during the whole time I was there the deceased never made any display of, or boasted that he had any money - some time after we left the Horse-shoes public-house; the deceased appeared a little intoxicated - Matthews, the pot-boy, asked Cooper to see deceased home, and Cooper led deceased over the bridge - Fare followed; I went on as far as Wagstaff's, about which place Fare went away, and Cooper went on with deceased; Wagstaff did not speak to Cooper, but I think Wagstaff said to me, "I must go in and set the sponge;" Wagstaff then went in - I then went on to the end of Holt White's-lane, when Cooper said he would take deceased to Pinnock's beer-shop, and I refused to go any further, and went directly home. Gentlemen, - I most solemnly declare myself innocent of the crime laid to me, or of any participation in it, I am perfectly aware that asseverations of innocence, unaccompanied by proofs, are disregarded in a Court of Justice-like this, but while I bow to the voice of the laws of my country, I cannot but deeply feel that I have, by the most unmerited and cruel aspersions, been deprived of the first and noblest right of an Englishman, which entitles him to be presumed innocent until he be proved otherwise: that in saying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030018"/>this I do not submit more than is true, is proved by my having been, from the first moment that suspicion attached to me, held up to the country as a declared murderer, and one whose atrocities should long since have brought him to this bar; what is the consequence to me at this dreadful moment? this - that fear has possessed my friends, and that I am in danger of falling a sacrifice to the prejudice which ascribes their standing aloof, as a sign that I am an abandoned and worthless man. I shall not, Gentlemen, trouble you with comments upon the calumnies cast upon me, but just observe that they have been the cause, and the only cause, that I have not, in this, my hour of trial, the attendance of some most worthy gentlemen to speak to my character, and assure me, to your satisfaction, to be a person wholly incapable of committing the horrible crime for which I am indicted. Bred up to be a gardener by my respected, and I fear now heart-broken father, I have ever been able to earn sufficient funds for my support, without having resort to indirect means to obtain them; is it fair then to suppose that I should follow the trade of the midnight assassin. That I had funds at my command is proved by the very duplicates, taken for a time, by Watkins, the patrol, when he searched me, and I had then other and valuable articles upon which I could have raised a considerable sum had I wanted it: why then am I charged with having murdered Mr. Danby, to obtain what was already at my command? and as he had never offended me, what other motive can be assigned that would have caused me to attempt his life? - none could exist - none did exist. Gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands, and I implore you (not more for my own sake than for the sake of my afflicted wife) dispassionately to weigh the whole of the circumstances adduced in evidence, and I pray that the Almighty, dismissing all prejudice from your minds, will enable you to discover that though I may have been unfortunate, that I am not guilty.</p>

            . I am a beadle of Enfield. On the 19th of May (Saturday) the prosecutor came to me, and said he had lost his goods - in consequence of what he said I went with him to Potter's, who was at home, and found a great quantity of articles - he was taken into custody; on Monday morning Hanley, I, and Mead went into Hill's house - he was not at home; I found his wife Ann Hill, at home - I found the property there which Hanley has named; I went to Mr. Walker's, where Hill worked, at Enfield brewery, but he was not there - it is about half a mile from his house; I had seen him on the Sunday, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, in Walker's yard, with a horse - I searched for him, but never saw him till within the last month, when I saw him in the office of Mr. Sawyer, the Magistrate's clerk - the property at Hill's was in the up stairs rooms; he had the whole of the house; his eldest child is about eight or nine years old - his wife was acquitted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A clerk; I have to say, that in taking the prisoner into custody, he was in such a state of intoxication, we could not take him before the Magistrate at the usual hour, and deferred it till the evening - I consider that he got intoxicated with my money; I had been at a party in the King's-road, Pimlico: I went there about eight o'clock, and staid till about half-past ten - I played at cards, and different diversions; I had about two glasses of home-made wine there, that was all - I went from there to my employer's, in Edgware-road, staid there about a quarter of an hour, and went from there to Tottenham-court-road, without stopping: I live in York-place, Kentish-town - I drove to different parts of London, first to the King's Head, St. Giles'; the prisoner had a small glass of brandy there, which I paid for; I had nothing - I drove myself; I got to the King's Head about a quarter past one o'clock: I went from there to the watering-house in the Old Bailey; I had no business there, it was merely in my way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where to? A. To no place in particular - I did not get out of the cab there; the prisoner said it was cold, and wished for something - he had a small glass of brandy there, which I paid 4d. for; I then drove over Blackfriars-bridge, and back over London-bridge, down Fenchurch-street, to the Old Bailey again: I gave him a glass of brandy there - then drove through Covent-garden, Drury-lane, to Tottenham-court-road; I went into the Red Lion there, and gave him up the cab - it was about five o'clock; I called for some bread and cheese for supper, and he came in, and asked for 6d., for the broken trace: I did not pay for it - 4s. was what he demanded for his fare.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was pulling you into the house in Carburton-street, why not give an alarm? A. I did not consider his intention was to rob me; I told him repeatedly to desist, but he would not, and then he tried to push me in - I did not call out, because people were standing by, and if I had chosen to use any means I could have done so, without assistance; there were one or two cab-men standing by the door, when I called for the Policeman - my money was scattered about the street; the persons about were a set of cab-men: I saw nobody in the house, but two women - if I had offered to detain the prisoner I considered I should not have got off so easy, as there were a number of cab-men, and such sort about; I am not in the habit of associating with such fellows - I considered the 245l. quite safe; I have had treble that sum in my pocket - it was a silly foolish excursion; I am not in the habit of doing so.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Carburton-street. On Tuesday morning, the 10th of December, I was at my door, and observed the prosecutor pulled about by a set of cab-men, and observed the prisoner lay hold of his coat and pull it open - his pocket-book fell out, and the money fell out; I saw the prisoner pick up some money, but what it was I cannot say; and I saw Young distinctly pick up money, and put it in his pocket; I beckoned to the prosecutor to come over - I certainly observed the prisoner pick up something; I could not tell whether it was money or not - he picked up something twice off the ground; I could not see what he did with it - I could distinctly see that it was money which Young picked up: I beckoned to the prosecutor to come over to my door - he came into the shop; he gave me his pocket-book to take care of - there was a 200l. note in it, and other notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the prosecutor pulled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030021"/>about by a set of cab-men? A. Yes, I saw the prisoner pull him; there is a cab-yard next to my house, and the cabmen assemble at the house opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. Just tell me whether you saw the prosecutor pulled about by the cab-men, and then the prisoner seized hold of him? A. Young, who has escaped is a cab-man, and they both pulled him about - the others were round him; I cannot say whether they touched him - I did not go up to the prosecutor; I was across the street - the prosecutor stood against the Lord Nelson public-house; I did not leave my shop to give him in charge - I had nobody in it; the prosecutor called for a Policeman for a quarter of an hour, but there was none - the station is about a quarter of a mile from my house; the prisoner had wooden shoes on - I saw him go away at last; he walked away leisurely.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prosecutor intoxicated? A. No, he appeared as if he had been out all night, raking, but not drunk; he knew what he was about, and delivered his money into my hands.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SOPER. I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner at twelve o'clock on Tuesday, the 11th of December, at his lodging, Ames-yard, Charles-street, Hampstead-road - he was drunk and asleep; I told him I wanted him to go with me - he said, "I know all about it, go on, and I will follow you;" he then dozed off again -I told him the gentleman gave charge of him for robbing him; he said, "It was a b-y good job to charge him with robbing him, for he had got nothing;" I searched him and his lodging, and found no money at all - the prosecutor was with me; I saw him about nine o'clock - he appeared as if he had been drinking, but was not drunk then.</p>

            , I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Tottenham-court-road, on Thursday morning, about five o'clock - the prisoner gave the prosecutor in charge for not paying his fare; Roberts, at that time, I could perceive had been drinking, but knew perfectly what he was about - I could tell by his appearance that he had been out all night - he talked rational; I afterwards saw the prisoner in company with another man - I overtook them in Tottenham-court-road; it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after Roberts was discharged; I was with them in the Blue-posts public-house, and drank a glass of rum with them - I heard the prisoner say Roberts had got plenty of money, between 200l. and 300l. - that he saw two 10l. notes in his front coat pocket, and he put his hand to his breast: Young and another person were standing behind him at the time - he knew that I was present; he left the house with Young - they drove the cab away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on duty that night? A. Yes, my beat is nearly half a mile from Carburton-street; I had my uniform coat on - the prisoner paid for my rum; I was sober - I was off duty then; we are not forbid to go to public-houses when off duty - I did not know him before; the prisoner said he had been paid 4s., and demanded 6d. more at the public-house, but at the station-house he demanded 2s. 6d. - he demanded the 6d. for his fare; I heard nothing about the trace till afterwards - there ought to be a Policeman round Carburton-street, but it takes the man there half an hour to go round his beat; the station is three quarters of a mile from the Lord Nelson, I think.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Who was driving the cab? A. Nobody; when I saw it they were in the public-house, and the cab was at the door - the prosecutor walked from the station-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor went to several houses and was quite intoxicated; he drank at every house as I did - he changed a sovereign at the Old Bailey, to give the waterman something to drink; he treated several people who stood round.</p>

On the 24th of December, about twenty minutes before seven o'clock, I saw a man walking round the shop - I was cleaning up the board; we had lost several pairs of boots before - I concealed myself, and saw him take a pair of boots; I ran after him as fast as I could, and in turning to the right, saw him with the boots in his hand, and caught him about fourteen yards from the shop - it was the prisoner.</p>

On the 22nd of December, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I came to London - I had 6s. in a canvas bag in my pocket; about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon my cart stood in Newgate-street, for about five minutes, as I was waiting there for my master; the prisoner came and said the cart should go on - I said I was only waiting a few minutes for my master; he moved the cart himself - I took it round into Newgate-market, and came back to wait in Newgate-street for my master; the prisoner took me to the <placeName id="t18330103-17-crimeloc104">Compter</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner is a Police-officer of the City? A. Yes - I placed my cart along the curb, and stopped with it; I did not kick up a row with the officers - there were two officers; they moved the cart themselves, and I took it into Newgate-market; I was not told in Newgate-street that a complaint had been made about my cart being left there; I resisted being taken to the Compter - I cannot tell how many officers I found there, whether there were six, eight or twelve - there might be twenty; I was thrown down by the officers, and my clothes all torn off my back - I was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say as you were taken to the Compter, that you had about 100l. about you? A. I do not know that I did; I could not tell whether I had 100l. or one hundred guineas, as I had a packet of money tied up, besides what was in the bag - it was my master's, and I had never seen it counted; I found after I got home that it was 20l. - it was all taken from me at the Compter; the prisoner took my bag out of my pocket, and put it into his own, I suppose - I do not know who took the 20l. - I do not know that any body searched me besides the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body sitting there as constable or superior officer? A. Yes - it was all taken while they had me down, but they were a good while doing it; I resisted all I could - I could not see what was done with my money, for I was knelt down, on my head; Butler was with the prisoner, but he would not have taken me if it had not been for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there not a board up, prohibiting persons leaving their carts in Newgate-street? A. I do not know; I cannot read - my master ordered me to stand there a few minutes.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the nightly watch, Farringdon ward. I was in Newgate-street on Saturday afternoon, the 22nd of December, and saw the prosecutor in the custody of the prisoner and Butler - they wished me to assist in taking him, as he resisted violently, and they could not get him along; they said he had been obstructing the passage - it took four of us to take him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030024"/>the Compter - when we got there he was very violent, and they were obliged to get him down to search him; it is usual to search every body who is taken into custody, and to take the property from them till they get before the Magistrate, that they may not be robbed there; he said before he got to the Compter that he had property about him, and it might be 100l., he could not tell; I saw the money taken from him; the silver was in a canvas bag, and there was 20l. worth of silver in four 5l. packages - that was done in the presence of us all; he had the 20l. in his outside jacket pocket - he was taken before the Magistrate on Monday, and a complaint made against him for obstructing the street - he was discharged; his employer came soon after, and took the 20l. of silver - I have the canvas bag; it was taken from him by Beaman - I saw him take it from his small-clothes pocket; he did not give it to me - I suspected there was something wrong, and was convinced the prisoner had put it in his pocket without giving an account of it with the rest of the money - this was just after the search on Saturday; I saw the packages sealed up, and I said to Beaman, "Is the canvas purse sealed up with the rest of the property?" and he said there was no canvas purse among his property; I was convinced there was one, for I had seen him take it out of the prosecutor's pocket - he denied a second time that there was any canvas bag; I described it, and he said there was none - I said I was convinced there was something wrong, and proposed that one and all of us should be searched before we left the Compter; I then saw that the prisoner was confused, and wanted to get away - I followed him very close, and saw his hand lift his great coat pocket up; he pulled his hand out of his trousers pocket, and I saw the purse in his hand - I said, "There in the purse," and he instantly threw it down; I did not pick it up - it was delivered to me; Butler picked it up - this was stated to the Magistrate, and he was committed; we do not usually take a man to the Compter for obstruction, but take the number of the cart, and summon the owner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been an inspector? A. Above two years; I am not a candidate for a vacancy in the City Police - I do not wish to change my situation.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the prosecutor say he was thrown down and knelt on, is that all a lie? A. He was on a chair at the time he was searched; when he first got to the Compter, he was knelt on, in consequence of his violent conduct; it was necessary - the 20l. was taken from him by another person, and I believe it was all put into Butler's hat; the bag was in his left-hand trousers pocket - the prisoner has been an officer ever since April; it was generally thought that he conducted himself well - he was taken before Mr. Cope, the marshal, and then he was at large till Monday, when he came to the office, and I charged him with stealing the purse, before Messrs. Aldermen Wood and Kelly; I saw the bag in the prisoner's hand - I saw him take it out of his pocket and drop it; I stood alongside of him - there might be six, seven, or eight persons in the room; Butler stood on one side of him and I on the other - Mr. Teague delivered the 20l. to the prosecutor's employer; Wilmot, I believe, took it from him, and sealed it up - he is a constable of Farringdon; it might be the prisoner who took it from him, as I did not see it taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you an amateur attending at station-houses? A. No: I do not attend different gaols; I went to the Compter that night, to see if there was any message, and on other business - I cannot exactly tell what; if Mr. Teague has any thing to send, I am there to take it - I was never in Newgate, except when I have been employed there; I was never confined there - I have been to Whitecross-street with messages; I am not in the habit of attending other prisons; four or five officers were present at this search - I am not a candidate for a vacancy in the Police, and never applied for a situation there.</p>

            . I am one of the Police. I was in Newgate-street when Clarke was laid hold of for obstructing the way - I was called by the inhabitants to move his cart, which stood before a door; I went up to the prosecutor, and desired him to move on quickly - he hesitated, and, in fact, got quite impudent, and said he would not move on; I told him to go on, and the prisoner and I moved him on - he was quite violent, and kept backing his horse into the road; he moved into Warwick-lane, and threatened to fight for a sovereign, and used very bad language - I told him he was obstructing the road; he moved into the middle of the lane, and said if I did not get out of the way he would run over me; I left him - he went into Newgate-market, he there left his cart, and came into Newgate-street; his conduct was very violent, and I said it was fit to take him to the station-house - we could not manage him; seeing Wilmot and Lawes we begged their assistance, and took him to the Compter - his conduct was so violent, it was necessary to throw him down, for he both hit and kicked; he was then put in a chair and searched - the contents were taken out of his pockets and placed in my hands; that was four parcels, which we afterwards delivered to his master - what I had was taken into the lobby, sealed up, and placed in the hands of the Governor; I did not see any thing else taken from Clarke's pocket - but Lawes said there was a purse; I said I had seen none, and I believe every body but Lawes said they saw no purse, and it was the wish of Lawes to go into the lobby to be searched - the prisoner stood by my side; I felt his hand go behind me, and immediately something dropped - I turned round, took up the purse, and gave it to Lawes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you unwilling to take Clarke, or were you persuaded by the prisoner to take him? A. I thought fit to take him; it was the prisoner's duty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030025"/>to search him - it was three o'clock; Lawes only came to assist - I have seen Gould at the Compter at times; I cannot say whether Clarke heard the inhabitants complain of his cart - I wished to take him before my inspector.</p>
               <p>MR. TEAGUE. I am keeper of Giltspur-street Compter. I was attending at Guildhall when this happened - when a man is brought in, it is the practice to search him, to prevent his being robbed; the money was locked up in my desk, and when I came home I delivered it to Clark's master; one of the officers has the canvas bag - the officer who brought the prisoner in should search him, and take possession of the property; one of my turnkeys was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it customary to have persons brought to the Compter for obstructing the street? A. Every day - they generally take the cart to the Green-yard.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He might see the parcel under my arm when I went through the shop. Witness. No, I did not see the parcel - the bag was not my employer's; I saw the parcel when I went into the warehouse; it was all covered with the bag but the card in front of it - he was buying a small quantity of hooping.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had you been out of place? A. About two months - this took place on Monday morning; I had not been to bed the night before - I walked about all night; I was alone -I was out late on Sunday, and did not like to go home to disturb the persons in the house; I had been drinking brandy on Sunday - I was not drunk; I got to the King's Head about seven o'clock in the morning - I went out of the door intending to go home; I had no female with me, nor did I procure protection from any female in my way from the house, but there was a woman with the prisoners; I should not think we had as much as nine pots of beer or ale at their room; I believe we had not five half-pints of gin; I believe we had two half-pints of rum - I had lived with Mr. Hoggarty, the auctioneer, for sixteen months, and had 40l. a year - when I left him I had a cheque of him for 13l.; when I began this carousal on the Sunday I had a sovereign in my pocket; I cannot tell when I changed it- when I left the last public-house I had 13s. or 14s. - I did not ask the prisoner Stevenson if he had any money.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that you did not ask him as soon as you got into his house, if he had any money? A. I cannot say that I did not, but I cannot see what I should ask him that for - I will not swear either way; I did not tell him I had no money, and ask him for some to buy the drink - I paid for what I had brought in; when I went to his house I was not drunk; I cannot say whether he told me he had 15s. saved up for his rent: we had the beer, the gin, and the rum at the prisoners' - I had two glasses of brandy and water at the public-house; I had no breakfast - the prisoner asked me for the money when he went to fetch the drink; he did not ask to be paid back what he had paid for drink, but he said I was indebted to him - that was in the evening, after he was apprehended; I did not tell him I did not mean to go home till night, and wanted some money for myself, nor that I knew a pawnbroker, at the corner of Stingo-lane, in York-street, who was a friend of mine, and ask him to borrow 30s. on my watch, in the name of Davies - there were two persons there, one was named Pye; I did not retire with any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030026"/>female; I might go into another room, but I soon came out - I believe I went into two rooms.</p>

            . I am in the service of a pawnbroker, at the corner of York-street. On the 3rd of December I saw Stevenson at the shop, with a female, who I believe was Stadley; Stevenson put down this watch, and asked me 30s. for it - there was a chain, two seals, and a key attached to it; I took it to Mr. Dennings, one of my masters, and he told me to write the duplicate for it, which I did: Stevenson gave me the name of John Davies, Mitcham-street - he said the watch cost him fifteen guineas; and the woman said, "We took it for a debt."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoners before? A. No; I did not know the watch and seals - I never said so; I did not know the prosecutor, nor did Mr. Dennings: I swear the prisoner said it cost him fifteen guineas, not 15s.; Mr. Dennings is ill, and could not attend here.</p>

               <p>Stevenson's Defence. When the prosecutor came to my house, he asked if I was landlord; I told him I was - he asked if I had any money; I said Yes, 15s., to pay my rent: he said he had been out all night with a woman, and asked me to lend him the 15s. - I said if I did I must have it again; he said he would send me to a friend of his to get some; I then lent it him - we had nine pots of ale, five half-pints of gin, two half-pints of rum, and 1s. worth of bread and cheese; he gave me his watch about two o'clock, and told me to go and pawn it in the name of Davies - he gave the seal to a young woman; I took it for her to several places, but they would not lend me any thing on it, as they said it was only cased - I at last took it to this gentleman, who lent me half a crown on it; the officer took the money and duplicate from me, and the Magistrate asked him how he came to go to the pawnbroker's where the watch was, and he said something struck him to go there.</p>

            . I live in New-street, Vincent-square. On the 28th of November I was at the Craven Arms - the prisoner came in there while I was in the parlour; he said there was a very sad fire - I asked where, and he pointed towards Oxford-street; I went out to see it - he followed me, and said if I would go to the corner I should see it quite plain; I went there, but there was no fire - I then went back to the house, and found the two candles on the table, burning; when I went out they were in candlesticks - the candlesticks were then gone, and the prisoner also.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Green-court. On the night in question the prisoner came, about ten minutes before nine o'clock, and asked if I would buy one of these candlesticks; I asked if it was his own - he said, "Do you think I stole it?" I said, "I don't know, but you will have no objection to write down your name;" I gave him pen and paper, and he wrote down, "William Steward, 37, Windmill-street;" I then said, "I shall go and see if you live there:" he went with me some distance, and then ran from me - I pursued, and cried, Stop thief! he fell down, and broke the other candlestick; he was then taken.</p>

            . I live in Phoenix-street, Somer's-town, and am a broker. On the 27th of December the prisoner came to my shop, and offered me a lock for sale - having heard some inquiry about it, I said I should send for an officer; he ran off - I pursued, but could not stop him: but I saw this pair of bellows taken from under his arm - they were taken to my shop, and I gave them and the lock to the officer; he told me where he lived, and we found him behind a palliasse at his father's - his father denied his being at home.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of December I was called into my shop, and saw the prisoner; he looked out brooms, brushes and various other articles, to the amount of 8l. or 9l.; among which were 2 lbs. of shoemaker's bristles - I was going to pick them out from the other articles; he said "Stop, we will pack them so and so" - I said "If you do, you will spoil them" - he said, "Never mind, they will be undone on Monday morning, or perhaps on Sunday night;" he then said he wanted some closing-hairs; I went backwards to get them, leaving him in the shop; when I returned, he said he expected his cart to call for the goods, and begged me not to detain him; he then went away; the hamper in which the goods were packed remained with me, but no cart came, and the next morning I opened it, and missed the 2 lbs. of bristles - they were worth a guinea a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. DOANE. Q. What time was this? A. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - my man was in my shop, and my wife came in once or twice - she was waiting breakfast for me, but I would not leave the prisoner as he was in such a hurry to be off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went to buy some goods of him, but I could get them cheaper; there was a boy and a man in the shop.</p>
               <p>MR. RUDLAND. When I returned with the closinghairs, he told me to put some other goods on the top of the hamper, which was done, and then he went away; I then finished the invoice, and expected him back - I had put the bristles in one paper in the middle of the hamper, but he would have them put into two papers; and he moved them or three times - how he got them out, I do'nt know.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Might not your boy or your shopman have taken them? A. They were in the shop, and might have taken them as well as the prisoner - but I have every confidence in them.</p>

On the 15th or 16th of October, the prisoner came to my shop about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - he asked if I supplied goods wholesale at the trade price; I said I did - he then left me a written list of articles, which came to about 3l., and they were to be ready by seven o'clock the next morning; he called at seven in the morning for them - there were three dozen of broom-heads, scrubbing-brushes, shoe-brushes, and other things, according to his order; he assisted me in putting them into a package, and as we were putting them in, I called them over for his satisfaction - he then asked the price of bristles; I told him a guinea a pound, but I wanted him to have some of an inferior quality with them; he said he should be much obliged to me to let him have them, and I did on condition of his taking some more brushes - I then weighed him out 2 lbs. of bristles; I should have tied them in one parcel, but it was his wish that they should be put separate, which was done; I then put them into the hamper myself - he then purchased some other goods, some of which I put into the hamper, and some he put in; he then went away, and said he would call in ten minutes with a cart, or his cart, and take them - I had fastened the hamper down before he left the shop, concluding the bristles were inside; I never saw him again till he was in custody - as he did not return, I opened the hamper the next morning, and the bristles were missing; they were worth 1l. 18s. in the trade - all the other things were the same as they were put in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You put them in yourself? A.

Fry's service. About two hours afterwards, a country - looking man called for the gig, and I let him have it - on the 4th of December I received this letter - (read).</p>

               <p>Andover, December 1, 1832.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I am very sorry to inform you, that I have had a very serious accident with your chaise on last Thursday, at Andover, in Hampshire. As I was standing at a shop in Andover, my horse did take fright, and ran away, and unfortunately broke your chaise almost to atoms; the axletree and wheels are quite asunder; likewise the shafts and the body were so far injured, that it was quite incapable of moving it to town; therefore I have left it with my uncle at Down, ports-town, in Hampshire, and I shall arrive in town on Friday, when I will call upon you.</p>
               <p>I am your's, &amp;c., CHARLES DOLLEY.</p>
               <p>P.S. I have forwarded this letter by a coachman whom I know.</p>
               <p>L. MARTINELLI. On the Saturday morning after, the prisoner called, and said he was very sorry, but a waggon was going by, and he thought the man must have smacked his whip and the horse set off, broke the gig to atoms, and he had left it with his uncle to sell - I said I would not have it sold; I would have it sent up if it were in one hundred pieces - he said he would write to his uncle, and I should hear from him; on the Tuesday he called - he said he had not received a letter, but he expected one by hand; he called again about half-past two,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030031"/>and produced a letter from his uncle, stating that it was sold for five guineas - I said I should wish to see his uncle; he said he would be in town at Christmas, and settle with me - he then went away; I went to Fry's, and asked if such a person travelled for them - they said No; I then went to Tattersall's, and made some inquiries about the horse - the prisoner said after he was in custody, that he had taken the gig to Robertson's, in Little Britain, and pawned it for 4l., but he intended to redeem it, and let me have it back again - I went to where he said he had pawned it, and found that they had sent it to the Talbot Inn, and it was gone into the country - he offered to give me a bill at a month for the value.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What did you mean to take for it? A. I would not have taken any sum, but I did not tell him that.</p>

             (Police-constable K 25). On the Friday night after this robbery, I saw the prosecutor, and heard of his loss, and on the Sunday morning, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner driving in a cab along the highway; she inquired for the White Swan, which was not open, but the Ship and Shears was, and she went there - I watched her, and saw her treating some persons out of the cab; she then went into the Ship and Shears, and was offering every body gin, or what they liked to take - I went up to her, and asked if she had any money; she answered rather vague - I saw her put her hand into her pocket, and put it down by her side; I took hold of her hand, and found in it thirteen sovereigns, 7s., and some halfpence, and in her pocket I found three half-crowns; I asked where she got it, but she was too drunk to tell - I took her to the watch-house; I asked her next morning where she had got it: she said a captain had given her 5l., and the rest she had saved up - I said hers must be a very good trade; she then said that two homeward bound seaman, had given her some - I found on her this bag, which the prosecutor identified.</p>

             (Police-serjeant 18 D). I was in Great James-street, Lisson-grove, on the 8th of December, about eleven o'clock at night; I saw a donkey-cart coming towards me - Harding was in the cart, beating the donkey, and two others were walking by the side of it, in fustian jackets, one of whom I believe was Lenerman, but I did not see his face; I followed the cart to Lisson-grove, when Harding jumped out of it, and they all three ran off - I took hold of the donkey, and a man named Page came up; I said to him, "What have you got in the cart?" he said a copper - I took it to the station, and found two coppers in it; I went in search, and in about two hours I saw the two prisoners in Bell-street, in company - I said to Lenerman, "You are the man I want for a felony, about a copper;" "Aye, aye," he said - I then turned to Harding, and said, "You are the other man I want;" he said, "Don't handle me, and I will go with you;" I took them into a shop, and handcuffed them - I found on Harding a latch-key and a shilling, and on Lenerman a handle of a door; on the left shoulder of Harding's coat I saw some soot and dirty mortar - I asked him how he came by it, and he said in the public-house where he had been sitting; I found a copper had been stolen from No. 7, Charles-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FRENCH. Q. When you saw the cart was Lenerman with it? A. He was walking by the side of it; I knew him before, but I did not see his face - I knew him by his dress - I followed them, and did not lose sight of them; they were not driving furiously -I came up with them in about five minutes; it wanted five minutes to eleven o'clock - when they saw me they ran off; there was plenty of light to see them - when I took them before Mr. Rawlings, on Monday morning, he asked if I saw Lenerman's face - I said I did not, but I was positive it was him, at least I verily believed it was him; I did not see him have any thing to do with the copper.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know when the coppers were stolen? A. Yes, on Saturday, from No. 5, and No. 7, Charles-street; Mr. Windsor's house is No. 7.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Groom hired the cart? A. Yes; Harding had nothing to do with hiring it, but he was in the cart when Groom and Lenerman brought the coppers out; it was out of No. 31, but I cannot say whose house it was; it is a private house, and I have heard that Lenerman lodged there - I saw nothing brought from Windsor's.</p>

On the 27th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner conceal a piece of silk, in a recess behind the counter; I secreted myself in the carpet-room, and in a few minutes I saw him take the silk from the recess, place it on the counter, and cut off some of it; I then came out, and sent him up stairs to his tea - I then told Mr. Graham, who sent for him, and desired him to produce the silk; he put his hand into his hind coat-pocket, and produced the silk - we sent for the officer, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Is it not customary to put silks there? A. Not where this was placed; there were some shawls upon it - they would have been removed at night; I believe Mr. Graham had a good character with the prisoner - he had been with him for some time; I never heard any thing against him before - Mr. Graham said, "Produce the property you have robbed me of instantly;" and he pulled this out of his coat-pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were three bales of goods on the end of the counter; the witness could not see me from the carpet-room - he came to me, and asked me for a ladies address, which I gave him, and then he told me to go to tea as soon as I could - when I got up I heard a voice calling Scott; I came down and met Mr. Graham, who took me into the counting-house, and asked what was the last thing I had cut - I said fourteen yards of silk, which I intended to send to my sister, and to pay for, as is common in the trade; I believe Mr. Parkyn has done in the same way.</p>
               <p>MR. PARKYN. I never did; he brought this silk from the silk counter, and placed it on the side where silk is not sold - had it been on the silk side, I should not have thought of it.</p>

            . On the 22nd of November, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came, and brought this order; he said he came from Mr. Mister, of the Dover-road, and he wanted these things with him, as they were to be sent with an engine to Richmond that evening; he said his master, or Mr. Mister would have come himself, but he had had an accident with his cart, and the shaft was broken: I asked if he was hurt; he said No, that he was in the cart, but was not hurt - he said he was going further, and would call again: he called in about twenty minutes; the goods were then nearly ready; he said he had been to the White-horse, in the York-road: I said it must be wrong; he must mean the Liverpool-road: I gave him the goods, as specified in the order - they were worth 2l. 12s. - he went away; after he was gone I noticed that the order was signed R. Mister; and not W, but I thought it might have been written by one of his men: on the following evening the prisoner brought another order, which I have in my hand; he handed it to me, and drew back; there seemed a shyness about him, which excited my suspicion; I asked where he got it, and who gave it to him - he at first said Mr. Kember; I repeated my question, and then he said a young man at the corner of the street - the same person who gave him the order yesterday evening; that he was in the street, and a young man came and asked him if he wanted a job; that he said Yes, and he said, "Take this order, and get the things, and I will give you sixpence;" which he did, and he said if he would meet him the following evening at the Bull's Head, Smithfield, he would try to get him a place, and he said "If they ask you any questions, say you sometimes work at turning a wheel at Mister's," and that the young man said, "I do not like to call for the goods myself, because I once worked there." I sent a man out to look for the young man, but he could not find him.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that the prisoner said the man who employed him did not like to go to your premises because he had worked there? A. To the best of my recollection, I think I did - I am sure he said so; the first day he said he came from Mr. Mister, but the next day, when I questioned him, he told me at once, that a man told him to bring it, and he was waiting in the street - (order read).</p>

             (Police-constable H 49.) I was in Union-street, Spitalfields, on the morning of the 20th of December; I looked down Red Lion-street, and saw the two prisoners and the prosecutrix - they had hold of the prosecutrix's clothes, and were hustling her - I went towards them; Cook crossed the road - I heard the prosecutrix say "You have robbed me of my purse, containing three duplicates," and she called Police! I took the two prisoners to the watch-house, and in going along Cook struck the prosecutrix on the face - I got a light and on the opposite side to where the prosecutrix had been, I found this purse and three duplicates.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did they scuffle together? A. They both had hold of the prosecutrix, who was certainly in liquor; she had not been on that side where I found the purse, but Cook separated from them, and went on that side.</p>
               <p>Christmas' Defence. We had two or three quarters of gin, and the prosecutrix had some beer; we went out and she asked if she could sleep with me - I said No; she then said, "I have spent all my money, and now you will not take me home" - I said I could not; she then said we had robbed her, and gave charge of us.</p>

On the 14th of December, I met the prisoner in Harrison-street, Gray's-Inn-road, with a sack on his back; I asked several times what he had got there - he at last said, a harness. which he got at Portland-town, and was taking it to his master's stable - but he would not inform me where, so I took him to the station; he threw it down, and said, if I was going to take him to the station, I should carry the harness.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to him when he came out of the kitchen door? A. I was opposite: he saw me; he did not run at first - he had turned several corners, and I lost sight of him, before he was taken.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gilbert-street. The prisoner came to my shop on the evening of the 24th of December, about seven o'clock, and wished to dispose of a silver mug, and three silver tops belonging to a dressing-case; I inquired whose property they were; she said her own, and they had been given her - I think she said by a lady's maid, whose name she mentioned, but which I forget - she gave me her own address at No. 25, James-street - I sent my young man there; they said they knew her very well, and she was a very respectable woman; but I did not feel satisfied, and sent for a Police officer - I think these articles are worth 25s. as old silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to James-street? A. No - the prisoner did not say it was her brother's house; she did not wish to pawn these articles - she went to James-street with my young man.</p>

             (Police-serjeant D 3.) I took the prisoner - these articles were on the counter; I asked her how she came by them - she said they were given her by Fanny Baptiste, who had formerly lived in Green-street, Grosvenor-square, but she could not tell the number, and who was now gone to Russia or Prussia; she said she had known her for two months - I asked her where she herself lived; she said at No. 51, James-street; I went there, and found she had a lodging, and a few things there - I found on her 1l. 2s. 6d. and a bottle - and at the watch-house the inspector saw something on the floor, which turned out to be this silver lace band; I asked if she had any more plate - she said Yes, she had a silver spoon in her box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you at first doubted whether these articles belonged to the gentleman? A. I never doubted about this top of the tooth-brush glass; I did not tell Mrs. Marsh that I should be better able to tell if I went back and looked at the cupboard - Mrs. Marsh told me the prisoner had been taken; she supposed, for trying to pawn some articles belonging to Mr. Bosanquet; I said if she had only been going to pawn them I should take no notice of it, as I thought she might intend to restore them - she said she could not tell what the articles were; she said she thought it was the silver lid of a sugar dish - I said I did not recollect such an article; this mug has the initials of one of Mr. Bosanquet's children on it.</p>

            . I live in Whitechapel. The house belonged to me - it was nearly finished; I missed fifty-one squares of glass, which had been taken out, as it appeared, with a knife; I think they were worth 5l. or 6l. - they cost me 5l. 18s. to put in again; the house was let, and the tenant was to have gone in on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The cellar is not under the house. Witness. It goes down a step or two, and is partly under another house; the prisoner had no business there at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that having differed with the prosecutor on the subject of wages, and hearing of another job, he had gone to the premises to fetch his tools, and on the Policeman making his appearance, he stumbled against the basket, and was accused of stealing it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say I had never moved from the place? A. No - I said you moved about three feet nearer the counter where the linen was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate that, after looking for some stockings, you found the prisoner in the same place you had left her in? A. No, I said I left her six feet from the counter, and when I returned, she was three feet nearer to the linen - this is my deposition - but she had removed three feet nearer the linen; when the alarm was given, she remained still in the same place.</p>

             (Police-constable N 40). I apprehended the prisoner; I told him it was on suspicion of intermarrying, his first wife being alive, and for robbing Mrs. Catling of 5l.; he said it was no such thing, that it was a trumped up piece of business against him - he told me not to disgrace him in the street, but to let him walk; he went a short distance, and then made his escape - he was taken again, and at the station he asked if there was any letter from the country; I said there was, but I could not let him see it till the Magistrate had seen it: he said it was a bad job, but he must make the best of it, the worst they could do was to transport him for seven years, and he should petition the Court to let him go out of the country.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I gave her a good crown-piece, which she weighed before my face - her husband then came out, and she gave it to him; he then brought out two bad ones, and said somebody gave him them.</p>

            . I was in the back parlour, and saw what took place - what my wife has stated is correct; the prisoner pushed me down, and endangered my live - I have felt the injury ever since, and so has the man he knocked down afterwards; I held the crown-piece fast in my hand, and ran after the prisoner, who was brought back to my shop - the officer has the crown-piece.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CUTTRISS (Police-constable C 24). I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. These crowns are all counterfeits, and the two produced by Tennant are of the same mould.</p>

I gave her a good crown-piece, which she weighed - I thought I had change enough, but I had not; gave her the same crown-piece again, and her husband brought two bad ones from the parlour - I shoved him from the door, but I was in liquor; when I got to the corner, there was a man whom I shoved down - my hat fell off, and I returned forty yards back for it; I was then taken back - all these other people have come against me since - I never was at their shops.</p>

            . I am a coachman. On the 29th of November, I met Mr. Hall, the Police-officer, and two others, at nine o'clock in the morning, at the Wilmington Arms, John-street; I was searched by Mr. Reynolds, the officer - there was nothing on me; Hall gave me five shillings, which I expect were marked - I then went out, followed by the officers, to a private house in <placeName id="t18330103-79-crimeloc468">Catherine-wheel-alley, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

I showed him, and told him I had them from the prisoner; I did not take notice of what the prisoner said.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a coachman? A. All my life; I have been out of a situation better than two months - I have driven a cab and an omnibus; I have been a Police-constable and a porter - I never was charged with any offence in my life; it is a year since I drove a coach - the last two months I have got my living by going on messages, and have had the assistance of my wife's purse; she is a laundress - I have assisted officers occasionally, but that you know, you need not have asked me that; Hall, the officer, has employed me - I never was told what I was to have; I made no agreement about it, or ever asked; I have been employed by him since the 13th of November; I have borrowed money of him as a friend; I do not know but what I owe him money now - I have known him about three years, and have been employed in about three jobs for him; I never asked for any money, and it is an impossibility to tell what I expect - any thing will satisfy me, if they give me 5s.; I may have spent twenty days in these jobs - I have borrowed 5l. or 6l. of Hall; I have had no money at all for labour - I did not know there was any due to me; I did not know but what I was doing it for nothing - I believe I have been a witness for the Mint three times, twice in this Court, and once at Clerkenwell; I do not know when I began to borrow of Hall - I never borrowed any thing of any other officer - I left the Police force to join the West Middlesex regiment of militia, for which I was drawn - I was discharged from the Police for quarrelling with my serjeant; I did not think myself justly used, and instead of reporting him I swore at him; I never was in any gaol, nor accused of passing bad money - I had been to the prisoners on the 27th of November, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030046"/>Q. Why did you not mention that before? A. Because the prisoner was indicted for what happened on the 29th, and if I had mentioned that, you would have said I prejudiced the minds of the Jury; I did not tell him I wanted five sixpences gilt to put them into punch-ladles - I did not see him; I had a shooting-jacket on then - I did not tell him I was a silversmith; I was at his house on the Monday, and purchased one of these sixpences - I did not say to him on the Tuesday, "Do these as well as you did the one yesterday, for that was done very well - I must have them on Thursday, and get the punch-ladle done on Saturday - don't disappoint me;" nor any thing like that -I saw a person there on Tuesday, who I expect was his wife; I did not see any man, nor did I say in the presence of any man, that the sixpences were intended for punchladles - I did not take down two of these on the Thursday, and say I had only two punch-ladles ready - he did not tell me they only came to 2s. - I said I had but 5s., and could take but two.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. In consequence of information I employed this witness to assist me in apprehending the prisoner; I sent him to his house on the 29th of November - we met at the Wilmington Arms; Daniel was searched by Reynolds - he had no money and I gave him five marked shillings - I then told him to go on; Reynolds followed him, and kept him in sight, and Lloyd followed me, and kept me in sight - when we got to the house I went up, in consequence of a signal; I went in, and when I got to the first floor landing-place, the prisoner was coming down; he asked me what brought me there - I said I did not know; we then went into the room - I caught hold of Daniel's hand, which he had in his pocket, and found this bit of paper, in which were these two gilt sixpences; I asked where he got them - he said of the prisoner; Lloyd searched the prisoner, and found on him 27s. or 28s. in silver, and, I believe, a half-sovereign, all good; I found the five shillings which I had marked - I said to the prisoner, "Nesbitt, it is a pity a man like you should do such a thing, to be taken from your family; where did you get these things?" he said, "Of him," pointing to Daniel - I said, "Now you are telling an untruth, for he has been employed by me to detect you;" we found two gilt farthings in a tea-chest, which the prisoner said were only counters - in going to the office he said he did not know there was any harm in guilding sixpences to put into the bottom of punch ladles and pots - but as to the selling he did not know how he should get over it; I have known Daniel about twelve months - he states he has been a cab-driver, and I believe he has been in the Police - I never advanced him any money; I have paid him when a case has been done - I think on the last occasion I paid him 1l. 10s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give him that for past services, or was it money lent or advanced? A. No, it was money for past services; I have been employed by the Mint for many years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is he in your debt? A. No, Sir; I do not recollect that I ever lent him a shilling; I paid him for what he did, and he knew it was for that - I think the first time I employed him was in the case of Cole, tried here, and the last time was at Clerkenwell; when the case is over Mr. Powell pays me, and I pay him - if he says I have lent him money as a friend, it is wrong.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in a long address, stated that he had been a water-gilder for many years, and that Daniels had called on him, and employed him to gild the sixpences, to put into the bottom of punch-ladles, which he had done, and placed them on the mantel-piece, out of the reach of his children.</p>

I noticed that the bosom of his shirt was rather large, and having had information of this robbery, and having seen some of James' shirts, I took his shirt off - I saw the end was cut off it, and a piece put in; I asked him how he came by it - he said he bought it in Moumonth-street; I asked how long he had had it - he told me six months, I am sure he said that; Mrs. James claimed it, and he said to her, "It is very curious if that is your shirt, I have had four months."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his lodgings? A. I asked where he lodged - he told me first one place and then another; I went to some of the places; I did not see his brother.</p>

            . I am a baker and live at Enfield. On the night of the 19th of December I was at the Crown and Horse-shoe public-house; Fare was there in the course of the evening - we came away a little after eleven o'clock; Johnson, the prisoner, Cooper, and the deceased went out altogether; I went with them as far as my house - we all left at the same time; my house is about a hundred yards from the Crown and Horse-shoe; the deceased was intoxicated: they all passed me at the corner of the house; Johnson and Fare led him along, one on one side, and the other on the other - I was behind them, with Cooper; we proceeded in that manner until we came to my house, and there I parted with them: they were going in a direction towards Sheffield's house.</p>

            . I was at the Horse-shoe on the night of the 19th of December - I remember the party leaving the house about ten minutes after eleven o'clock; Fare was one, and the deceased was another - Fare and Johnson led the deceased along the road; after Matthews went in, I was behind with Wagstaff - they went just by Wagstaff's house; Wagstaff went into his house - I know Sheffield's house; they did not go quite so far as there: Fare and Johnson were leading him, and just before they got to Sheffield's, I saw a scuffie and a pushing about with them, and Fare fell down - I did not go up to them - the deceased caught hold of my arm, and Fare went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030048"/>away directly he got up; he was not on the ground half a minute - Fare lived with his mother, at the Holly-bush - I did not see which way he went; I never saw any thing more of him after that - I afterwards proceeded as far as Holt White's-hill, and while there I did not observe any body meddle with the deceased's pockets, or turn either of them inside out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not state yesterday that you saw a person in Holt White's-lane take a handkerchief out of Mr. Danby's pocket? A. That was up the lane, when the man was killed; Johnson took a handkerchief from his jacket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From his jacket pocket or his breast? -A. It was about his breast that he took it from.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was not the handkerchief taken from his jacket after he was murdered? A. Yes - I had been knocked into the ditch, and he upon me, and when I had an opportunity of seeing, Johnson's knees were on Danby's body, and his hands on his head; it was starlight and freezing; I was about three yards from Danby when the pushing took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be larking among drunken men? A. Yes - I did not know they were doing any harm; it appeared to be larking - Sheffield's house is seven or eight yards from Wagstaff's; Fare went away about a minute after Wagstaff went into his house - Wagstaff did not advise me to go home as he went in; he had done so about half a minute before - he said it would be better for me to go home; the prisoner was about four yards off - he could not hear that as Wagstaff did not speak loud - the prisoner had been drinking with the decased and Johnson; I do not think he was at all tipsy.</p>
               <p>Q. Fare was thrown down with this pushing? A. I do not know that he was thrown down; he went on the ground - I had my eye on him from the time Wagstaff went in till he fell down.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you able, from the position you were in, to tell whether he was robbed or not at that time? A. I cannot tell one way or the other; I heard no money rattle when Johnson took the handkerchief from Danby's pocket; I was near enough to hear if there was any - I was about four yards off; Johnson did not produce any silver to me after the murder - there was an opportunity to rob Danby near Sheffield's house, if they were disposed to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a passage between Wagstaff's and Sheffield's? A. Yes, it goes up the high road; it is a narrow passage by a public-house - the scuffle was in the footpath at the side of the passage: the road runs two ways - there is a little road branches off into the high road; that is what I call the narrow passage - the scuffling was in the footpath at the bottom of the passage, about ten yards from the high road, in the passage.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know if he kept his money in the same pocket as the handkerchief? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a silk or cotton handkerchief that was taken from him? A. I do not know, I had not hold of it; it was the handkerchief which was thrown into the river; the passage goes up into the road - it leads from the public-house to the chase-side road; we did not go out of the road - the passage was in the course of our way.</p>

            . When I saw the deceased produce his purse from time to time; he always put it into his right-hand breeches pocket, I am confident of that, for I had seen him pull it out the day before at the Holy-bush, and observed how very careful he was in putting his purse away.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How late did you see him with the purse? A. About half-past ten o'clock; I am certain he then put it into his right-hand breeches pocket - I went to bed after that, and cannot say whether he pulled it out again; I heard he was tipsy when he left the house.</p>

             re-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where Fare fell was there any ditch on the side? A. No. It was a level ground - he fell against the fence; it was on the right-hand side going along: the scuffling was hugging one another, pushing each other about - there was not much struggling.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you observe who commenced the struggling? A. Johnson apparently: Danby did not resist the struggling as offensive or troublesome - he was not in a state to resist it; I cannot say whether he was sensible enough to take it as a joke - I do not think there was struggling enough to make Fare fall down; they were only hugging and pushing about: he was not pushed down.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. On the morning of the 20th of December, I received information of the murder; I went to the spot, and saw the deceased's body - I observed a cap and gloves in it, with the body; I took Fare into custody on the Thursday morning, about ten minutes after eight o'clock: (it was about half-past eight when I got home;) I took him at his mother's house, in chase-side, near the Holly-bush - if persons were going from the Crown and Horse-shoe, to the Holy-bush, they would pass Sheffield's house to go to the footway, and along the chase-side road: he would be in a direct line to his home when he was with Cooper, and the deceased in the chase-side road - his mother keeps a small cottage; there are two little rooms down stairs, and two up stairs - she has a family, but I do not know how many; I did not search the cottage: I took Fare to the watch-house - I searched him there, and found on him four knives and 4d. in halfpence, a penny-piece, the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, some shot, a key, and two sixpences; I have known Fare from his infancy - he had been living in different families: he has lived at his mother's for some months; it is my duty to attend the parish officers at Enfield - Fare was a pauper of the parish, and received relief on the 19th at the poor-house, I saw him there that Wednesday morning, and in the afternoon; I was in the committee-room with him when they gave him an order for 2s. 6d. - I said,"Give it to me Sam;" I passed it over to the master of the house, who handed him two shillings and a sixpence in my presence - I cannot recollect whether he was in the habit of receiving relief before that; when he came, he applied for work or relief, saying he had got no employment, and he could not starve - the chairman said, "A youngman like you, coming for relief, you let yourself down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030049"/>very much to come as a pauper;" I know he said, "I must have relief or starve," or something like that - I showed Mr. Addington the tobacco-pipe bowl; Watkins searched his mother's house - I took a key from him, which I applied to a box at his mother's house, in company with Watkins; it opened the box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been in the habit of attending the committee when giving relief? A. Yes, for some years; persons sometimes get relief who are not really in want.</p>

               <p>JOHN MEAD. I took possession of the cap and gloves at the Serjeant, but not the halfpence; the shot was then in the cap; when I searched Fare I found a very small quantity of shot loose in his waistcoat pocket, with the bowl of the tobacco pipe - I did not take them all out; they are the same size as those found with the body; I found no shot in the deceased's clothes - I did not search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The shot was inside the cap? A. Yes, when I saw it - I understood it was picked up, and put in the cap; here is all the shot I took from Fare, he had more, but it was a very small quantity.</p>

On the morning before I heard of the murder I saw Mr. Danby at about half-past twelve o'clock, Wednesday morning - he came to my house; I had given him change for a sovereign on the Tuesday night; I gave him 20s.; he returned me one to pay for some gin and water - I gave it him all in shillings.</p>

            . Q. You say Fare fell towards the paling - was the deceased's face or back towards Fare? A. Fare had hold of the right-hand side of the deceased when he fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Johnson twisted about at all? A. A little; he was on the left-hand side.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. After Fare left you, on which side of the deceased did Johnson walk? A. On the right-hand side all the way; I should think he had an opportunity of taking any thing from the deceased if so inclined - the struggling lasted about half a minute; Fare had hold of him; I did not see him meddle with his pockets.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On which side of the deceased was Fare? A. On the right-hand side; he had an opportunity of robbing him if so disposed; I could not see whether he had his hand in his pocket - he was on his right side all the time till he left; he did not tell us he was going away; he left without saying a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the road light? A. There is a hedge; it is not so light as the Chase-side road.</p>
               <p>JOHN CUFFLEY. I was present when the deceased's clothes were examined; there was some halfpence and a sixpence I believe found; I had the key of the room all the time, till the Inquest; nobody could get at it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WATKINS. I examined the deceased's clothes at the Inquest, and found a sixpence and a foreign halfpenny in the inside jacket pocket - there was no other money on him at all.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I most solemnly declare my innocence of the charge - I am accused of having in my possession a tobacco-pipe bowl, some shot, and 11s. in silver, the supposed property of the deceased Benjamin Couch Danby, which has been attempted to be proved, by circumstantial evidence only, to have been the property of the deceased; I submit to your Lordship and Gentlemen, that there is no proof that the deceased was robbed by me, nor indeed was he, which I most solemnly declare; I do trust, that your Lordship and Gentlemen will not deem the possession of a tobacco-pipe bowl, and which I had had upwards of one month previous to the day in which the unfortunate and dreadful business was committed, and which I had used at least three weeks previous to the murder, on which day I had been shooting birds on the Chase, in company of Henry Keep, Thomas Moles, and George Hill, all of whom would have proved they saw me with the tobacco-pipe bowl, which I then used to charge the gun with powder, with which I shot the birds - the gun had been lent me by a person named

I was in the tap at Cranford bridge on the 9th of December; I went down there about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and continued there till near six in the evening; I went down there to receive some money, and had been drinking but very little; the prisoners, Biggs and George, came in, as near as I can remember, about half-past three o'clock, and remained there till within a quarter of an hour of my going away - I was never in their company before - I cannot say whether Hodges was there; I went out a little before six o'clock, and went on towards Hounslow; I cannot exactly say the time, as the clock in the room did not go; as I came upon the bridge, going towards <placeName id="t18330103-83-crimeloc486">Hounslow</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many public-houses had you been to that night? A. Only that one, I am certain; it is the White Hart; I was in no other house before the robbery - I was not turned out of any public-house, and refused any liquor; I was not altogether sober, but was not drunk; I cannot say how much I drank, to a pint or two - I paid 1s. 6d. for it, but the prisoners had part of it; I recollect saying I was the best body-snatcher in England; I should not have said that, but when I came in Biggs said, "There is that body-snatcher;" George said, "I'll lay a pot of beer he never took a body in his life" - Biggs said, "Oh, Yes, he has many a score, ayn't you old boy?" I said, "Yes, to be sure, many a one," &amp;c.; I said so in order not to have any words; the tap-room was nearly full of people; I do not know the man I met on the bridge: I said to him,"Here they are coming," but it was some boys I mistook for them - I have a perfect recollection of all the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not cursing and swearing, and so tipsy that the man you spoke to left you to follow your own devices? A. No; I said to him, "Here are the b - rs coming who have robbed me;" the persons might be ten or twelve yards off at that time - I will not swear they were within five yards; the witness Williams is not the man I spoke to - it was a taller man; there might be a person behind the man I spoke to, but I only saw him - I was much more sober then, through the fright; I was not in the Hare and Hounds that night - I know Knivton, the landlord - it was not at his house I said I was a body snatcher.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the White Hart and Hare and Hounds on the same side of the way? A. No - I am not certain that Hodges was there, but more than three partook of what I had.</p>

Biggs said Yes, and I tapped him on the shoulder; they passed me, and walked too fast for me -Hodges said, "He has got him in the road;" Hodges then set out running, and Biggs after him - I went near to them, and saw some man before they got up to the prosecutor, but I could not swear it was George; there were four together, and the three dragged the prosecutor on the bridge- as they drew him on the bridge, New said, "You are picking my pocket; "Hodges said "No, I am putting your handkerchief into your pocket;" they dragged him right on the top of the bridge - New had a white and black Newfoundland dog with him; Biggs asked where the strap was - I cannot tell what strap he meant; Biggs had the dog in his hand - as I passed close to them on the bridge I went a little way; I then stood and listened, and heard New halloo out, "You are picking my pocket - you are robbing me;" he cried very much at the time, and hallooed out, "You have got my money," and then he hallooed out Patrol! Patrol! six or seven times, and up came a postboy, Harry Burt, who lives at the bridge; I said, "Harry, let us go, perhaps they will drag him into the ditch;" we went up to the top of the bridge, to New, and Harry said,"Where are they?" they were gone then; New said,"Here they come;" there was a lot of boys coming along then, one of whom I saw in the yard to-day; the boys were not the persons who had been pulling New about - they were coming, and he thought it was the men coming along, and said, "Here they come back; I shall know them" - New was standing up when we got to him, he crossed the road to me - I said, "How much have they robbed you of?" he said 17s. and a watch - he was tipsy, but sensible - it was not very dark, it was moon-light -I did not interface to prevent it, because I knew if I had gone near them they would as soon have knocked me down as him; I went down to the White Hart to have a pint of beer at the tap, where the prosecutor had been, and told them what had happened - I told them the men's names.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a costermonger? A. Yes - I was not drinking at the White Hart, and never saw the prosecutor before: there was nobody on the road when I first saw them - they dragged him to the top of the bridge, about fifty yards from the houses, and one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards from the White Hart; I did not see Williams there - I know him; I do not think I met any body between the bridge and the White Hart; New did not point out two persons, and say "There are the two b-rs who robbed me;" if he did it was before I went up - Burt, the post-boy, and I went up together; I was quite sober.</p>

They were fighting when I came up: the White Hart is about one hundred and fifty yards from the bridge - I found George there, but finding nothing on him, let him go; I found two sovereigns in New's breeches pocket - he said his silver was taken from his waistcoat pocket; he said he had received 13s. or 14s. at the White Hart, and it was all gone but half a crown, and he went away to make sure of his gold - I could see he had been on the ground; it was reported on the bridge that he had five sovereigns in his possession, but I did not hear him say so,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before? A. Yes, and knew them from his description - he described one as tall, the other short, and that one man in a dark coat was stouter than the rest, and shorter than the other stout one; that description answered to the prisoner's- George had a dark coat on on the Sunday evening, and Biggs is stouter - he described Hodges as the tallest.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was with Emmerson on the Sunday night, when he saw the prosecutor; he described the persons who he said had robbed him, as Emmerson has stated - I apprehended Hodges and George in consequence of that description; I took Hodges at work at Cranford - he answered the prosecutor's description; I did not search him then - I brought him to the prosecutor, and asked if he knew him; he said, "Yes, I will swear to him - he was one of the men who robbed me;" I left him with my partner, and then went and took George, at Harlington, at work, cutting down a hedge, about half a mile from Cranford - I bought him to the prosecutor, who said,"That is another of them, I will swear to him;" I was with Emmerson when he apprehended Biggs on the Monday morning (before I took the others) - the prosecutor said, "He is one of them" - Emmerson searched Biggs; nothing was found on any of them.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN NEW re-examined. I had two sovereigns that night, in my left-hand breeches pocket - I had 6d. in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and I think a 1d.; the silver I was robbed of, was three half-crowns and three shillings; they were in my left-hand waistcoat pocket - I felt George's hand in my waistcoat pocket; I had a Newfoundland dog with me, and missed the dog all at once; I thought it was gone down to the water under the bridge to drink - I was dragged some distance before I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you tell nobody you had lost five sovereigns? A. No; it happened on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>George's Defence. I came out of the tap where the prosecutor was, and went across the road with a young woman, about half-past four o'clock, and then he came out- he behaved indecent, and the young woman went away.</p>

            . I keep the Hare and Hounds, near Cranford-bridge. I know all three of the prisoners, and New perfectly well - I recollect the night of Sunday, when the alarm of the robbery was raised; before that the three prisoners and New were at my house: I am certain New was there, and will swear he was very much intoxicated - he was very abusive indeed: he wanted more drink; I told him I would not fill him any more, on account of his bad language, and bad behaviour - he was not fit to drink any more; he had had too much: he said he was the best body-snatcher in this country, there was no one equal to him - this was at my house; I heard an alarm of robbery the same Sunday night - he was at my house a little before six o'clock, between half-past five and six; my wife pressed him to go away several times, but he wanted to stop, and dropped his cap off, which I picked up, and put on his head as I wished him to go - my house is on the London side of Cranford-bridge: the White Hart is on the other side, on a different side of the road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did he come to your house that evening? A. From half-past five to six o'clock; all three of the prisoners were there, two of them were in the house before he was (Hodges and Biggs), and when I had drawn them a pot of beer, New came in - George came in a few minutes after, they had conversation together; merely romancing with each other - I do not know on what occasion he said he was the best body-snatcher; they were talking with him about it, but did not ask him any questions about it - it was his own voluntary discourse; they all four went out of my house together, and went towards London - it was about six o'clock, as near as I can guess; I have seen New before, I do not know that I ever saw him in my house before - he gave me half a crown to pay for a pot of beer: he was only once in my house that day; he did not come back.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I recollect the Sunday night the robbery was committed near the bridge; I know New: I was about two hundred yards off the bridge - hearing this man swearing, brought me to the spot, he was very drunk indeed; he said I had robbed him, I and another witness - before I came up to him, I heard him use a very bad expression; when we got up, and went close to him, he said, "They are the two b-rs that robbed me;" he said he had got five sovereigns left, they had not taken all - I went away, Colley and Burt were on the other side of the bridge, six or seven yards from us; Burt is a post-boy, and the other a shoemaker - that is all I know.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you hear this man swearing at a distance of two hundred yards? A. Yes, and could have heard if I had been further; he was very drunk, but he could swear very well; he was swearing about body-snatching.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time was that? A. As near six o'clock as I can guess, it might be five minutes after - I was about fifty yards from him, when he said, "Here are the two that robbed me;" I could not see him till I got upon the crown of the bridge - I do not know who he al luded to; I saw no boys about: when we came up he said we were the two who robbed him, but not before - but he was swearing when we were fifty yards off: I know Bonsey, I did not see him there - I saw a Newfoundland dog on the bridge with him; John Ayers was with me.</p>

On the night of the robbery I found New laying by the side of the road, very drunk - it was about half-past six o'clock; I took him to Hounslow: I drank part of two pints of beer with him - he went up to a woman, and wanted to shake hands with her, and asked her who she was, and where she was going; I pulled him away: he did not annoy her - he did not tell me he had been robbed; it was near half-past six o'clock when I found him, as near as I can say; I had no watch - I went to Hounslow with him, to the King William the Fourth, and left him there: he was very drunk - I wanted him to go, but he said as I had brought him so far, he would treat me with some drink, and insisted on my going in; I drank twice with him, and came out, leaving him there -I had seen him before, he used to cry oranges, coals, and fish, with his father when I knew him before; I think he changed 6d. when he treated me.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Morrison. Last Tuesday morning, the 1st of January, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, the shop-door was open for business - master sells cloth as well as makes it up; I was coming down stairs into the shop, and a young man from Mr. Dunnet's, in Cheapside, came in, and asked if I missed a piece of cloth - I said Yes; I had not missed it, but said so, because no time should he lost - I instantly went out, and spoke to a Policeman, who was near the end of the church-yard; and as I returned home on Ludgate-hill, the Policeman pointed the prisoner out to me; he was taken in charge, with a piece of cloth, sixteen yards and three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030056"/>quarters - I went up to him, and asked where he had got the cloth; he said a man gave it to him in St. Paul's church-yard, to carry - I asked where he was taking it to; he said to the first coach-stand - he said nothing more; he had nobody with him - I can say the cloth is my master's; there is the mark of the threads left, where the ticket had been sewn on; but it is torn off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it your ticket or the manufacturer's? A. Our's - I do not know when I had seen the cloth last; I cannot say that I do know that it was taken from our shop.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Dunnet, at the corner of Paternoster-row. About a quarter after eight o'clock I was standing at my master's door; I saw a person come round the corner of St. Paul's church-yard, with a piece of cloth under his arm, part of it being unrolled - directly he got into Paternoster-row, he began to roll it up; he went down Paternoster-row, towards Ludgate-street - I followed him part of the way; he was in my sight two or three minutes - I cannot say who he was; I went round to Morrison's, and made inquiry; and then went back to master's.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. A person came and gave me information, and I saw the prisoner coming out of Paul's-alley, with this cloth under his arm, by the Charter-house - he was in the alley at the time I received the information; he had a handkerchief over the cloth -I followed him into Ludgate-street, and met Denyer; I spoke to him, and then took the prisoner - I had followed close to him; he was walking very gently along, and I did not hurry after him, because he should not notice me - I went up and asked him where he was going to take the cloth; he said a gentleman gave it to him to carry to the first coach-stand, in Bridge-street - I took him into custody; I have not had any inquiry after the cloth; I took the prisoner to Guildhall - I have had the cloth in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was walking leisurely? A. Yes, with the handkerchief over the cloth; it had no paper on it - a stranger had given me information before I saw Denyer; I told the prisoner he had passed the first coach-stand, and then he said, "The first stand in Bridge-street;" the handkerchief did not cover all the cloth - I had my suspicions directly I saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you expect to see such a large piece of cloth, with nothing but a handkerchief over it? A. I did not.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Morrison. I have looked at the cloth - I am positive it was in my employer's shop the same morning it was missed; I am quite certain it is the cloth - it had master's mark on it when in the shop; it had a ticket on it - when it was brought back there was no ticket, but there was the thread where the ticket had been.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you heard Denyer describe the threads? A. No, I did not attend to what he said; I saw the cloth again at Guildhall - I am the prosecutor's shop-boy; I have folded the cloth up - it is black; I saw it on the counter a quarter of an hour before it was missed- the other boy was lighting the first at the back of the shop, and a person might come in and take it; there had been no customer that morning - there was a canvas ticket on the cloth, with a number on it - it could not have been sold.</p>
               <p>JOHN MORRISON re-examined. I swear to the cloth - I keep an account of every particle of stock, and enter every thing sold; directly I was told the cloth was missing, I set the young man to work to see what cloth it was - he discovered the number, and then ascertained what quantity was cut from it; he is not here - I examined also, and found the quantity which ought to have been left was sixteen yards and three quarters, which was put down on this piece of paper before we measured it; there are marks where the ticket was - here is still the manufacturer's number on it, 17,917; I wrote that down before I saw the cloth, and part of that number had been cut out; it was very likely done at the cloth-worker's - there are two numbers, one the manufacturers on the outer part of the cloth, in very large numbers; but there is one part of the number now, which is 917 - the rest has been cut out: here are the threads which sewed on our number; I positively swear to this cloth - it is worth 10l. - the large figures were probably cut out before I purchased it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman asked me to carry it to the first coach-stand - I pointed him out to the Policeman, but he took no notice of him.</p>

            , as we were going along in the cab, to pay the cab hire which was 2s. - the prisoner Guest put on his spectacles, looked at the notes two or three times over, and asked what we wanted for them; I asked him 120l. for them - he said he could not give that, but he told us to wait a bit, and he would be in in a short time; we waited about a quarter of an hour - he then returned, and offered us 90l. for the notes, and we agreed to take it - we made this agreement in the back parlour; we then went up stairs with him to a bed-room, and he went to an old oak chest, and took out a little bag of sovereigns - we came down again into the parlour, and he gave me thirty sovereigns and three 20l. notes; I asked him if he could not let me have it all in gold, as we did not know how to get the notes changed; he said No, for he had taken all his gold to the Bank a short time before, and got notes for it; the notes he gave me were new looking notes -

             then said he had ten sovereigns in his pocket, which we might have, and he would go with us to the Bank of England, and change the notes - he then got a pen and ink, and wrote his name and address on all three notes - we then all three came over Waterloo-bridge, took a coach in the Strand, and went to the Bank; we went up some stairs there, and got the notes signed, or done something to; we then came down stairs again, went to another part of the Bank, and got cash for them; we received sixty sovereigns - William Guest took ten sovereigns out of the sixty, and gave me the other fifty; we came back again to the coach, and drove to the foot of Holborn-hill - we parted the money in the coach; I gave Smith thirty sovereigns, took thirty myself, and I kept thirty to give to Grimbley -

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How old are you? A. Nineteen - I had not been a pickpocket long; I cannot recollect when I began; it might be about eight months before this happened; I have been three times in prison - I was sent from Newgate to the hulks; the first time I was taken up was on suspicion of stealing some things - I do not know what they were; that was about two months after I began thieving - it was from a house in St. Martin's-lane; I was charged with stealing knives about a fortnight afterwards; I was discharged for stealing Mr. Holmes' note; and three days afterwards I was taken for stealing a purse, but went out by proclamation, and six weeks afterwards I was taken for stealing a handkerchief; I have not been in prison on any other occasion - I was sent on bail to Tothill-fields for being in company with a lad who stole something from his master - I do not recollect any more times - I was nearly eight weeks at the bulks before I got out; I was tried on the 20th of October, for receiving a pocket handkerchief, or for stealing it; I do not remember which - when I was at the hulks Mr. Thomas and Mr. Higgins came to me; they said they would hold out no promise, but if I had any thing to say I was to say it to them - I had intimated to Mr. Higgins that I had something to say when I saw him in Newgate, two or three days after my trial - I did not send for him; he came to me - he said very little; I do not remember what it was about; I had made a communication to my cousin, and Higgins came, with my cousin, to me - he did not speak about these notes, nor about Mr. Holmes' robbery -I cannot recollect what it was about; I have known Higgins from the time I began to be a thief - he is an officer; I have seen him, and drank with him; I do not know that he knew I was a thief - he never proved me one - he had taken me into custody; I drank with him after that, but paid for what I had - I have drank with him since I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030058"/>from the hulks; he lives in Drury-lane, and I in Bow-street - he has had me in custody from the time I came up from the hulks; I was not charged with any offence -Higgins told me I was to have my pardon before I gave evidence - I have not had the pardon; I was kept in custody at the station, but I went to Higgins' to have my breakfast, and sometimes my dinner, and sometimes he used to bring it to me; I have been once or twice in a public-house with him - I cannot tell how often, perhaps six times: sometimes we had a pint of beer - I was not told what I was going to Bow-street for; I had no idea, but Higgins told me that Mr. Stafford craved an interview with me, and I should see when I got there - the interview was about Mr. Holmes' robbery; Mr. Stafford took down my deposition - I was sworn, but there was no prisoner present; there was a Magistrate - no questions were put to me - I told of my own head; this was last Wednesday week; I saw Mr. Higgins twice on board the hulks, with Mr. Thomas - they asked me about Mr. Guest, and several things about the robbery, but they did not say I was to be brought up; I did not know what I was brought up for- my object in appearing here to-day is to serve the public, not myself; I did not know I was going to have my pardon till last Tuesday - Higgins told me he dared to say Mr. Stafford would get me a pardon; I was not certain that it was got - no one had said any thing to me about a pardon before then, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say that for about eight months you have been out on these expeditions - whose company did you go in? A. Very often with Smith and Grimbley.</p>

On the day before this robbery I put 125l. in Bank notes into my pocket-book, but it contained other notes to a considerable amount, 30l. at least; there was one 100l. note, and some 5l. notes - I had full 140l. in notes, or more; I had a pencil-case in my pocket-book, which I bought of a jeweller in the Strand - the name of Smith is over the door; I had sent that pencil-case back to him to be repaired - it had a stone in the top of it, with a crest on it; when I lost my pocket-book it was in it - the pencil-case was a particular one; I should know it again: I did not miss my pocket-book for some time after it was gone - I walked that morning near Berkeley-square; I came up Hay-hill, and into Dover-street - this is my pencil-case, but the stone is removed; I took rather a fancy to this case, and had a pocket-book made to fit it - and then I found the head of the pencil-case unsoldered, as I turned it rather sharp in sealing a letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You know nothing of either of the prisoners? A. No, except from having seen Smith at Bow-street; the pocket-book was in my right-hand coat pocket; my handkerchief was not in that pocket - I did not feel any pull at my pocket; my pocket is deep - it was rather a large pocket-book, made to hold this pencil-case; there were some letters in it- I missed it about twelve o'clock - I had left home about ten; I had not seen the pocket-book that day -I had seen it at seven o'clock the evening before, and had put it into my pocket; I had the same coat on I have now- my servant generally brushes my clothes in the morning, but having this money in the pocket-book, I desired him not to take my coat down in the morning; I had not taken the book out of my pocket, but I felt it there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Though you had not seen the pocket-book, had you felt your coat, so as to know that it was there? A. Yes, I had, more than once, enough to satisfy myself that it was there, after I was in the street - I have heard that pickpockets do things very dextrously, but this is the first time I was ever robbed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did they all come in together? A. Yes, and in five minutes Kennedy went out and staid three-quarters of an hour - when he came in he produced the pocket-book; Smith and Grimbley remained there all the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see who had the pocketbook before it was in the fire? A. Yes, Kennedy had - he pulled it out of his pocket just as he came inside the door; Smith and Grimbley were sitting with their backs towards him - they might have seen it, but I do not think they saw it put into the fire till I spoke about it, and objected to Kennedy poking up the fire; Kennedy went out directly he burnt the pocket-book, but Smith and Grimbley staid about two hours; they washed themselves, and put on their clean shirts.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to represent that both Smith and Grimbley remained after Kennedy went away? A. Yes, for about two hours - I had not got their shirts ready- I was obliged to iron them and air them, and they remained in the room. I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Which did he say? A. I will not be certain whether it was May-fair, or in the vicinity of May-fair; I have been a carpenter and joiner for nine years - I once lodged in Royal-street, Stangate, and worked at that time in the Belvidere-road; I had no shop there - I was preparing some roofs for granaries at Puddle-dock, for a gentleman in Thames-street; it is a dock which leads down to the Thames - it used to be called Pedlar's-acre; I have never been of any other trade - I am not a discharged Policeman; I left the Police honourably - I got my living as a carpenter previous to that, and since; I left the Police on the 22nd of February last - we had a rule of being at the station-house at eleven o'clock at night, but I was at my sister's, and imprudently stopped there all night: I went in the morning, there had been a disturbance at St. Martin's vestry-room, and the men were all called out - I met Carter, who said to me, "The inspector has suspended you," and I sent in my clothes and resigned; I refused to go before the Commissioners when Carter told me to go, but I consulted my friends, and resigned the next morning - my sister then kept the Bank public-house - I did not know the house before she took it - I certainly know it now - I have heard the term, a flash house, but I do not know what it means; a great many bad characters frequented that house - it was not at that sister's I slept the night before I left the Police - I have more sisters than one; I have not got my living as a carpenter ever since I left the Police - I have been living with my sister at the Bank for five or six months; I slept there, and my sister was good enough to keep me; I left it about five weeks before she did - I left it to go to St. Bartholomew's hospital; I have not been in the habit of hanging about at Police-offices - I was not at Bow-street office in July last; I went by, but I was not in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not there with Higgins when Smith was discharged in July last? A. I was not, I knew he was discharged about six or seven weeks afterwards, but I did not hear it from Higgins - I have drank with Higgins, but not in July last - I suspected Smith was in custody when I saw him in the cab with Mr. Thomas; it was not Higgins who was with him, it was Mr. Thomas - I did not go into the office when he was examined - I disclosed what I heard him say in the public-house about a fortnight before the examination at Bow-street - I saw what passed at William Guest's on the 5th of July; I did not think it was all right, but I did not give any information of what I saw, because I thought I had nothing to do with it,; I had no interest in it; I consulted my father and my brother-in-law, who advised me to have nothing to do with it and I did not bother myself with it - Higgins came to me about it in October; I do not know how he knew that I could tell any thing about it; I told him then, because he said it would be the means of bringing the parties to justice; there would be no blame attached to me, and I should be in no danger - I did not tell in July, as I did not know how I might be served by characters of that description; my sister who did keep the Bank is now in lodgings in Bull Inn-court, in the Strand; they have not kept any other public-house since that; she and her husband lived in Royal-street, Stangate, before they took the Bank - and when I got the job in the Belvidere-road, I went to lodge with them - I am not in the habit of removing goods in the night for people - I believe there was a distress for taxes at the Bank public-house, in March or April last; I was living there at the time; I lent the persons who were legally engaged in taking the goods away, a hand to remove them; it was about two o'clock in the day; I do not think there was enough to pay the distress; I never removed goods from there of a night - I do not know Henry Phillips - I do not know a person named Calder, in Wild-street; I have seen a man who goes by the name of Mo; he used to resort to the Bank, when my sister kept it; I do not know what his name is - I believe he assisted in removing goods from there for a lodger up stairs, but it was by day-light, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; that was five or six days before the distress was put in - I do not know whether they had removed all the goods before dark; there might be some left till the next day; they were not my sister's goods, they belonged to the lodger, whose name was Wingate.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was it Smith talked about the money? A. At the Bank, about six or seven weeks after I had seen them in the cab - there might be seven or eight persons in the public-house; I did not think of asking him what he meant by saying he got it of Mr. Holmes - I thought it was remarkable to say such a thing in a public-house, but it was not my business - I thought he had stolen it, but I knew he had been examined at Bow-street, and as that was over, I had no business with it - if Higgins or any body else had come to me, I should have told them; I had told my sister and several persons of my own family, and they advised me to have nothing to do with it - I thought when Smith said it, it was done more out of bravado than any thing else; but I suspected it might be true, from his having been in custody - I did not ask him what Mr. Holmes he meant: I had seen him several times at the Bank, and I think I told my sister the next day, or the next night, after I heard him say it; but my sister had left the Bank then; I think she left it about a fortnight before I came out of the hospital - I think she left it in June.</p>

I meant the house that had been my sister's, and my sister was there that day with me; she only lived about four doors from it - I was there, having a pint of half-and-half; I do not know whether my sister was having any thing to drink - I had been home, and could not get in; I went there, and saw her standing at the bar, talking to Mrs. White, the landlady - I did not stay more than twenty minutes; I left her there, and followed the three persons to Guest's; I certainly thought things were not right, but I did not give any information and thought I had better let it alone - I have known Higgins for fifteen months, I suppose; but have not conversed with him respecting this trial, except when he asked me what I knew of it - when I heard the trial was put off, I asked him why he did not let me know; I was never a witness in a Court of Justice but once, and was once at the Westminster Sessions - when I was at my sister's I did what there was to do, and served in the bar; I knew the house was resorted to by bad characters, but I did not harbour them; the house was not in my control; my sister could not help their coming there - I was there when Higgins took a man named Donovan out of the house; I believe it was about a cloak, but it was not stolen in that house; I believe my sister kept the house eight or nine months; they paid as far as they could, when they went away - I believe they did not pay the rent; I helped the goods away when they were seized - nothing had been removed before but the lodgers' goods.</p>

               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley among the company who resorted to that house? A. I have seen them there repeatedly; I have often seen bad characters there, and heard them relate their exploits to one another; it was very common - I left the house three weeks or a month before my sister did, and went to the hospital.</p>

            ; we kept the Bank public-house - I did not know it by the name of a flash-house; very indifferent characters came there - Smith, Kennedy, and Grimbley came there very often; on the 5th July, the day Smith was taken, I saw him with some money - I did not keep the house then; I used to go there very often to get in my debts; I saw Smith with some sovereigns in his hand, between twelve and one o'clock; I asked him to pay me what he owed me, which was 11s.; he used some very bad language, and said he did not owe me any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you arrived there before your brother? A. No, I rather think he was in the house when I went in; I am not sure; I used to attend at the bar - I do not know what you mean by calling it a flash-house - I am very sorry I ever saw it; I lost my all there; I did not owe so much when I left it as was owing to me - I had not a good opinion of Smith, though I trusted him; I think my brother left the Police in the latter end of 1831; or it might be February, 1832 - we went to the Bank in November; and it was some time after Christmas he left the Police - he afterwards came to live with me; I kept him; he cleaned knives, and did any thing there was to do - I did not pay him wages; I gave him a shilling or two, now then - when I saw Smith there in July, I stopped about twenty minutes in the house; I think I left the house before my brother, but I can hardly recollect which went first - Higgins, the officer, has been there occasionally, when he came for prisoners; he has not been there every week - I have known him not to call for a month; I knew he took two prisoners there, who were transported, and four or five others; my brother was not there five months; he was there three - he knew of two being taken in the house, because we told him; I do not know whether he was in the house when they were taken; he staid with us till we left the house, or nearly so; I am not aware where he went to; he was ill while he was with us; he had a bad leg, but it got well about a month or five weeks before we left, which was in May - we went to live in Parker-street, which is the next street; my brother lodged with me in Royal-street; he took the lodging the same week I did - I think he was at the Bank at the time we left it, but I took no sort of charge of him, and do not know when he left - my goods were seized for ground-rent, which I imprudently did not see paid before I took the house; we had a lodger named Wingate, who left us about a week before our goods were taken, and in about a week after we left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This house was frequented by bad characters? A. Yes, but I was not aware of it before I took it, or I would not have taken it; I left it very much reduced, because I had given credit to a great many persons - I tried my utmost to let the house before I left it; Smith owed me 11s. for board and for drink - I generally trusted good characters with more, but I stopped at 2s. with bad characters; I did not trust many bad characters - I believe my brother went to the house after I left it; he did not go much there that I know of -I remember Smith going away on the 5th of July, with Kennedy and Grimbley; I believe my brother followed them: I remained there then, but I meant I did not know whether my brother or I left first in the evening - I went there very often; I believe my brother did, though he did not board there; I have drank in the house after I left, but not often - I may have drank half a dozen times there: I generally drank porter; I might have taken half-and-half- I paid the landlady for what I drank; my husband is now very much reduced, and is obliged to work in a brewery - he never was in any trade; he never was a fighting-man: his brother is one.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were any prisoners taken in your house for any crime or misdemeanor committed there? A. No; my brother was not always there, but generally - Donovan was one of those who was taken, there was another taken at the same time; I always gave Mr. Thomas all the assistance I could: my brother went to St. Bartholomew's-hospital with his leg - I think he was there at the time we removed.</p>

            . I live on Holborn-hill; I carry on business under the name of Spratswell: I am a tailor. On Thursday, the 5th of July, Smith came to my house with a taller lad, and then he came again with a smaller lad; he first bought a pair of white trousers - the next time the younger one bought a suit of clothes - I forget whether Smith paid me two or four half-sovereigns; I saw a considerable quantity of money in his hand; I think twenty sovereigns or more, and the other lad had as much - here is my book in which I made the entry at the time; my attention was called to it the same day by the officer.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030061"/>JOSEPH HIGGINS (Police-constable F 35). I knew Smith before the 5th of July, and on that day I met him and Grimbley in a cab, in Holborn; I knew them to be thieves, and stopped them: they had each a new hat on, which took my attention first - it was about six o'clock, or between six and seven; I got into the cab, and saw a little bundle - I cannot say which of them had hold of it; it contained a jacket, waistcoat, and trousers, all new, and Smith had a new pair of white trousers on: I asked what they had in the bundle - they said some new clothes which they had purchased at a tailor's, and if I wished I might go there; I went in the cab to Mr. Spratswell's - I took them in there, and found that they had purchased such articles as were in the bundle; I then saw Smith had a watch in his pocket: I took it out, and asked how he came by it - he said he had bought it; I then searched him, and found in his trousers pocket fifteen sovereigns, and I found on Grimbley three sovereigns, but he had no watch - I left them in the shop, in the custody of a friend of mine, whose name I do not know; and I went to the cab, and found a green purse, containing twenty-five sovereigns under the cushion; I went into the shop, and said, "Here is a purse, do you know any thing of it?" they both denied all knowledge of it - I turned out the gold, and counted it in the presence of the shopkeeper; I got into the cab with them, and told the driver to go to Covent-garden station-house: when we got to the corner of Little Queen-street, I saw Kennedy come up to the cab, and halloo; I put my head out, and the moment he saw me, he appeared to bolt off - it appeared to me that he saw the others in the cab, before he saw me; they had several examinations at Bow-street, and were then discharged - Kennedy was out of the way for nearly a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you usually found him? A. At the Bank, and I at last found him there, playing at cards with William Guest; it might be about the 12th or 15th of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known Watts? A. Twelve or fifteen months; I have seen him in the A. division of Police - I have frequently been to the Bank to look for thieves; I have drank there when it is necessary, or we could not find them - I have been there thirty times a week sometimes, and sometimes not once; I cannot swear that I have not been a month without going there - I should think not two months, while Baldwin kept it; when I have been looking after thieves: I have gone in many times a day - I have been in when I was not looking for thieves; my own judgment or my own interest sometimes leads me to drink with thieves - I have never been told, as an officer, not to drink with thieves; I took up a gentleman some time ago as a suspicious character - I did not swear to him as a reputed thief; I charged him as a suspicious character, lurking about Covent-garden, but he turned out to be a respectable person, and I apologised publicly; he was locked up, but bail was taken for him - he admitted that he was in company with thieves, but he did not know them; I do not know his name at this moment, upon my oath - I should know it if I heard it; he told me he lived in a house in a court opposite Drury-lane theatre: he was a theatrical man I believe - I took twenty-five sovereigns to the Stamp-office on the same day that I took Smith; they were what I found in the cab - and the other eighteen sovereigns I have had in my possession ever since; I never offered any money respecting this prosecution - I never offered either of the prisoners any; I went to Smith's mother's house on the 19th of November: I found him in bed - I took him to Covent-garden station-house; I did not take him to any public-house, nor give him any gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Smith that if he would split and say where the notes were, you would make a man of him, and give him 20l.? A. Never in my life; I have known Kennedy eight or twelve months - I was not in Court when he was tried; I knew he was in Newgate, because he sent for me - I went to him once; I do not know that it is part of the orders to the Police not to visit convicted felons - I never received such an order, nor heard of it; I went to the bulks three times, and spoke to Kennedy, in the presence of the keeper of the ship - he had sent me a letter, and I asked him what he wanted; I believe Mr. Thomas has the letter - I took down an order with Mr. Capper's name to it the last time I went, but I said nothing to Kennedy about a pardon; he might speak to me about a pardon, but not on board the ship, not to my knowledge, not that I recollect; such a word never came from my lips - when I got him on shore I took him to a public-house at Greenwich, and gave him some dinner: I paid for it; I am in the habit of eating and drinking with thieves, but not living with them - Kennedy has no money nor friends; I have been obliged to feed him since I have had him in custody - I expect to be paid for it; I have sometimes sent him his breakfast, and sometimes he has come to my house - I have been once in a public-house with him since I brought him up; I will not swear I have not been oftener - I do not know that I have drank gin with him; if I have I paid for it; I have not drank rum with him -I never employed Watts; I have seen him at Bow-street, and on the evening Smith was under examination I think he came to the office with two or three more, but I will not swear it - there were several examinations, and I might have seen Watts once or twice.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know of any order that you are not to drink when on duty? A. There is an order that men are not to go off their beats to drink - I acted under the direction of the Magistrate with respect to the money - Kennedy was never in my house till I brought him from the hulks; I am compelled to feed him now, or take him to a cook-shop, or do something with him.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Police, division A. On the 16th of November I went to the house of the prisoner Guest, in Belvidere-road - it has the appearance of a shop, but there are no goods for sale; it was about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - I saw Guest at the door; I told him I was an officer, and I had come to search for some notes taken from Mr. Holmes - he said,"Dear me, I am taken very bad in my inside;" he repeated it several times, and said, "Will you allow me to go backwards;" he stepped out towards the back door, and I saw his hand was in his waistcoat pocket - I went to him, turned him sharp round, and took from his hand this pencil-case; I searched his bed-room, and found two boxes, one large and the other small - there was 20l. in money and some valuable articles in each of them - he did not go into the yard after I took the pencil-case from him.</p>

On the 3rd of December, in consequence of some information, I took Ballard and Goddard, the officers, to Mr. Gill's, a chemist, at Charing-cross; I saw the prisoner there, behind the counter, acting as an assistant; I did not speak to him, but passed through, and spoke to Mr. Gill - I then had the prisoner called in, and told him that we had been robbed, and I wished to see his boxes; he agreed that we should - he accompanied us up stairs, but we did not find any thing in his boxes; in consequence of something else, we went to a house in Groveterrace, Camberwell - I was there shown a portmanteau, which Ballard searched, and found in it the articles stated, which are mine; a part of them were in a cholera medicine-box, and the rest in the portmanteau; we then went back to Mr. Gill's - we did not find the prisoner there, but in consequence of what I there saw, we went back to Grove-terrace; we found the prisoner in the house in which the portmanteau was- the officer stated to him that we wished to go up stairs, and search the portmanteau again, and the prisoner accompanied us up stairs - the portmantean was opened, and the officer asked the prisoner who the things belonged to; he said they were his, meaning the things which were then in it - the officer then said, "I have turned many articles out of it that Mr. Gray claims;" the prisoner said they were Mr. Gray's, but he had paid for them - I remarked "Mr. Steane, you remember it was your duty, whilst in my house, to set every article down in the book that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030063"/>sold, however small their value," that the book should be produced, and I trusted that he would be able to clear himself by it; I had given him those directions on his coming into my service - I have examined the book, and these articles are not entered - my shopmen are occasionally allowed to have articles if they ask for them, but not otherwise; among other articles found in the portmanteau, I found some essential oil of orange-peel, which was drawn in England many years ago - it had become by age exceedingly thick - and for a compound which I make, it is very valuable - and I stated to the prisoner when he once put up 2 ozs. by accident, not to sell it to any druggist at any price, even if five, ten, or fifty guineas an ounce were offered for it - it is quite different to what we have in the trade; here are a number of other essential oils which have marks on them - and, among others, here is an essential oil of sandal wood, which is in an unfinished state, not fit for sale; here is some essential oil of angelica, about an ounce and a half of it - I have missed about this quantity of it from my shop; I have no doubt that all these things are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had the prisoner been in your service? A. About three months - I believe I had a good character with him, as I cannot find any written one; when any of my young men bought articles of me, they had them at the trade price, which is much under the general price; but if he had put the money into the till, and not entered them in the book, there would have been an excess of cash in the till - I certainly have known that some things have not been entered in the book; we profess to balance the book by the till every ten days, it may have been fourteen days, I think not a month; if there has been an excess in till, it has been entered in the book as sundries, but there generally has been less in the till than in the book; the common petty cash disbursements were made out of the till, and there was a book for them - I have spoken to the prisoner about the money in the till being deficient; I forget whether the prisoner's salary was 30l. or 35l. a year; I found the prisoner at Mr. Gill's; I knew Mr. Gill's shop, but had not seen him before - he keeps a respectable chemist's shop; the prisoner was there, and was quite willing that we should search his boxes - when I saw them, I inquired respecting a hair-trunk, and a carpetbag, which I knew had gone from my house with his other boxes - we found the carpet-bag in the portmanteau; when we first went to Mr. Gill's, it was about twelve o'clock in the morning; and we did not see him again till six or seven o'clock in the evening - I had desired Mr. Gill not to let him go out; but he did go out, and left a note - we found him at Camberwell; he might have gone off if he had chosen - the portmanteau did not belong to him; I really cannot tell whether it was locked or not - there are stamps of mine on these bottles; the oils could have been poured out, but I should have known them any where; they had been removed from our store bottles to stopper glass bottles.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner write? A. Yes, this letter is his writing; I received it by the Twopenny post - I am quite sure I saw the prisoner on the 13th of November; I am certain there was a hair-trunk and a carpet bag among the articles I sent for the prisoner, and he denied having them- (letter read).</p>
               <p>Mr. Gray, Oxford, 4th of November 1832.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - I am exceedingly sorry that I cannot write you in favourable terms of my brother, who still continues in a very precarious state - and it is the wish of my friends not to leave Oxford while he continues so ill; in all probability I may be in town the latter end of this week, on business of my brother's - should I, I will give you a call; - the "Bride of the Isis" I have not yet been able to get, but shall have them as early as possible, when I will forward them you. I am extremely sorry that my leaving town so hasty, but under the present circumstances it could not have been prevented; should I return to London again for a permanency, shall solicit the favour of your interest in procuring me a situation.

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 3rd of December I went to Mr. Gray's, and went with him to Mr. Gill's; I saw the prisoner in the shop; we begged to speak to Mr. Gill first - I think the prisoner spoke to Mr. Gray, but nothing material passed; when the prisoner was called into the back parlour, I told him Mr. Gray had been robbed by several of his servants, and he was suspected; I asked if he had taken any thing- he said No, he had not; I asked if he had given any thing at any time to any of Mr. Gray's servants; he said No, he had not - I said, "A bottle of lavender water - now, have you given that to any body?" he said No, but he had given a box of tooth-powder, and I think he said a box of pills to the maid; I said we must search his boxes; he was quite willing that we should - we went up stairs, and he produced some keys, but I did not have them; there was nothing found there - Mr. Gray then asked the prisoner respecting a hair-trunk, and whether he had any other box; he said he had not - I will not be sure whe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030064"/>ther any thing was said about a bag, but he said he had no boxes at his brother's - I am quite sure he said he had nothing at his brother's; we then went down stairs, and left the prisoner in the shop - this was in the morning, perhaps about eleven o'clock; we then went to Camberwell - I found the articles which Mr. Gray claimed, in a portmanteau on the landing of the second floor; the prisoner was not there - I saw a lady and gentleman there; the portmanteau was not locked, I believe; I opened it; I took the articles away, and have had them ever since -I have them here; part of them were in this cholera-chest, and the others in the portmanteau; we then went to Mr. Gill's, and in consequence of a note which I got there, we went back to Camberwell and showed the note to the prisoner, who said it was his writing - this is it - (read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Gill.</p>
               <p>SIR, - Excuse the liberty I have taken in leaving your premises without your consent, as I could not rest satisfied till I had seen my brother at Camberwell. I will be back as soon as I possibly can.

               <p>Witness. When we went back to Camberwell I told the prisoner I had found a great many things in a box, which Mr. Gray claimed, and some others which Mr. Gray had some doubt of, and he had better go up to the box; we went up and found the box where we left it, I threw open the lid, and said, "Whose things are these?" the prisoner said, "They are mine;" I said, "I have taken out a great many things, what answer have you to give to it?" he said,"Yes, they came from Mr. Gray's;" I said "Do you mean you have taken them without Mr. Gray's knowledge?" he said he had accounted for them; I said, "Of whom did you buy them?" he said, "Of myself;" I said,"Do you mean you have bought them, and paid the money into the till?" he said "Yes;" I then took the prisoner to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Mr. Gray up stairs when you had the conversation with the prisoner? A. Yes, and Goddard also; I should think they must have heard the prisoner say he had nothing at his brother's; I said so at Marlborough-street, but it was not taken down.</p>
               <p>MR. GILL. I am a chemist, and reside at Charing-cross, The prisoner was in my service for three weeks - he came on the 12th of November; I did not see him taken, but he left me abruptly on the day he was taken - he did not leave me to go to Oxford, nor did he intimate a wish to go - on the 29th of October I applied to Mr. Gray to make inquiries respecting another young man; I saw the prisoner there, who said, "He was going to leave Mr. Gray, as there were several things uncomfortable in the situation;" I said, "Well, if you have made up your mind to leave, I may as well engage you as any other person, but I beg you will leave Mr. Gray in a handsome manner, and whatever notice you have agreed to give him, I hope you will give;" he said, that was a fortnight - on the 10th of November he called at my house in my absence, and said, he was very sorry but he could not come to me till the 12th; he came to me on the 12th, and from what he said I was led to conclude he had left Mr. Gray</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was what he said to you that he had received his wages from Mr. Gray and done with him? - A. Yes - he did not desire me to keep it a secret that he was coming to me; I received notice to attend here about an hour ago.</p>
               <p>MR. GRAY. These are my property; some of the articles have never been opened - this is a bottle of essential oil of orange-peel; here is about 4 ozs. of it, which I should refuse to sell at any price - here is some oil of sandal wood in an unfinished state, in which no one would buy it; I cannot speak to the bottles, but I can to the contents of them; here is a case of lancets, which are wrapped up in a paper, which has two of my seals on it - here is a German silver spatula and spoon, which I had from Prague, in Bohemia, and I am short of them; I believe there are none such in London - I kept them in my shop for use, but do not sell them; this ink-stand contained these three coins, which were up stairs in my cabinet.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read the following Defence: My Lord and Gentlemen, - I entered the prosecutors' employ to get acquainted with his method of chemistry, and to get such information as would ultimately enable me to set up in business; and I accordingly bought, while in the prosecutors' service, essential oils, and other articles, which I did not enter in the day cash-book. I have already stated to the officers, on my being taken into custody, that these goods were Mr. Gray's; and that they came from his shop. When I took them, I was under the full persuasion,(which I believe is common to young men employed as I was in that trade,) that the custom of the trade allowed the young men to take goods at the cost price. I paid the cost prices into the till, from time to time, as I took the goods. They were curious articles, and I took them to be useful to me as samples, when I went into business for myself, as I fully intended to do. The cost prices bear but a small proportion to the actual selling price. I have been wrong in not paying Mr. Gray himself, or keeping evidence by somebody that I did pay for them. Mr. Beacall, my fellow-shopman, knew (as I thought) of my paying for some; but by a letter received from him by my attornies since I have been in custody, it appears that there was only one article which he could distinctly remember, and for which he knew that I paid into the till; as his evidence would not go further, and as he is in Dublin, and to bring him here might be the loss of his situation, I have not so far made use of his good feeling for me as to bring him as a witness. Mr. Gray said before the Magistrates, that if I had paid, it would appear by his daily cash-book; that book was not regularly kept, and only balanced once a month, as I can show; therefore that is no proof. I once reminded Mr. Gray of an omission to enter an article sold by himself, and he told me, in harsh terms, to mind my own business, and leave him to take care of his; I confess that this, which happened soon after I went to Mr. Gray helped to make me careless in entering. I made no concealment of having these things - I showed many of them to my sister Jane long before my apprehension, and they were left in an open old trunk of my brother's. My condition in life was such as not to make me at all needy - if I wanted more money than my salary gave me, I had it on application to my brother; I mention this to show that I could easily pay for what I had. The character which I have always borne will show, I trust, that I am incapable of stealing - I have had no motive for it. If I had wished to conceal them, the last place where I should have deposited them would have been my brother's, at Camberwell, to whose house, according to Mr. Gray's evidence, I had directed him to send my boxes, when I could as easily have had them sent to a coach-office, which would have afforded no clue to their discovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030065"/>- GWATKINS. I was in the service of Mr. Gray, the prosecutor, for three months. The cashbook and the disbursement-book were not regularly kept; they were balanced once a month, but did not always come right.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Gray sell such coins as these? A. No - I have seen such spoons and spatuals as these at the prosecutor's; they were not for sale - I left him in consequence of a quarrel; I went to Mr. Gardner's, but am not there now - he gave me a trial, but I was not fit for his situation; I have seen essential oil of orange-peel there; it was old and spoiled - it might be of use to him, but it would not sell in the market; I have seen such coins as these given to children.</p>

            . I am secretary to the Board of Stamps. About the beginning of November I went to the prisoner's house, in consequence of information received at Mr. Mann's shop, who is a stationer in Cornhill; I did not see the prisoner then - I intimated a desire that he should call at the Stamp-office; he came on the following day, and I told him a forged stamp had come into my possession, which had been purchased from him - (that was a stamp brought to the office by a Mr. Burridge for allowance); I observed to the prisoner, that the stamp was a forgery, and asked him where he got his stamps - he told me from various stationers; he first named Mr. Deacon, of George-yard, Lombard-street - I asked him if any discount was allowed him on the purchase of stamps from Mr. Deacon; he said no discount on bill-stamps - I asked from what other stationers; he said he had purchased some stamps of Mr. Letts, Royal Exchange, who also allowed him no discount, and from Mr. Summers, who had allowed him a discount of 5 per cent. - I observed that there was no doubt the stamps so procured from Mr. Summers were the forged ones, in consequence of the discount- he remarked that he purchased receipts as well as billstamps from Mr. Summers, and therefore 5 per cent. was not an inordinate discount on bills and receipts - I do not exactly recollect his expression; he said "9 per cent. being allowed on receipt-stamps;" I asked what proportion the bills bore to the receipts that he bought of Summers - he said very small; I then told him I had no doubt in my mind it was from that quarter the forged stamps had come into his possession, and that it behoved him immediately to send his stamps to the Stamp-office, in order that the genuine stamps might be pointed out from the forged ones; and I observed to him, that if hereafter he sold a forged stamp, he might be placed in a very unpleasant situation - I pressed on him the necessity of sending them to be examined, and he said he would; nothing further passed that I remember - 30s. per cent. is the discount on bill-stamps if 30l. worth are purchased at one time, and 7 1/2 per cent. on receipts; he mentioned 7 1/2 per cent - it was my mistake when I said 9 per cent.; these is no discount under 30l.: Mr. Sawtell and Twyford were appointed to inspect stamps which might be brought in by different stationers - I saw the prisoner again at the Stamp-office (after the appointment of the inspectors), some time in the middle of November; no conversation then passed between him and me on this subject - he applied to be allowed a spoiled stamp, and was refused; he did not say any thing about having sent his stamps to the office to have them inspected, nor I to him; Mr. Halfhide is the person employed by the Commissioners to engrave the dies - I have the minutes of the Board of the 27th of October, 1830, in which it is recorded, that the engraver delivered to me certain dies, among others is the 3s. 6d. die - I know that they were delivered to me.</p>

Yes; I then only had one stamp in my possession which had been bought of him: it was a 1s. 6d. one - I then cantioned him that he would be in danger if others were sold; when I saw him again I am sure he did not tell me he had sent his stamps to the office, and they had refused to receive them, because they were too late - I do not know whether he had sent them; I have heard from stationers that they buy more stamps than they want, in order to get the discount: if they want the money to use of course they must sell them to somebody - I cannot say whether they allow a greater discount than the office; that is a mere question of trade - money is never returned for spoiled stamps, but a stamp of the same amount; but deed-stamps of a large amount may be divided into different amounts: if 30l. is laid out in different stamps, a proportionate discount is allowed - the amount of forged stamps found at the prisoner's is under 3l.; he told me had been nine months in business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the 18d. stamp produced at your conversation? A. Yes, he saw it; I desired him to bring to the office all the stamps he had: I told him the stamps he had sold to Mr. Mann were forgeries (he made no answer), and that Burridge had bought this 1s. 6d. stamp at Mann's.</p>

            . I live with Mr Mann, my uncle, who is a stationer, in Cornhill, and assist in his business. I bought for him some bill-stamps of the prisoner; I did not buy them myself - I sent a lad for them; I saw the prisoner the day after, respecting them - Mr Pressly called on me; it was the beginning of November - this was the first time I saw him after I knew about the stamps; I told him the secretary had been down concerning a stamp bought at our shop, and which we had of him, and I had referred the secretary to him - the stamp had been sold to Mr. Burridge; Mr. Pressly looked out some stamps at our shop - I do not recollect the number; I sent for Mr. Laird, and showed them to him - I had a list of them, and told him Mr. Pressly had been from the Stamp-office, and said the stamps were forged, that he could not expect us to lose them - he gave me the money for them, and took them away with him - I think they amounted to about 1l. 14s.; I think there were about twenty stamps, or not so many - most of them were 18d. stamps; they were bill-stamps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The transaction between you and him was open, public, and fair? A. Yes - when our boy brought the stamps, I looked at them to see if they were right; they appeared to me to be genuine - the prisoner called on me the day after I had seen the secretary; he was not taken into custody for some time after, and had abundant opportunity to destroy the stamps.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He said he believed the office worked off two for one, and it would be found that was the only fraud? A. They wanted to trace that, not that they were forged, but that they were double impressions, from the same die - he did not tell me he had sent all his stamps to be inspected, and they were returned without being looked at - I was not employed by the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you bought the first stamp, you took it to the office to be allowed for? A. Yes, and that is how they detected me with it, and I wanted to clear it up.</p>

            . I live next door to Mrs. Wasem. On the 7th of December, after she went out, I heard a noise at her door - I opened my own door, looked out, and seeing nobody near I went in and shut the door, and a few minutes afterwards I heard it again; I then went and tried her door, and it was fast - I went in again, and thought I heard it pulled too; I got up, looked out, and saw two men in the court, going different ways, one towards Whitechapel-road, and the other to Montague-street - I then went and found her door open, and gave an alarm; I believe the male prisoner to be one of the men - I will not positively swear to him; it was soon after three o'clock, and rather a darkish day; the lamps were not lighted - one was a tall man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather a foggy afternoon? A. Yes, rather - his pockets were outside; I did not take particular notice of the other man - the men spoke to each other, and both went away together.</p>

            . I live seven doors from the prosecutor. About a quarter of an hour before I heard of this robbery. I went through the court, and saw two persons standing in the court - and as I returned, I saw one about twenty yards from Mrs. Wasem's house, and one at the end; the one up the court made a sign to the one at the end - the male prisoner resembles the one who stood about twenty yards from the house, but I cannot swear to him; I never saw a man more like him - I did not see his face, for when I came up the court, he put his hand to his face; I did not take particular notice, but he resembles the prisoner exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was either of them leaning against a post? A. No, the prisoner who was nearest to the house leaned against the wall - it was rather foggy, but light enough for me to see if I had had suspicion, but I had none.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Donovan in Albion-street, at a house of ill-fame, on the next morning; I believe the house was kept by the prisoner Davis; he was in bed, and she was in the room - she took a woman's pocket off the bed he was lying on, and wrapped it up; I took it from her, and found in it four half-crowns, fourteen shillings, and five sixpences - there was a particular shilling among it; I found in Donovan's trousers pocket twenty shillings, ten sixpences, two half-crowns, and half a sovereign, and in his waistcoat pocket a piece of wax candle - there was one shilling in the trousers pocket, with a mark on it, which the prosecutrix spoke to - he said he got part of the money at a collection which had been made for some man; he afterwards said he got it at gambling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you inquired if he had made a collection? A. Yes - I found a collection had been made for a poor man; the shilling the prosecutrix swears to by a mark was in Donovan's pocket - two other men were taken up on this charge; one is under examination now; he is a tallish man; the third was discharged - I know Donovan lives with Davis.</p>
               <p>MRS. WASEM (looking at the shilling.) This shilling is the dark shilling - it looks like mine; I am sure it had been among my money; I can swear to this other shilling, the cut one - I will not swear to the one found in the man's trousers pocket - the other is as much like the dark one as can be - I had had the marked shilling about eight days before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The shilling found in the man's trousers you have no mark on? A. No; but you might see one hundred, and none like it - it is dirt, which I tried to rub off, but could not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What is there remarkable in the dark shilling? A. I do not think this is the shilling.</p>
               <p>Donovan's Defence. A poor man in the hospital was going to have his leg taken off; the money was gathered for him - I was to take it him the day I was taken up.</p>

On the 28th of November I locked the house up about six o'clock - I locked my cellar door at six; my fowls and all were safe then - the cellar is under the house - I cannot go from the inside of the house into the cellar; I went to bed about eight, and between eleven and twelve o'clock I heard a noise in the cellar - I got up, went out of doors, and saw the three geese laying dead; they had been in the cellar - a man stood by the side of the verandah - I made a blow at him, and he ran away; I called for my gun, and the prisoner came out at the cellar door; I struck at him with a stick, and saw his face - he was dressed in a smock-frock; he had no hat on; he called for mercy: my wife checked my arm, and he went away; having no shoes on, I did not go after him - I struck him a heavy blow on the head; he was taken next day, and I went down to the office, but he had been liberated; I saw him near a month afterwards, and am positive he is the man - I saw a mark on his head then.</p>

On the 29th of November I met the prisoner coming down Jackass-lane, in a direction from the prosecutor's house, about one o'clock in the morning; his head was bleeding - he appeared to have recently had a severe blow on the head; he said he had been to Uxbridge, drinking with some friends, that he had fallen out of a cart, and lost his hat; his clothes were not dirty - he had no hat on; I took him into custody; he had his smock-frock wrapped about his head - he was about a mile and a half from Mr. Dowden's.</p>

I had been to Uxbridge to look for a job, at Fowler's barge: another man got the job - I fell in with two or three coalheavers, and got a little too much to drink: they put me into a cart, to take me home; I pitched off the cart on some gravel stones, which cut my head; I got up, and about ten minutes after I found three young chaps by me; they snatched my hat off: I put my smock-frock over my head, and walked towards home - I was tipsy - the Policemen stopped me; next morning the serjeant looked at my head, and said, "Well, it looks like a fall, there is a little gravel in it; I shall let you go."</p>

            . I am an officer; I was sent for about eleven o'clock in the morning - the prisoner gave me the key; these articles were found in her box - she had a great number of things belonging to tailors, such as tape, binding, and other things; she said they were part of a lot of property left to her by her father - she had two boxes; one box, contained her wearing-apparel, and this contained tailor's articles, and books - these were not the only articles of the tailors trade.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose Mr. Woolf pointed out what he considered his own? A. Yes; he did not think any of the others belonged to him; she did not object to give up her keys.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOLF. I know this woollen cloth by matching with a piece I have here, which it was cut off; it tallies with the notches where it has been cut; it was sent to me to make up, and measured about five yards; I had cut off about a yard and three quarters, leaving about three and three quarters - I call this three quarters, and about three yards remained which made up the quantity - these three pairs of clasps I know, by having others similar; here is a pair which exactly match - they are not uncommon; other tailors may have them as well as me - this binding I would not swear to it; I can swear to the two shawls, by having the very same sort of things; they are the centres of shawls, and here is where the border has been cut off; I have a complete shawl here, and this black one I had only got in a few days before; I looked over the cupboard on the night of the 28th, and the shawls were gone - I knew they had been there before; this half a yard of cantoon had been cut off this piece - it had no mark on it, but it is a complement for a pair of trousers; it was the same colour and quality, and I can safely say it is part of the same, on my conscience, from the quality and colour, and quality of the back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many thousand pieces of the same colour and quality have been in the County? A. Certainly, there are hundreds, and so there are of this colour of cloth, but not with this indenture: these are shawls with the borders cut off - it can be used as a shawl; the prisoner's keys were in her box - she afforded every facility to the search.</p>

            . I live in Bride-court, Bridge-street; it comes into Bride-lane. Pearson lives in my house now; I have known him for about twelve months - I do not know the prisoner. On Sunday, the 16th of December, about half-past five o'clock, Pearson called on me; he knocked at the door, and looked pretty nearly covered with blood, which came from his face and arm - I am sure blood came from a wound in his face; he was not intoxicated, but it appeared that he had been - I got him some water to wash himself; he had his arm in a handkerchief for a fortnight- the next day the prisoner came to me, and asked if the prosecutor was at my house; I told her he was not, but I expected him in every minute, and asked her how she came to use the man as she did, and cut him about; she said she wanted to murder him, and was very sorry she had not done so - the prosecutor had been living at my house once before, but not with her; she went away - she did not appear influenced by liquor.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; my husband lives with me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had compelled her to resort to prostitution for his support- that on the day in question he came home intoxicated; she endeavoured to leave the room, in order to avoid him, but he prevented her, and a scuffle ensued, during which she took up the knife and struck him with it, unconscious of what she was doing.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Aylesbury-place, Bream's-buildings-Chancery-lane. I have known the prisoner some time; I always thought she and the prosecutor were man and wife - she always conducted herself with that propriety that I always considered she was; the prosecutor called at my house on the Friday preceding the Sunday this happened; they had been separated for three weeks, and he said they had been together again for three weeks - he said he was going to send her down to her mother, who lives a little way out of town; and on the Sunday morning in question she called on me, and inquired if Pearson had been with me since last night- I said I had not seen him; she came to me on Monday, and said she had cut him; I understood they had quarrelled about his being out all night and all day on Sunday, and words ensued - I said to her, "Why not go out of the room?" she said she was going, and he laid hold of her by the throat, and he would not let her - I never saw her otherwise than mild and good tempered.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he not on the common pavement? A. He was close to the chapelgate; persons can go on that side, but there is no one goes there all night - the houses are on the other side, or mostly so.</p>

             (Police-serjeant S 3). On the night of the 15th of December I met the prisoner and this witness; he said he had stopped the prisoner coming from the chapel with some coals; I said, "Perhaps he has a right to these coals;" the prisoner said, "No, my friend, I have no business with them at all, they don't belong to me at all; I take such a bag home once a fortnight, instead of using them in the chapel, and I did not think that any of your men would take such a mean advantage of me as to take me into custody;" he said the Trustee was a good sort of a man, and he did not think he would appear against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Clark hear all this? A. No, I sent him to get a wheelbarrow to carry the coals; he did not say at that time that he had taken coals from his own house, to light the chapel fires, and he thought he had a right to a return for them, but he said so before the Magistrate, who told him he must go and make a Judge and Jury believe it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say? A. He said he had taken over a quantity of coals to the chapel, when they were out of coals, and when he went home that night, his wife said, "William I am out of coals, I wish you would fetch those you took to the chapel."</p>

            . I am a carman to Mr. Wood, a coal-merchant, in Camden-town. I delivered three tons of coals at Camden-town chapel, on the 20th of October, in thirty sacks; part were put on one side and part on the other.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Grove-terrace, Kentish-town. I remember seeing the prisoner in the early part of October come across the street from his own house to the chapel with some coals in a scuttle; his wife called, and asked him if he had the tinder-box - he put down the scuttle in the street, and went back for it; he then took the scuttle of coals into the chapel - I saw him about a week afterwards take some coals in a bag into the chapel on his shoulder; he said to me, "Good morning;" I said the same - it was a thin dirty bag, and appeared to have coals in it; I said to him, "You are loaded:" he said they were out of coals at the chapel, and he was taking some to light the fires.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you applied to, to give evidence on this subject? A. Last Thursday; I had not mentioned this circumstance - I was not before the Magistrate; I heard of the prisoner's being in custody: there was nothing to make me look at the coals.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. When was it you observed the coals in the scuttle? A. It was on a Thursday morning, in the early part of October, at twenty minutes past nine o'clock; as I passed the chapel I looked up, and saw the time - I could see the time every day if I looked up; it was a black scuttle - I cannot tell what day it was when I saw him again, but I had particular business on the first day, which makes me remember it; I never saw him carrying coals at any other times.</p>

            's mother came to me, and inquired if the prisoner was out of his time - this was in the April before his marriage; I told her he was not, that he was but nineteen, or in his twentieth year, and I would not consent to the marriage, as he was my apprentice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know for what purpose she made the application? A. She said he was going to be married to her daughter, who was twenty-eight years of age, and she was a cripple - she said she was a very good daughter to her, and she would not wish her to be married to any body, except a person who would be kind to her; I told her he was rather wild - I would not consent to it; and if she had any regard or love for her child, by no means to allow them to be married - I had had a few words with him before that, and told him if he could get work at another place, I would not hinder it, but he was at my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030074"/>house occasionally - my wife is forty-three years old; she is the eldest of ten, and the prisoner is the youngest - he called on me the morning he was married, and told me of it; I was angry, and would not speak to him.</p>

Yes, and rather ailing - I had nothing to do with her marriage; I understood the prisoner was about twenty at the time - I knew of the marriage two or three weeks before the banns were put up; it might be wrong, but I was younger than either of them, and it did not strike me.</p>

On the 29th of November Fudger lodged there - Wyer's wife is Fudger's sister - I saw Fudger and his sister one Thursday, the latter end of November, they went out together; and I saw Mrs. Wyer come back - the prisoner Wyer had at that time a bad leg, which had confined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030076"/>him to the house; but, after his wife returned I saw him go out with two or three bags or parcels in cloths.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Great Ormond-street. On the morning of the 29th of November, the prisoner Wyer came to me between nine and eleven o'clock - he brought with him a bag in one hand, which was full of something, and a can, which was three parts full - he stood at my door, and I came out of my parlour, and said to him, "Mr. Wyer, what do you do carrying things when you are on your club?" - he said,"That is the very thing that I called here for; let me leave these things, and I will call in the course of the day;" he left them, but did not call again - on that day week, a person called and said he was an attorney; and after he was gone, I opened the bag in the parlour, before my wife and her sister; the bag coutained ginger, nutmegs, soap, and a variety of articles, and the can was three parts full of oil - Mr. Gray's name and address was on the bag, stamped with a small stamp; the prisoner Wyer called the same evening, about a quarter-past nine o'clock - he said he had called for the things; I said,</p>
               <p>"I cannot give them up; I am going to take them to the owner" - he made answer, "You can take the can, but not the bag" - I said,"I shall take them all, just as I received them;" he left me, - I got a cab, and went to Mr. Gray's with them, accompained by a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you what was in the bag? A. No; I have no reason to think he knew; Mr. Gray's name was on a part of the bag, which was tied up, and was not seen till it was untied - I do not consider that he knew Mr. Gray's name was on it; he did not, when he said, "Do not take the bag," add to it, "As it may get Fudger into a scrape" - he said no more than I have told you; I have known Wyer two years - he is a hard-working and honest man; he is a farrier; I thought the bag contained horse-medicines, as they made such a smell.</p>

            . These things were brought to my shop by the witness. I sell some of these articles, but not the sugar, soap, nor oil - I know the bag is mine, and the lavender-water has my stamp on it; it has not been opened - two of these bottles are wrapped up in one of the shop-dusters, which I know, by its being burnt with our acids; the paper round this liquorice has my writing on it - and so has this paper round the ginger, and these cloves; this camphor soap is in an unfinished state - it is in a handkerchief like one I have seen Fudger use; and we have missed some soap - we do not keep pepper in bottles like this, but in large jars; I found a tin scoop bent up like a funnel, as if to put pepper into this bottle - I have one partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you missed any pepper? A. No; there may be thousands of bottles in the world like this - these papers have the names of plants on them; I once had a large collection of them; the plants are destroyed, but the paper being in good order, I put it up in quires, and this is some of it.</p>

               <p>MR. FAIRLAM. This spoon, pawned on the 8th of December, is the heavy spoon - the one I gave her she did not take out of the house; we had four silver spoons in use in the kitchen.</p>

            . I belong to the Hopewell bark. On the 29th of December I was going home at a late hour, and lost my road - I met Dooling, who asked me to go home with her; I asked if she would direct me to my lodging, and said I would satisfy her for her trouble; she took me down a street which I thought was not right, but she said it was - she got me into a house; I had not been there five minutes before I was going out, as I knew it was not my lodging, and she shoved her hand into my trousers pocket, and got the sovereign out; I was not drunk, but not quite sober - I should not have gone into the house but she told me it was the right house; I had nothing to do with her - I am sure I had a sovereign and a half when I went out; I had changed the half-sovereign, and had the sovereign in gold in one pocket, and some silver in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030080"/>other - as soon as I missed my sovereign I went to the door, and called Police! I did not notice Carr at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You went into a bed-room? A. Yes; I am sure I had no connexion with Dooling - I did not notice the room till I got into it; I did not put any coppers on the mantel-piece - I did not go to bed, nor was I on the bed; I said, "I am not going to stop here," and I was going down when she took the sovereign.</p>

            . I went to the house that night to get a lodging; when I had been there a minute or two, I heard a row up stairs - the prosecutor and Dooling came down; he said he had lost a sovereign - he went to the door and sung out Watch! in the mean time Dooling slung herself round, and slipped the sovereign into Carr's hand, who was sitting there - the officer came in; he went up stairs, and came down, but could not find any sovereign; I took hold of Carr's hand, and said, "I will show you where the sovereign is;" he found it in her hand - she had been down stairs in the room where I was; she had not been up stairs at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there nothing in Carr's hand but the sovereign? A. No; she said she would not give it to me, but to the officer.</p>

             (Police-constable K 94.) I was on duty at half-past twelve o'clock that night, in Ratcliff-highway - I heard a cry of Watch! I went to the door, and saw the prosecutor outside; he said, "I have lost a sovereign in this house;" he gave me this piece of paper, which has still the print of a sovereign on it - I went in, and said to Dooling, "Where is this sovereign?" she said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got it; he had no sovereign, and there is not one in the house" - I went up stairs, but could not find it; I came down, and Wilson said, "I will show you where it is;" he had hold of Carr's hand - I took the sovereign out; he said he saw the other give it to her; he asked her to give it him, but she would not - the prosecutor said the sovereign had been in this paper, it had been taken out, and the paper put into his pocket again.</p>

             (Police-constable K 285.) The two prisoners were brought to the watch-house - Dooling said she put her hand into the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket, and took 2 1/2d. and a sovereign out.</p>
               <p>Dooling's Defence. I met him very tipsy - he said,"Do take me home, I will pay you for your trouble;" he then stood a few minutes, and said he had been robbed of his watch - I said, "Look, perhaps you have got it in your pocket," and he found it there - he then gave me 2d. worth of rum; he then asked me to take him to Back-lane - I took him a little way; he was too drunk to go any further - he then said he would go home with me; I took him up stairs; he sat down on the bed, and discharged his stomach - he said, "I have no money to-night, I will pay you to-morrow;" I said, "The old woman must be paid, give me your watch;" he then put his hand into his pocket, and took 2 1/2d. and a sovereign out of his pocket - I took the sovereign down to the woman, thinking it was a shilling, and put the half pence on the mantel-piece - he then got up, said he was better, and would go; he took the halfpence off the mantel-piece, and then said he had lost a sovereign - he called this officer, who found the sovereign on Carr, but she did not know what was in her hand, nor did I.</p>

               <p>RICHARD BOOTE. I am in the East India Company's service. On the 20th of December I received my pension, which was 1l. 15s.; I fell in with the prisoner Reed in cliffe-highway, between one and two o'clock in the forenoon; I had seen her once before - I went home with her; we drank tea, and then came out to take a walk about seven; I was perfectly sober; I had not spent all my money - we walked down the highway; I saw Hart about ten, or half-past ten at night - we had been in different public-houses; we fell in with Hart at the door of the Half-moon and Seven Stars; I had not seen him before; we drank together, in the same house - I was perfectly sober, and had my money safe; I went out with the two prisoners; they took me up a court in the Highway, and there took my jacket and hat off, and left me; they took one sleeve of my jacket off first, then capsized the jacket over my head, and dragged it off; I was not perfectly sober - I was walking home very cold, and fell in with the Policeman, who saw me home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since you were at sea? A. I came home on the 9th of September, from the West Indies; I never was in this Court before, nor in any other - I had only been with this woman to drink tea, and it was there the jacket was found, as the officer said; I was walking quietly home when the officer spoke to me - I did not tell this woman I was going on board an Indiaman, and had no money, and left her my jacket - I did not give her any thing for her tea.</p>

I said No, it was quite out of my line - I had not above 5s. in my pocket, and could not have bought more than an ounce of plate - I had come from Reading: when I am in town I live at the Bear and Ragged Staff, Smithfield.</p>

            . I live with my father, William Watson, an army-agent, No. 60, Charlotte-street, Portland-place - he had lived there thirteen or fourteen years; there are no other Watsons, army-agents, living any where in London - a list of army-agents is published under the authority of the Secretary at War; I have examined that- I accept bills for my father; and sometimes my father does so - no other person was authorized to accept bills in 1830- this acceptance is not in the hand-writing of myself or my father, nor of any person in his employ; my father does not bank with Brown and Co, Abchurch-lane; I know nothing of Mr. Duff, the drawer, or Carew, the endorser.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you do business for the 17th Light Dragoons, or 2nd Life Guards? A. No; I do not know an officer named Duff - nobody of that name did business at our house; Mr. Brook presented the bill to us in 1830 - I do not think it was before it came due.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When he called, did you tell him it was a forgery? A. The last time he called I did - if genuine, we should have paid it.</p>

            . I have been a Sheriff's officer - I am out of any thing now: I have ceased to be a Sheriff's officer for two years. I sold bread for the prisoner at No. 166, Drury-lane till the end of October, or the beginning of November, 1830; I knew a man named Chesney - he lived up by Carnaby-market, and was selling bread for the prisoner in the same way as I was, between St. Giles' church and Tottenham-court-road; he died in the Marshalsea prison six months ago - I know this bill of exchange; I have seen it in the hands of Chesney - he brought it to me to discount it for him about the month of June, 1830, I think, but I cannot be sure; we were very intimate at the time - he was at my shop almost every day; he told me if I would get it discounted for him, that it was drawn by an officer in the army, accepted by an agent, and made payable at a banker's; I told him when he called on me a second time I could not do any thing with it - his answer was, that he could get Mr. Darby to do it, but he owned him 15l., and he was afraid Darby would stop the 15l. out of the bill; this bill is exactly in the same state as when shown to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you a Sheriff's officer, or a follower? A. I was an officer's man two years ago; before that I was an officer - I had some business of my own, and took it to what officer I liked: I have had a sufficiency to maintain me for the last twenty years - I have ceased to be an officer five years - I may go to Serjeant's Inn three or four times in a Term; I never hired sham bail; I have hired persons to put in bail above, when I was an officer - they had half a crown each.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this bill was in the same state when you saw it in Chesney's hands? A. Yes; I was examined before the Magistrate - I have not said that Carew's name was on it then; I was looking at the body of the bill - I do not know whether Carew's name was on it or not when I saw it in Chesney's hands; I might tell the Magistrate that that name was not there when I saw it - I do not know that it was not there; I swore at the officer that it was not, and it was not - I paid the prisoner so much out of every loaf; I sold on my own account - I kept the shop; I had a halfpenny out of every quartern loaf, and sold two hundred a day, perhaps; a man named Williams lived in the house; Chesney sold in the same way, as far as I knew - there was no name over either shop - Chesney was about a twelve months at the shop, and left about October, 1830; I sold for the prisoner till the beginning of November - I saw Chesney about three weeks before his death; he lived up by Carnaby-market, and he lived there when he was selling for the prisoner, and before the prisoner left off business - I should suppose the prisoner knew where to find him; I did not hear the bill was forget till the prisoner was apprehended - I have not seem Chesney with the prisoner since 1830; he could be found at any time before he died - I know he was in the Marshaleoa a long time before he died; I did not know Duff - Chesney told me he was in the army - I have not been arrested for the last ten years- I saw the prisoner in Wheeler-street once or twice in 1830; Chesney lived in Carnaby-market till he was taken to the Marchalsea, but he was out in the country, and he told me he had been hopping; I swear I sold bread on commission for the prisoner in October, 1830 - I do not think he left his shop in Regent's-park before the 29th of September - I think I sold bread for him after that.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure you sold bread for him in October? A. I am pretty sure I did; I remember his disposing of his business in Edward-street - his wife was out of her mind at that time, and went into the country to her friends; I saw the prisoner in the Corn-market early in 1831 - he used to call on me when he came to town; I had no reason to suppose he was keeping out of the way -I did not know

            . I am a cheesemonger and live in Portpool-lane, but did live at No. 31, St. Mary-street, Hampstead-road, when the prisoner became a lodger of mine, which was in the middle of October, 1830 - I had known him a very little time before; he brought in some furniture, and was there about six weeks; he took his family into the country, but always boarded with me when he came to town - his family were with him just when they came in; he was there in July following, once or twice a week (July 1831) - Mary-street is near Regent's-park.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are sure it was in October,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030087"/>1830? A. Yes, quite; about the middle I think, but am not positive - I cannot swear he did not come before the 30th of September; Mary-street is about seven minutes' walk from Regent's-park - he remained six weeks before he took his furniture away, and he came backwards and forwards till July - I do not think he was away four days together from October till July; after his furniture was gone he slept next door, and boarded with me - he carried on no business in town; he was backwards and forwards in the country on business - when he went into the country he did not come home for two or three days; he never told me he had received a forged bill from a man named Chesney - his family went into Suffolk; they were about six weeks in my house, but his wife was not with them, till the day he took her to the country - he has four children; I went to St. Pancras parish for a strait-waistcoat for his wife in October, 1830.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did he not come to you before the 30th of October? A. Not to my knowledge. I once saw his wife and she was almost delirious; that was about the middle of October - I do not know Carew; I knew the prisoner when he lived in Edward-street - he came to my house from there; his brother married my wife's sister - I never heard him talk of Chesney, nor of Duff; I do not believe he was ever away seven days together, for if he went away, he left word that if any body wanted him he should be in town in three days - I cannot swear he did not come to me before the 29th of September; he brought his goods to my house about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had you reason to believe he was avoiding or shunning any body? A. None in the least - I went round the neighbourhood with him to collect debts.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and builder; I live in Clarence-street, Regent's-park.

            . Q. Was not you out of town with your regiment, when you say you saw the prisoner after he left? A. No, my regiment left in July, 1830, and staid out of town twelve months - I was in the habit of seeing him after that; we removed from Regent's-park barracks in 1830, to Knightsbridge - I was at Windsor from 1831 to 1832.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was his name over the door? A. I do not think it was; I land flour at Boy's wharf - I am agent for Mr. Elder of Romford, Essex, who has a mill at Bromley; I do not know Aylet and Co., surveyors, of Newgate-street - I think I have heard of the name; I never knew the prisoner dealing for them - I was in the habit of supplying the army with bread; I knew the prisoner by his keeping a shop near the barracks - he kept what is called a second rate shop; I knew the 2nd Life Guards, and served them for ten years, at times - I did not know Duff; we did not know much about the officers; I knew one Playford - I cannot say I know Chesney or Carew- I think I have heard the name of Duff, but cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you driven a cab? A. About three months - he paid me 6s. one Saturday night for taking him to Stratford, over the second bridge; I waited for him at the end of the bridge - I once took him to Kennington, where he said he had a letter to deliver; he always had a letter with him, which he said he was to deliver - I at last suspected something; I told him I had rather not carry him any more, for I was afraid I should get into trouble - I have often driven him to his master's door; I asked him if his master was at home - the other boy used to come to the door when he jumped into the cab, and I, of course, thought all was right - he once changed a sovereign - I never gave him a bad half-crown.</p>

On the 4th of January the prisoner came to my shop and asked to look at a fancy ring - I took a tray from the window with rings in it, and put it on the counter; she asked to see some pearl rings - I put a case of them on the counter; she selected one at 15s.; I turned round to wrap it in a piece of paper, and, on turning again, she said, "I will leave you one shilling on this ring and call again;" she went out of the shop directly, and I immediately missed a ring off the counter - I rang the bell and my young man came down; I followed her down the street about ten doors, and charged her with taking the ring off the counter; she denied it - I said she must come back with me - I said I must search her; she said, "Don't do that;" she took her hand out of her pocket with her handkerchief in it, and laid the ring on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the meaning of leaving a shilling? A. She left 1s. and I was to keep the ring till she called for it - I did not say it would be better to give up the ring.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the corner of Redcross-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief!- I immediately crossed over to the corner of Golden-lane, and caught hold of the prisoner; there was a cry of Rescue! and at the corner of Beech-street he struck me a violent blow in the face, and afterwards a violent blow on the left side of the breast; he was secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a coat hanging at the door, and was going to buy it - I asked the prosecutor the price - he immediately collared me; I said, "Let me go;" he would not; as I went out, by accident, I broke two panes of glass.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor. On the 31st of December I was in the stables, early in the evening, and heard the fowls squeak - I took a light, and found the prisoner standing against the roost; I called to him several times - he did not answer me - at last he said he was reaching a turnip from the cart, and he went away - I went after him, saw something under his smock-frock, and found it was the fowl; I took hold of him and he dropped it from under his smock-frock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not intend to take it away.</p>

Brighton note - I know they had been safe a few minutes before the prisoner came up to me; I found a Policeman coming after me, and went with him to the station; I saw the prisoner and two others - I pointed out the prisoner, as the one who was most conspicuous in accosting me, and importuning me; I saw a 5l.

             (Police-constable H 91). I was on duty in Shoreditch, early in the morning of the 19th of December; I saw the prisoner in company with the prosecutor - she was the only female with him at that time; she then left him: I saw her tearing a bit of paper, and throwing it away - she put her hand to her mouth; I followed her, she then ran: I pursued - when I came up with her, she produced three sovereigns, and begged me to take them and keep them, and say nothing about the robbery; I took the three sovereigns to the station, and left her in custody - I then went down the street, to where I had seen her throw something away, and found these two pieces of a 5l. Brighton note; one piece is lost - I then took the prosecutor to the station; he recognized her as one of the parties who had been about him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the prosecutor very much in liquor - he was surrounded by two or three females; I saw the piece of paper at his feet: I took it up, and took the sovereigns out of it - I cannot read, and I threw the paper away; when the officer took me, I said I had three sovereigns, which I had just picked up.</p>

I said I was waiting for a person who had gone to get change, to pay for a pair of boots - she said she had seen the prisoner there, who had inquired for a person, whom she never saw in her life; I was to have had the money or the boots back, but not to leave them without the money - the person who came down, told me I had better run to the pawnbroker's shops: I went to my master, who sent me and my mistress out; I went to Mr. Harrison's, and found one pair pawned there.</p>

I applied to Carpenter on the 22nd of November, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030095"/>asked him to go with me to Westminster, and we went to the Feathers, where I searched him; he had no money - I gave him five good shillings; I told him to go and stand against the lamp-post opposite the Feathers, about six or seven yards off - I remained in the tap-room, and had a full view of him; when he had been there a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner come up with a pipe in his mouth - I saw them speak together, and then the prisoner pulled something out of his pocket; I saw it was money, but could not tell what coin - I saw it told out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was not in paper then? A. Yes, it was - I could not ascertain what it was; I saw Carpenter telling it out of one hand into the other - I had seen Carpenter give the prisoner something into his hand; I saw it was money - I had no authority from the officers of the Mint to employ Carpenter on this occasion; I had no intimation at all - I did not see any money in Carpenter's hand, except what he told into the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. Did you see any money told out by Carpenter except what he gave the prisoner? A. No, except the money he told out of the parcel; the prisoner then went away, and Carpenter came over towards me; I took him to a public-house, and found a score of shillings in his waistcoat pocket - these are them; they are in the same paper now - I took the prisoner on the Saturday following - I said "I want you for some bad coin which you have been making away with;" he said he knew nothing about it - he had nothing on him; I took him before the Magistrate, who detained him till I let the gentlemen of the Mint know of it; there was another person with the prisoner when I took him, on whom I found some utensils of the trade, but he has escaped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came the prisoner to come to the corner of the street to meet Carpenter - had you made any arrangement to procure his attendance? A. No, it was pure accident - I did not in the least expect he would come there; I took no steps to procure his attendance.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. Had you no knowledge of the prisoner's coming to the corner of the street? A. Yes, I understood he was coming there; I made a mistake when I told his Lordship it was pure accident - I had information where he was to come.</p>

               <p>JAMES JOSLEN. He said he got it from Mr. Watts', who keeps the wine-room at Sadler's-wells, and was going to take it to Hatfield-street, which is a very bad street - this is the seventh window which has been opened in the same street.</p>

            . I am the wife of a Policeman; I live at the station - I was called to search Wallis; I took off all but her stays - she told me not to take them off, as she had no money about her; I said if she would not let me take them off I would call one of the men - she then took them off, and 4s. in silver fell from them - I found 1s. 2 1/2d. in a pocket in her stays; she said she would give me 2s. if I would not say any thing about it.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the station, and at half-past eight o'clock the next morning I heard him making a noise in the cell - I went and opened the door - he seized me by the collar, got me down, and nearly killed me; the reserve man came to my assistance - the prisoner then got these two lanterns off the shelf, threw them at us, and broke them all to pieces; we struggled with him, I suppose twenty minutes, and were then obliged to throw open the doors, and call for assistance - and several people came to our aid; he was very violent indeed before we handcuffed him.</p>

On the 1st of January I was going down stairs from the shop - my attention was called to an iron-roller, which I had seen safe a few minutes before; it was then about half-past seven o'clock - I went out towards St. Giles's, and overtook the prisoner drawing the roller after him, two or three hundred yards from my masters'; I stopped him, and said I must have it - he said, "Stop a bit, and hear me speak;" I asked what he had to say - he then said a man ordered him to draw it to the top of Tottenham-court-road, and said he would give him 4d.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife, I went out with my husband; I returned before him - when I came back my door was open, and appeared to have been opened from the inside, and this table was gone; the chairs were set two by two, and the middle door, which had been nailed up, and which I had put paper round, was open.</p>

            . I called on Mrs. Simmonds on the evening of the 31st of October, and in consequence of what she said I called on the prisoner - I saw him in a little bit of a counting-house, in his house in Dean-street; I asked if he had made any seizure on Mrs. Simmonds; he said he had not received any instructions - I said there was a table lost; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not represent yourself as an attorney. A. Yes, because you have represent yourself as such many times; I told you I should get a warrant, as I had reason to believe you had it - I knew you was difficult to get at; you pointed up to your books, and asked, if I thought you were such a d-d fool as to do that - I wrote down my address and gave it you, and then I tore it up; the Magistrate said to the prosecutor "There is your table, you had better drop it" - I did not hear you offer the table to pay the rent and expenses - you did not tell me that if Mr. Simmonds had any thing to say, he should come and say it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure he denied knowing any thing about the table? Yes.</p>
               <p>The distress-warrant was here put in and read.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I admit being denied, but I had a reason for it - I was looking over some dirty goods, and was not in a dress fit to see gentlemen, but when the officer said he had a warrant, I said, "Let him come up, be he who he may;" and when he came up and asked for a table, I said, "If there is any table you want, take it."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KING. I know the warehouse in Bear-street; it belongs to the prisoner's father - it was the prisoner's before it was his - I have been in the habit of going there; I believe the signature to this inventory is his.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SEAL. I signed this paper - I signed it at the prisoner's request.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What are you? A. A licensed appraiser; I was sworn on this occasion by Wilson, the constable, at the warehouse, in Bear-street, where this table was brought out to me to examine and value - I believe it to be worth about 16s.</p>
               <p>MR. GEORGE COOK. I am a furniture-broker, and am a juror in waiting - this table is worth 1l. 1s.; to sell again, it would fetch at an auction 24s. or 25s.</p>

On the night of the 31st of December, on my way home, I met the prisoner Chapman - I went with her to a house, and then I saw Eliza Smith, who asked me to stand treat; I gave her 6d. to go for some gin: when I went in I took my watch out, and looked at it - it was then eleven o'clock; when Eliza Smith returned with the gin, I was sitting by the fire side, and Chapman opposite to me - Eliza Smith sat down by my side, and was very fondling of me, and felt about my person with her hand; presently after that: she asked for another treat of gin, and I complied with it - I gave her half a crown; she went out, and I observed that she was gone a long time; Chapman then went out, and they both came in together - I asked for my change, and they would not give it me; I got up, and said it was time to be going - I had hold of my watch-key, which had a small piece of twine to it, and it had been cut off from my watch; I said,"Out of this house I won't go, till I get my watch:" they poured out the most disgusting language upon me, but I was determined to stand it out - I said, "Whatever be the consequence, I will see through it;" they then cried out Police! when the officer came - I said I had lost my watch - he took them in charge; I had not been to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this your signature to these words - "When I went to bed my watch-fob was cut off?" A. Yes, but I never said so - I never went to bed at all; I think this was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Chapman. Q. Did I come near to your person? A. No; it was a double-cased hunting-watch, "No. 722, Kent, maker."</p>

            . I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and live in Chiswell-street. I was sent for to see this child, which was between a fortnight and a month old- it was dead; I saw it on the day the accident happened - I examined the body; the death appeared to me to be occasioned by the passage of air into the lungs being obstructed - the mother pressing the child, without intending any hurt, might occasion the death; I could see no mark of violence whatever - I saw nothing to induce me to believe the child had received any external injury to occasion its suffocatin; the passage of the air might be obstructed by very gentle pressure.</p>

            , M. D. I live in New Basinghall-street. I saw the body of the child on the 1st of January; it had been dead three or four days; there was no mark of external violence - I suppose its death to have been occasioned by respiration being stopped, by pressure of some kind; it might he stopped by unintentional pressure: if the mother was struggling with any body, it might be occasioned by pressure on the chest; I saw no marks whatever of violence - if it had been the pressure of a hard substance, such as wood, the child's body would have exhibited some marks.</p>

I am the father of the child - it was not christened On Thursday night, the 27th of December, the day after boxing-day, a little after one o'clock, my wife came after me - I had been at a public-house with some friends - I went there a little after nine; we left the Mail Coach public-house, Camomile-street, at twelve o'clock, and went to another, a quarter of a mile farther; we went to have a parting glass at Mr. Purcell's house - we had something to drink at another public-house before - the doors of the house were closed; I do not know how many yards his house was from the other; the second public-house was the Gully-hole - we knocked, but we could not get in; we drank at another, Tomkins', in Widegate-alley - I think that was about half a mile, or a quarter of a mile, from the one we had left; I was not drunk - the clock had struck nine, I think, when I went into the first house; I cannot swear it - we did not stay five minutes at that public-house; we had some more gin there - my wife, with the child, had been with me all the evening - she came to me at the Mail Coach, about five minutes after nine; the prisoner's house was shut - I did not attempt to force the door-way in - I knocked, and we were admitted; I asked the prisoner to draw us some liquor - he looked in our faces, and said he would not draw it; there were others drinking there - he took a young man who was with me by the collar, and shoved him out - he went to turn me out; I said, "Open the door, and I will walk out;" he shut the door after I was out - he shut my wife in; I called her out, and knocked to know if he was going to let her out; the door was opened to let her out, and closed upon her; I will swear that I was not making a rush at the door to endeavour to get it open - I was not drunk at all; I had not been at work that day - I was walking about, looking for work in the early part of the day; as soon as my wife got to the door it was jammed on her, and the child.</p>

On Wednesday, the 14th of November, at eight o'clock in the evening, I saw my money safe - it was kept in a drawer in my bed-room; I had 41l. there - there were twenty-eight sovereigns; four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030102"/>half-sovereigns; two 5l. Bank notes, and four 5s. pieces; the prisoners were both my apprentices - my drawer was locked; Anderson slept in my house - I had not seen him in the house myself after eight o'clock, as I went out at eight; the drawer was then locked, and the bed-room door was bolted - I left my wife at home; I was sent for in half an hour, and went to my bed-room; I found the drawer laying on the ground and the money gone - I think it must have been done by a picklock-key; I saw no marks of violence on the drawers - the key had been left in my bed-room door, and when I left the house, the back door leading into the yard was bolted; neither of the prisoners were in the house when I returned - I went to Tucker's father-in-law, who keeps the John of Jerusalem public-hosue, opposite Aylesbury-street, and there found both the prisoners in the back parlour, (Tucker generally left the house about four o'clock;) I have not seen a farthing of the money since - I stopped the notes at the Bank, but have not heard of them; the prisoners seemed to experience grief at my loss, and Anderson came home. The week before the robbery took place, Tucker had said at tea-time, that he was in want of shoes, and said he did not like to ask his mother for any money, because of the old man, meaning his father-in-law - I have since the robbery seen new shoes in his possession; he has bought one pair of boots and one pair of shoes, and has got his watch out of pawn since the robbery; I did not know that his watch was in pawn - he had been in cuscustody, but discharged for want of evidence; I took him again on Thursday, the 29th of November, and before that I had seen him in possession of new boots and shoes, and his watch; my wife has died since that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Tucker has been taken up twice? A. Yes, he was taken on the night of the robbery - Anderson was examined against him at the first examination by the Magistrate's order.</p>

            . I am a jeweller by trade, and live at No. 10, Peter-street, Cow-cross. I know both the prisoners; Anderson came to my place on Sunday, the 11th of November alone; he said he was very short of money, and he said, so help his God, he and Tucker intended to rob his master before the week was out - he said he had pick, or picks in his possession, sufficient to do it, he had been in the bed-room that day - he put the pick in the lock; he said it stuck in the lock - he said he had got it out, but he had scarce time to get it out, as his master came suddenly into the room; he said he had made an excuse to go into the room for some boots - I had seen Tucker at his mother's house on the 10th, the day before; Anderson was not present - he said they intended to do the robbery at supper-time, when the old man was gone out; Anderson said Tucker would go down into the kitchen first, and bother the old woman as much as he could - I understood him to mean his mistress, and to make as much noise as he could in coming down stairs, so as to enable him to go into the room without being heard, and while he was going down Anderson was to go into the room, and attempt the robbery - this was told me on the 11th; he said Tucker was to go up stairs and receive the property of him, and then Anderson was to go down stairs, and bother the old woman about some onions, which were in a net, and which he knew he should not get - that was all that passed; Anderson came to my place again on the 16th - I knew where Hayford lived; he told me the job was done, and said he had thrown the picks down the privy, for he was afraid to keep them in his possession - I never saw them with any picks, but believe one has been found in the privy since; I gave my evidence at Hatton-garden - I said I did not believe they intended any such thing, and it had slipped my memory - I said I should look in the newspapers, and if I saw an advertisement, I should give information; he said, if I would keep quiet, and not make any bother about it, he would try and get me a few pounds - I said I should do nothing of the kind, if I saw any thing I should certainly go - I saw him again on the 29th, and then saw he was altered in his dress and purse, and that strengthened my suspicions; and I that day went to Mr. Hayford's house, and asked him if he had met with any loss; I told him the conversation the prisoners had with me, and they were taken up - I have worked for masters as a jeweller, and likewise on my own account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate the conversation you had with Tucker? A. No, I omitted that: I told the Magistrate Tucker had said so help his God he would have the old man's money, but not the conversation we had at his mother's house; I forgot it - I am married; I have gone by the name of Johnson, as I got into trouble about a crown-piece, having been seen in company with a person who uttered it - I have gone by another name but forget what; I have gone by the name of Jackson, but only when I was in trouble - I have been in trouble two or three times about bad money; I went by the name of Simpson for the same reason - I did not know the money was bad - I was only in gaol for a day or two; I was discharged, as I was innocent - I do not think I have gone by any other names; I have been in two or three gaols, but only for a day or two - I was in Horsemonger-lane, the Compter, and Clerkenwell; I have had a dark-lantern in my possession, but never had a centre-bit or crow-bar - I lodged at Mrs. Penhall's - I had her back room second floor; I only had one room; I left a dark, lantern behind me there, but not a centre-bit or crowbar - I left there suddenly, but left some shirts and stockings behind, for my rent - I owed her 7s. 6d. I took her keys with me - I went to ask her to let me have my things, and said then I would write to the country for some money, and give her her keys; I left a chisel behind - it may be a ripping-chisel; I left no pick lock there - I do not know what a picklock is; that is the chisel I left there; I had it from my brother, to do a job with - this screw-driver is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this (producing a pick lock key)? A. I swear I never saw that till now - my father lived at the Bull-inn, at Norfolk; I was there about six weeks, on a visit; my mother lives five miles across a common, and I had the lantern to go there with.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was you in prison on these charges? A. Several days on each; I was never tried, but discharged from the office.</p>

I live in the same house as Norman lives in - I have lived there between four and five months; Norman has lived there the same period of time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030103"/>- I did not inhabit the same part of the house when I first went there, I lived in the front room, on the same floor as the back room I now live in; I know Anderson, and have seen him there a hundred times - he came there of an evening, to pass half an hour when he had time; he came to see us both as a companion and friend - he was more intimate with Norman than me; on Sunday, the 11th of November, 1832, I heard him say he was short of money, and that he should rob the old man, Mr. Hayford, before the week was out, with an oath; I do not exactly recollect what he said on Sunday - he came again on Monday, the 12th, about half-past six o'clock, and from that to seven; he came on Sunday from half-past six to nine - I heard him say, on Monday, that his master had a sum of money for wood, which he had boarded, and which, I believe, he said, he was going to pay for wood; he had then in his possession a sort of instrument, which, he called a pick, which, I believe, was made from an iron skewer - I saw it, and broke it, puting it into the spout of the tea-kettle; this was before this charge was made against him; he then said he would make haste home before his master, (he had been with his master to measure the wood), and he should try the pick in the lock; his master, I understood, was then gone to measure the wood - he said he was going with his master to assist in measuring; I heard nothing further that evening, but on Tuesday, the 13th, he called about the sametime, he said that he had tried the pick in the lock and it would open the drawer - he said then, with an oath, that he would have the money before the week was out; nothing further passed - I saw him again on the Friday following; he was in the room about ten minutes before Norman came in;(what he said on former occasions did not pass in Norman's hearing - I believe Norman was in the room on the Wednesday night, but not on the Monday or Tuesday - we all three stood together on Friday;) Norman must have heard it - he said the job was done; I suppose he meant the robbery - he said he was a sort of evidence taken up against Tucker, his fellow apprentice, and when taken by the Policeman (meaning Mr. Hayford's son), that he had a pick, or picks in his pocket, and that he asked leave of the Policeman to go to the privy, and had thrown them into the privy - I saw him again on the Wednesday after the Friday: he said then that he was going up to Hatton-garden on Tuesday, as a witness against Tucker - I did not see him again till about the middle of the week; it might be Thursday or Friday - he then said that the old man had done no good - it was all hushed up; he did not explain what he meant; he said Tucker had been discharged: he came again on the Sunday, and appeared very flush of money, and said he had been tossing with Tucker - I saw silver in his possession; he said he had won 8s. or 9s., and he said he had bought a new great-coat, which he had on; and he never had it before - he at first said that he had bought it of Tucker, and then that he had bought it in Field-lane for 14s. - he paid 1s. for a pack of cards, on Sunday morning; he bought them of a person up stairs in the house I lived in - he paid 18d. for an umbrella, and he changed 3s. or 4s. in the day - I saw him do all this; nobody was in the room but myself - he came again in the afternoon, and changed another shilling - when he came in he sent for a pint of ale, then for a quartern of gin, and then a quartern of rum, changing a shilling each time, and every time I saw him, he was always flush of money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now Mrs. Ward - ? A. My name is not Ward - I am not married; the prisoner had more money than he used to have - he had several shillings, and before he never used to have sixpence to spend - I have known Norman six or seven months, and have lived with him for the last three or four months, as his wife - I am not ashamed to admit it; many have done wrong -I never cohabited with any body else; I was in service before I lived with him - I was servant to Mr. Douglas, at Whitecross-street prison, and left there in June.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get acquainted with Norman? A. I first met him in Holborn; I drank with him there at a public-house - I was then living with my brother; I do not know what I drank; that is a very frivolous question; it was a little rum and shrub - I did not recollect before what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe Anderson when he said he meant to rob his master? A. I did not, from the character he gave his master - I believe him a very wicked youth, who would do any thing for money; I never knew where his master lived till he was taken - I never heard any thing of Tucker being concerned.</p>

I have worked for the prosecutor a number of years - I know both the prisoners; Tucker came to me on the 20th of December as I was at work, and asked me to go for him (he spoke to me in the shop) to fetch a watch out which was pawned for a sovereign - I went to 117, Ratcliff-highway, got it out of pawn, and delivered it to Tucker; it amounted to a sovereign and 1s. the interest; and he wore it afterwards - I told my master the next day that I had taken the watch out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not hung up where his master might see it? A. It was hung up stairs in the shop where it formerly had - there was no concealment about it; I think it had been in pawn from the 18th of October.</p>

            . I live in St. John-street, nearly opposite Mr. Hayford's. I sold a pair of shoes to Tucker, and a pair of half-boots, on the 27th of November - they were new, and came to 15s. together; he paid me in silver 8s. 6d., for one, and gave me a sovereign to change for the other, and to get the sovereign, he appeared to let his trousers down to get it out of the lining, as if it was secreted; he appeared to take it from the lining, but I did not look -I am sure he did not take it from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not do this before your face? A. Yes; he stood in front of the board.</p>

            . I am a constable; I apprehended Anderson on the 29th of November, in his master's kitchen - I told him I wanted him on suspicion of robbing his master; he said he had not robbed his master - he was going to take physic, but threw that in the fire, and said, "This is physic enough for me;" I took him before the Magistrates - I found 2s. 9d. on him; I neither threatened nor made him any promise - he said quite voluntarily as he went along, that he had no money at all that his master could swear to - he said there was nothing but the notes that he could swear to, and it would be a long time before he would see them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any body present at this conversation? A. No.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. What the witness says I told her is false.</p>
               <p>Tucker's Defence. What Norman and his good lady has said concerning me, is false, on my oath, and what this man says about the shoes - my mother finds me in clothes, and gave me money to provide them.</p>
               <p>- READ. I am Tucker's mother - my husband keeps a public-house in St. John-street. In November last I gave my son two sovereigns and a half to buy a great coat, but he bought shoes instead; he bore a good character - Hayford said at my house, within a week or two of his being charged with this, that he was a good lad.</p>

            . (Police-constable E 39). I saw the prisoners together at the prosecutor's door, about half-past five o'clock in the evening on the 13th of December; Conley went up the steps, and went into the shop three times - he went two steps towards the parlour, and came back, and every time he joined Follard, and spoke to him- I then saw Follard go into the shop; he put one foot in, put his right hand on the top of the show-glass, put it under his left arm, and came out with it; when he got about ten yards off, a third person came up with a wicker-basket - Follard gave the glass to that person, who ran away with it; I got ahead of the two prisoners - another Policeman came up, and we took them; I took Follard, and as we were going to the office, he said, "Don't you go to bot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030105"/>tle down too tight upon me - the plums are all right; they are gone."</p>
