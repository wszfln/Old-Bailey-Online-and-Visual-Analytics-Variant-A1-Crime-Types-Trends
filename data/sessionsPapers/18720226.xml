               <p>afternoon, I went, with other officers, to 4, Orchard Place, Battersea—I went into the first floor back room, and there found Alfred Taylor, Jane Copeland, Sarah Ann Taylor, and Emily Mattock—they were taken into custody—we searched the room, and found some plaster of Paris moulds, with a coin in them, so hot that you could not hold them, and all the neces<lb/>sary implements for making and colouring counterfeit coin—I produce them—here is a double mould for half-crowns; that was broken in the struggle between the woman Taylor and I—here is also a single mould for half-crowns, a galvanic battery, bottles containing acid, and everything necessary—on Alfred Taylor were found the two pattern good half-crowns from which the moulds were made—I have known the prisoners for some time—after the seizure I was not able to find him till 25th January, in the present year, when I found him in bed, at No. 8, Andover Road, Horn<lb/>sey Road, and took him on another charge, for employing a boy, who is awaiting his trial now, to utter counterfeit coin—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him that he would also have to answer the charge at Bat<lb/>tersea—he said he never lived at Battersea, nor had he been there for years—I told him I had got a search-warrant, and he was entitled to have it read if he liked—he said "Oh, never mind, Mr. Brannan"—I made a search, but found nothing.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, and reside at the Rifle Pavilion, Wormwood Scrubbs—in March, 1871, I had known the de<lb/>ceased for some time—I always thought him a healthy man—I should imagine he weighed something about 12 stone, or I fancy it might be a little more; he was a little stouter than me—on the renewal day, the 7th March, 1871, I went to the North Pole to fetch him, and about 9 o'clock he and I started to go to the renewal meeting—as far as I know he was perfectly sound in health and strength at that time—he walked and talked very well—we went to the meeting, and after it was over we were joined there by Mr. Dixon, and we went from the Vestry Hall, and took the train to Notting Hill Gate station—we got out there, and went down the Notting Hill Road, and went into the Coach and Horses public-house—Mr. Dixon and Mr. Hughes went into the private bar at the further end of the house; I went in also for a minute or two—I saw the defendant there; not at first; he came in afterwards with a Mr. Weston—there were other persons there, but I did not know them—I wanted something substantial to eat, and I had it in the private bar—while I was having it Mr. Hughes was pushed against the parti<lb/>tion where I stood; he stood opposite to Mr. Fuelling, and I should think it was Mr. Fuelling that pushed him—I did not see him actually pushed—some glass came down from the partition at the time, at the back of me; whether it was glass from the frame or not I don't know—I did not wait to see what happened to Mr. Hughes; I went out at once—previous to the push there had been some conversation about the weight of Mr. Dixon's chain, between Mr. Fuelling, and I believe Weston was talking about it—I saw Fuelling take a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of his pocket—there was so much talk that I could scarcely understand what it was for—the conversation was about the weight and value of the chain—after the push given to Mr. Hughes I went into another compartment of the house, and did not see anything more of Mr. Hughes—at the time we went into the Coach and Horses I think he was perfectly sober—we got there between 2 and 3 o'clock—I should say the push was given about twenty minutes after we got there, or it might be a little more.</p>

I live at 1, Swanscomb Place, Hammersmith—I have retired from business—I was a baker at one time—I had known Hughes seven or eight years—he appeared a strong and healthy man—this was the first time I ever knew of his quarrelling—I did not know of his giving boxing lessons—on 7th March I met him by accident, at the Vestry Hall, at Kensington—I accompanied him and Mr. Barth, by train, to the Notting Hill Gate station—he appeared to be quite sober at that time—I don't remember the time we left the Vestry Hall—I think we arrived at Notting Hill a little before 2 o'clock, or about 2—we had not been in any public-house between the time of leaving the Vestry Hall and getting to Notting Hill—when we got out there we went to the Coach and Horses, at Mr. Barth's suggestion—we had taken no refreshment before we got there; we were all quite sober—we all three went into the private bar—I believe the prisoner came in with Weston while we were there—there were three or four persons in the private bar when we went in, but they left—at the time the prisoner and Weston came in I was partaking of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cold gin-and-water—Hughes was drinking cold gin and water—I had on the watch chain that I have on now—it might be a quarter of an hour, or twenty or twenty-five minutes after they came in before the prisoner addres<lb/>sed any observation to me—he was known to me very well—Weston was a stranger to me—Fuelling took up my chain in a jocular sort of way, and said "That is a nice chain, Mr. Dixon; I would not mind giving you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it"—I believe I said "You very much depreciate the value of my chain, but I do not want to sell it"—I said that in a jocular way—I was not out of temper—I never took it as an insult—Mr. Hughes then said he considered it a d—d insult—Fuelling said "I don't know you; who are you?"—Mr. Hughes said "You don't know me, but (leaning towards Fuelling's face) you know Mr. Harris, do you not?" in that way (<hi rend="italic">describ<lb/>ing it</hi>)—I was talking to Weston at the time—I said I had no wish to sell the chain—Fuelling had got some notes in his hand, with some gold in the centre, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his finger—Hughes said to him "You need not be so flash with your money," and then Fuelling pushed Hughes back up against the partition, and up against Mr. Barth—as soon as Hughes recovered himself from the partition, he up with his fist and struck Fuell<lb/>ing in the mouth, and after that Weston struck Hughes in the right eye—the blow knocked him against the partition; but instead of his coming flat against it he came against the round part of it, which caused him to slide round on his back, and he came right on the ground—I said to Wes<lb/>ton "All this is quite uncalled for"—some man came from outside the house and picked Mr. Hughes up, and wiped his eye, and I am inclined to think that he sucked his eye, to draw the blood from it; but whether he did or not I don't know; he put his mouth to it—after he got himself a bit together, he came up to Weston and said "You have done this to me,</p>

               <p>young fellow," putting his finger to his eye—Weston said "Why did you strike a cripple, one that could not defend himself," at the same time point<lb/>ing to Fuelling—after that there were some words going on, and while they were going on Fuelling put his left hand against the stairs, one hand against the partition on the right side, and he struck Mr. Hughes like that with his foot, just above the calf of his leg—he leant on the staircase, and struck his foot out—he struck at him with the flat part of his foot; it seemed to strike with the bottom part of the foot, above his calf, on the right leg, just above here (<hi rend="italic">pointing</hi>), at the side of the leg, inside the leg, just above the calf—then there was a bit of a skirmish, asking what he meant, and a man came and said if anyone touched Mr. Hughes again he would hit them—after he was kicked Mr. Hughes put his hand down to his knee, and rubbed his knee—he did not say anything then—a Mr. Cook, who was in the other compartment, and who knew me and Hughes, said "Never mind, Hughes, come away," and he took us round to the other compartment—I have seen a high heel to the prisoner's boot; from what I could see of it it would be about three inches—when we got into the other compartment Hughes got up and rubbed his leg—I said "Has he hurt you much?" and he said "Yes, he has caught me on the <hi rend="italic">funny</hi>-bone"—I don't know how long we were in that compartment, but it was grow<lb/>ing dusk when I left—Hughes was sober at the time he received the blow, and when we left he was sober, as far as to walking, but he was excited—he complained again of his leg—I asked him if he would have a cab—he said no, he would walk home—I accompanied him as far as the Latimer Road—he limped, and stood every now and then—I left him at the farther end of the Latimer Road, from his house—I can't be positive of the time I left him, it was growing dusk—I left him there, and saw him limping along, and I went back home—he had no tumble in the road while I saw him; he had hold of my hand all the way—he had nothing to drink after he left the Coach and Horses with me—he made no complaint about his knee after Weston had knocked him down—Fuelling, myself, and Wes<lb/>ton, were in the private bar, and after the occurrence a person came in; I don't know his name, but I see him opposite me now—the landlady was behind the bar, and I think a barmaid—the potman was outside doing something to the lamps, I think; at least, I saw a young man cleaning the lamps, whether he was the potman or not I don't know—I think it would be difficult for anyone but me and Weston to see what was going on, be<lb/>cause the compartment was so small.</p>

               <p>Weston did not push him up; Fuelling recovered himself, and directly Hughes struck him, Weston struck Hughes—Fuelling's lip was cut open, and bled—the remark about the cripple was not before Weston struck him; it was after—Hughes was a man of 12 or 13 stone weight, a short thick-set man, his height was about 5 feet 5 inches; he twisted round, and fell right full-length on his back, and his hat fell off—I can undertake to say that the push went against his leg; I saw that—I have never said it went against his stomach—it was with his deformed foot that the prisoner struck him—Hughes was pointing to Weston, and saying "You have done this for me, young fellow;" and while he was making use of those words, Fuelling leant one hand against the banisters and struck him—Hughes was standing with his back against the partition and his face to Weston—I did not at first say, before the Magistrate, "He <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of pushed the deceased with his foot in the stomach"—I was examined twice at the Police Court; that was read to me, and I had to contradict it, and said I never said such a thing—I swear I never said anything about the stomach, it must have been a misunder<lb/>standing—I said, before the Coroner, that he struck him on the leg; I believe my words were "He struck his foot out, and caught Mr. Hughes on the leg"—the disturbance lasted a very short time—we left Fuelling standing at the bar when Mr. Cook fetched us away—we remained in the other com<lb/>partment for sometime—I don't know how long—I was not drinking all the time—Hughes had some gin-and-water, I had some bread and meat—he was very excited, but not tipsy, when we came away; it was the result, of temper, being struck and kicked—he had been drinking; he was not tipsy, he was sober—I don't call a man exactly sober when he has been having a glass of something to drink; he was what I would consider about half and half—I walked with him as far as the Latimer Road, which leads to his home.</p>

I live at 6, Franklin Terrace, Latimer Road—I am a professional nurse—I was for eight years regularly employed at St. Mary's Hospital, where Mr. Gascoigne is consulting surgeon—I have had con<lb/>siderable experience in nursing patients suffering from different complaints—I was called in to take charge of Mr. Hughes, on 9th March, about 8 o'clock in the morning, and remained in constant charge of him till 30th January, when he died—Mrs. Hughes paid me for my services—when I went, on 9th March, I found Mr. Hughes in bed suffering from severe pain of the right knee—there was a bruise, it was black, about 1 1/2 inch long, and about 3 inches wide, there was inflammation extending from the bruise up the leg, towards the thigh, and about 3 inches down the leg—I immediately applied six leeches, to keep down the inflammation—Mr. Roberts' assistant I believe came twice, but I did not see him—he was principally under my care for some little time—Dr. Godfrey was the first doctor that I called in—that was about a week after my attendance—he attended him about three months'—Dr. Gascoigne was called in on several occasions for consultation during the time of Dr. Godfrey's attendance—with the exception of the knee, Mr. Hughes was perfectly well in health—he never complained of anything but the knee—he performed all the natural functions without any difficulty—he could not get in and out of bed, he lay on his back; he could not sit up because of the severe pain it gave him in the knee, he laid on his left side more than the other—his leg was getting worse—there was a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a swelling from the foot to the thigh; it was swollen considerably all the way up, about one-third up the whole limb was swollen; that was sympathetic from the bruise—it would not result from a twisting of the muscles; it could not result from slipping down on his knees; it would not result from concussion; it must have been a direct blow of some hard substance—supposing he was twisted round the corner of a partition, and in tumbling the sharp angle of the partition came in contact with the under part of the knee, that would produce what I saw if it came exactly on that spot, that would be a direct blow—I don't recal the black eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M. R. C. S., and one of the surgeons of St. Mary's Hospital; I also practice at 48, Queen Ann Street, Cavendish Square—I have been 20 years in the profession—I was called in to see the deceased on 18th May, 1871, by the friends, to meet Dr. Godfrey in consultation—I found the right leg very much swollen from the foot to the centre of the thigh—I was told that he had met with an injury, and I had no reason to doubt it—the injury was quite consistent with a kick having been given him in the leg—there was no appearance of scrofula about him; he appeared to be a very healthy man—I heard the nurse's evidence—if the man had been struck there, I have no doubt there would be a bruise at the date the nurse spoke of—the swelling I saw from the foot up to the thigh is consistent with that—after the injury, inflammation set in, which travelled along the leg, both upwards and downwards, and went on to the formation of pus and abscesses—the first time I saw him there was a considerable collection of pus in the leg—I made several incisions, and evacuated half a pint of matter; that showed that the injury must have taken place some little time, or he could not have been in such a condition—if everything had gone on most favourably, it was certain to go on for some time, the man must have been kept in bed a considerable time to recover</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260017"/>
               <p>from the amount of inflammatory mischief—I made a close and accurate examination of the knee and knee-cap, and all the locality; there was no external bruise at that time—I saw him again on 4th July, he was then in a much worse condition—I saw him again on 22nd August, he was a little better then; that is, his general health was a little better; the limb was not—I saw him again on 2nd September; his health had much improved, but the limb had not—I saw him on 7th October; his health was better, but the limb not any better—his general health was extremely good after my second visit—after 7th October I did not see him again till 9th January, when I was called in; I then found that acute in<lb/>flammation of the knee joint had set in, and that amputation was the only chance of life—I communicated that fact to him—on my previous visits, the inflammation had not reached the joint itself—the appearances I saw on my first visit were not consistent with the disease having originated from natural causes—I performed the operation on 14th January—the leg was taken off about the lower third of the thigh—I afterwards carefully examined the limb that I had taken off—I found the knee joint in a state of extreme inflammation; the cartilages and internal structures of the joint were dis<lb/>organised and softened; the cavity had given way, and allowed the exit of tissues round, so that the matter was burrowing up the thigh—all the appear<lb/>ances I found were consistent with the injury having been given in the way described in March, 1871—there had been no interim, if I may say so; the symptoms were all consecutive; he had never recovered from the original injury—I confidently expected him to get better after the amputation—he rallied extremely well from the operation—I saw him that same evening, and several times afterwards, and he was making steady progress—the stump had almost healed, and, I believe, would have healed, if the ligatures had come away; I mean the strings placed on the artery to restrain the bleed<lb/>ing—they will not separate after a given period, but if they had separated, I believe the wound would have completely closed in a fortnight after the amputation—the operation was performed under chloroform—on 27th January, hearing that the bleeding had recommenced, I went to see him—I found that he had lost a quantity of blood, and was somewhat faint—on the 29th, a second attack of bleeding took place, and I opened the stump, and secured the bleeding vessel; he then turned over, and went to sleep—he died within two or three hours of the time I left him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was on the morning of the 30th—I did not make any second operation, I merely opened the stump with my finger; I did not cut it—I did not see that the bed was full of blood on the 27th—they told me that he had lost a good deal of blood, but they had taken it away before I came—I consulted with the other medical man in attendance as to what was best to be done, and we thought it was better to give him a chance of recovering from the temporary hemcerrhage—we plugged the stump with wool, and placed bandages on it, so that there was no chance whatever of the return of bleeding till we should see him again—I saw him the next day, the 28th—we did not attempt to secure the artery till the 29th, except by the plugging—hemcerrhage was the immediate cause of death—the hemcerrhage occurred from the same vessel where the operation was performed—the artery was tied up at the original operation—I must have tied it Originally—one or more of the ligatures had separated—I believe it was tied securely—the ligatures ought to separate—at the time of an operation the bleeding vessels are secured with ligatures, and in the course</p>

               <p>of time natural process separates them—they must come away before the wound can entirely heal—about a week before the man's death one of those ligatures separated, apparently at the proper period, six or seven days after the operation—from that ligature bleeding set in, whether from that vessel the ligature had come I could only form an opinion, but I believe it was from that—if that artery had been properly tied up I should not have expected the hemcerrhage to occur so long afterwards, unless there was some reason for it—I think the reason was some deep-seated ulceration in the stump—it is not possible for an artery of that size to escape observation in tying up—it might do so, but then it would bleed early, in a day or two—Mr. Roberts was with me at the time of the operation—there was no <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body; simply of the limb after its removal—the damaged cartilage which I found on cutting open the knee would be the result of inflammation—in my opinion that was the extension of the inflamma<lb/>tion which followed the original injury—I could only form an opinion of what the original injury was from what I heard—I was told it was a blow on the leg—the cellular tissue immediately below the integuments first took on inflammation—that would be caused by an injury—I don't think it was the knee joint that was originally injured—it was the cellular tissue, below the integuments of the leg—that part suffered immediately on the receipt of the injury—acute inflammation was established in that, and it spread down the leg and up the leg—that is a very important part of the limb, a part that is peculiarly liable to take on inflammation—the particular part that was injured was the upper and inner part of the shin bone, immediately below the knee—that is a very delicate part—I was told that was the part that was injured, and I have no reason to doubt it—there was nothing to be seen there when I saw him, except general swellings-supposing that to be the part injured, the cellular tissue would carry on the inflammation into the knee—that would not always be the case—it would very often depend on the state of the part—possibly a very stout man might be more subject to the inflammation than another, but not necessarily so—if he had been a drinking man it would be more likely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As far as I was able to judge, there was no trace of any previous disease—all the appearances I saw in May and in January were consistent with an injury done to the knee in the spot I have described, without any subsequent injury—the inflammation of the cellular tissue extended quite up to the body—I could not trace the particular spot where the injury had been inflicted, because of the inflammation; it was so general—the term "<hi rend="italic">funny</hi>-bone" is merely a popular expression to indicate a nerv<lb/>ous sensation to a particular bone—it is simply a shock to the nerve, appli<lb/>cable to any part, but more usually applied to the elbow.</p>

On Thursday morning, 15th February, I was with Downes, in Threadneedle Street, and saw the prisoners—I knew them, and we watched them—they went into the crowd, and Morris and McCarthy pushed against the crowd at the Stereoscopic Com<lb/>pany's window—Larney was pushing about in a very mysterious manner, and then they followed a lady who was carrying a reticule—I saw Morris with his right hand under his left arm, and as soon as he went from her side, I saw her reticule hanging open, and I spoke to her—we followed them from about 11.18 till 1 o'clock, and saw Morris make several attempts to pick ladies' pockets, and to open several reticules—McCarthy was always behind Morris, at the back of the ladies, and Larney was either in front of them, so as to impede their progress, or standing on the kerb-stone—we followed them to Princes Street—two ladies were waiting by the Bank of England for an omnibus—Morris and McCarthy pushed themselves in front of the ladies, and Larney stood on the kerb-stone, watching for the police—we were in plain clothes—Morris put his hand behind him, and one of the ladies observed him and moved away—I then saw that the lady's reticule was open—she fastened it up again—an omnibus came up, and stopped; and as soon as the ladies moved towards it, the three prisoners pushed them selves in front of them—Morris put his right hand under his left arm, and as soon as they got past the ladies, they all ran separately into Threadneedle Street—we pursued them through several streets into Lombard Street, where I saw Morris apparently looking at something in his hand—I saw him give something to Larney—he then put something into his left-hand trowsers pocket—they ran into Gracechurch Street, where we got assistance, took the three into custody, and searched them on the spot—I found in Morris's left-hand trowsers pocket 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, also this purse—we took them to the Station—I had seen them all three together more than once before—the lady's name is Scott.</p>

I live in Parker Street, Drury Lane—on 16th January she (prisoner) and her husband and I were drinking in their room—I could perfectly understand what was going on—the prisoner and my wife quar<lb/>relled, and I endeavoured to part them—I turned round and blackguarded them for fighting, and I blackguarded her husband for advising them to fight, because there was a difference in their weight—I and the prisoner's husband came to blows then—I fought him into the passage, and when I was making a blow at him I felt the prisoner come behind me, and catch hold of my hair with one hand—I felt something on my arm—it did not feel as if it was a stab—she at the same time said "Give it to him, <hi rend="italic">Scotty;</hi>" and when I went to make a blow, my arm fell—I got <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi> by the throat, and got him forwards to the door, and then I fell down—I got up, about three parts, and one of them knocked me down, and the other kicked me; the woman followed me out afterwards—I was taken to the hospital, and my arm was dressed there—I can't swear that I was stabbed with a knife—there was a little pruning knife on the table—there were no nails and no window within twelve feet of the place—I did not see any knife in her hand.</p>

I am an oilman, and live at 39, Princes Street, Portland Market, Marylebone—on Tuesday evening, 30th Januarys I went into a public-house—I don't know the sign, being a stranger there—Mr. Shirley was with me—seven men came into the public-house—the prisoners are five, of those men—the one that tried to trip me up is not there-wit was between 4 and 5 o'clock when we went into the house, and we stayed there about a couple of hours, having glasses of ale and smoking—I had been down to the Fireaway Read about some property—Rock came in first, and said he was starving, and Shirley gave him some bread and cheese, and asked me to pay for it—I pulled out some gold and silver—I had 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I went from home—I handed Mr. Shirley a shilling to pay for the bread and cheese—I afterwards treated all the seven men to bread and cheese and ale—we left the public-about 6 o'clock, or a little after, and went to the next one, and the men followed us—all seven of them came in—we stayed there about three-quarter of an hour—they had some ale, and I paid for it we came out of the second public-house about 7 o'clock—we got a good distance down the Portobello Road, and Sullivan, Cockran, and Rook <hi rend="italic">pinned</hi> me, and Brittain took nay money out of my pocket—Whalin was with them, but I can't say that he had hold of me—one or two of them had hold of Mr. Shirley—I can't swear who they were, because he was a little distance from me—I caught hold of one of the men, but he is not here to-day—they tried to trip me up, but I did not go down—they all ran away after that—I am posi<lb/>tive that the prisoners are five of the men—I identified them at different times, from among a number of others identified Sullivan first, then Whalin, and then Cockran, Rook, and Brittain—I had not the slightest doubt about them—they are five of the seven, and were there from the time of going to the first public-house till they ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The public-house was where I first saw the seven men—they came in one after the other—they all had bread and cheese and ale—they were all strangers to me—I often have a large sum like that my Pocket; sometimes more and sometimes less—I don't generally take it out and show it in public-houses, and I am sorry I did then—I had three glasses at the two public-houses—two at the first and one at the second, and my friend had the same—we had a smoke—we were in the second public-house about three-quarters of an hour—I only had one glass of ale there; I don't swallow mine down like some of them—we had not been into any public-houses before that—I had my dinner before I started—I have never given a different description of Brittain—I did not describe him as a dark young man with a dark moustache—I said that the man who tried to trip me up had a dark moustache—Brittain is the one who took my money—they fol<lb/>lowed me behind and pinned my arms—four of them held me, three of the prisoners and one other—it took a very short time, not much over a minute, I should think—it was between 7 and eight o'clock—I gave a description of the dark one, but I could not swear to the other—we had got about 100</p>

               <p>yards from the second public-house before it happened—they walked behind us all the time—I saw they were the same men—I did not know they were going to rob me—they were talking all the time amongst themselves—we were coming home as far as we knew—we were strangers there—we could not find a police-station for some considerable time afterwards—I went to look at a house—I was going to buy it—we went there first and then went into the public-houses—the landlords of the public-houses are not here, and they were not called before the Magistrate—it is not true that I was sick—I did jump in the public-house, and Brittain jumped in the bar—it was a standing jump along the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44A, Princes Street, and I live on a little property of my own—I was with the last witness on Tuesday, 30th January, and went into a public-house with him—Rock came in and said he was starring, and I gave him two pennyworth of bread and cheese, and a pint of beer—the other men came in, and my friend said they all seemed to be hungry and wanting; and we gave them all some—we left that public-house and went to another—I don't know the sign of it—the same men came in there—the prisoners are five of them—we treated them to some ale there—I afterwards left that public-house with my friend—not knowing the road I said to one of the men "Will one of you fetch me a cab, and I will give you a shilling?"—they wanted the shilling beforehand—I said "No; when you have fetched the cab I will give you the shilling"—we went out to try and get a cab—I heard some persons following—I turned, and saw they were the same men—I was pinned from behind—when I came to my senses again I looked across the road, and I saw these young men there round my friend—they had hold of him—they were the same men who had been in the two public-houses—my friend was in the road, and I was on the footpath, a little ahead of him—I am sure the prisoners are the men I saw there—I identified them afterwards—I have had to go and pick them out—I have no doubt about them, but I thought there was another one, but when I got closer to him I found he was not one of them—I have not the least doubt as to these five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were fifteen or sixteen round the room when I picked them out—there were either six or seven we treated in the public-house—I could not swear whether we treated six, or seven, or eight—that observation applies to both public-houses—I don't know how long we were in the first—it might have been two hours, or two hours and a half—I did not jump—I am no jumper—my friend jumped to see how far he could jump along the floor—some of the young men were jumping for amusement, and he did it too—I can't say how many men pinned me—my arms were pinned behind, and very nearly wrung out of the sockets—I expect it was more than one—it was so sudden, I really did not know where I was for a minute—the whole of the prisoners were round my friend—there were about seven of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sullivan.</hi> They were in the public-house between 1 and 2 o'clock, and</p>

               <p>his friend was sitting on a barrel. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was sitting on a barrel, and I Was standing by his side, leaning on the counter—I did not hear him say "I will jump the lot of you"—he did jump, and slid down—he was not drunk—we only had a smoke and a glass or two of ale—I did go outside with him, but I did not say afterwards that he had spewed like a fountain—he merely spit, he did not actually vomit; but he spit out a mouthful of porter—he did not come inside and say he had been drinking all the even<lb/>ing, and was not fit to jump—I was not drunk—you wanted to take, the change out of the beer, and I would not allow you.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, South Road, Westbourne Park, and am a porter—on Tuesday 30th January, I was outside the Britannia public-house, about 4 30 or 4.45—I saw Mr. Mayho and his friend come out and go away from the public-house—I saw Sullivan come out soon afterwards—he spoke to the others who were round, and he said "One of those men promised me a <hi rend="italic">bob</hi>, I mean to have it by fair or foul means;" he said he saw about ten quid in his hand, and he might have the <hi rend="italic">poke</hi> before the night was out"—Sullivan, nick named "Tommy Dodd," said that—Mr. Mayho and his friend returned and asked if he could get a '<hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and Sullivan said "I thought you wanted a cab," and he said a cab would do—they then went into a public-house at the corner of the bridge, and seven other men came up and asked me where they had gone—I said "Round that way some—where," and I nodded my head—five of those men are here, that is includ<lb/>ing Sullivan—they went into the Warwick, and I followed soon after, and saw them, all in the private bar—I stood opposite and watched; I intended to watch right through, but I had occasion about 7 o'clock to leave and go and look to a fire which I was keeping up for my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, and when I returned about 7.15 I saw Sullivan making his way towards the Prince Arthur, and the others were gone—I thought no more about it and went round the house—when I came back, in about ten minutes, I saw a mob outside the Prince Arthur—Sullivan was in the public-house at that time—I went down towards Netting Hill, and found Mr. Mayho and his friend down a turning—they had had some drink, but I don't think they were drunk—I think they were in a condition to know what they were about—I went with them to the police-station, and they made a statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw one of them sick—there was no doubt they had had some drink—there was a large mob when I came back to the Prince Arthur—there might have been 80 or 100 round there.</p>

I am in the employ of George and Henry Scovell, as foreman, at Cotton's Wharf—on Tuesday, January 16th, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to me in the ordinary course of business—when a warrant has been left for the delivery of tea, it is initialled by Mr. Morris—I saw the initials of "J. M." on that warrant, in the proper column—it is also the custom to put on the warrant the character of the conveyance into which the packages are to be put, and upon the warrant appears "Smith's truck"—having received that warrant, I looked out the chests of tea, and found that they corresponded, and I returned the warrant to the office—in the course of the afternoon I called out for Smith's truck, and the prisoner answered—I saw the nine packages put on the truck—I had seen the prisoner at my master's premises fre<lb/>quently before, and I have not the slightest doubt that he is the person who was there with the truck—it was between 1.30 and 2.30 he took the pack<lb/>ages away—he was quite cognisant of the course of business at the premises—I rely on the initial "J. M." and that document to look out the goods—I believed that to be a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> signature, "Armstrong &amp; Co., B. Taylor," and I looked out the goods and delivered them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, Royston Street, and am a gardener—on Thursday, February 1st, between 9 and 10 in the morning, I was pre<lb/>sent at an altercation between the prisoner and her mother, about the removal of the prisoner's furniture from Park House, Approach Road, Vic<lb/>toria Park—the prisoner was very Violent, and held up a decanter to attempt to strike her mother several times; that was in the drawing-room—I went down stairs and came up again, and the deceased said, in the prisoner's presence, "She has beat me, she has struck me"—the prisoner took no notice—the quarrel had commenced in the bedroom, and they came down and continued it in the drawing-room, where the attempts strike her were—I don't remember where the words were used—I did not pay that correct attention—I think it was down stairs, in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been in Mrs. Aria's service over three years—I remember the prisoner's marriage with her present husband—after that marriage Mrs. Aria became very angry and excited against her, she used to fly into constant fits of passion about it—I remember the prosecution which Mrs. Aria instituted against Portbury's mother, and I remember perfectly well that it was at the prisoner's suggestion—Mrs. Aria was very excited about that prosecution—there was then a prosecution against Portbury him<lb/>self, which the old lady interfered in—for a month or six weeks before this affair she was more than usually excited, and she bad very great ground for it, in as much as the prisoner was her perpetual annoyance; she did all she could to vex and annoy her, instead of removing quietly—on the Wednesday night the old lady was quarrelling with the prisoner, and was in a very violent temper—I interfered—she was not calling her very particularly dreadful names, I believe she called her nasty names now and then; they were not particular on either side as regards that—I don't know that Mrs. Portbury did not go to bed all night—I know that she wished to let in her husband at 10 o'clock—I slept on the sofa—I don't remember her coming down in the morning and saying "For God's sake let me out, she is quiet now,"—it is quite likely—both the street doors were fastened—I was the most likely person to unfasten them, but I don't remember doing it—she went out—when she came back she wanted me to help her, and I refused—Mrs. Aria said "You shan't help her; I pay you, so you are my servant"—the prisoner did not claim the protection of the police—a police<lb/>man was there—I sent for him, and he advised her to go—that was about half-past 10 o'clock on the Thursday morning—the prisoner had then been there some time claiming her furniture—she did not claim the assistance of the policeman in moving it—it was the deceased that claimed his assistance—the police were very insulting—the deceased said "She is mad, take her away," and the policeman said "I think you are all mad," and went away—he knew the law better than I did, and would not interfere—I don't remember him saying "You may summons her to the Magistrate, and she will have to pay treble the value"—something of the sort was said—I</p>

               <p>might have said to Mrs. Aria "Why don't you give Mrs. Portbury her things, what is the good of all this row?"—I did say so—nothing was said about a Magistrate, if so I should recollect it—what Mrs. Aria said about having been beaten, was about half-past 10 o'clock, in the kitchen—I can't remem<lb/>ber whether it was before or after the police came—I know very well that my evidence won't be taken unless there are marks of blows—I don't think anyone else was present but the prisoner's son, and other wit<lb/>nesses will prove that his evidence is not fit to be taken; he contradicted the first evidence he gave—it was a common thing for the deceased to com<lb/>plain of having been beaten by her daughter in various ways, up to the time of her death; sometimes it was a decanter, sometimes it was a poker—I won't swear that anybody was present but myself when the words were used—the prisoner was not in the kitchen at the time, she was between the kitchen and the passage, moving her things, I don't think she did hear it; perhaps she did not want to hear it—I noticed in the course of the day that the old lady was very unsteady on her legs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I noticed that as soon as she got up—that was after the prisoner had left—the prisoner married Portbury about four or five months ago—the prosecution against his mother was shortly after the marriage—the prosecution against Portbury was commenced about three months back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Jury.</hi> The prisoner attempted to strike her mother with the decanter several times—she held it near her forehead, in that way, in the right way to do an injury—I prevented it—that was in the drawing-room on the Thursday morning—the deceased was standing up in the kitchen when she said she had been beaten—she did not appear to be in pain or suffering when she said it—if she had had blows it did not injure her—she did not appear to be Buffering from any recent blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Ann Street—on the 1st of February, about 9 o'clock, I was in the kitchen of Park House during a quarrel between Mrs. Aria and the prisoner, about the removal of furniture—I was servant to Mrs. Portbury—I have been thirteen years in the family—I was with her in her first husband's time—during the quarrel I saw the prisoner hold a decanter up to her mother's face, but it never touched her—she held it by the neck, and she spit in her face—I saw no blow struck on either side—I was there when Mrs. Portbury left, about 12 o'clock—that was the first time I knew of her leaving the house that day—I was about the house all the day—Mrs. Aria went about the house well enough all the day—about 9 o'clock at night I went into her bedroom, and found her lying all in a heap, behind the door, in the corner at the foot of the bed—she had been vomitting—I spoke to her, but she did not seem to move—I called Bryant and he and I together lifted her on to the bed—about 10 o'clock she went down stairs with my assistance, and went into the kitchen—there are three flights of stairs from the bedroom and the kitchen—she remained in the kitchen about half an hour, and Bryant and I then assisted her upstairs again—I did not sleep in the house, Bryant did, in the kitchen—I went home and returned next morning about 9 o'clock—she was then lying on the bed, with her clothes on—Bryant and I led her down, she was drawn all on one side, she could not walk straight—she was straight enough the day before—on Saturday, 3rd, Mr. Brotheron was sent for, and on the Sunday, Mrs. Bray the nurse came.</p>

               <p>from her in consequence of her violent temper—the Wednesday was the day that Mr. Portbury was to have been tried here—I came to the Court that day—Mrs. Aria, was very angry with me for shaking bands with him—she worked herself into a violent rage and said "That old b—(meaning me) shook hands with that stable-boy"—I said "He has never done me any harm, and I don't see why I should not shake hands with him;" she con<lb/>tinued in a very excited state all that Wednesday—we got home from the Court about 2 o'clock, or between 2 and 3 o'clock—I can't say that I ever saw her drunk—I know she kept rum in her bedroom—when she was excited she used to throw her arms about very much—I was there on Thursday morning—Mrs. Aria was very angry about the removal of the things, and worked herself into a great rage, and when the prisoner left she, ran out of the house after her—there was some very valuable old-fashioned china belonging to the late Dr. Meldola, which the prisoner asked me to count; I did count it, there were twelve pieces; she said she was afraid they might be pawned, as other things had been pawned—I know there were a good many things pledged—that observation greatly excited the old lady—I was there the whole time that Mrs. Portbury was removing her things—I was no blow struck—I don't believe she meant to strike the old lady when she took up the decanter—she went away about 11 o'clock, and did not come back—I remained in the house all the day, till I went home at night, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I did not see a bit of difference in Mrs. Aria the whole of that day, from what I had seen on other days—it was on the Thursday night that I found her lying behind the door; she was not in a fit then; I think she had a fit during the-night, because next morning when I went up to her she was trying to get off the bed, and she could not—I think the alteration in her appearance arose from something that happened in the night—I don't remember saying before the Coroner that a little run would affect her.</p>

I am now stopping at 2, Heneage Lane—I am nearly twelve years old—the prisoner is, my mother—on Thursday, the; 1st, of February, I was in the kitchen at Park House, when there was a quarrel between my mother and grandmother—I only saw my mother spit in my grandmother's face—it was about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning—I did not see my mother do anything else—I saw her lift up a poker, it did not touch anybody—she took it from the fire-place—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she took it up like this—it did touch my grandmother, but it could not hurt a fly—mamma just touched her on the back, grandma then took up a broom and pursued my mamma with it upstairs into the drawing-room—I went up shortly after and found them still quarrelling—there was nobody in the room at that time but my mother and grandmother—mamma just took a decanter up from a shelf, and held it like this by the neck, and put it down again directly—grandmamma was following close behind her—the poker was left down in the kitchen—we afterwards all went into the parlour—there was some quarrelling there—my mamma afterwards left the house with some furniture in a van—I saw my grandmother fall after that, about an hour or two after my mamma left—she stumbled like into the parlour,</p>

               <p>and she went to the cheffonier and got some rum—she got off the sofa and staggered and knocked her head against the door—she got the rum from the cheffonier in the parlour and poured out about a quartern—I know it was rum because she never drank anything else—the parlour in on the same floor as the kitchen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My grandmother took up a decanter to my mamma and I said to her "Grandmamma put it down"—she took it up and held it up for a few minutes—that was in the drawing-room—she did put it down, but not the first time—I told her two or three times—that was not the same decanter my mother took up, a different one—after that they went into the parlour—my grandmother was very violent there, she was using bad language—I remember mamma taking down two little pictures of her own in the parlour—grandmamma was very violent upon that, and smashed a tumbler, and said, "Take that, you b—h," when she chased my mother with the broom she did not hit her, she touched her the same as mamma touched her with the poker, slightly—mamma ran out of the room after that, and grandmamma chased her upstairs, and there it was she took up the decanter—my grandmamma took up the decanter first—Bryant was not in the room when the decanters were taken up—that was in the drawing-room, about 10 o'clock—mamma left about half-past 10 o'clock—grandmamma ran out into the street after her and used bad language, and tried to bring a crowd—it was about 11 o'clock, or a little after that I saw her drink some rum—she had some cooper at dinner-time, about 1 o'clock—it was about half an hour after having the rum that she staggered and fell against the door—she struck her head against the kitchen door, against the middle part, the edge, it was open—she did not fall to the ground, because Bryant came and helped her—he pushed her up and she lay on the sofa again—she had some more rum in the evening—she took it from a round bottle—I noticed that it was emptied and filled that day, sometimes it was tilled two or three times a day; it held a quartern—I saw her take half-a-quartern in the morning, she finished it, and in the evening she sent Bryant for a quartern—before this row began, she used to have it in by the bottle full—she had some cooper for her supper in the evening, about 8 o'clock—she was in the habit of keeping rum in her bedroom—I noticed that day that she frequently went between the kitchen and her bedroom—I don't think she was sober that evening—I have sometimes seen her under the influence of drink in the morning, and I have said to her "Grandmamma, you should not get drunk so often"—after she fell against the door, she complained of having hurt her head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 289, Cambridge Road, Bethnal Green—I knew the deceased, Mrs. Aria, for the last few months—I had been her medical attendant—I saw her the day previous to 1st February, and I had also seen her on the Monday—on the Wednesday morning I saw her at my surgery, she then appeared healthy and robust—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260047"/>
               <p>on Saturday morning, 3rd February, about 11 o'clock, I was called to see her—she was then in an excited state, and prostrate—she remained in that conditition until the 11th—on that day I found her in a state of insensibility, or coma—she continued in that condition until her death, which took place on the 15th, at 12 o'clock at night—I made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination the evening following—there was a slight adhesion of the right pleura, and the liver was spongy—that was the result of age—there was nothing in the heart or liver to account for death—I opened the skull and examined the brain, it was congested throughout; there was no external appearance on the scalp—the membranes of the brain were in a highly congested con<lb/>dition, and between the membranes and the right hemisphere there was a small clot of blood, about the size of a crown piece—it was very thin and flat, I dare say it was not more than a drachm in weight—on removing the brain, beneath the right hemisphere, there was about two ounces of extra<lb/>vasated blood—that was blood that had oozed out of some ruptured vessel—that oozing had been going on from Sunday, the 11th—I should not think it could have commenced on the 1st, or the Symptoms of compression would have ensued earlier—when I was first called in to attend her, I did not observe anything that would indicate pressure on the brain, she was suffering more from a nervous shock and excitability, which she appeared to rally from—the coma did not come on till the Sunday—the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the base of the brain, that which I saw above and that which I saw below, might, and probably did, arise from the same cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The coats of the vessels of the brain were flabby—the liver was in such a condition that I could break it in pieces without any trouble, that is not a Symptom which I should expect to find in a person who has indulged in drink; I should expect a hardened liver, a nutmegy appearance, not spongy—the liver was not healthy, the state of it would not be produced by any blow recently given; it indicated a diseased con<lb/>stitution; the vessels of persons of that habit and age become brittle and liable to rupture on a fit of excitement—there was nothing in the condition of the brain inconsistent with her having ruptured a blood vessel through excitement—there was nothing to enable me to say with certainty that it was due to violence—if a heavy blow was struck with this decanter I should expect it would leave a mark, but not necessarily—I never saw any signs of stimulants about her; if she had been in the habit of taking stimulants that would increase the brittleness of the vessels, and coupled with age would make it likely for injury to occur sooner—I think that blood first began to effuse from the broken vessels on the 11th—had effusion com<lb/>menced before, there would have been other Symptoms—there were two escapes, the thin one and the 1 1/2 oz or 2oz.—if a blow sufficient to cause that had been given by this decanter I should almost think it would have been broken to pieces—if such a blow had been given on the 1st I should con<lb/>sider that insensibility would have commenced at once, from concussion—I have never known a case where after a blow of such a description a person has pursued their ordinary avocations for ten days without exhibiting signs of insensibility—if the blow was violent enough to produce such an injury as I saw at the base of the skull, in my judgment it would be followed by Symptoms of the brain having been injured—such a knock on the back as the boy has described would not produce anything at all like the Symptoms I saw—habits of drinking would increase the probability that excitement would cause the rupture of a vessel, apart from violence.</p>

I am the father of the deceased, and reside at 116, Pratt Street, St. Pancras—on Saturday evening, 17th February, I started from my house with a baked potato oven, on wheels—I was dragging it, and my two sons were behind—the deceased and his brother—previous to starting I saw the prisoner about twenty yards behind me, with a horse and cart, which was then standing still behind some trucks—I was dragging my truck three feet from the kerb, on my left—when I had got about twenty yards from my house, which would be forty yards from where the prisoner was, his horse and cart dashed in between me and the kerb, knock<lb/>ing one son down under the horse's feet, and killing the other—I did not see the cart bearing down upon me in time to get out of the way, it was done so momentarily—the cart caught the oven as well, and drove me with it—the prisoner had both reins in his hand, drawing up—the elder boy scrambled out, and was picked up—he was not hurt anything to speak of, only his knee—the deceased, Albert, was carried away by a boy to a doc<lb/>tor's, close by—the prisoner got out of his cart and went over to the doctor's with me, and the boy was lying there, a corpse.</p>

I live at 21, Queen Square, Westminster, and am a tailor—on 2nd February, about 12.45 in the morning, I was going home, and as I passed Gardener's Lane I saw the two prisoners—the man came behind me and put his hands over my mouth—he then dragged the button off my coat, and dived for my watch—he put his knee on my spine and laid me in the road—the female prisoner said "Jim, have you got it?" and he said "No; I have not got at the b—yet"—my coat had been com<lb/>pletely buttoned up—when I got rid of his arms I called "Police" and "Murder," and when I got up I did not see anyone, so I ran on home, and met a policeman at my own door—the prisoner did not get my watch—he took my chain—they both ran away when I got up, and I lost sight of them completely—I was called up about 2 or 3 o'clock that morning, and went to the police station at Rochester Row, where I identified the prisoners—they had my hat as well as my chain—I was slightly in liquor, but I was quite sensible, and knew what I was about—the man had dark whiskers, a Paisley scarf, and a wide-awake—the woman did not do anything, but she was there.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Edwards, of Clerkenwell—on the evening of 7th February, he sent me for a necklet—I got it, and was bringing it home in my bag—I had the bag by the neck, and put it under my jacket—when I got to the corner of Ashley Street, three men came up and put their hands over my mouth and eyes, and took the bag and necklet—the prisoner was one of them—I had seen them before—they followed me to the jeweller's shop—two of them came first, and one of them had a new pair of trowsers, and he said he was not coming in the mud—they kept beckoning for him to come—I went on the other side of Ashley Street, and the two were beckoning the other one to come up—the prisoner was one of them—after they had taken the bag and necklet, they ran down the street, and I ran too, calling "Stop thief!"—they did not hurt me—two ran down John Street Road, and one went down Corporation Lane—there was a crowd in John Street Road by the beer-shop, and the prisoner came back into the crowd, and a policeman took him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I lost the necklet I told a policeman about it—I pointed the prisoner out in the crowd, and then the policeman took hold of him—the policeman said "Is that one of them?" and I said "Yes"—I saw the prisoner before in Whiskin Street—I should not know the other two again—I should know one of them—one of them had a pair of whitish trowsers on.</p>

On this Saturday I was assisting to take Tyssen to the station—we were surrounded by a mob of about 150 persons—I saw the prisoner violently assaulting the prosecutor—I went to his assistance, and Dutnell turned round and dealt me a fearful blow in the back, which knocked me down—the prisoner was knocked down by a brother constable, and then I got up and secured him—it appears that I was stabbed in the back with a knife—the knife lodged in my back till I got to the station—I am sure Dutnell is the man who struck me—he only gave me one blow—I was dressed as I am now, and the knife penetrated into my left shoulder—as we were going to the station he said "If you put me away this time, I will do for you."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-builder, and live at 22, Park Street, West Ham—I was acquainted with the deceased, George Raymond, for fourteen or fifteen years—he was always a healthy man—he was thirty-one years of age—on February 16th he and I went down to Ilford upon veloci<lb/>pedes—we got there about 9.15 or 9.30 in the evening—I went to the Rose and Crown, kept by Mr. Milton—the deceased went further on, and returned to me at the Rose and Crown in about an hour and a half—he was then per<lb/>fectly sober, and perfectly well—we remained there till closing time—we had three or four pints of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. half-and-half, I also had three 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worths of warmgin-and-water, and we each had one glass of rum—when we left we got on our velocipedes for the purpose of going home—we were sober enough to ride them—the deceased was quite capable—there had been no quarrelling or angry words between us that evening, or at any time all the years I have known him—it was a very dark night—we came away together, but I was before him, perhaps 100 yards—I was jogging along, and all of a sudden I found myself go over—I thought that I had run against something, or something had run against me, and as I was getting up I found a constable (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) had hold of my collar—he showed his lantern—I asked him if he had done it, and the reason he had done it—he said what was I making a disturbance there for?—I said I had made no disturbance, and I should go down to the police-station and report him—he shook me as well at the same time that he collared me—I called to my friend to mind the machines—I said "George, this policeman has been ill-using me, and I will go down to the station and report him for his conduct"—the prisoner said "The next man that comes up I will knock down"—there was no one there but the prisoner, Raymond, and myself—I then went straight away to the station—I made a complaint there to the inspector—the prisoner came in some few minutes afterwards with the deceased, and I said "That is the man"—I did not take particular notice how he had got the deceased, they were not walking separately, they were both together—he was being dragged like up the steps—when we left the public-house he was quite capable of walking—I did not hear the prisoner make any answer when I said "That's the man"—he said "That is his friend"—we were both put in the dock—he said he would charge us with being drunk and causing a disturbance, and we were locked up in the cell—no more notice was taken of my complaint—when I first went in I complained to the inspector that one of his men had been assaulting me—he asked if I knew the man—I said "No," and when the prisoner came in I said "That is the man"—I had been in two or three minutes before he came in—I believe my complaint was not taken down—I was talking to the inspector when the prisoner came in—when he saw me</p>

               <p>he said "Oh, you are here then," and then he took hold of me, and put me in the dock—I was on the left-hand side of the road with my velocipede, the near side, coming towards London—there is no footpath on that side, only on the other side; there is a hedge and a sort of ditch, and some heaps of mud raked up—I am almost confident that I did not run up against the policeman—I never gave him the least provocation for catching hold of me—I don't suppose we were going at the rate of more than about two or three miles an hour—I could not have fallen off my velocipede, because I was too particular in keeping the right side of the road—I can't explain how I came off—it was done all of an instant—my velocipede had two wheels behind and one in front, and Raymond's had one behind and two in front—they would stand perfectly steady—I did not strike the policeman to my recol<lb/>lection; I had no occasion to do so; I did not; I have no recollection of striking him—this happened 400 or 500 yards from the police-station—I ran back to the station—the station is higher up the road than the Rose and Crown.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was not became I had had so much beer that I do not recollect whether I struck the policeman or not; it was too dark to see anything, too dark to see a blow struck; he could not tell that I struck him, or anyone else—he did not know which it was—if he was struck at all it must have been either by me or Raymond—before I went to the Rose and Crown we had only been in one public-house—we had one pint of four half-and-half there between us—at the Rose and Crown we had four pints of half-and-half, three glasses of gin-and-water, and one small glass of rum—I had the biggest part of the four pints—I was not quite sober when I got on my velocipede, but I was quite capable of riding it; of course if I was not sober I must have been drunk—I was drunk, but not incapable—Raymond was much better than me; he had slot had as much as I had—we started from the Rose and Crown between 12.30 and 1 o'clock—I can't say what time it was when I got to the station—I don't know whether it was 2.30, that was what the constable stated—I can't tell at all what we were doing during the two hours—we had only got between 300 and 400 yards from the Rose and Crown—I have not the slightest idea how we had occupied those two hours—I was not on the near side of the road, nor the off side—the velocipede might have been on the off side after the occurrence—I can't tell how it came there—it is a wide road—when my friend came up to me he <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> his machine across, more into the middle of the road, because he should not run against me, I suppose—I called out to him before he came up to me—there are no lamps there—there was a lamp outside the station door—I have no recollection of a man driving a dog-cart stopping and speaking to me—no one spoke to me—I heard a man named Coomber give evidence about coming and speaking to me—I can't say whether it was before the Coroner, of where it was—I was not present when he gave his evidence—I did not call out to my com<lb/>panion "George, stop the b—"—I can't recollect it—I did not say "George, give it to the b—"—I don't make use of such expressions—I don't re<lb/>collect anything of the sort—I charged the constable with assaulting me, for throwing me over with the machine—I did not think he had upset me, I merely asked him afterwards if he had done it—I asked him that before I went to the station—he did not say he had or not, but he said what was I making that disturbance for—I should think Raymond was 100 yards behind me—we don't very often go out with our velocipedes—I had only</p>

               <p>been to Mr. Oldacre's, at Ilford, that day—I lost my hat when the machine went over—I told my friend to look for it while I went to the station—I got it again—I can't say who brought it to me; it was one of the police<lb/>men, the same morning, at the station—I did not tell Sergeant Fry next morning that I had lost my hat, and was looking for it when the police<lb/>man came up, or that my mate had knocked it off—I was put in the dock and charged with disorderly conduct, drunkenness and an assault; that charge stands over till this case is disposed of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My impression was that the policeman had knocked me over, velocipede and all—he took me up and shook me, that was the assault complained of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, and live at 4, Mercury Gardens, Romford—on 16th February, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was coming from Wanstead in a dog-cart—when I reached between the Coach and Horses and the bridge I heard something rattle like the wheels of a truck turning over—it was near me, exactly opposite—I looked over my near side wheel, and saw a man in the act of falling, and he fell very heavily, just as if he was falling off something—he was on the near side of the road—if he was going to London he would be on his wrong side—I did not feel that I struck the vehicle—I was going about six miles an hour, I could not go any faster because it was so dark—if I had run against it I must have felt the shock, you can feel almost anything in a dog-cart—I asked the man if he was hurt—he did not answer me for the moment, but the first words he spoke were "Stop the b—, stop the b—, come here, George"—I asked him again if he was hurt—he still continued calling—I walked my horse four or five yards in the direction he was calling to, and presently I saw a man leave the bridge—I said "You had better go and look after your friend, he has fallen over, I think"—he never replied to me, but replied to the man that had fallen—I turned my horse's head and went back to the spot, and asked him if he was hurt—they neither replied to me, but one said to the other, "No, I am not hurt, only the b—knocked me over"—I don't identify Humphreys as being the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I called at the police-station and told them what had occurred—I did not know whether it was a truck, a velocipede, or what it was—when I left the men they were squabbling one with the other, I could not make head or tail of them, they were <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> one another, noisy, I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant K</hi> 25). On the morning of 16th February, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260064"/>
               <p>was on duty at Ilford Station, about 2.30—a knock came at the door and Humphreys came in, and he complained of having been assaulted by a policeman up the road, that he had been roughly handled, he did not know who the policeman was—during the conversation Strickland came in with Raymond by the collar—he put Raymond in the dock, and also took hold of Humphreys and put him in the dock, and charged them both with being drunk, creating a disturbance and assaulting him—he said he had found them quarrelling in the Romford Road, that he advised them to go away; that they refused, when Humphreys came and struck him in the mouth; that they then both made an attack on him; he undid his cape, drew his staff and said "The first one that strikes me again I will knock him down;" that Raymond came towards him to strike him, and he struck him on the head and knocked him down—I did not examine Strickland's mouth—I did not observe any marks of violence on his face—I was standing three yards away—from his general appearance, I saw there was no violence on him—I did not go to his face and look—I also examined Raymond's head, but did not find the least marks of violence on him—he tried to speak, but could not—he was very incoherent—I did not understand a word—I did not see that he placed his hands to his head—the charge was read over to them and Humphreys said "You are not going to lock me up, are you? I have not done anything. I don't know what my mate has been doing, I am not drunk"—they were placed in a cell—the doctor was afterwards sent for—I was present when he came—I should not have locked Humphreys up as being drunk and incapable from what I saw—he was drunk, but I should not have locked him up for drunkenness alone—I continually looked at the deceased in the cell after 6 o'clock—I think Humphreys was quite capable of giving an account of the assault that he alleged against Strickland—at 7.30 I noticed that Raymond had moved his head—a pillow had been placed under him—he vomitted before the doctor came—I tried to rouse him, but could not—his eyes were half open and half shut, apparently fixed—I had him carried to the fire—after the doctor came I had a cart sent for, by his direction—I placed Raymond on a stretcher and put him in the cart and accompanied him to the London Hospital—on the road near Bow, I observed his features change, and a little further on I found he was dead—I afterwards accompanied Strickland to the place where this occurred, about 500 yards from the police-station, and about 300 yards from the Coach and Horses—I there found two tricycles, one with two wheels in front and one behind, on the left had side of the road, the other with two wheels behind and one in front, about 70 yards nearer London, on the right-hand side of the road—the first one was about 120 yards from the bridge, on the London side—I said to Humphreys in the morning "What had you been drinking last night?" and he said "We had three or four pints of four half-and-half, and the deceased had a glass of rum"—he also added "If the policeman had not interfered with us we should have been all right."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He also said "My mate knocked my hat off, and we were looking for it when the policeman came up"—I am not certain whether he had a hat on when he came to the station—Raymond had no hat on; that was never found—Humphrey's hat was found afterwards—I don't know by whom—I went from the station after 3 o'clock, and did not return till 6 o'clock—I saw Strickland's cape and coat—they were apparently muddy, and showed marks of a struggle—he said that when the attack was made on him he put his cape down in the road—it was dirty—he has been in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—Raymond was brought there on 16th February—he was dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on opening the scalp, I found extravasation of blood into the brain and into the muscle underneath—the skull was opened, and there was a fracture about two inches long, and under the fracture extravasation of blood—that corresponded with what I discovered before I opened the skull—the skull was thin; thinner than the majority of skulls are—there was extravasation of blood in other parts of the brain—the heart and lungs were healthy—the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> was separated from the skull—the brain itself was a healthy one—the cause of death was fracture of the skull, and extravasa<lb/>tion of blood into the brain—a policeman's staff would be calculated to cause such a fracture as I saw—the fracture would cause insensibility and inability to speak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no external mark—it might have been due to a fall of any kind, provided it was not against a sharp-pointed instrument, which would have produced a puncture—he was a strong, muscular, powerful man—the wound was on the left side—the skull being thin, less violence would cause the fracture.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. Galloway of High Street, Deptford—on 13th January, the prisoner told me to give him the bas<lb/>ket—I did so, and he put it under the counter where the cheese is kept, I went outside and he afterwards gave me the basket packed, and said "Take this to my place"—there was no one there to pack it but himself—there was butter, cheese, eggs, and bacon in it—the cheese was in paper, tied round with string—on my way I opened the paper which was round the cheese, and found under the cheese two half-crowns and a florin, I wrapped it up again, delivered it to Mrs. Hayes—when I re<lb/>turned I made a communication about it—on 25th January, he said "Take these papers to my wife," they were packed up under the counter—there were nine <hi rend="italic">Kentish Independents</hi> and one <hi rend="italic">Surrey Gazette</hi>—I took them to his wife, and on my way I showed them to Detective Officer Osborne—I had been told to do so—on 10th February the prisoner told me to take his things off the shelf; there were some eggs, butter and cheese; I put them in the basket, and took them to his house; there were also three or four rashers of bacon done up in paper, which he pointed to me and told me to take—on my way I saw Detective Margetson, who examined the basket in my presence, and I saw him find two half-crowns between two rashers of bacon—he then did it up as it was before, and I left it at the prisoner's house.</p>

               <p>goods were packed—there is no charge against him with reference to the cheese—I had not opened a parcel before—it was the under shopman who told me to open it—when I went back I saw George Simpson outside the shop, and told him I had opened it—the prisoner was then behind the counter—neither Simpson or I put any question to him—I had told the prisoner that Mrs. Hayes wanted some paper to wrap up his dinner to send to him, and he said "Take some of the waste paper under the counter"—they were old newspapers, and something like 1 1/2 lb., and I took it—he did not say "Don't take it away"—I took nine old newspapers, and asked him whether that would be enough—he said "Yes"—Simpson did not pack the parcel containing the rashers of bacon, but he always told me to open the parcels, and I always did from that time—I went to the prisoner's house every day, and opened all the parcels—I do not know who wrapped up the rashers of bacon on 10th February—I was putting the goods away—I saw Margetson open the parcel—I knew him before—he came back in half-an-hour—the prisoner was there—I put no question to him—I did not attend at the Police Court—Simpson has been there all the time I have been there—Mr. Galloway was there every day; he is a cheesemonger—I never served.</p>

I am under-shopman to Mr. Galloway, and have been sometime in his employ—on January 13th the boy Osborne took some things to the prisoner's wife—Mr. Galloway had not then made any communication to me, but I gave the boy instructions in reference to the parcel—I did not pack the things on that occasion, but I was present when the prisoner packed the cheese into a basket—I saw him go to the end of the shop, and take some<lb/>thing from between the tubs, and put it between the cheese and the paper—I could not see what it was, but in consequence of what I saw I gave instructions to the boy—when the prisoner put it into the cheese he deliberately put it into the scale, to weigh it and charge it to himself, the money with the cheese, and that attracted my attention; when the boy came home, he made a communication to me, and I told my father the same day—my father does not live there—I remember seeing the boy take the papers—I did not pack the parcel of goods which the prisoner sent to his wife on 10th February, nor was I present when it was packed, I was outside—nobody was present to pack it but the prisoner and the lad.</p>

               <p>between the first and second rashers were two half-crowns wrapped in paper; they were not marked—I put them in again and sent them by the boy—on the same Saturday I received four marked sovereigns and four marked half-sovereigns from Mr. Galloway—I gave two of the sovereigns and two of the half-sovereigns to Detective Berritt, and the other two sovereigns and half-sovereign to my wife, directing her what to do with them—shortly after 12 o'clock that night Mr. Galloway called me into the parlour where the prisoner was, and Simpson and the two lads—Mr. Galloway gave the prisoner in custody for robbing him—a half-sovereign, a crown, a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence were lying on the table, and Berritt asked the prisoner "Have you any more money in your pockets? if so, turn it out"—he took a half-sovereign and a crown out of his pocket, we examined it, and found that the half-crown was marked—it was money which was previously taken—I asked the prisoner if he had got a great-coat to put on; he pointed to a coat hanging behind the door and said "That is mine;" I asked him if he had got anything in the pockets; he said "A pair of gloves and a wrapper"—I asked him if there was anything else—he said "Not that I know of"—I examined the coat and found a pair of gloves in one pocket and a wrapper in another; I put my hand in a second time and found a marked half-sovereign—he said that he knew nothing about it, somebody must have put it there—I took him to the station—I afterwards searched his house, and in a chest of drawers in the bedroom I found a bag containing a half-crown marked.</p>

Brigade, Royal Artillery—the prisoner was a gunner in that battery—he would have no right, on the return of the regiment, to write for those stamps—he had no authority—unless he had authority, no non-commissioned officer was allowed to write such a letter—he signed himself as paymaster, to that letter—that was an untruth—the stamps are used for the service of India—if the captain of the battery had taken them to the Postmaster-General he would have been given the money for them.</p>

I live at 41, Manor Road—Mrs. Dewsbury is my wife's sister—I am an accountant, and have money of Mrs. Dewsbury, for the purpose of lending it out, which is the reason that there is a bank<lb/>ing account in the name of Follit and Dewsbury, and the security is in the names of Follit and Dewsbury—on 20th November the defendant came to me; I had never seen him before—he gave his name Alfred Whitehead, and wanted a loan of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said that 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nett would suffice—he offered, as security, a bill of sale on his furniture at Stock well—I asked him if he had a pianoforte—he said "Yes, I have got one at the Pantechnicon, but I have had an advance upon it, and that is partly the reason I want this money, to redeem it"—I asked him if there was any rent due; he said "No, it is paid up to Michaelmas." On the 23rd I went to his house 4, Norman Terrace—there was no pianoforte there then—he produced the inventory and said that he did not wish the bill of sale registered till the last day, at all events, because he was about obtaining an appointment to an estate in liquidation at Hammersmith, which would bring him into funds, and if the bill was registered it might injure him in getting that appointment—he said that he had received some income from his wife</p>

               <p>which might assist him, and he might get rid of the bill of sale—I next saw him on the 24th, I think, and the money was paid on the 25th, when I saw him at my house—I met him that day according to appointment at 6, Longford Terrace, Mr. Harris's house—the bill of sale had then been pre<lb/>pared; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it had been agreed that the bill was to be for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to cover interest and expenses for 12 months—he executed this bill of sale, and this inventory (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is copied from the one he supplied me with—he signed and made this declaration at the same time, and before he executed the bill of sale. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the pianoforte, chimney-glass, and hearth-rug were his own property, and that he had not charged his goods with any sum of money, except the goods at the Bedford Pantechnicon</hi>) he also signed a pro<lb/>missory note, and I paid 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the full amount of the bill of sale—the amount the defendant got was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be deducted by agreement until he produced the pianoforte—I went to his house on the 29th; he opened the door to me—I said "Have you got the pianoforte?"—he said "Yes, all right"—I went into the parlour; there was a pianoforte there, made by Tolkein, and I paid the prisoner the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 14th I wrote to the prisoner, as the time for registration expired on the 17th, and said that unless it was paid on the following day it must be registered—when the deed was executed I said "Well, I expect the receipt for the rent," and he handed me this piece of paper to show that the rent was paid—I received this letter in reply to one of mine about registering the bill of sale: "December 7th. Dear sir, I think I shall be able to pay you back the bill of sale by Thursday next; so you will not require to register it before next Thursday, and I will call on you then. Yours respectfully, A. N. White<lb/>head. To W.

                  </hi>. I am a grocer—in October, 1870, I found it neces<lb/>sary to call my creditors together—I had some furniture and a pianoforte made by Harling—I had it twelve months, and paid him for it—my friends provided money and bought it, and the trustees were aware that it was my property—this letter came from the trustees to the defendant—the defend<lb/>ant gave me the money to buy the furniture; it was bought in for the trus<lb/>tees, and these are the receipts for the money (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the furniture was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187202260081"/>
               <p>then removed from Shepherd's Bush to Whitford Street—the whole of this money was provided by my friends and relations—the pianoforte was re<lb/>moved with it, and money was subsequently raised on it by bill of sate, by Mr. Baughan—I went on paying off the bill of sale of Mr. Baughan—I gars the money to Whitehead to pay—I had part of the money from Mr. Baughan—I did not have the whole, because I owed Mr. Whitehead some money—I had nothing to do with putting the piano into the bill of sale—the furniture was removed in March or April from Whitford Street, by White<lb/>head—I knew it; I was there, and he said he was going to put the piano into the Pantechnicon—I had no portion of the ten guineas—I did not see the pianoforte afterwards—Mr. Harling's name was on it—I had no know<lb/>ledge of his pledging it to Mr. Follit—I appeared at Hammersmith Police Court as a witness against him, early in November I think—I knew of its removal, but did not know of its being pledged there—after the seizure on Mr. Lee's bill of sale, I went and saw the furniture at the auction rooms—I recognised a Chest of drawers, a marble washhand-stand and fittings, and some carpets, my property, which had been at Whitford Street, where I lived, and which the prisoner had removed to Norman Terrace, without my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could furniture be taken out of your house without your knowing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A bill of sale was taken by the prisoner, and I could not keep up the payment—he said that he would pay off Mr. Baughan, and he allowed me to remove two rooms of furniture, which I did, and went away from Whitford Street, leaving all the furniture there, except that of the two rooms, which I removed—I did not know of his removing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I believe there was a liquidation in 1871. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my trustees were Izzard and Bette—they did not refuse to sell me the furni<lb/>ture, but I had not got the money—I got it from the country, from my friends—I owed you money—one amount I handed over to you was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was to buy furniture for me—I did not owe you money at that time—I paid you 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the evening of 23rd December 1870—I got 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my wife's mother—the whole amount for buying the furniture was 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you had the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I received from Mr. Conway in liquidation—I do not think Conway's money was all paid before Baughan's Bill of Sale was ever thought of—the piano was included in the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the furni<lb/>ture was sold—nothing was said to you about the piano not belonging to me, but a note came on 24th December, which I received and gave to you—you hired the van to move the furniture, and paid for it—you took the house for me—you took it from Mr. Wilmot, and it changed hands afterwards—the furniture belonged to me—but what I moved away was a very small quantity, there was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left to be paid off—you bought my coals but you had all the money from me—I knew that you were going to mortgage the furniture for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you did not tell me that I should have it back by paying off Mr. Baughan—it belonged to me, and I can bring witnesses to prove that the whole of the money was paid—I did not buy it myself be<lb/>cause I had not got the money—I left the house I think in April, 1871—I do not know the value of the furniture I left behind, but I know that I have had to pay for it again.

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Great Dover Street, and am manager in the hat department of Messrs. Dunn, the clothier, at Newington Causeway—the prisoner is my wife, and has been for the last fifteen years—I lived with her till a fortnight before this occurrence—I had more than one reason for being dissatisfied with her, and we agreed to separate—I allowed her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—my salary was two guineas—I was afterwards compelled to seek the protection of the Magistrate, and then I allowed her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I told her if she annoyed mo I should have to send her back to prison—she said "The next time I go to prison it will be for your death"—I refused to see her after that, and on 20th January she came to my master's premises—she came first of all at 9.15, but I would not see her then—she came again at 12 o'clock in the day, and I went to the door to see her—I said "What do</p>

I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—a little after 12 o'clock on 20th January, the prisoner was brought to the hospital—she was burnt very much—about half-an-hour after Richard Grange was brought in—he was burnt very much on the left side of the face, but worse on the scalp—it was done with nitric acid—I was shown a jug in which there was about a tea-spoonful of nitric acid.</p>
