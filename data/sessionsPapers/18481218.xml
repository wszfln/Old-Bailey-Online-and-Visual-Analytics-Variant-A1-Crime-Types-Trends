                  </hi>. My father is an auctioneer and land-agent, carrying on business in Gresham-street, City; he has a country-house near Chelmsford, called Broomfield-lodge. On Monday, 6th Nov. last, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper:—"A pair of brown geldings, and a very superior Brougham-horse to be sold, at half their value, to procure immediate sale; the pair are well-bred, clever in saddle, and step well together in harness; six years old. The Brougham-horse is bay, black legs, sixteen hands; very noble horse in harness; five years old; warranted sound. The coachman is fully empowered to disposed of them. 28 stable, Turk's Head Mews, Harley-street, Cavendish-square. Also, a very stanch pair of liver and white pointers."—In consequence of seeing that I went to" Turk's Head Mews, or Harley Mews North, in Harley-street—I went down the yard, and when I got to No. 28 stable I saw Mowatt; he was dressed similar to what he is now, with a shawl-handkerchief on, a black coat, and kerseymere trowsers—I asked him for the coachman of 28 stable—he said that he was the coachman—I went into the stable, and asked him whether those were the horses which were advertised for sale in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—he said they were—I said, "You will have no objection to give me a reference to whom these horses belong?"—he said, "No, certainly not;" they belong to Mrs. King, of Eastbourne, Sussex"—I asked him to have the horse stripped and taken out of the stable, that I might see him—he called a person named George, who turned out to be a person named Bubb; who came from the loft, went up to the horse's head, took the clothes off, put a bridle on him, and turned him round in rather a clumsy way—Mowatt said, "D----n these Lon<lb/>don fellows, I thought they were more up to their business"—I looked at the horse, and found he was older than he was represented to be—I believe that was the smaller horse—I asked him how long Mrs. King had had them—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180006"/>
               <p>said, pointing to the smaller horse, "That one she bred, and the other (all<lb/>uding to the larger one), she bought two or three years ago"—the little horse was then taken into the stable, and—the other one was brought out—he said they had been constantly driven together, and I asked to see them stand together side by side—I asked how long they had been driven together, and he said constantly for about two years by himself; that the ladies had ridden them, and they were perfectly quiet in double and single harness—I believe I made a remark upon the other horse's age as well—I said that either he or I must be a fool to say that horses with their mouths were only six years old—he said that they were only that, for the one his mistress had bred, and the other she had only had about two years—the horses were then taken into the stable, and I asked him, I believe, what the price was—he said his mistress, Mrs. King, expected a hundred guineas for them; but that I had better see the job-master as to price—he called to George, and told him to fetch his master; he did not mention the job-master's name, but it turned out to be Ward—Ward came down the yard, and I told him, in Mowatt's presence, that I had seen the horses; that I liked the look of them very well, and that the coachman told me they were perfectly quiet in double and single harness—Ward said, "I can assure you that they are both perfectly quiet in double and single harness"—I said it was not for myself that I wanted them, they were for my father; and unless they were quiet 1 would not look at them, nor get him to look at them at any price whatever—he said Mrs. King was an old customer of his; that she had been dealing with him for fourteen or fifteen years, and that was the reason she had sent the horses up to him to be sold—I repeatedly spoke about their being quiet, and he said they were quiet; I might have no doubt about it; that he knew Mrs. King a long time; that she would not ride behind them unless they were perfectly quiet; and she would not permit him to tell a lie about it—I then asked the price—he said that Mrs. King expected a hundred guineas for them; but that he had no doubt she would take eighty, for what with the expense of the horses standing at livery, and the coachman, who must have his "<hi rend="italic">baccy</hi>" the same as the rest of them, it cost her very nearly 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I said it was useless for me to look at them at that price—" Well, sir, "he said, "I don't think she would take any less; but ladies don't know much about these sort of things"—I again asked him as to their being quiet; "for, "I said, "my father is uncommonly fidgetty, and unless they are perfectly quiet I really would not have them"—he said, "You need be under no apprehension of anything of that sort, sir, for I have known Mrs. King so long; and I can give you a warranty that they are perfectly quiet"—I then asked him to tell me the price he intended to take for them as I would get my father to look at the horses, and if he liked them, I would recommend him to buy them; but as for eighty guineas, that would not do—he said it would be a bad job for him; that Mrs. King had been his customer so long that he should get nothing by having the horses there at that price—he then said, "If you like to have the horses at seventy guineas, and pay me my commission, I think I can get Mrs. King to accept it"—I said, "If I bought the horses, I should buy them outright, without having anything to do with his commission"—he said, "Well, it is a very bad job for me; I shall get nothing out of it"—I said, "I can't help that; if you will tell me the lowest price you will take for them I will get my father to look at them, and see if he will buy them"—he said he thought Mrs. King would not take any less—I said then I could not buy them at that price—he asked what I would give for them—I said, "I believe it is not a usual custom to be buyer and seller too;" I know you men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180007"/>
               <p>have generally two prices, an asking price and a selling price; and if you will at once tell me, as I am going to Tattersall's to-day, I shall probably, unless I buy these, meet with a pair there"—he then said if I liked to take them at sixty-five guineas, and pay his commission, I should have them—he said he had been to an omnibus-proprietor, a namesake of his, named Chaplin, who would give him seventy guineas for them immediately; but Mrs. King had left particular orders with the coachman that they were not to be sold unless for private use; that she would not entertain any dealers having them—I then told him that if he would give me the refusal of them at 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till three o'clock in the afternoon I would get my father to look at them, as they were for him, and not for myself; and then I would give him an answer whether we would have them or not—this was about half-past eleven, or twelve—I then went away, and returned in about an hour with my father—I found Mowatt and Ward standing against the stable-door—Mowatt opened the door; we went in, and 1 said, "These are the horses"—Bubb was in a box close by, with a Brougham-horse—the horses were brought out—my father entered into con<lb/>versation with the men—I did not pay attention to what was said; I walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a land-agent and valuer, of Gresham-street, and have a country place, Broomfield Lodge, near Chelmsford. On 6th Nov., in consequence of seeing this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, I went to Turk's Head Mews, or Harley-street Mews, and saw Mowatt, Ward, and Bubb—the horses were brought out, and stood side by side—I looked at them, and said I under<lb/>stood they were more than six years old, but I did not care about that so long as they were quiet—Mowatt then stated that he was coachman to Mrs. King, of Eastbourne, Sussex, that she bred one of the horses, that he had driven them together two or three years, and I might depend upon them being perfectly quiet—I had them walked down the yard—Mowatt said he had driven them with a snaffle on the top—I said, "I suppose you mean you drove them with a curb bit on the cheek—he said, "Yes," and that he had constantly driven them, and that the last journey was with his mistress from Eastbourne to Bromley, and they came up extremely well; and that when his master was alive he used to drive the larger horse in single harness, he was a capital horse in single harness, and he always drove him with a snaffle bit—I said that what I was particularly anxious about was, the horses being quiet, and he repeated several times his having driven them together, as Mrs. King's coach<lb/>man, and he always rode the larger horse when he rode post—some conver<lb/>station occurred about the price, and he referred me to Ward, and said, "The job-master will talk to you about the price," pointing to Ward, who was standing by—Mowatt said that he was very anxious indeed to get rid of the horses, because he was there at considerable expense, and his mistress was very anxious for him to get back, as she was going to Jersey, and wanted the horses sold, and if sold he should go back that night—I then had some con<lb/>versation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180009"/>
               <p>with Ward about the price, and he asked me seventy guineas—I said I could not give that price—Mowatt, who was standing by, then came up to me, and said, "What has he asked you?"—I said, "Seventy guineas"—he said, "I don't think my mistress will accept that price"—I was then walking up the yard towards the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which was waiting for me in Harley-street—Ward and Mowatt were walking with me, talking about the price, and Ward said, in Mowatt's hearing, he would take sixty-five guineas for them if I would pay his expenses, for that Mrs. King was a very old customer of his, and he could not charge her anything for the standing of the horses, and he should get nothing unless I gave him something—I told him I could have nothing at all to do with his commission, and as I was getting into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I said I would give him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horses—he and Mowatt were standing together—Ward said he could not take that price, and after some more con<lb/>versation, he still recommending the horses as a pair most likely to suit me, the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove on—in going along Harley-street, in consequence of some conversation with my son, we turned round, and came to the end of the yard in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Ward and Mowatt were standing together at the corner—Ward came to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-door, and I said, "I think the horses will suit me in consequence of what you say, and I am induced to offer you 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to include everything, if you will deliver them at the Eastern Counties station this afternoon"—he said I must give him something for himself, for he had no other chance of getting anything—I said, "No, I shall not do that," and I called out to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to go on—he then said, "Stop a minute"—Ward then went to Mowatt, who was standing two or three steps from him, and be came back and said I should have the horses—I then said to Mowatt," Of course you will lend me the cloths and bridles to take the horses down to the railway, and I will return them to-morrow"—he nodded assent—Ward came from Mowatt to the <hi rend="italic">cab-door</hi>, and said, "You must give me something to bind the bargain—I gave him a sovereign, and drove away, having previously arranged that he was to be at my office, in Gresham-street, a little before four o'clock, and that the horses were to be sent at five o'clock to the Eastern Counties Railway station—I then went away, and got back to the office about a quarter to four—I found Ward there—I took out my check-book to draw a check—Ward said a check was of no use to him, because the bank would be closed, and he could not get the money—I said I had not the money by me, and after talking for two or three minutes I said, "Well, if you will be at the railway station at five o'clock, I will endeavour to get the check changed, so as to give you the money"—at five o'clock I went to the rail<lb/>way station, where I saw Ward—he wished me to pay him—I said, "Where are the horses?"—he said they would be there in a minute or two—I replied I should like to see them first, and in the course of a few minutes they came into the yard—a horse-box was got ready—I then went into the waiting-room, and paid Ward four sovereigns, having given him one before, and six 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—he again pressed me very much to give him something for himself, saying I must give him something to get a new hat, that he should get nothing for the keep of the horses, repeating what he had said before—I gave him no answer, but walked out where the horse-box was—he followed me—I found them taking the cloths off the horses—I remonstrated, and Bubb then stated that he was ordered not to leave the cloths or bridles—in a minute or two afterwards Bubb came to me, and wanted something for bringing the horses—I said, "No; as I have been deceived about the clothing, I will not give any of you a <hi rend="italic">screw, "</hi> I think was the observation—I then went down by the train—the horses were taken out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180012"/>
               <p>at Chelmsford that evening—Ward gave me this receipt at the time I paid him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"London, Nov. 6, 1848. Received of J. Bedel, Esq., the sum of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for a pair of brown geldings, warranted sound, quiet to ride, and quiet in double and single harness; the horses to be returned within one week from this date, if not approved of. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE WARD</hi>." The horses got into my stable at Broomfield that night—I went to see them taken out next morning, and directed my coachman to put the harness on—they were put to a spring van which I keep, and in which I always drive horses before I put them to my carriage—one of the horses came out of the stable very well—the large one we could not get out; we had considerable trouble with it, and we were at last obliged to back him out—after considerable difficulty we put the horses to the van—they appeared to be unaccustomed to be put to harness—my coachman and my son got on the box, and we tried to make them go forward, but they were very unwilling to do so, but after pushing at the wheel, and pushing behind, they sometimes rearing, and sometimes backing, and sometimes going a step or two forward, we got them out of the gates into the road—they still kept on doing the same, and after they had got about fifteen or twenty yards, one of them kicked very viciously—I had not given them too much beans; I had none in my stable—they bit one another very much in going through the yard—they were evidently unaccustomed to each other, and, I think, to harness—I did not take any care as to which side I put them in, or change them—as soon as I found they would not go forward, but kicked and reared, I had them taken out—I never tried them in the carriage—that was the only experiment I personally made with them—they were tried subse<lb/>quently—I came up to London, and communicated with the police—I did not go to the stable—I attended before the Magistrate on the Saturday—at the time I parted with my money I believed the horses were the property of Mrs. King, that she had bred one and bought the other, and that Mowatt was her coachman, and that the horses were sent up to Ward, the job-master, for the purpose of selling them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Your <hi rend="italic">clerk</hi> informs me that you will not be in town till to-morrow, therefore any time between eleven and four o'clock to-morrow, Tuesday, you can have your money returned by sending the horses to the stable in Harley-street"—I believe my clerk did see the person—I did not send the horses to the stable on the Monday—I did on the Saturday, but not after receiving the letter—I believe it was a fact that I was not likely to be in town on Monday—I am an auctioneer—we do not always give a literal account of the matters we have to sell, but we do not deceive—some persons give a much more pic<lb/>turesque description of the property they have to sell than others—I am not poetical, and do not keep a poet.</p>

I know the defendant—I saw him on 1st Nov., between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, at the King's Head, in Old Change—his brother-constable, Edward Healey, was with him—they went down into the skittle-ground, and played at skittles there, about three hours—I went with them, but neither Grant nor I played—I remained there till seven o'clock—I was in Grant's company the whole of that time—he, I, and Healey then went over to the Crown and Sceptre, which is kept by Healey's brother; it is only seven or eight yards from the King's Head—we there saw Perez and Lee—I went with Grant and Healey from one house to the other—there was nobody in the street at the time—Healey called for a quartern of gin and two cheroots; one I had and one Healey had, and he poured out a glass of gin for Grant, who directly gave it to Perez—he drank it, and he in return put his hand in his pocket, and gave Grant a cigar—about a minute or two after, Perez asked for a knife, in his broken way of speaking English—the landlady gave it him—he untied a brown paper parcel, containing a box of cigars—no one had any cigars out of the box—he said they were good—they were folded up again, and the box remained on the counter—a minute or two after, Grant called Lee on one side; I did not hear what he said, but Lee left within two or three minutes, leaving the cigars—Perez then took the box of cigars under his arm, and was about to leave the house, when Grant placed his hand on his shoulder, and said he was his prisoner, and asked where he was going—he said, "Me do no wrong, me do no wrong; my master's goods"—Grant then went with him to his house—I went about ten</p>

               <p>minutes afterwards with Healey—the policemen began to search the house—I was detained by Grant as a witness, to take particular notice what things he took away—I had seen him once before that day—I saw some bills found in a box—Grant said, "What, more master's bills? you had better burn them, they will only go hard against you"—I am sure it was Grant that said that—Perez said, "Me no burn"—Grant handed the bills to Healey, and Healey put them into Perez's hande—nothing further was said—I did not hear Healey say or do any thing—I was in the room the whole time they were—I then went for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with young Healey—we went over Waterloo-bridge—Grant then hallooed out of the window, to know the nearest station to where this occurred; I said, "Garlick-hill"—Garlick-hill is about a minute's walk from the Crown and Sceptre—I heard the charge made by the defendant at the station—he said, as he was passing from Cheapside down Old Change, a tall stout gentleman stopped him, and said there was a party in the Crown and Sceptre selling stolen property—Perez then placed the bills in the inspector's hands—the inspector said they alluded to the property that was taken—Perez spoke such broken English that very few parties could understand him—the inspector said he could not take it as a charge of felony, and asked what charge he would prefer against him—he said, "Selling goods without a licence"—the inspector asked if he had any witnesses; he said, his brother-constable—an excise officer was sent for—he came and looked at the tobacco and cigars—he said they were English make, and there was no case for him at all—he was then bailed, and went before the Magistrate next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an export-oilman. On 31st Oct. I called at Perez's lodging, about seven o'clock in the evening, and asked him for a box of cigars—he said he had not got them then, the warehouse was closed; and if I called next evening, at seven, I could have them—I went at seven next evening, and gave him four half-crowns—he went up stairs to put his coat on, and said he would come out and give me change—I knew that the cigars came from Mr. Newton's—I had bought several boxes of him before—I have never been to Mr. Newton's—I did not like walking about the street, and I went round to the" Crown and Sceptre for some few minutes—Perez came there, and put the cigars down on the counter at the bar—I had given Perez the four half-crowns, and he was to give me a shilling change—he brought in the box of cigars, and gave me ls.—he asked me if I should like to look at them—I said, "Yes," and he opened the box, and said they were good—I was present when the defendant came in—the first thing he did was to come up and ask Perez if he had a license for selling those cigars.—Perez answered as well as he could that he was selling them fur his employer, Mr. Newton—he did</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, of High-street, Tottenham. I had some printed cotton, which I saw safe inside my shop on 8th Nov.—a policeman came and gave me some information, and I missed a shawl—the policeman produced it, and a piece of print—I identified them—I had seen them both about an hour and a half before—I had not missed them—these are them—here is the mark on the shawl.</p>

I had this piece of printed cotton on a pile in the shop—it was safe in the course of the day, and I missed it—when the policeman brought the shawl, he said he had two persons in custody—I went and identified the prisoner as having been twice in my shop—she was searched, and this print was found on her—it has my private mark on it—I only know by repute that she is the wife of Edward Hagger—they have always passed as "man and wife—they have two children, and occupy a house—my firm belief is that this print and the shawl were taken at the same time "hen the prisoner was waiting to be served—my young man desired her to go to another part of the shop.</p>

On Wednesday, 22nd Nov., about half-past three o'clock a.m. the afternoon, I saw h-r going out with a bundle under her shawl—I had not then seen her baby—I knew she had been confined—I saw her again about seven in the evening, sitting by the fire—she went into Mrs. O'Lrary's room, and I heard the old lady say that her daughter had left a good fire, and to go in and go to bed, for she must feel very ill—she asked her what she had done with her baby, whether she had put it to wet-nurse or dry-nurse—she said she had put it to dry-nurse—I went out, and spoke to a policeman, and afterwards went to the station and fetched a police-sergeant—I returned with him, and he and my husband went upstairs—I do not exactly recollect the time, it might have been between eight and nine in the evening—I believe the sergeant left about ten—I went to bed about half-past eleven, and passed the prisoner's door—I went into the prisoner's room, and found the prisoner's box corded, and the prisoner up and dressed—I asked her what she had done with her baby—she said she had taken it to 4, Dock—head, to Mrs. Bell—I asked what sort of person she was—she said she was an Irishwoman, and her husband English—I asked her what she was to give to the person for nursing her baby—she said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and she afterwards said that her Ellen's nurse would try to get it into the Foundling Hospital for her, and, if not, she would take it to its father—she began to cry, and said she had milk, and would suckle her baby if she had but got it—I told her I would call my husband down stairs, and he should go and fetch it—I called him, and she told him to go to 4, Dock—head—before he came back, she said she did not see why me and Mrs. Burns should sit up to watch her—she wished Mrs. Burns to go to bed, for she had said she would tear her to pieces—she cried, and said she wished she had a friend—I told her I would befriend her in anything that I could—she said she wished she could get out of the house that night—she said she had gone out of the house, and walked as far as the Three Nuns, in Whitechapel; while waning for a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, she sent a little boy with a white pinafore for a pennyworth of syrup of poppies, and two drops of laudanum; she gave part to the baby, and the other part she put into her own mouth; and she then went to Dock—head, to see if she could find Mrs. Bell, who had taken her Ellen to nurse; that she could not, and asked two or three women to take her baby, but none would take it without money—she said she then went to Hyde-park, and sat down; (she did not say how she got there); that she went to the first turning past St. George's Hospital, up a mews, and sat down, and put the baby on her lap, and got up, and walked away with the baby; that the devil tempted her, and she went back again, took the shawl off the baby, and laid it on its side down on the (dunghall, and put her handkerchief over its face, and spread its little bedgown out in hopes of some of the ostlers picking it up, and taking it to</p>

On Wednesday evening, 22nd Nov., about nine o'clock, I was called to 3, Plumrner's-row, and saw the prisoner in bed—she told me she had been confined—I asked her where the child was—she said at Mrs. Bell's, 4, Dock—head, which is at Bermondsey—I went there and made inquiries, but could find no Mrs. Bell there, or in the neighbourhood—I returned next morning and told the prisoner that what she had said was not true—she then told me that she had taken the child to Dock—head, but could not find Mrs. Bell; that she went in an omnibus to Hyde Park-corner, went down the first turning past St. George's Hos<lb/>pital, and laid it down on a dung—heap; that it was then alive; that she had given it some syrup of poppies and some laudanum to compose it, and she left it there and covered a handkerchief over it—it is five miles from Plum<lb/>mer's-row to Hyde Park-corner—this was a cold damp night.</p>

On Thursday morning, 23rd Nov., a little after six o'clock, I was going along Belgrave-mews, East—I had'occasion to go to the dang heap there, and saw something white lying—I got over, and found the body of a female child lying on a heap of ashes, not covered by anything, nor concealed—it was quite dead—any one having occasion to look into the dung-hole would see it—it is an enclosed place at the back of Lord Combermere's house, bricked up ten feet high, and slanting down to about three feet and a half—the mews is a thoroughfare.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the dead body of a female child on 24th Nov., in the dead-bouse at Mount-street Workhouse—it was pointed out to me by the porter—I saw that body afterwards identified at the Inquest—I examined it, with the view to ascertain the cause of death—I found no indication of poison in the stomach, or anything there that would occasion death—if the child had been exposed, as has been stated, for several hours during the night, I think that would have been sufficient to have caused its death, and would account for the appearances that were ex<lb/>hibited on the previous examination.</p>

I know not what to do; something must be done!"—I said, "We had better send for a doctor"—she said, "What is the use of sending for a doctor, as she is dead; it is only a needless expense," or words to that effect—I felt that her pulse had ceased, and she was quite cold—the prisoner then said, "I left her early in the morn<lb/>ing, with directions to mend a pair of stays and a pair of stockings, which she had neglected to do; I then went out to my work, and on returning, at half-past eleven in the forenoon, I found nothing had been done, and on asking the reason why it had not been done, the girl said she had sat down, and gone to sleep; I said I am determined you shall not sit down and sleep, for you shall stand and do your work, for I will tie you to the bedpost, and you shall have nothing but dry bread to eat until it is done"—she then said, "I took a rope, and put it round and round her neck, and then round the head-post of the bed, and made it fast to the foot-post;" and she said, "I put a chair near her, with her work on the chair, and went out to my work, lock<lb/>ing the door and putting the key under the mat; on returning at night, about half-past ten, I found her in a stooping position, dead"—I then said, "This is a very serious case, and there must be an inquest held; the death must be registered, and, as there was no witness to the death, a doctor's cer<lb/>tificate will be required"—I forgot to state that she said, "I tied the rope to the foot-post slack, but not so slack as she might get her chin through"—she said she did that in order to keep her from sitting down to so to sleep.</p>

I was called in on Friday night to see the child—I found a deep discoloured inden<lb/>tation, extending across the middle of the neck right round from one side to the other—a rope tied tight round the neck, or with the pressure upon it before death, would have caused such a mark—I attribute the death to suffo<lb/>cation by strangulation with the rope—if the rope had been tied round her neck and fastened to a bed-post, and she had sunk from exhaustion and so been strangled, that would have produced the marks I found.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could you tell from the appearance of the body how long she had been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; for I did not examine it for three days after—I found very little food in the stomach—I could not tell what it was—it was digested food, like gruel—there were no marks of violence upon the body—the indentation on the neck was deeper on the right side than on the front—I do not think it could have been produced after death—Betts' Medical Jurisprudence is a work of great authority on the subjects on which it treats—the appearances of persons suffocated are very various—the arteries and vessels of the brain are generally congested, and the brain itself presents a number of small red spots when cut into, apparently resembling extrava<lb/>sation—I examined the brain; it was not so highly congested as I should have expected from my reading—my experience is not so great as to enable me to make frequent comparisons—it is not usual to find so large an amount of congestion in the brain of a person not dying from suffocation—the lungs of a person dying from suffocation are generally full of blood and dark-coloured fluid, and the body of the lungs filled with air from rupture of the</p>

               <p>air-cells—I examined the heart; the right ventricle and right auricle were full of fluid and dark-coloured blood—if a rope is placed round the neck of a person not very tightly, it is likely to produce a tendency to apoplexy—drowsiness is one symptom of apoplexy—it is difficult to say how long a girl of this age could remain in an upright position without exhaustion—it would depend very much on her previous habits—some are soon exhausted—I should say a girl of a hardy constitution might continue five or six hours without sinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Daniels and Payne, of 29, Upper Thames-street, iron-merchants—Clark was in their employ—he was to deliver iron according to the papers or orders that came in—before he delivered it he had to enter it. On 6th Dec. an order was brought from Perry and Sons by Rackham—I did not see it delivered—I was in the shop-when he came—I saw Clark have the order—in five or ten minutes afterwards Clark sent me to fetch such iron as was wanted for Messrs. Perry's order—I brought various sizes, and put them in the scale—Clark helped me—the iron was put in the cart—I cannot say what it weighed—it should have been entered on the board—I cannot say whether Clark entered it—Clark then sent me for eight bars of mitre-iron—it was brought, put in the scale, and then in the cart—Rackham was then standing against the scale—I saw the cart driven out of the place by the carman—Rackham did not go with it; he went in after his bill—I cannot say what became of him then—after the eight bars were put in the cart I went down to fetch up other iron that was on the orders—I went the next day to the Vine-yard, Bishopsgate-street, and found eight bars of mitre-iron—I could not say whether they were those I had put in the cart—they were the same size, and had the mitre mark on them.</p>

I saw this order on the file when it was executed—it was the duty of the man who weighed the iron to put the order on the file, and chalk it on the board—Clark chalked this order on the board—the order is in the writing that I have always understood to be Perry and Sons—I saw a cart which came from Perry's with iron on it, driven by the carman they had hired—I did not see Rackham when the cart was driven away—I saw him while it was there standing by the scale, and some iron was being shifted from the scale to the cart—I did not look at it—the iron chalked on the board corresponds with the iron in the order, with the exception of one size—7-8ths was sent for 7-16ths—there was no entry on the board of eight bars of mitre iron, either on that day or the next, as being sent to Perry and Son—it was the person's duty who brought the order and took away the iron to sign a receipt for it—this book is signed by Rackham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the brig <hi rend="italic">Lemuel</hi>, and was so in July and August last. In July I was on the high seas, off the Gold Coast of Africa—from "26th July to 8th August, I received nine boxes of gold-dust, to bring to England as freight—one of them was from Mr. Andrew Swanzi—during the month of August, and during the time I received those boxes I was confined to my room at Elmina, through sickness—I placed the boxes in the corner of my room, where I was confined to my bed, and afterwards gave them to the second mate, Price—I gave him eight boxes on the 9th, and one on 10th Aug.—I gave him directions to take them en board, with the keys of my <hi rend="italic">state-room</hi>, and to unlock the larboard lockers in the cabin, and put them in there—I had the key of the state-room with me, and the keys of the cabin-lockers were in the state-room—Price brought back the key I had given him—according to the bills of lading there were 1, 755 ounces of gold-dust, to the value of about 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 11th Aug., about half-past nine o'clock a.m. the morning, I received a note from Price—the ship was then in Elmina Roadstead—I went to the Governor of Elmina Castle, and afterwards went on board the ship—the larboard lockers were then broken open, and the whole nine boxes abstracted—I missed a box containing two gold watches from the same locker; two chronometers, worth about 103 guineas, from the library; the cabin dial, north about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and four cutlasses—two guns were taken out of the cabin, and were found on the upper deck—two boxes of cigars, belonging to me were gone, and my boat also, which was worth thirty-two guineas, and was the only serviceable one belonging to the brig—I had not seen any of the prisoners at Cormantine—Powell was first mate officer of the <hi rend="italic">Lemuel</hi>; the other two were seamen—the next day I went to Cape Coast Castle, and saw the prisoners in custody, and found the two chronometers, the gold-dust, and the cigars there.</p>

On 27th Nov., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the Hampstead-road with some officers, to attend a soldier's funeral at St. James's Chapel—I found a great many persons there—it was my duty to keep a thoroughfare for the soldiers to pass and repass to the chapel—a disturbance took place—there was hallooing, shouting, and throwing stones at me and my brother officers, and threatening to do us some injury—I heard a man say he would do for one of the constables—I felt a rap on the head with something, I could not tell what—I fell down—it made me insensible—when I came to myself, I found myself in a chemist's shop, and the blood running from my eye—I thought I had lost the sight of my eye—I was taken by two officers to Mr. Collins', and after that I was under the police-surgeon—I was ten davs before I could do duty.</p>

About three o'clock, on Monday, 27th Nov., Sergeant Wilkes was brought to my surgery—he was rather cold, and almost insensible—he was not aware where he was—his pulse was very low—he was almost in a state of collapse—I found a small wound between the eyelid and the external angle of the right eye—the skin was broken—the wound might be dangerous—it appeared mare to have affected the brain—it might have been caused by a stone—the ball of the eye was not injured—I suppose it produced the effect from the violence with which it was thrown.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 84). On 24th Nov., between four and five o'clock, I was on duty in Deptford Broadway with another constable, and saw the prisoner Smith loitering about a linen-draper's shop window which adjoins Mr. Armitage's—after she had been there a considerable time Gates came out, and commenced cleaning the door-plates—Smith went up to him, and they were in conversation some time—she then left, and was loitering about for nearly three-quarters of an hour—she came again, and loitered about the front of the shop, passing up and down, and looking in, and at last, when the shop was clear, she went in—I immediately went to the window, and there saw Gates supply her with some rashers of bacon—she did not pay for them—Gates opened the till and gave her a piece of silver, which I believe to be a shilling, and some coppers—she had not given any money for which that could have been change—she then came out—I saw her go into the shop five different times that evening, but I only saw her get something on the first and last occasion—she cot some cheese the last time, which she did not pay for; I am sure of that—I was within three yards of her—the counter was between us—I saw the till opened distinctly—Smith went into two or three public-houses during the evening, where she got some spirits and water—after she was supplied with the cheese she came back again to the shop—it was then shut up—she walked about a considerable time,. then stooped down and looked through the key-hole, and then walked away for about sixty yards, and then ran towards Deptford Railway station, from where she went up to London by the last train—I followed her in the same train, and when she got out at London-bridge she crossed the road, went through the Borough-market, Bankside, across Blacfriars-road, to Cornwall-road, Lambeth, went into 68, and up into the back bed-room—I followed close after her, and asked if she lived there, and what her name was—she said that was no business of mine—I said, "I am a police-officer, and I wish to know"—(I was in plain clothes)—she again said it was no busi<lb/>ness of mine, and she should not tell me—I said, "The fact is I have been watching you for some considerable time; I wish to know what you have in your basket"—she said it was no business of mine—I said, "I insist on knowing'—she said, "What I have got there is my own; I bought and paid for them, "and she produced some bacon, butter, cheese, and eggs—I asked where she got them—she said the bacon and butter at the Marsh-gate, and the cheese and eggs in the New-cut—I said, "You did nothing of the sort; the fact is you are charged with stealing these articles from the shop of Mr. Armitage, a cheesemonger, in Broadway, Deptford"—I then asked if she knew a young man living there—she said she did not, and she did not get them from Deptford; she did not know where Deptford was—I said, "Why you have just come from Deptford by the railway"—she said, "You are a Use speaking man: I was never there in my life"—I then took her to Green<lb/>wich station, went and took Gates, and at the station put them together, and said to Gates, "You are charged with stealing these articles; do you know this woman?"—he said, "I do; I have served her with these things"—she said, "Is is false"—he said it was not; that he had supplied her with goods before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, of Camberwell-green. The prisoner was my clerk, and had been so several years—it was his duty to receive money paid at the counting-house from the draymen, who might collect it in the course of their rounds, and from customers who called to pay—it was his duty to keep a day-book, cash-book, and ledger—when goods went out it was hisduty to enter them in the day-book, and also to enter in the day-book and cash-book all moneys received—it was his duty to enter money in the day-book as soon as it was paid, and in the course of the day to enter all he had received in the cash-book—I used to look at both books, and it was from them that I received information of the receipts—I balanced the day-book every week, and ascertained whether the cash-book corresponded with it, and if I did I put my initials to them, as correct—it was his duty to keep the ledger—that was posted from the day-book—both goods and money would appear there—if carried from the day-book into the ledger, it would be carried to the different customers' accounts—sometimes I examined the ledger and the day-book, but at other times the prisoner and the boy in the office did—I did not examine the ledger so frequently as the day-book—if goods appeared in the ledger which were not paid, I should send to the customer at the usual time for the amount—I send in the bills every three months—they were made out on the accounts appearing due in the ledger—the prisoner left on 3rd Oct.—before that I bad balanced the cash-book with him—he did not mention any sums of money but those that appeared there—after he left I looked at all the books, and made extracts from the ledger—this is a list made from a longer list, which I made firs:—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one list has been destroyed, and two preserved—the one from which this was made is destroyed—I showed this one to the prisoner, and also the others—I sent for him on 27th Oct., after I had examined the books—I then showed him this list—the day-book, the ledger, and cash-book were before me—I called his attention to these sums of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 8th March, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 22nd March, and 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 1st June—none of those items appeared in the cash or day-book—they appear by the ledger to have been paid—I pointed those out to him, with other sums—he appeired confused, and said he could not make out how it was that the sums were posted in the ledger, not being in the day-book, there must be some mistake—I asked if the cash in the cash-book</p>

               <p>agreed with the day-book always—he said it did—he looked through the cash and day-books, and I told him he had robbed me of the money, and that it was a serious charge—my brother, who is an attorney, was present—he told the prisoner he did not wish him to commit himself there, that if he would appoint his solicitor to meet him with me next morning at half-past nine o'clock, we would open the books to his inspection—he left shortly after writing a note to his solicitor—he commenced writing it on the back of an old letter—I handed him some note-paper, envelopes, and sealing-wax—he then wrote a note, sealed it, and took it away with him—about four o'clock, before I left, I locked up the books—the whole of them had been examined in the prisoner's presence—they were in the iron safe, close to the counting-house door—I received information in the course of the night, went to my premises about one in the morning, and found them in flames—the brewery and dwelling-house are entirely destroyed, and the premises adjoining the counting-house where the books were kept—one story below was saved, and the stables—in searching the premises 1 found some books, partly burnt, and some not burnt at all—two ledgers and part of a day-book are here—this is the ledger of 1848—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was perfect when I left it, on 27th—it is now partially destroyed by fire—the cash-book, in which these three accounts were, is totally destroyed—from March up to June inclusive are destroyed—I find no entry in the ledger of Bagsbaw's account, on 4th March—there is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Bagshaw's credit, on 8th March, as received, in the prisoner's writing—here is George Dollond's account, 22nd March, credit for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the prisoner's writing—there is no entry on 16th March—on 1st June credit is given to Baron's account for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Combe, Delafield, and Co-'s—I had then discovered several of the accounts that he had embezzled, and I avoided a direct answer, and said I would consider of it—I had gone through the accounts with Mr. Dance, and I showed some of them to my father—I had not gone through the whole; we only took the ledger from the day the prisoner left me backwards to 1st Jan., 1848—we there discovered 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd deficient in the prisoner's writing—on 25th Oct. the pri<lb/>soner offered to come to the premises and take out the book-debts—(after the bills are delivered to the customers, it was our habit to enter the whole amount of them in a book, to assist in the collection of them—that is what we call taking out the book-debts, taking out the amount due on the ledger into another book)—I thanked him, and said if I wanted him I would send for him.</p>

               <p>—I think I shook bands with the prisoner when I got out, I do not know that I did, I will not swear it—I really do not know whether I did or not—Mr. Turncy took me over the brewery, and the prisoner accompanied us—I asked him to come to the counting-house at two o'clock next day, to take out the book-debts, not to go through the accounts—I wanted him for the pur<lb/>pose of tolling him of those accounts which were irregular—I did not tell him so—I took a glass of ale with Mr. Turney before I left—the prisoner asked me to taste some ale—I did so—I think it was of his brewing—Mr. Tur<lb/>ney and he were together—I tasted several casks of beer—I think the pri<lb/>soner said they were his brewing—I said I thought they were very good—I did not tell him one word about the embezzlement I had found out—I should have thought he would not have come, if I had—he came according to appoint<lb/>ment—my solicitor was there—I had not told the prisoner the day before, that I would have my solicitor there—my brother suggested that the prisoner should come on a future occasion, provided with his own solicitor—one of the dray<lb/>men's books of 1848 was produced on that occasion—there are two draymen's books relating to this day-book, and two relating to the other—one of those books was produced at this interview—the other the drayman had out—I do not know whether those of the second ledger were out, but they did not refer to this—there has been no indictment preferred against the prisoner for the first item on this paper, "Gale, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 29 May"—I swear there was no entry of that 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the day-book or in the cash-book—I entered into con<lb/>versation with the prisoner about it—from that item we went to Crowder's, which was next—I swear I have no entry in any of my books of the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as paid to myself—I did not direct the prisoner to make an entry of it in the ledger in his own writing—I swear I never directed him to do anything of the sort—there were cross accounts between me and Gale—he is a cork-cutter, and sup<lb/>plied me—I do not recollect my brother "saying, "What do you propose to do about the errors?" when the prisoner said on referring to his book that there were errors somewhere—I did not see the prisoner endeavouring to extricate the horses at the fire—I saw him there—I do not know that he was wet, or that he was endeavouring to extinguish it, for I gave him in charge as soon as I saw him; I was hunting him out—he did not come up to me with Dance and say, "This is a dreadful affair, Sir, "or anything of the sort—he was taken before the Magistrate next morning—I believe he was not remanded on the charge of arson, but discharged; as there was not sufficient evidence; but as he was leaving the Court, the charge of embezzlement was made, and a remand was granted—part of Mr. Branch, his father-in-law's, premises abut on mine—he did not live there—part of his furniture was on my premises in a little back room of the dwelling-house, at the back of the counting-house, which was burnt down—I was insured—I had four ledgers; two are here relating to the private trade, and two relating to the public-house trade are destroyed—I am able to show from this book what my debts are—I did not apply for a remand on the arson case in order to have an investigation before the Coroner: I think my brother, who managed the case, mentioned it, and the Magistrate thought it would be a very good plan—I know Mr. De Pledge very well; I never told him the brewery was a d----d expensive concern, and I wished it was burnt down—I had four ledgers, three day-books, and a cash-book—I had a private cash-book, ledger, and journal; there were dray<lb/>man's books besides, and load-books, which the beer was booked into—some<lb/>times, when the goods were entered in the day-book, the drayman would receive the money and enter it in his book, the name of the drayman would appear in the cash-book—there are four draymen; one is named Moore—</p>

               <p>when the prisoner comes home, he enters the gross amount received from the draymen in the cash-book., in the draymans name—the dravrmn would bring his book and call out the names, and the prisoner booked it into the day-book; the draymen's books were made out by districts—it might happen that a drayman in one district would receive a sum for another; that would go down in the day book on the day in which he received it—the voucher given by the drayman to the customer is the receipted bill signed by himsell—it may have occurred that a receipt has been signed by the drayman before he went out, but not to my knowledge—when I received money, I never told the prisoner to give a receipt for it—if he gave the receipt, he took the money—I may have taken it from a customer's hand and given it him if he receipted the bill—I never told him <hi rend="italic">to give</hi> a receipt, and put the money into my) pocket—I had a customer at Lambeth Workhouse—I have frequently received 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there, it was always by cheque—I cross the cheque, and generally take a receipt and write it there—I have not asked the prisoner to give a receipt, to my knowledge; I will not swear I have not—I have a lease of "The Fleece" public-house; a friend of the prisoner's, had it, who died: the prisoner had lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the widow did not wish to continue the house, I bought it of her—I allowed the prisoner to let the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remain; I owed it him—I paid him by a cheque on 17th Jan.—he had not an interest in the house—he has made no further claim against me—I do not know that a message was sent to Hunt, to ask whether she had paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or not, she is the person who pays for Mr. Dollond—the prisoner did not mention that to me when the lists were produced—I receive from 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 13000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the year, a large portion of which would pass through the prisoner's hands.</p>

                  </hi>.—On the Friday evening, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw Coe and Jones at the Pelican stairs—I found the ware-house open, and foot-marks—I found, beside the red wheat in the warehouse, three sacks containing white wheat; one was marked "Husband," one "Langdale," and the other, "Palmer"—I have here a sample taken from each sack; they were all one quality—I took Coe and Jones in my boat to Hayes-road—I said to Coe, "There is a barge there;" lie said, "That is not ours, that is Brown and Young's barge"—I said, "Well, I will have a look at her"—I <hi rend="italic">went</hi>, and saw a quantity of wheat scattered abaft the hatch<lb/>way—I removed the after hatch first, and there was a great hollow, I should say from two to three sacks Had been taken out—I removed the fore hatch,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180093"/>
               <p>and there appeared about a sack gone from there—there was no one on the barge—Coe said his barge was gone up; I went after it, and found Hamilton there—I found in the pockets of Coe and Jones, grains of red and white wheat—there was a boat moored against the barge, in which I first saw Coe standing—I found grains of wheat scattered over the state-room of the boat, and likewise over the thwarts—it was white wheat, as far as Ljcould judge; it appeared only to have been a short time there.</p>
