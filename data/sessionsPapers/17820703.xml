On the 22d of May, between the hours of six and seven in the evening, the three prisoners at the bar came into the shop, and asked to look at some thread lace edging; I was at the further end of the shop; one of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030003"/> bought something, and then they all went out together. Mr. Kendrick immediately stepped into the shop, and asked us if we had lost any thing; upon examination we missed two cards of lace; I followed them to the Black-Horse. When I got there, Davis pulled out of her pocket two cards of lace, and put them on the fire. This (producing it) I took off the fire; the other was burnt. I am certain this is our property, for there are marks in my own hand-writing upon it; I know it was in my shop that day. Delaney whispered to Wilson, upon which Wilson ran down stairs, and Davis ran up stairs, but Delaney herself staid in the room.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner secrete three pieces of lace; I told Mr. Watridge of it. When the prisoner was brought back, she was taken down stairs into the kitchen; she let me search one of her pockets; I did not find any thing in that; she refused to let me search her any further: she said she had but one pocket on. As I still persisted in charging her with having secreted some lace, Mr. Watridge insisted upon having her searched thoroughly; then we took her up into the dining-room; my master's mother, the maid servant, and myself, went with her; one piece of lace dropped from her up stairs, and we found the other pieces of lace under her stays, and the ribbons in her other pocket.</p>

On Thursday night, the 14th of June, about half after two o'clock, Fish and Hopkins brought Mahen to the watch-house, with the bag of things, and the stitch of bacon. Mahen said Jones was concerned, and had the watch. In the evening, the prosecutor and Dempsey came to the justice's; she mentioned the marks of the things before she saw them. Dempsey said he had lost a blue great coat; I remembered Mahen having one on that did not seem to fit him; I went to the New Prison, and took the coat off his back. We took Jones at his lodging, on the Tuesday following. I asked him what became of the watch they took from the place where they got the bacon: he said it was gone to hell .</p>
               <p>JONES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going to work early in the morning; I saw Mahen standing at the corner of an alley with the bacon and bag of things: he said he was going to Whitechapel. The watchman came up, and asked him, where he got that property; he said he found it: they stopped him, and I went to my work.</p>
               <p>MAHEN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I got up early on Friday morning, to go to work; and in Farthing-fields, I found this bacon, and bag of things. I told the watchman, when they stopped me, that I found them. They said, I must go to the watch-house; I said, I would not, and ran away. They pursued me, and took me: Jones is very innocent of the affair.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday night, the 19th of June, I was going from Berkeley-street, Portman-square, to Highgate. I went to New Norfolk-street, and staid, as I intended to go in the stage; but I was too late for the stage, so I was obliged to walk. When I was walking along the second field from Kentish-Town, a boy, who was lying down in the grass, started up: he said nothing to me, but passed me, and ran fast up the field. He was dressed in a brown coat, and a brown linen apron; his hat was pushed back from his face, so that I had a perfect view of his face.</p>
               <p>Are you certain the prisoner is the person? - I believe him to be the man; he is very much like the man . When I came to the middle of the field, the prisoner stood before me; he made a horrid noise, and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030006"/> he seized me by the throat with both his hands, and swore that if I was not quiet, he would kill me. He held me fast by one arm, and with the other he felt into both my pockets: he took out three handkerchiefs, and some silver; and he likewise took a bundle, which had in it four pair of dimity pockets, a linen apron, and 9 s. in money. He wa nted to take my cloak off, upon which I screamed out, and he ran away. (The wearing apparel was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) I saw these things a day or two after in Litchfield-street .</p>
               <p>Do you swear positively to the prisoner? - It was a light night; I saw his face very plain: he kept me a great while; I believe him to be the person. I saw him afterwards at the office in Litchfield-street; he was in the parlour, along with other persons. I was desired to point out the man that robbed me; I pointed out the prisoner. I desired one of the people there, to ask him for a locket he stole from me; the prisoner immediately asked me, if it was wrapped in white lawn paper. I said, Yes. He said, he was sorry he had thrown it away; he said he was very drunk, and begged my pardon; but he appeared to be quite sober when he robbed me.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner very well. As I was passing through Soho-square, in company with Macdonald, the next morning after the prosecutrix was robbed, we met the prisoner with a bundle; we stopped him, and asked him what he had got; he said, Nothing, but an apron and a petticoat. I insisted upon seeing the contents of the bundle; he resisted that. After some altercation, and giving him several blows, he submitted to let us search the bundle; we found in it the things which have been produced: we found this brown linen apron (producing it) in his pocket.</p>

On the day Mr. Lewis's house was robbed, I saw the prisoner walk by Mr. Lewis's door two or three times; and he made a full stop, and looked at Mr. Lewis's child, which was then sitting at the door. He walked to Cross-court, which leads into Broad-court; then he walked back to Mr. Lewis's, and looked into the window. He made a full stop; and then he pushed open the door, and went into the house. I never saw him come out again. I thought the prisoner might have been a sweetheart to one of the maids. In about ten minutes after I saw the prisoner, I heard of the robbery.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross-examination, he said he was at his master's garret-window when he saw the prisoner in Broad-court; that he saw the prisoner's face very plain; that he described the man's person, and his dress; in consequence of which the prisoner was apprehended some weeks after.)</p>

               <p>On the 13th of May, I went to the prosecutor's, to spend the evening with some friends. We had the silver tankard before us, and drank out of it several times. We all went away together, except Mr. Keeling. The tankard was before him, when we went away. We parted company at the end of Chancery-lane. Just as we had parted, Mr. Keeling overtook me. His coat was buttoned, and he had his hand in his pocket. I did not observe that he had any thing, as I had no suspicion. I never heard any thing amiss of him before.</p>

I took hold of the little girl.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is the prisoner? - Yes; I am. She struggled, and got out of my hand. I called the watch to my assistance.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - The clock had struck twelve. In about five or ten minutes after I called Watch! the officer of the night came, and took the girl. When she was in custody of the constable, I left her at the watch-house, and went home about my business.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A gold one, enamelled; the outside case was metal. I have never seen the watch since.</p>

             was. He said, he lived at Dartford; he was agent to Mr. Cook, who kept the lime-kilns at Dartford, and that he kept his cash at Mr. Drummond's, at Charing-cross. I took the note; and upon the strength of this note, Mr. Smith and Mr. Kinnersley trusted him with 30 l. more. Some little time before that, about a fortnight, I believe, I went to enquire at Messrs. Drummond's, whether the note was good or not. They said, they knew nothing of any such person.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that to be the same note you received? - I saw the prisoner indorse his name upon the back of it. (The note read.)</p>

               <p>Has not Mr. Smith commenced an action against the prisoner, for the balance of his account? - He has commenced an action for his debt.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether this note is included in that demand against him in the Common Pleas? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Did you make out that bill? - I did; it was 50 l.</p>

               <p>Was this note part of that account - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the action upon the note, or goods sold? - Upon goods sold.</p>
               <p>Did he say, at any time, that he knew Jones, and that he was frequently in town? - Yes, he said, he dealt largely with him; very largely: he often came to his house, and he had been there the day before I called last time, to let him know where the note was.</p>

On Wednesday, the 17th of March, I apprehended both the prisoners; I went to a corner house in Wardour-street; after being there some time, and telling my business, the prisoners came down stairs, with their hands in their pockets: I was apprehensive that they were armed, at that time, and therefore I let them pass by me. As soon as they were got out into the street, I made a hue-and-cry; upon which they drew their hands out of their pockets, and then I saw they had a pistol in each hand. They were pursued, and taken. When we came to Bow-street, I searched them; I found, upon Joseph, four Bank post-bills, a 100 l. a 70 l. a 40 l. another, 33 l. 14 s. and a lottery-ticket, No. 28,257.</p>

He said, that if the master of the house was there, he thought he would not take it. He called me. I said it was what we always had.

               <p>Please to look at that note, and inform the court and jury whether that was one of the notes forwarded by you to London by the mail? - This was a note forwarded by me to London, by the mail, on Saturday the 27th of January, 1781. This is No. T 1062, 40 l. There were three others, T 1060, T 1061, and T 1063, of the same date and tenour .</p>
               <p>Please to look at this note, and see whether that is one you forwarded also? - I believe it is; but the number has been altered since.</p>
               <p>What alteration has been made in the number? - Here is an addition of a 0 to it; the original number was T 1063; it appears now T 10630.</p>
               <p>That alteration is made by putting a 0 after the figures? - It is.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say whether it was one of the bills you forwarded to London? - I believe it is; but, the number being altered, it does not appear as before.</p>
               <p>What reason have you for believing it? - I have a copy in my pocket, that I took of the bills, which corresponds with these. I believe I have left it in my great-coat pocket, in the other room. I have examined it, and every thing corresponds but the 0, which clearly is an addition.</p>
               <p>What is there that induces you to think this was not 10630, when the bill was originally issued at the Bank? - Because the date and sum agree with the other, and the 0 appears to me to be added since the bill was sent from my house. My memorandum is, Bank post-bill, No. T 1063, dated January 16th, 1781, payable to

               <p>Do you remember any person coming to your office, in order to buy lottery-tickets? - On the 23d of November, in the evening, there came a gentleman about this ticket, (No. 28,257.)</p>
               <p>Can you tell who the person was that came? - In the midst of business, we are very thronged; to the best of my recollection, it was

               <p>How did he pay for the ticket? - He gave me 100 l. Bank post-bill; I had not cash enough in the till, to give the change myself. I took it to Mr. Branscomb, and said, I wanted change for this 100 l. note. He gave me three 25 l. bank notes, and bid me make the rest up in cash, which I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever seen the prisoner Joseph before? - Not before that night.</p>
               <p>You must have a vast number of people come to your office, I imagine? - A vast many. In the course of a week or eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030018"/> days, the same gentleman came again, and wanted another ticket; I took one out of the till, the only one I had at the time. I said, I had only one ticket; if you are not partial to any number, this is undrawn: he said something, he was not particular about the number. He took out of his pocket a little red Morocco pocket-book, and opened it, but he did not take any bill out of the book. I happened to cast my eye upon him, and when he saw that I looked at him, he turned away from the counter, clapped his hand upon his thigh, and said, I have left my purse in some place he mentioned. He immediately retired from the office, and did not buy the ticket, nor did not offer me a bill at that time.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he was the same person that you took the bill of? - I really believe him to be the same person; it struck me, the second time, that he was the same person.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you now certain, or not, whether he was the person that came the second time? - I am sure he is the person that came the second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether he was the person that came the first time, or not, you are not positive? - Not so positive; but I believe so .</p>
               <p>You have looked at the ticket? - Yes, I know the ticket.</p>
               <p>You are sure that ticket was sold at your office? - I am sure that is the ticket, because I indorsed it myself.</p>

               <p>What is he? - He was a clerk in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Do you know his hand-writing? - Very well .</p>
               <p>Is that his hand-writing? - I am satisfied it is not.</p>
               <p>Was that note issued by the Bank? - It was, but was not accepted by Mr. Lateward, nor any other clerk at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>You have seen Mr. Lateward write? - Yes, I fancy, a thousand times .</p>
               <p>What induces you to swear that it is your opinion that this is not Mr. Lateward's hand-writing? - He wrote a very good free hand, and that is a stiff laboured hand.</p>
               <p>Is there no similitude between this and the manner of his writing his name? - I cannot perceive that there is any in the cut of the letters.</p>
               <p>Can you point out the difference? - Mr. Lateward wrote a free easy hand.</p>
               <p>This appears to be a very free easy hand; is it not? - It does not appear so to me.</p>
               <p>Then it is mere matter of opinion? - I am satisfied it is not his writing.</p>
               <p>Don't you know, that men, writing sometimes with one pen, sometimes another, write more or less alike? - They may.</p>
               <p>Is there any difference in this, as to the turn of the letters? - Mr. Lateward would have written a better hand with a worse pen, even almost with a skewer.</p>
               <p>Can you point out a difference, as to the turn of any of the letters? - The N in Number is made different.</p>
               <p>I am asking you as to the acceptance? - The letters may have the same turns.</p>
               <p>You are of opinion that the letters in the name have the same turns? - They may.</p>
               <p>Then all that induces you to swear as to the difference, is, that this is written rather stiffer than Mr. Lateward usually wrote his name? - A great deal.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Upon the whole of your observation, do you, upon your oath, believe it to be Mr. Lateward's handwriting or not? - I do not believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Do you know the person of the prisoner? have you ever seen him? - I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Look at that bill: do you recollect having seen that bill any where before? and relate to the court and jury the circumstances attending it. - This bill was presented at a lottery-office in Holborn, where I was at the last lottery, by a person that wanted to insure.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on what day? - No: it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030024"/> was about the middle of the drawing of the lottery. I was standing near the person that he gave it to: I looked at it: I saw the acceptance was a forgery: I told him it was. I happened to look over that person he gave it to. Being acquainted with Mr. Lateward's hand-writing, it struck me immediately to be a forgery: I said so at the time.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that produced that bill? - I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - Not much doubt; indeed, not any doubt.</p>
               <p>Upon your making that observation, that the acceptance of Lateward was a forgery, what was said? - The prisoner seemed a little affronted, I thought, and told me, It was not. I told him, I was well acquainted with the hand-writing, and was positive it was. He said, If we did not like it, we were not obliged to take it; and he went away with it immediately.</p>
               <p>Upon seeing it now, are you of the same opinion you were then, that this is not Mr. Lateward's hand-writing? - Yes, I am very clear that it is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you belonged to the Bank? - About ten years.</p>
               <p>How comes it that you are so very conversant with the hand-writing of Mr. Lateward? - I did business with him for a long time at the same book.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Lateward's name upon that bill? - The name of Mr. Lateward is; but it is not his writing, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Are not the letters there turned in the same kind of way that Mr. Lateward usually wrote his name? - There may be some similitude in the turnings: he wrote a very fine free hand: the initial letters he used to cast with a pen in a very free and easy manner.</p>
               <p>How long did you belong to this lottery-office? - I assisted in the evening at a lottery-office in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Then it was in the evening that the prisoner brought that bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it an office where a great deal of business was done? - Pretty well: not so much as at many.</p>
               <p>There were a great concourse of people continually coming backwards and forwards in that office, were there not? - It was only a small office. There were a good many customers. I was only there to assist in the evenings.</p>

               <p>Which Weston? - The prisoner at the bar. Afterwards, the women went away in a great hurry, as if they were going a journey; they wanted a coach, and desired me to get one. I looked at the stand; there was none: I went to get one, but they were gone before I returned.

I was coming up Cock-lane, with a sack of peas, from the market, about eight o'clock, on the 2d of July; I cannot tell within half an hour, over or under: I was going to Silver-street, with a sack of peas, from Fleet-market. I was going up Cock-lane; that Gentleman (the prisoner) was running down. Some people were making a noise after him; he turned his head, and said, a parcel of fools were making a noise after him. Then the people cried out, Stop thief; upon which I threw the peas down off my knot, off my head, and went up to him, and catched hold of him with my left hand. He said, Let me by, or I will blow your brains out; he took an oath of it. He had no sooner spoke those words, but the pistol went off, over my arm; I turned my head on one side, but it wounded my neck and chin. I held him' till the people came up, and a gentleman knocked the pistol out of his hand, and took it up.</p>
               <p>What was you wounded with? - I apprehend, a ball.</p>
               <p>What makes you think it was a ball? - Because it took me in one place.</p>

               <p>Was you loaded when you laid hold of him? - I throwed my peas down off my knot, and laid hold of him.</p>

               <p>Do you suppose, at the time you stopped Weston, he had the pistol in his hand, or his pocket? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>It might be an accident, this pistol going off? - No, he said, he would blow my brains out, if I did not let him go.</p>

               <p>I am a broker. I heard the cry of Stop thief; I crossed the way. The prisoner was running; I made a catch at him, and had hold of his collar. He clapped a pistol to my forehead; I don't know whether it did not touch my forehead: with that, I turned myself round, and he got from me. He ran, and I followed him, 'till he was taken in Cock-lane by Davis; I was almost by Davis when he collared him. When Davis had hold of him, he took his hand up, and fired at him; whether any words passed I cannot say; he had it in his hand all the way he ran. I called to Davis, and told him he had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to fire at him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What report was it? - A very strong report, for so small a pistol. I came up, and knocked the pistol out of his hand; we secured him, and delivered him to the constable, Mr. Catchpole.</p>
               <p>CROSS EXAMINATION.</p>
               <p>At the time Davis met the prisoner, he had a sack on his back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The peas were on his back, and the collaring and firing were all at one time? - I cannot say that, whether he had thrown the peas off his back, or not.</p>
               <p>Whether the pistol going off was not in consequence of the sack of peas falling upon the man? - No, it was not; the peas fell on the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Are you confident, at the time these two men met, the sack of peas was, or was not, on Davis's back? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you, the pistol did not go off accidentally? - No, by pulling the trigger.</p>
               <p>Designedly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- CATCHPOLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I had this pistol (producing it) from the hands of Mr. Wallace: on Tuesday morning last, about a quarter after eight, a messenger came to tell me a man had shot at a person in Cock-lane .</p>

               <p>On the 28th of May, about three in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into my yard. Joseph went into the privy; when he was in the privy, he took a sheet off the line, and put it into a pocket in the inside of his coat; then he went into the skittle-ground, and stood about fifteen minutes, and then came out again, and took the other sheet off the line, and put it in his inside pocket on the other side. Then I went down and stopped him, and sent for a constable; he said, he should make no kind of defence; I should do what I would with him. When we had him in custody, the other prisoner, Joseph, came out of the privy; he said, he had no concern in stealing the property; that he only came into the yard to make use of the privy.</p>

On the 12th of June, about a quarter before ten o'clock, as I was coming through a field, near the New road, from my brother-in-law's, where I had been to measure him, I saw two men standing at a stile before me; they walked leisurely on, I walked on. When I came up to them, they each stopped on one side; I passed between them; I looked at each of them, and went on; they followed me over the next field; I thought they walked faster than they should do, upon which I mended my pace: then one of them ran, and overtook me; he seized me by my throat; threw me down, and then held me by my throat; the other put his knee upon my belly, and risled my pockets of what is mentioned in the indictment. Then one said to the other, Damn your eyes! come along; and pointed to shew me where my hat lay: they ran away. The prisoner held his hand to my throat, and his face was over me all the time they were rifling me. I had a better view of him than the other, but I should know the other if I saw him. I saw the prisoner next morning in a street in Ratcliffe-Highway . I went back that night, after I was robbed, to my brother-in-law's; we went to the field I was robbed in; we saw a man walking there; we asked him who he was: he said he was a friend; there was he and some more of Justice Sherwood's men. The next day we searched about, and saw a great many, but none answered the description; at last we saw three men walking on the other side of the street; they were all taken up; one I had no knowledge of, he was discharged immediately; the two others were carried before a magistrate; one of them was discharged, because I said I did not know the man. It was a light night; it lightened much: I could see distinctly the face of the person who stood over me; the prisoner I am positive is the man.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 3, Stepney-causeway. My husband is a rope-maker. The prisoner is a rope-maker, and was in my house, in the same room with me, on the 12th of June, from a little before nine in the evening till the watchman went eleven. I have known him upwards of six months, and never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your house near the New road, where this robbery was committed? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>A Spectator. It is about half a mile.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the time he came to your house? - It was at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>What makes you able to fix the time? - Nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>What did he come to your house for? - To ask how my husband did; my husband being sick a long time, and upon the sick book of the rope-makers: he was a-bed up stairs, and we were down stairs.</p>
               <p>How long was he at your house? - From nine till the watch went eleven.</p>
               <p>Was any body with the prisoner? - Yes; Mary Street, a gentlewoman who lives next door to me, at No. 2, but nobody else: she is an acquaintance of mine: her husband and mine worked together in the same ground. The prisoner spent the evening, and had a pot of beer; he eat some cold leg of mutton; then we had another pot of beer, which my little girl ordered at the King's-Arms; and we passed the evening: by that time the clock went eleven, then he said he must go.</p>
               <p>Who came in first, Mary Street, or the prisoner? - West came first, and went out first; and Mary Street went home to bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030030"/> immediately; she was up till eleven o'clock with us.</p>
               <p>What were you talking about all this time? - Nothing but concerning work; they were talking whether my husband would be able to get up at six next morning to go to work.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of May, I met the prisoner on London-bridge; she seemed to know me: she said I was her countryman, and asked me to give her something to drink, which I did. It rained very hard. She said she lived at Mile-end; that she had friends there, worth 40 l. a year every day in the week; and if I would take a coach, and carry her to Mile-end, she would make me amends. I took a coach, and went to Mile-end: we got out of the coach, and went into a public-house; being weary, I was about falling asleep; I felt my watch go out of my pocket; I opened my eyes, and said, What do you mean by that? She said, if I took the watch from her, she would swear my life away. I gave her all the good words I could to get my watch again: she said, if I would go back to Whitechapel with her, she would give me the watch. I did; and, when we came to Whitechapel, she endeavoured to make her escape; I called the watch, and gave charge of her, and then she gave charge of me. She had my watch in her bosom; I pulled at it, the chain broke off, and was left in her bosom.</p>

               <p>On the night of the first of June, between Surry-street and Norfolk-street, at about one o'clock, or rather after, in the morning, as I was walking home, the prisoner laid hold of my arm, and asked me to go with her; I told her not, and desired her to go away. Then she asked me to lend her a shilling; I told her I had none: I was walking all this time. She laid hold of my arm, and, as I thought, put her hand upon my breeches pocket, and presently ran away; I was not sensible, at the time, that she had taken any thing from me, but, from her running away, I was satisfied she must have taken something. I felt her hand upon my pocket, but was not sensible of its being in my pocket; I had a notion she must have taken my watch, by her running away. I pursued her two or three hundred yards, and overtook her, with my purse in her hand. She opened her hand, and said, there it is, and delivered it to me. Then I took her to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am a beadle . I was in the watch-house; this man came, and said, he had been robbed of his watch. I went, from an information I had received, to a kind of a shed, where people sleep; there were three persons there, and the prisoner charged them all three with robbing him. From something that dropped, I understood that the prisoner was the person who had robbed him. We went to the prisoner's lodging, and when he saw her, he said, that was the woman who knocked him down, and robbed him. I asked her, where the watch was? She said, If you will let me off, I will produce the clicker; and, with a deal of difficulty, I got the watch from her .</p>

               <p>On the 22d of last month, as I was going up the King's Road, I saw the prisoner with two bundles. I followed her into a public-house, and asked her, where she got those things; she said, they were her own, that she had just fetched them out of pawn. I suspected they were not, and took her to Bow-street. I sent for the prosecutrix, and she said they were her property.</p>

On the 25th of May, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's window: he leaned over, and took a piece of silk, and concealed it under his coat. He went off. I followed him. When he got upon Ludgate-hill, he ran. I cried, Stop thief! He ran across to the London coffee-house. Some people attempting to stop him, he ran across the way again. I called, Stop thief! and he dropped the silk. Some people coming along, stopped him. He was never out of my sight before he was stopped.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 7th of June, at three in the morning, I was coming from Butcher-row. The prisoners asked me to give them something to drink. We took a coach, and went into Holborn, and had half-a-pint of brandy. The coachman brought it out to us. From thence we drove to the Goose and Gridiron, in St. Paul's church-yard. There I got out of the coach. I went to pay the coachman, and missed my money, my pocket-book, and my handkerchief. The women were still in the coach. I was in liquor. I felt my money in my pocket before I got into the coach, and afterwards, when I paid for the brandy; and I think I felt it in my pocket at the end of Fleet-market. I charged the prisoners with robbing me, and told them, if they would give me my property again, I would let them go about their business; if not, I would call the watch, and give charge of them. They would not give it me again. I called the watchman, and charged him with the prisoners; and they were taken to the watch-house. As they were going along, I saw Thomas drop the pocket-book. I took it up, and said it was mine: and in the watch-house she dropped the handkerchief. She was searched afterwards, and my money and some more was found upon her.</p>

When she went out, I suspected she had taken something. I followed her, and found a quart pot under her arm, and she had her cloak over it. When she was committed, I went up to her room, and found two quart pots there. Since that, a pan for melting, and some pieces of metal, have been found in her room.</p>

               <p>You are a midwife? - Yes. I was fetched on the 26th of May, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, by Mr. Wicks, the constable, who said I was wanted to a labour. When I came to White's-alley, I met the prisoner's mother coming out at the door. She turned back, and said the child was up three pair of stairs. I went up. There lay the child, dead, wrapped up in a dirty coarse apron. There was a mark under the throat, like two fingers and a thumb, and the thumb-nail had rather scratched it. I took it to the work-house. I did not see the mother till the afternoon. I washed it in the afternoon. I was fetched about five o'clock. There I saw the mother of it.</p>
               <p>How did you know she was the mother of it? - I knew she was the mother of a child, that she had been lately delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was that child? - She acknowledged it. I asked her whether it was born alive. She said she would not say. I asked her if she had pinched it, in helping herself. She said she did not help herself at all.</p>
               <p>Might this have happened in the delivering herself? - It might have happened in that way; that made me ask her that question.</p>
               <p>I suppose she was just brought to the work-house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You are a surgeon, and live in Chancery-lane? - I am.</p>
               <p>You saw this child afterwards? - I did.</p>
               <p>You examined it, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon it? - There was the appearance of a bruise on the forehead, and on each side of the windpipe.</p>
               <p>What do you think was the occasion of that child's death? - The naval string was torn off, at a few inches distance from the belly of the child; it seemed to be torn, and not cut.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, do you believe this child got her death by violence? - I am not clear in it. It might happen, if the mother was delivered on the vault, by the child's falling, the naval string might break. I examined the lungs of the child; it was plain, by the appearance of them, that the child had lived.</p>
               <p>I don't understand that that is a certain sign of the child's having been born alive? - If there are no signs of putrefaction.</p>
               <p>You will not take upon you to say that this child received its death by violence from any person? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I have understood that that experiment upon the lungs has of late been held not to be conclusive: in one way, it has been held to be conclusive, if the lungs sink; but not to be conclusive, if they float: it is a common experiment, and, in that case, gives a degree of probability; if the lungs sink, it is conclusive? - Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030036"/>But I understand the floating of the lungs may be occasioned by other circumstances, than that of being inflated. The bruises upon the forehead, you say, might be occasioned by the fall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the bruises upon the neck, you think, might be caused by the woman, in the agony of child-birth, endeavouring to free herself from the child? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I keep a silver-smith's shop at Charing-cross. On Tuesday evening, the 31st of December, I received a 20 l. Bank post-bill of my sister; I sent it to the Bank the next morning, for acceptance.</p>
               <p>Was it paid? - No. On Saturday was three weeks, the prisoner came into my shop to buy a pair of silver buckles; I shewed him some: he did not approve of them. He asked for some second-hand ones, I shewed some, and he chose a pair. Then he wanted a gold shirt-buckle; I shewed him one, he said, he had no cash by him; if I would change him a five-guinea bill, he would be obliged to me. He gave it me; I saw it was the same indorsement as the 20 l. note my sister had received. I suspected him; I asked him, if he had any other note: he shewed me a 10 l. note, indorsed in the same manner. I took them both, and told him, I would get change for one or the other. I went to my other shop, which is opposite, and desired a person to go to the door, and see that he did not get off, while I got a constable. I went to the watch-house, and got one, and took him in custody. As we were going in a coach to Bow-street, I asked him, how he came by the notes; he said, he found them in a pocket-book, either<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030037"/> in Fleet-street, or the Strand, I am not certain which. We asked him what he did with the pocket-book; he said, he threw it away. He was searched at Bow-street, and he had five guineas, and some silver, in his pocket.</p>

               <p>I am solicitor to the Post-office. I attended the examination of the prisoner, at Bow-street, on the 17th of June. The three notes which have been produced here, were at that time produced: the prisoner was asked, where he got them; he said, he was coming along Cheapside, on a Friday or a Saturday evening, about six or seven o'clock, and he found a pocket-book, in which these three notes were contained; and also a 50 l. note, which he had put off at Windsor, a 100 l. note, which he had put off at Bath, and a 40 l. note, or bill, which he had put off at Mr. Tregent's, a watch-maker, in Leicester-fields. He said, he did not look at the pocket-book 'till the Sunday after he found it; and that in two or three days after his looking at the pocket-book, and its contents, he put off the 20 l. note at Mr. Noble's. He was also asked, if he told any body what he found; he said, No: he was asked if he had any acquaintance in the Post office; he said, he had an uncle who was a letter-carrier, who was dead. He was asked, if he had ever visited his uncle, in the letter-carrier's office; he said, he had.</p>

               <p>I am a watchmaker, in Leicester-fields. On the 8th of January, in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, to buy a gold watch: he asked for one of a low price; he said, he had had some prize-money; that all he had got, for a great many prizes they had taken, was a 40 l. Bank-note, which he would go home and fetch, in an hour. He came again, in about an hour, with the note; the watch came to fifteen guineas: I took the note, and gave him change. He said his name was Barnett. I never saw him before; I saw him afterwards at the Justices.</p>

On Wednesday last, near seven in the evening, I was in Basinghall-street, sitting on the coach-box; I thought I found the coach to sway backwards and forwards; I looked over my left shoulder, and saw the prisoner come from behind the coach with my fellow servant's great-coat; she was wrapping it up in the skirt of her gown; my fellow-servant had left it hanging in the holders behind the coach; it is my master's property. I got off my box, pursued, and followed her from Basinghall-street to Wood-street; a person told me she was run into a public-house; I went into the public-house, and saw her sitting in the corner, with the coat in her apron. I asked her how she came by the coat: she said she picked it up. She gave it me, and said, There is your coat.</p>

               <p>Coming along, the coat lay in the footway; I took it up, and put it into my apron, and went into a house in Wood-street; the gentleman came in, and said he had lost a coat, and I gave it him.</p>

After that, my room door was broke open, and the first man I saw come in was the prisoner, Jacobs, whom I was intimately acquainted with; I knew his person perfectly well; I saw him by a light which one of the other men who were with him had; I cried out, Murder! then Jacobs threw himself upon me, bid me be quiet or he would kill me, and I felt something sharp cut me in the face. They heard some people coming after some time, and they went off; but they took all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I called the watchman, and he went with me to Jacobs's house, which was only three minutes walk from me; we went and asked if he was at home; he was denied.</p>
               <p>(Upon his Cross-Examination, he said the prisoner was his third cousin; that he had asked him to find bail for him a month ago, which he had refused; that in getting into the house they had broke the glass over the door, but he could not say but it might be so opened that a man might get through without breaking any thing; that they were about ten minutes in the room; that when he went with the constable a second time, he met Jacobs with two others, when he had him taken up.)</p>

               <p>Did you ever observe him go to bed before? - I never observed him go to bed but that particular night. I saw the candle too near the window, as I thought. I was afraid of fire, and opened the window, and asked if the candle was safe. The prisoner opened the window, and said to me, that it was. My husband was just got to bed; for we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030040"/> went up stairs together. When I was at the door, my husband was asleep in the parlour. I waked him, to go to bed.

               <p>I am a neighbour of Mr. Levy's. I went to the prisoner's house, about half after one. He got up, and opened the window. The prosecutor said he had been robbed; he took a watchman with him, and said he was going to the person's house, and if he found him at home he should think nothing of it; but, if he did not, he should have his suspicions. When we came back from the house, they said he was not at home. Then I went back with the watchman: he knocked, and said, For God's sake, look out of the window; there is a robbery committed, and they charge you with it. The prisoner immediately came to the window, undressed. He came down with another man, and said he would be at the prosecutor's house in five minutes. He came the minute we called at the window.</p>

               <p>We knocked a considerable time before any body came to the window; and there was time enough, if he had been dressed, to have undressed himself, before he appeared at the window.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. On the 27th of May, I went to bed about nine o'clock. At, I believe, between twelve and one o'clock, a man came into my room, and fell upon me, and covered my face. I screamed out. He d - ned me, and said, You are a dead woman, if you make any noise. I begged him to spare my life . He said, I will not hurt you, you bloody b - h, if you don't speak. He asked for my silver spoons, my Bank-notes, and keys. I told him I had no Bank-notes. The man that lay over me talked to another man. They broke open a box, but did not take any thing out of it. They took my ring off my finger . Then they tied my hands behind me, and said, If I stirred, in less than half an hour they would come back, and blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Did one man lie upon you all the time? - Yes; for about half an hour. When they were gone, I lay some time. Then I got up, and alarmed some of my neighbours, and sent for my husband.</p>
               <p>(I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment, repeating them.)</p>
               <p>There are two back-doors to the house; one goes out of the yard into the City-road, the other out of the kitchen into the yard: that door I bolted the night before. There is a window close to it: that I left secure. The door out of the yard into the City-road is usually kept locked, and the key hangs behind the street-door. On the next morning, the door out of the kitchen into the yard was open. The window was taken quite out . The door into the City-road, was locked, and the key taken away. My husband came home about five o'clock, and we sent for some of the Justice's men. They found on the kitchen dresser some brown paper, in which seven yards of scarlet cloth had been packed, which had been left in my care by a Mr. Jones. They had unpacked the truss, taken the cloth out, and left the paper behind them.</p>

We asked him what he had got. He dropped the bundle, and ran away; and a brother watchman stopped him. We took him to the watch-house, and then took the goods to the beadle's house. When we took him, he said he knew nothing at all of the goods. I saw him drop them; I was very near; and

               <p>I am a watchman. On the 27th of May, I was out on my beat, in Brick-lane, Old-street. Three men came by my box, with a bundle, about a quarter after one o'clock. I asked where they were going with that bundle. They said, to a waggon. I said, they must go to the watch-house, and give an account of themselves. They said, they would do that willingly. We went together till we came to the end of the street. Then one of them said to the other, Go on with the bundle, as fast as you can, to the left. I said, No, gentlemen, you must not go to the left; to the right is the way to the watch-house. Upon that, one of them stepped back,

I followed them till I met with these watchmen.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030042"/> I called to them to stop the man with the bundle, for I was mortally wounded. Upon that, I saw him drop the bundle; and he was taken. I was carried to the hospital. My life was despaired of for a fortnight. I believe the man in blue (Lee) to be the man that had the bundle. I followed him from Brick-lane to the upper end of Mitchell-street . The other prisoner walked by me the whole length of the street. We had a good deal of conversation. From the whole of his appearance, his visage, his stature, and his voice, I believe him to be the man. When I was taken to the Office, I gave a description of the person by his visage and stature, and said I should remember his voice. Upon my description, he was taken up. I saw him eight days after, and gave the same account. I now believe he is the man, but I cannot swear positively to him.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of March, I lost some things; on the 20th of March, I lost a great many other things. The prisoner lodged in my house: I was going out upon business; I told the prisoner, in the morning, I was going from home, and should not be back 'till late. The prisoner asked a great many odd questions, but did not raise any suspicions in my mind at that time: I went away. As I was returning home, I was told my house was robbed; I went home, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment, and two trunks were gone, one of which, I am sure, was locked. While I was walking up and down in my room, I stepped upon two pawnbroker's duplicates; I took them up; they were of goods stolen on the 19th of March. I carried them to Bow-street; there, I was informed, from whence those tickets came. I went to Mr. Rochfort's, the pawnbroker; upon shewing them the tickets they said, they had got the goods, and they would enquire after the man: they afterwards found him in the Poultry Compter. I left the prisoner in my house, when I went out; when I came back, the prisoner, and all the goods, were gone. I gave 7 l. 10 s. for the watch; it was made on purpose for me.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Rochfort, a pawnbroker. I received all these things of the prisoner, on the 20th of March; I lent him 2 l. 11 s. upon them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A bill came payable upon Mr. Waller, while I was with him; he asked me to come and stay, while I was out of place. The man who had the bill came, and said, he would trouble him, if he did not pay it. Mr. Waller desired me to take these things to Mr. Rochfort's, and pawn them, which I did: I passed as his nephew, and he as my uncle, in the court where he lived. When I took them to pawn, Mrs. Rochfort asked, if her man should go and speak with my uncle; I said, Yes. When she found I was willing that her man should go with me to my uncle, she was satisfied. I drank harder than I should do; I lost some of the money, and was afraid to return.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the bill for, that was due?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it was 30 l. Mr. Watson, of St. Alban's-street, Pall-Mall, had the bill: the money was to be paid by Mr. Waller to Mr. Watson; Mr. Waller neglected going to Mr. Watson for three or four days, and it was he threatened Mr. Waller.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. Was there any such bill? - When I first came to London, I missed a bill.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there a bill of that sort? - He had nothing to say to that bill. I never desired him to pawn any thing whatever: I never pawned any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to take that young man into your house? - I kept a house of lodgings; from the 5th to the 20th, he was in my house; I looked upon him honest: he told me, he was an honest young man.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to let him pass for your nephew? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there ever any conversation between you and him upon that subject? - No.</p>
