I am shopman to Mr. Henry Joseph Niblett, a sil<lb/>versmith and pawnbroker, in Farringdon-street On the evening of the 27th of December I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner about half-past seven o'clock, as I was engaged serving a customer—I observed the pri<lb/>soner come and take a hat off a peg—he ran off across the road—I pur<lb/>sued and took him with the hat in his possession—he made a desperate resistance, and tried to get away, but I succeeded in keeping him—he did not strike me, but tried to get from my grasp—this is my master's hat.</p>

I know both the defendants—on the 20th of April, I called at the house of the defendant Boone, in Paradise-row, Chelsea—I think it was No. 64—I am in the habit of calling at houses for orders—I saw a person there who represented herself to be Mrs. Boone—I soli<lb/>cited an order—(the defendant Boone was not within at that time)—I have seen that woman since—she is called Ann White—she represented herself as Boone's wife—when I asked for the order, she said Mr. Boone had gone to our house to give me an order, but as I should not see him she would give me an order herself—I had called at the house once before, and left my address—the order she gave me amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told her my manner of doing business was for ready money—she said if I had a mind she would give me part payment then—I said that was not the general way of doing business, the general way was to receive the money when we delivered the goods—I went away without any money—I sent my porter with the goods the next day (Friday)—he did not bring back any money, nor the goods—on the 1st of May, in consequence of what I heard, I went to Boone's house in Paradise-row, and found it</p>

               <p>only paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was understood, on the first parcel being paid for, and his reference proving satisfactory, that he was to be supplied with another parcel at one week's credit—I then went to the reference, No. 9, Fann-street, Goswell-street, and saw a little woman—she was not in widow's mourning—I asked for Mr. Collier—she said her husband was not at home, but would be at home at ten o'clock at night—that he was gone to Dept<lb/>ford—I then said Boone had referred me to her husband, and asked her if his statement was correct—(I afterwards saw that same woman at St. An<lb/>drew's-hill—she called herself Mrs. Collier there, the same as she did in Fann-street—she was keeping the house on St. Andrew's-hill—I asked for her husband—I expect Boone represented the Mr. Collier there, but I did not see him there myself—when I saw the little woman in Fann-street)—she said, "Boone has served his apprenticeship to my husband, and he now works journey work as a cabinet-maker for my husband; he has married a ser<lb/>vant-girl at Chelsea, with whom he has received about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he has get about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. property of his own, and intends to open this shop for his wife, and he will still carry on the cabinet-making business himself; he has now work at home for my husband, which, if he brings home on Saturday, he will be paid for"—all this corresponded with what Boone had told me him<lb/>self—in consequence of this I let the goods go—I saw Boone again on the 15th of April, and mentioned to him the conversation I had had with this woman in Fann-street, and told him I was satisfied—he had previously told me himself what Mrs. Collier had told me—he promised then faith<lb/>fully to pay me for the goods every week—when I told him I had not seen Mr. Collier, but Mrs. Collier, he said it was all quite correct, that I could see Mr. Collier at any time—I went again, but could not fee Mr. Collier—Boone was to pay me for the goods on the following Monday, when he would want more—I let him have four parcels, which, altogether, came to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the balance of the first parcel before he had the second, and then he had four others, which came to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never paid any part of that—I went to Fann-street again twice in the week before I parted with more goods—I saw the same woman again, and she told me the same story both times, that her husband was not at home, but would be at home after ten o'clock at night—I repeated the first conversation I had with her to Boone—I did not repot the second—on the second Sunday after this I missed Boone from Paradise-row—I believe he had run away on the Monday morning on which he had promised to pay me—I received a letter, in consequence of which I went to the house on a Monday morning, in the last week of April I think—it was about three weeks after the first order—I found he had broken his name off the board—he had absconded, and the fixtures were taken away—there was no stock left behind—on the following Monday week I saw Quantock on Brook-hill, when I was in company with Mr. Bennett, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Fennell—we found they were at St. Andrews-hill after he ran away—I had been there myself, and seen the little woman there on Sunday the day before, I saw Quantock—I went into the shop with other parties who had been defrauded, and saw the woman—I said, "It is most extraordinary to find you here keeping a shop from Fann-street, after Boone has absconded from Paradise-row, and I verily believe you are all a set of swindlers together"—I asked her for her husband—there was a man in the parlour, who I said I would see, but he escaped by a side door and got away directly he heard the name of Collier mentioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801010013"/>
               <p>he hung his head down—I said, "Collier is in the parlour, is he not?" she said, "No he is not," I said, "There is some man in the parlour, let me see him, perhaps that is Boone,"—he then crouched down and made his escape—next day I went with others and saw Quantock on Brook-hill—I was introduced to him by Mr. Fennell, who said, "Here is Mr. Collier," Quantock looked as all bad people do, ready to drop, and said, "My name is not Collier, my name is Quantock"—Mr. Fennell said, "Why you represented yourself to me as Mr. Collier yesterday, Mr. Quantock, why did you do so?"—he said, "I did answer to the name of Collier yesterday, but it was to suit my own purpose, you may take what ad<lb/>vantage you like of it"—Mr. Dimsdale was not present—Mr. Bennett, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Fennell, and myself were present—(Mr. Taylor it now very ill in bed)—I thought Quantock would have struck Mr. Fennell—I intimated that he must be connected with those swindlers in Paradise-row—I said, "Mr. Collier, I must have some conversation with you respect<lb/>ing that swindling transaction of Boone's"—he directly changed his countenance from a florid complexion to a pale white, and was ready to drop, and said, "My name is not Collier, it is Quantock."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, living in Gerard-street, Soho.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Slee and Co., vinegar makers at Horsleydown. In April last, a woman calling herself Mrs. Collier came to our house—I was not there when she came, but in consequence of her calling there, I afterwards went to a house on St. Andrew's-hill, with the name of Collier over the door—I did not see the name over the door, nor see any name at all—I saw Boone there—he went by the name of Thomas Collier to me—I am sure he used that name to me—he said he was a cabinet-maker, and was earning 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; that he worked in Barbican—Long-lane, Smithfield, was mentioned—I think I asked who he worked for there, and I think he gave me the name of Farmer—we sent him two quarter casks of vinegar, and two casks of mustard—it has never been paid for—I went to the shop about a month afterwards and found it shut up.</p>

                  </hi>, jun. I am a baker, and live with my father, in Comp<lb/>ton-street, Brunswick-square. The prisoner was our journeyman, and had been so about five weeks—he slept in a room opposite mine—I have no get up in the night to attend to business—I had missed money from my pockets from time to time, which induced me to mark a half-crown on Sun<lb/>day evening the 17th of December—I put it into my waistcoat pocket—my bed-room door is left open—at eleven o'clock, on the night of the 17th I got up to go to work, and the prisoner got up with me—the half-crown was then in my waistcoat pocket, which I left in my bed-room, and my trowsers were covered over it—the prisoner could go up to my room—I missed the half-crown a little before ten o'clock on Monday morning the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the other two doing at the time the three were about you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of them was sitting down by the side of the ditch, and the other walking backwards and forwards by the side of the foot-path—they did nothing to me—they never came nearer to me than the footpath—they all ran away together—I hallooed out to the roadsmen, and beckoned to them—(they are people who mend the road)—Bennett, one of the roadsmen, ran towards me—he might be about 300 yards off—I cannot say exactly—when I hallooed out, Steel <hi rend="italic">clawed</hi> a stick out of King's hand, and said he would beat my b—brains out—King was one of those who had done no<lb/>thing—he did nothing with the stick—he did not come up to me—Ben<lb/>nett</p>

               <p>was coming towards me at that time—three or four more people came up, but there is only Bennett here—the prisoners ran away—I saw Steel, King, Hutchinson, and Williamson, again the same day at Uxbridge, and saw Clarke on the Saturday after—Clarke was the last of the three that came up to me—I can swear to Steel, and to all of them as being the five men—they were all together, and ran away together, and they are the three that insulted me.</p>

On the 29th of December, about five minutes to six o'clock, I was in the shop walking from behind the counter, to another counter on the left-hand, and hearing somebody come into the shop, I turned my head and saw the prisoner making towards a pile of handkerchiefs—I did not know him before, but I am certain of him—there are seven gas-burners in the shop—he went towards the handker<lb/>chiefs and took them off the pile—he left about two pieces on the counter—he took about forty-eight handkerchiefs, being eleven or twelve pieces of different lengths—he made towards the door and ran out directly—I ran after him calling out, "Stop thief"—he was not brought back for half an hour, but he was stopped eight or ten doors from the shop, within two minutes of his leaving the shop—I saw him stopped and taken into our shop—I saw two pieces of handkerchiefs drop from him—he had then all in his arms till the constable took hold of him, and he still had some under his arm.</p>

About half-past nine o'clock on the morning of the 20th of December I was in my parlour—the prisoner came and asked if it was a barber's shop—I said, "No, next door"—he came in five minutes afterwards and had an ounce of tobacco—I served him—he stood talking about the price—in five minutes afterwards I was in the parlour, and heard a noise in the shop—I went in and saw the prisoner with the cigars in his pocket—he asked me to let him look at the tobacco boxes—I looked for them, missed the cigars, and said he had got them—he said he would give them me back if I would not make an alarm—he flung some out of his pocket on the floor, and shut the door that I should not go out, but I stopped him, and a neighbour came over, and he got them all out while I went out and shut the door to call for assistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, living at the Manor-house, Westbourne-green. I was returning from London in one of Cowderoy's omnibuses, on the 22nd of December—I was sitting on the left-hand side with my right pocket next to the door—there were two persons on the step for a very considerable time, but at this time there was only the pri<lb/>soner on the step—I felt a little twitching at my pocket—I could not see any one—I looked very quietly, and saw the handkerchief going through the crack of the door, and it went on until it was taken out through the crack—I got up, looked at the prisoner, and said, "I will stop here"—I saw him throw the handkerchief on the step—I jumped out, seized him, and gave him to the police—I saw it in his hand, and then he threw it down on the step.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper, and live in Great George-street, Bethnal-green. I knew the deceased, Thomas Hawe—he was a coal-whip<lb/>per—I had known him for about three weeks and a month—on Saturday evening, the 9th or 10th of December, I was in his company at the Queen's Head, at the corner of North-street, Mile-end-road—the prisoner was there, and a young woman named Jane Bubb—there was a dispute be<lb/>tween the prisoner and the deceased about Jane Bubb—the prisoner told her to keep herself to herself, and not to be talking to other young men—she had come there with the prisoner, and she was talking to the deceased—the prisoner then said he would strike her if she did not keep herself to herself—the deceased said in his presence that he should not—that was all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801010059"/>
               <p>that passed—they left there afterwards—on the next Tuesday I was at work with the deceased all day, and went to the Northampton Arms pub<lb/>lic-house in the evening, between eight and nine o'clock-—the prisoner was in the tap-room when I got there—the deceased came there a little after ten o'clock-t-the prisoner had come about nine o'clock—I did not hear the prisoner say any thing in the tap-room—I did not see the other people come down to him afterwards—I was up stairs in the same house about ten o'clock—there were thirty or forty persons there, as near as I can guess—Jane Bubb was there and the deceased—the deceased went down stairs, and in about five minutes returned with Jane Bubb, and she went and sat by his tide—'they came up together—she sat down by the side of the prisoner, and kept laughing and sneering all the time at the prisoner—the deceased then sang a song, and in a few minutes after he got up to go, and Jane Bubb with him—the prisoner all the time appeared much agitated—all the while the was in the room, sneering and laughing at him, and when they got up to go away, he jumped off his seat, ran to the door, and went down stairs, and they followed him—I followed them, and when I got round the stairs I heard the deceased say, "Don't strike her"—I suppose he said so to the prisoner—the staircase goes round—as soon as I got round, the first thing I saw was the deceased either strike or push the prisoner, and he went back about a yard and a half against the partition—the de<lb/>ceased then followed him, and doubled his fist—they then struggled to<lb/>gether with their hand round each other's neck—they bad about one of two hits at each other, as I thought—I then stepped in between them, and said, "Drop it"—the deceased made answer "He has got a knife"—I then laid hold of the prisoner's hand, and held it till a young man named Stiff came down and took a knife out of the prisoner's right hand—it was open—I did not see any blood on it—it had a black and white handle—it was a sharp-pointed knife—a common clasped knife, which men are in the habit of using—the deceased was taken to the hospital—I saw him again the next evening, alive—I saw him after he was dead, at the Coroner's In<lb/>quest—this is the knife—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—that was the knife given to me by James Holland.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-porter, and live in North-street, White<lb/>chapel-road. On Saturday night, the 12th of December last, I was at the Queen's Head—I saw the deceased, the prisoner, and Jane Bubb there—Jane Bubb was sitting between the two—the deceased got up and said. "There is a vagabond who says he will strike the girl because she spoke to me"—I saw the prisoner mutter to himself, but was too far off to know what he said—I saw no more of them that night—I saw them on the Tues<lb/>day evening afterwards at the Northampton Arms, up stairs in the singing room—I went up with some friends—when I had been there a short time the deceased came up with two friends—I heard him sing a song—I went down, and when I came up again I saw him sitting by the side of Jane Bubb, and she was laughing and jeering at the prisoner, who appeared greatly excited at their conduct—the deceased and Bubb got up with the intention of going down—the prisoner rushed down before them—I heard a noise and followed immediately—when I came down I saw the deceased and the witness Burn and the prisoner—the prisoner held a knife in his right hand—Burn was holding him by his right hand, and I took the knife out of his hand—the affray was all over when I got down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

CATHERINE HATES. I am servant at the Northampton Arms. I re<lb/>member the Tuesday night in question—I saw the deceased that night, and the prisoner and Jane Bubb—they were up stairs—I saw the prisoner in the tap-room, and also up stairs—he did not come to the bar to me—he came to the house by himself, and Bubb came with the deceased—they did not dance together that evening, that was on Saturday—Todd and Clark were down in the tap-room, when the prisoner called me down into the tap-room—the prisoner had said to me, that Tuesday afternoon, that if Bubb came there that night, he would give her a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—that was before she came with the deceased—I never heard him threaten to give her a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> before that—I remember their dancing together at our place on the Saturday before—he had been complaining of her then—after they came on this Tuesday evening, the prisoner came and called me down stairs into the tap-room, and gave me a knife, a pocket-book, half a brace, and another book besides—he told me to take care of them till the morning—I told him I would take care of them, and told him not to go up stairs any more—I left him in the tap-room with Clark and Todd—after putting his things away I went up stairs for his beer, and brought it down stairs—he afterwards came up stairs again, and brought his beer back, and soon after he went up, the deceased and Bubb got up to come down stairs—when the prisoner saw it he rushed out, and came down before them—he got before the girl in the passage, and asked her where she was going to, and he struck her—the deceased saw it, the returned back from the bar, and struck the prisoner—they were then in the passage—he appeared a more powerful man than the prisoner, and they</p>

               <p>struggled—he appeared to me to strike him hard—I do not know whether he went backwards in consequence of the blow, but they struggled toge<lb/>ther, and the deceased fell—I cannot say how long they struggled toge<lb/>ther—it was not very long—I saw the deceased strike the prisoner once, but not after the first blow—when the deceased fell, I picked him up, brought his hat to the bar, and told the girl to go out—the deceased ran to the prisoner again, and they struggled again—the prisoner was standing by when I picked up the deceased—I stooped down to hold him up—I left the deceased's hat at the bar—I do not know what hap<lb/>pened after they struggled the second time, for I picked up the de<lb/>ceased's hat, and told Bubb to go out, and as I returned from the bar I saw several young men trying to get the knife from the prisoner—it was in his hand—there were a good many other persons in the passage besides me—a good many were coming down the stairs, and when they heard the scuffling they all ran down.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a confusion in the passage when the struggle took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there was a gas-light before the bar, not far from where the struggle took place—it was as far as I am from your lordship—(<hi rend="italic">about six yards</hi>)—I cannot say how wide the passage is—it is not very wide—it is not so wide as the jury-box-—it is wider than one division of it—I cannot say how wide it is—the girl and I and the two men strug<lb/>gling were in the passage—the rest were coming down stairs—Burn was in the passage during the struggle—I kept the knife which the prisoner had given me, and gave it to my master—the prisoner never had that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Forster-street. I was pre<lb/>sent when the prisoner gave the pocket-book to Catherine Hayes—he came down stairs and seemed very much agitated, and gave Kitty the pocket book and a knife—he made believe to take something else out of his left<lb/>hand coat pocket—Kitty took the knife and pocket-book, and went into the kitchen—when he made believe to take something from his left-hand coat pocket, he said, "This I will keep, and if the b—touches me I will put it into him"—as he left the room he said, "God strike me dead," or "b—dead, I will put the knife into him"—that was as he left the room after he had delivered the pocket-book—he said, God strike him dead, or b—dead, he would put the knife into him, if he touched him, and rip his bowels out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Fetter-lane. The prisoner was in my employ—on the 27th of December, (yesterday week,) I had marked three bags with my name at the bottom, in the after<lb/>noon, while he was gone home—they were quite empty—I put them into the same place where I found them, which was in his flannel-jacket pocket, while he went home at dinner-time—he had lived with my father three years and five months; and with me, since Michaelmas-day—when he came in at half-past five or twenty minutes to six o'clock, I told him to go down and do his business as usual—he accordingly went back—at twenty minutes past six o'clock he came through the shop, and went out into the street—I kept my eye on him till he got sixteen or twenty yards—I then called him back—I had the officer in waiting across the road—he came over, and I said, "Take him into the room, and search him"—he found three half-quartern bags of flour; and round his neck there was a handkerchief which had some more flour in it; and in his pocket, six biscuits—that was my flour, it had been taken from the bin; and more than that, I had greased the scoop, and the flour stuck to it—here is the flour, and here are the bags.</p>

On Tuesday, the 27th of December, the two prisoners were in my tap-room—I could not get them out—I called for a police<lb/>man, but he dared not come in, he said, except for robbery or murder—they were too much for me—I could not get them out—I tried to get them out, and they threw my table against me, as if they were going to murder me—I called the policeman at ten o'clock at night—I sat down till four o'clock in the morning, and fell asleep—I then awoke, and saw Compton at my till—Phillips was on the other side—Compton had some coppers in his hand, and the till, and was going to put them into his pocket—I took him by the collar—he put them back, and said, "I have got no money"—my wife was in the parlour—I said, "We will search you"—we searched his right-hand pocket, and found this money—I charged him with its being my money—that money was missing from the till—we have two bowls in the till, and, as near as I can say, three minutes before, this silver was in the bowl, and one halfpenny laid on this bowl on the silver—the halfpenny was found in his pocket—all this time Phillips was on the other side, and he kept on telling Compton to cut my b—y head off, and beat out my brains—Compton was inside the bar, and Phillips on the other side—he could see all that was done by Compton—he said, "You have three halfpence of Compton's money, give it him back, or I will pull you up and make you sorry"—I told him to behave himself, or I would call a policeman—I was going to call a policeman, and he clung round my neck, and held his hand over my mouth as I got along—our door was closed—he got his head against the door—I got the door open as well as I cook—he put his hand on my mouth, and Compton ran out of the house—a policeman met him and brought him back—I had found the money, and gave it to my wife—the policeman took them to the station, and the money was left there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 18th of December I was going to Worship-street, and Mr. Smith, the pawnbroker, said that the prisoner had offered a pair of shoes in pawn, and he stopped him with them—I took the shoes and prisoner to the station-house—the prisoner told me that his mother had sent him out to pawn them—I went to his mother, and found her story corresponded with his—he was discharged, and then the prosecutor came—I said he was discharged, and then I went with him to the prisoner, and asked what he had done with the shoes—he said he had pawned them the night before, and had spent the money—I took him to the pawnbroker's, and found the shoes, which I can swear were the same I saw at the pawnbroker's the evening before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant. The prisoner is my cellar<lb/>man, and has been so above seven years—about three weeks ago I missed three gallons of wine—I do not know how it went—the prisoner always had a jacket when he came to work, and very frequently left it on the premises—I had the curiosity to look into the jacket in consequence of suspicion—I lifted up his jacket one day by chance, in the warehouse, and saw a tin bottle in it, with the top out—it was empty—it would hold nearly a bottle—I smelt it, and it had decidedly contained wine—I watched occasionally every day, and on the 1st of January I looked at the jacket as usual, when he went to dinner, and found the tin in his pocket full of wine, drawn from a particular cask in my stock—I took my brother to see it, and then called in an officer, and showed it to him—when the prisoner returned from dinner, I had him called into the counting-house, and told him I suspected he had been robbing me—he said he never had—I said, "You have something in your pocket which belongs to me"—he said he had not, and turned out all his pockets, and said it was all he had got—the officer searched him, and found this tin flask of wine, put into a secret pocket, below the one I had found it in—he then said it was wine given to him—I asked him from whom—he said, "A person not far off"—I said, "Who?"—he said, "At St. Helen's"—I asked the name—he refused to tell, and said nothing should induce him to give up the name—I gave him in charge, and in his pocket we found an account of wine sold, amounting to between four and five dozen, and some spirits—I am convinced the wine was mine—it was very fine sherry.</p>

I know Mr. Lawrence's shop—he is a linen draper in New Church-street—on Thursday evening, the 14th of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I was passing his shop, and I saw the prisoner Miles looking in at the window—Shepherd and Snelling were standing together at the corner of Carlisle-street, about a dozen yards off, talking together—I then went into a baker's shop two doors off, and when I came out of that shop I saw Miles taking some prints from inside the shop door, which was open—he ran to Shepherd and Snelling, who stood at the corner, and gave the things to Shepherd—Miles and Shepherd then ran down Carlisle-street—Snelling passed Mr. Lawrence's shop, looked in at the door, and passed along—I ran in and gave information to Mr. Law<lb/>rence—Sudell ran out after them, but did not overtake them—I am quite sure of the other two prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames-police surveyor. On Sunday morning, the 31st of December, I was watching at the prosecutor's shop a little be<lb/>fore eight o'clock, and saw Markham come out of Mr. Hancock's shop with a large bundle under his arm—he went up Blue-gate-fields to his own house, and remained there a little time, and came back again—Chandler was in the shop—I had seen them talking together in the shop—Markham came back in a quarter of an hour to the shop, and brought another bundle away—he did not go into the shop—Chandler gave him the bundle on the second occasion—Chandler spoke to him immediately, and he gave him the bundle—they had a very few words—they were not more than a minute together—I had a man of my own buying some meat in the shop at the time—I followed Markham to his house—I did not go back to Hancock's till the next morning, Monday, when I apprehended Chandler—his master asked what he had sold—he described some mutton, beef, and bones, and so on—his master said, "Is that all?"—he said, "Yes," and described it—I said, "You must have done a great deal of trade, I saw Markham twice at your shop—he took a large bundle away; did he pay you for the meat he took away?"—he said, "No"—I went to Markham's house with the prosecutor, and found him at home, and his wife—he was Isitting down eating a piece of roast beef—he said, "Do you want to be measured for a pair of boots?"—the prosecutor said, "No, Mr. Fogg wants you"—I said, "Have you no more beef in the house?"—he said, "No"—his wife was in the room—she ran out immediately—I said, "You and Chandler have begun a nice game"—his wife ran into the yard—I said to Mr. Hancock, "Run out, that woman has got the privy door in her hand, I cannot leave him"—I then took Markham out into the yard—I told Mr. Hancock to turn up a tub that was in the yard, and in a pan were two pieces of beef—Mr. Hancock said, "These are my pieces"—I said, "Where did you get these?"—Markham said, "Mind, I have said nothing yet"—he said, "Mr. Hancock, you know my brother is a butcher, but I do not say I had it of him"—I also found about 60lbs. of coffee at Mark<lb/>ham's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us what account, he gave of the cause of his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He stated he was so intoxicated at the time that he could not recollect the commencement of the affray—I took down his words to this effect—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Charles Ragan says, on the night of Sunday, the 10th of December. 1837, he forught with Thomas Smoker, and recollects being kicked in the belly—that Charles Palmer and a man named Cowper were present at the fight and says he thinks they assisted in injuring him, but is not sure who gave him the kick in the belly"—he died either from a kick or blow in the belly—I found the bladder ruptured—he died in two hours after making this statement—I afterwards opened the body and found mortification and rup<lb/>ture of the bladder—there were other injuries, but he died, undoubtedly, from the mortification of the bladder—a kick would decidedly produce the rupture I saw—a person falling on him with his knee might also occa<lb/>sion such a rupture.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at New Cross. In November last, I bought fifty-nine sheep of Mr. Holcombe—I was to take them ten a week—the prisoner was in his service—I used to fetch the sheep—it was not the prisoners' business to bring them, but on the 12th of December he came to me between twelve and one o'clock, and told me he had got a sheep ill, and he thought it had better be killed—I asked him if it was one of mine—he said it was—I said I could not fetch it that day, for I was going out, and could not fetch it till to-morrow—he said he thought it had better be killed—I asked what was the matter—he said it had lost the use of its fore legs, as it kept pitching on its head—he brought it to me in a barrow the same day, all dirty, and three of its legs were tied—he said, "It is no use to untie its legs, as it will not stand"—as I was going out, I killed it in the shop—I asked him if the sheep would not eat—he said, "No, it would eat nothing for the last two days;" but on slaughtering it, I found the stomach full of food, and it was in good health—the prisoner came to me again in the evening, and asked me what I thought the value of the sheep was—I asked him why—he made no answer—I said, "I do not think it worth as much as the others by 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and asked why he asked—he made no reply—I asked him if it was my sheep—he said, "No"—I said why was that—he said it was one he had fetched out of Mr. Holcombe's other fields, that he had lost two of mine last week and brought that instead, and what was deficient in that, he would make good—he said two of mine had strayed away—I was not satisfied with this, and went to Mr. Holcombe next morning to make inquiry—I sent my boy Marlow to Mr. Holcombe with the skin—I afterwards saw the skin when it had been cleansed, and it was marked with a B in a ring—the fifty-nine I bought were not branded in that way—I have killed them all except ten.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, and live in Grove-hill-terrace, Grove-lane, Camberwell. There is a gentleman in the neighbourhood named Ryder—he is an independent gentleman, and lives just below me—I have known him some time—I saw the prisoner at my shop on the evening of the 18th of November, about six o'clock—we had candles lighted—I was sitting at tea in the parlour, behind the shop—he came and asked for change, as we understood at first, for a person named Wright—he came, and held the shop door in his band, and pushed it back against my desk, holding the hasp in his hand—he put his head in, and asked for change for a £5 note—I thought he said for Mr. Wright—I got op from my table, and walked towards the parlour door, to go into the shop—I said, "Change for who?"—he said, "For Mr. Ryder, a little below"—Mr. Ryder lives in Walworth-place, which is a little below my house—I put my hand into my left hand pocket, and pulled out five sovereigns—he had a £ note in his hand—it appeared to me a bank-note—I took the five sovereigns from my pocket, gave them to him, and he wrote the name of Ryder on the note—he did it of his own accord—he wrote "Ryder"—nothing else—he took away the sovereigns, and I saw no more of him—I took the note, and marked it with a mark—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a note.</hi>)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think you had seen the prisoner before, and take him for another man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh! the face is very familiar to me—I took his face to be one I knew when he came into the shop on the Saturday night—I thought I knew him, but I found out I was wrong—I know his face is very familiar to me—I did not say I thought I knew him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you hear that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the reason I said that was, because another person's face was familiar to me, and I thought I knew him so well, I did not hesitate in giving him the money—I looked at him very bard, and when I came to see him again, I knew his face again, and it is the very same person I gave the money to—the person I thought it was lives at Was worth—I was mistaken, but the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after receiving the note did you see the prisoner again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I saw him at the police-office, before the Magistrate—I do not know how long that was after I changed the note—I suppose it is a month ago that I went up the first time, but I did not set it down—it was on a Tuesday—I recollect that—there was more than a week between the two occasions—I should not think there was a month, but I will not swear it—I will not swear one way or the other—I will swear it was not six weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is said you took him for another man, how long did that opinion last in your mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not longer than till I saw him again—when he first came into the shop I took him for one Parsons, but I recollected by looking at him that he was not Parsons—I looked hard at him, as the candle was close by me, and found it was not Parsons—I took more par<lb/>ticular notice of him to ascertain whether it was Parsons or not—my boy was in the shop at the time.</p>

On the 18th of Novem<lb/>ber I was in the shop when the prisoner came in for change—he opened the door, and I first understood him to ask to change Mr. Wright a £5 note—master got up from his tea-table, came to the door, and said, "Mr. who?"—he said, "Mr. Rider, a little below"—master came round to the counter, put his hand into his left-hand pocket and pulled out five sovereigns—I stood at the further end of the counter—I saw him lay a paper down on the counter—he said, "Shall I write Rider on it?"—master said, "Yes," and while he was doing so, master put five sovereigns on the counter—I did not see what became of the paper—master took it—he did not show it to me—I saw the prisoner afterwards at Lambeth-street, and knew him again.</p>

On the 21st of December, the prisoner came about three o'clock, and purchased a penny raspberry-puff—she gave me a bad shilling—I said it was bad, and she gave me a good sixpence—I give her change—I gave the bad shilling to my nephew, and he cut it, and has gat it now, I believe—she wanted the shilling, but I would not let her have it—she said she took it at a grocer's shop, on the other side of the way, but she could not give the name—I gave her one of my cards, and told her to take it there, and he would know me very well, and to get a good shilling, if she could, or they might come to me, and get the bad one returned—neither the grocer nor the prisoner came.</p>
