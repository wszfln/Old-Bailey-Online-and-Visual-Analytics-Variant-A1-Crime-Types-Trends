               <p>Q. Was it quite light at that time? - Yes; I picked up one of these young girls, I forget her name, I believe it is Deane; I went with her to Mrs. English's house, and there I was robbed of this money.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were you robbed? - I cannot say, I was so much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man or single? - A married man.</p>
               <p>Q. You see the danger of getting into liquor? - Yes, I was very much in liquor, and I cannot say how I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that is the woman that you went home with? - Yes, I was sober enough to know that is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober enough to know that English was there, that kept the house? - Yes, she kept the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you undressed? - Yes, I lost seven guineas in the house, but I cannot tell how I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed as soon as you went into that house; you went in at six o'clock you say? - Yes, but I cannot tell what time I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to know at the time you went into the house, that you had this silk handkerchief, and this money about you? - Yes, I was sober enough to know that, because I pulled it out; the money was in my breeches pocket, all loose.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last, before you picked up this young woman? - I see it at the public house in <placeName id="t17950916-1-crimeloc3">Winfield-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever recover any of your money? - Yes, two guineas, which I tied up in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you, that made you discover that the property was missing? - I recollect myself being in a strange room when I awaked.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you describe them? - Yes, I took the man to shew him them, I could not give him much description of them; I found two at the house, Mrs. English and Mrs. Hog.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - I am not certain whether the officer searched them or no, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recover any property at that time? - No, the first money that I recovered was before; they did not rob me of all at first, I had some left after the first time they robbed me, I had two guineas, and I tied it up in my handkerchief for safety, and then afterwards the handkerchief and money and all were gone, but how I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you ever recover any of this money? - I recovered none that I lost first, but I recovered the two guineas of Deane afterwards, I kept that and spent it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - At Canterbury, a constable. On the 13th of August last I received a warrant from the Mayor to apprehend Susannah, a black girl; I received information that she had lodgings at one Mr. Read's, a school master; I went to the house, Mr. Read directed me into her appartment, the girl was laying there on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? -About five in the afternoon; I told her. she must go before the Mayor of Canterbury, I did not tell her for what then; I asked her whether she had any boxes, or any thing in the room that belonged to her, she pointed then to a trunk, which trunk I took with me to the Mayor with her, the Mayor asked her some few questions,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160006"/> and he desired to have the key of the trunk; the first thing that presented was a pair of shoes; the Mayor would not look any further into the box, but gave me the key of the trunk, and desired me to comeup to town with it, and take the prisoner to Bow-Street, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the box was opened at Bow-Street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found? - These articles.(Produced) they were taken out of the box and tied up in this cloth before justice Bond; it was delivered to me, and Lady Bridges had it from me, as justice Bond thought it would be troublesome for me to take it with me to Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did you receive it again? - Of Lady Bridges.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Bridges. We understand from Mr. Gosby, that he delivered a bundle to you at the public office; what did you do with that bundle? - I have kept it locked up ever since, till I delivered it to him this morning. (Deposes to the articles produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they put? - They were in different chests.</p>
               <p>Q. This house is Mr. Bridges, he rents it, does he? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you lived there? -About three years.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the house were the chests kept in? - In two different rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them before you missed them? - I really cannot tell how long, but a very short time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bridges. How did she come into your service? - I bought her when she was a girl; I brought her with me from the East Indies; she is extremely young, not now fifteen; I am afraid she has been ill advised, or she never would have committed such a crime.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had a good opinion of her till this time? - A very good opinion of her.</p>

On Saturday night the prisoner and I lay together; on Sunday morning (I never observed any thing a matter with my box) I cleaned myself and went out pretty soon in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160007"/>morning, between nine and ten o'clock, and I left the prisoner in bed; I did not return till between the hours of eleven and twelve at night; I went up stairs and missed the box, and found the prisoner in bed; I enquired of the young woman that cleaned the room, whether she had seen any thing of it; she told me she had never been in the room from the time that I left it, as the prisoner was in bed, till she had cleaned herself, and she was not then in a condition to do the business of the room. Then by making an enquiry for the box, there was a young man up stairs that lay in the room, and he told me it was in his room; I went up stairs, and found the box and some bits of wood in the room were the box was taken to; one of the pieces was about five inches long, and an inch and a half wide, where the box was broke.</p>

               <p>Q. What kind of boxes were these? - The one that my money was in, was rather slighter than the other which I kept my clothes in, but I put the money there because I thought if any thing should happen of this sort, it would not be suspected so soon, to be where my tools and dirty linen were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a man, a waterman, lived in the house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then if you was asked a little more you would say a little more. Where did you get all this money? - By my industry.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, how much money had you on the Saturday? - Sometimes two guineas, for my week's labour I mean.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was you master of on Saturday morning? - I was master of twelve guineas; a guinea of which I took out of my box and put into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, of course, on Sunday morning you had more than the eleven guineas and this guinea that you took out of your pocket book? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your week's earnings? - I did not work that week, because work was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this money been in your pocket book? - I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you count it last? - I counted it on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no more than twelve guineas? - No more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how did you subsist the week if you did not work? - I had some silver in my pocket that I subsisted with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell any body that you had eleven guineas in your pocket book? - I said at the time when the money was gone, somebody asked me what was lost, I said, perhaps it may be fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen guineas; but that was including my clothes and tools; but when I went to the box I found it to be only the eleven guineas from the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you give me this answer when you had been to your box and seen that the eleven guineas were gone? Upon your oath would you have missed your things if they had not been there? - No, I should not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say that you had not the anxiety to examine whether any thing else was gone, when you found your money was gone? - I had not the curiosity to examine at that time.</p>

He then went down and called up the landlady of the house, Mrs. Kavener, and he unlocked the box before Mrs. Kavener, and he found nothing disturbed in the box, only the place where the pocket book lay, where a hand was put in.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see it next? - I see it in a stable, in a place called Hog Island, a place in the parish of Mary-le-bone, near Cumberland-place, at the back of Messrs. Ward and Harpur, the Cowkeeper's.</p>

When I took him I told him that he must go back with me, for I had a strong suspicion that he stole my horse the night before; he says, I will go any where with you. He then came back with me about a hundred yards, and he began to cry, and said, if I would but forgive him, he would tell me where the horse was.</p>

Did you promise to forgive him? - I told him I wanted to see the horse, very possibly it was not my horse; he says; it is your horse and I know it; but I have cut his mane and tail; and says he. it is in such a place. I took him to Paddington, to a public house, the sign of the King and Queen, and I sent him for a constable, and from thence I sent him down to Marlborough-street; the magistrate then ordered a search warrant, and sent one of the officers along with me, and we went and found the horse according to the description that he had given before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive it is the same horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he first met me on the road, I told him that I had got the horse which I took in my drunkenness, but the horse is very safe; he said, will you go along with me? I said, I will go with you; and we went to the Red Lion, and when we got to the Red Lion he said he would forgive me if he could get the horse; and when he and the constable went in with the search warrant, I stood at the door, and the constable went in to look at the horse, he told me to run away any where from the door, as soon as he had seen and was satisfied it was his horse. He knows I only took the horse in a frolic.</p>
               <p> Court to Prosecutor. Did you say to him that you would forgive him? - No, I did not. I lost a mare about this time twelve month, and I have a strong suspicion that this is the man that took it.</p>
               <p> Prisoner. I have been at home but nine weeks from abroad.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him? - I see him a horse back on the 24th of last month, in the evening, coming by me at the corner of the Black Lion-lane, in Westburne-green.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the evening? - Between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was he on? - It appeared to me to be a kind of a darkish bay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the horse? - I see it many times on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whose it was? - No, I did not till I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Mr. Goton about it? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think the horse that you see in Marlborough-street was the same that you see the prisoner on? - I have reason to think it was, but it was, much altered.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it altered? - The mane and tail had been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. But though the mane and tail was cut, do you think it was or was not the same horse? - I must incline to think it was the same indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. What size was this horse? - I cannot say; I am no judge of horses; it may be thirteen or fourteen hands high.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to our house, and I see him pass with the gentleman's horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - On Westburne-green.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - On the 24th of August; about half after seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - He asked me if there were any of his comrades at our house. I told him no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured horse was it that you see him on? - A bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house a public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What is the value of this horse? - About five pounds. I was bid five pounds one shilling for him last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the horse that you found was the same horse that you lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the prosecutor met me on the green he challenged me with the horse, and I told him I would tell him where it was; and when we had walked some distance on the road, he told me if I would tell him where it was he would freely forgive me, and I begged and prayed that he would for it was merely a drunken frolic; I told him that I met the horse on the road. Accordingly we went into the Red Lion, and Mr. Townsend came in and asked me whether he had got me in custody? he said, he had; he said, he hoped he would keep me. As soon as Mr. Townsend was gone from the room, he said, as soon as I have gone in and seen the horse and was satisfied that it was his horse, do you make your escape, and told me to run as fast as I could, and that I might run any where,all he wanted, he said, was to have his horse. I immediately spoke to the man that was with him, and says, that I did not think he would do what he said; the man said, he would be bound for him that he would, and I said, I hoped he would, for I would not wish for it to go to the regiment. We went from there to the King and Queen, in Paddington, and we had some bread and cheese there, and he charged me with the constable there. As to the mane and tail of the horse it was as I found it.</p>

               <p>Q. What corps do you belong to? - The second regiment of the Queen's dragoon guards; part of them lay now at Norwich. The paymaster of the regiment was to be here, but I don't know the reason he is not here.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got up could you distinguish where the entry had been? - Yes, it had been made by the dining parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to be affected? - The window was not up, the blind was cut in two places, and the window shutter was broke all to pieces, it had been effected by listing up the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an inside shutter, I suppose? - An inside shutter; the sash was down, but the bolt of the sash was not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. What street did the dining room look into? - Into <placeName id="t17950916-5-crimeloc23">Hereford street, Park-street, in the parish of St. George's, Hanover-square</placeName>

               <p>Q. When you came down, in consequence of the alarm, in what state did you find the furniture, of the house? - I found several parcels tied up; among other things there were five silk curtains tied up, a bed, and four small inlaid boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find an enamelled box? - No, I cannot speak to that. Two silk curtains belonging to the drawing room, and two belonged to the dining parlour; they were not up, they were taken down when the family went out of town, and put up in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen them the day before? - Not to observe them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine any other parts of the house? - We examined the whole of the house, and found the stable door was open, and the area door was open, that is unlocked, and the house door was unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the persons, whoever they were, that had broke in, had made their escape? - We found none in the house. There had been two or three locks picked open; the locks of two small boxes and one chest, in which they found the two boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the stable communicate with the house? - It does.</p>

               <p>Q. Now you will tell me in what manner it was usual to fasten the parlour window? - I cannot speak particularly how it was fastened that night. My mother has not long had the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that there is a kind of bolt used for keeping the shutters fast? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or your mother pay the rent of the house? - It is my mother's house; I have nothing to do with it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You was servant to Mrs. Willes at the time this matter happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the dining room was fastened that looks into Hereford-street? - The shutters shut from the top to the bottom, and then rasten by a bar which goes across the middle I went round the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160015"/>house as the clock was striking eleven, to see that all was fast; they were fastened with the bar that went across, I fastened them myself in the dusk of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten it compleatly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the usual way in which they were fastened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, fastened the asp of the window? - I had positively, both sashes; In the dusk of the evening we always make it a rule to go round.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the stable? - I fastened all in the stable, between the hours of four and five, or six in the afternoon, all the three doors; the main door has three bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect particularly bolting it that evening? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you receive any alarm? - It might be just as the watch was going half past two; I was alarmed by some dogs in the street making a great noise; it might be about ten minutes after that I perceived a shadow of a light come in at the room door, and go all round the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your room? - On the top of the house, in a small garret. I did not notice that for some time, but presently I heard the screaking of a door, or of a man walking with screaking shoes, as it seemed to me, that alarmed me, and I got up and listened, and I heard nothing; then a light came all of a sudden, which lighted the room all over, then I got out of bed and alarmed a woman that lays in another room across a little passage; I heard no more till I came back from her, then I heard a kind of shrill voice say, don't go any further, the d-ed people were up there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this voice come from? - It appeared to be on the stone stair case, as you come up the garret stairs; with that I was so frightened I had not power to speak for a few minutes; then the woman said, when I came to myself, call the watch; I immediately ran into the room and called the watch, then I called for the watchman, and he sprung his rattle, then I see the watchman turn down the area, and come into the house, then I went to the garret stairs and went and called my master; I cannot say whether I walked down stairs or tumbled down, I was so frightened. With that we searched the house, but we found no one person in it; there were some things packed up, two packages laying in the porter's half, going out of the front street door, and some in the servants hall below stairs, close to the area door; and a bed which I used to sleep on, was put into the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the bundles contained? - The bundles contained table linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Any silk curtains? - Yes; they had been packed up, having been taken down before we went out of town; there were three silk curtains in one bundle, and two damask curtains in another.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they carried to? - They were in the porter's hall, they were not there the night before; the silk curtains were packed up, but the damask curtains were not, they were laying down; the silk curtains were in a cloth, but they tied them up in another strong table cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the damask curtains silk or damask? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they the over night? - In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did you go into the stable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the stable door? - I found them all open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the stable the next morning? - Yes, between nine and ten.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing? - Yes, I have got the articles into my pocket, several trinkets.</p>


               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160016"/>Q. Do you know whether or not they are the property of your mistress? - I can not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any snuff box there? - No</p>
               <p>Willis. They are only a few garnets and beads, of no sort of value, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Jones, I found them at the bottom of some steps that goes out into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the window before Mr. Willis saw it? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it together? - Yes; the sash was down, not fastlened down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fastening to the sash? - I don't think there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that you said about dusk? - I went round then and fastened all the 
shutters.</p>


               <p>Willis. There was a hasp to the sash, but it appeared to be broke, or so stiff that it could not be used.</p>
               <p>Q. To Jones Do you recollect any thing about fastening the hasp? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley, I take it for granted that you usually fasten the hasp when you go round? - The window was down, and I cannot say further.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is your usual way? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you find the iron bar? - The bar was not taken from the shutter, but the wood work was cut out, and two iron hinges broke in two, and the wood shoved out from under the bar.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make an alarm on the night of the 19th of August? - I did, near on half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your beat? - In Park-street, joining to Green street, rather better than an hundred yards from Mrs. Willis's house; the rattles seemed to me to spring from Oxford-road, and I directly went away from my beat to go to the rattles, and just as I got to the corner of Hereford street, another watchman that is not here, ran over with his light.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mrs. Willes from the corner of Hereford street? - It may be ten or twelve yards; Mr. Willes is the second door from the corner of Park-street; just as I was going to turn the corner, the prisoner at the bar was standing rather against the post, or near to it, whether he touched it or not I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that post? - The very corner of Hereford-street; after I past him I thought that he made a step to follow me,but he did not, I thought he was coming after me to follow me up to the door by his movement, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - I am; in about ten minutes after that he came to me at Mr. Willes's door, and one of the Mary-le-bone watchmen was along with him, and I said to the Mary-le-bone watchman, making an observation on Mr. Willes's house, that some of the glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What pane of glass did you allude to? - It was the parlour window, the lower one.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean of Mr. Willes's house? Yes, the nearest square of glass to the front door; with that the prisoner at the bar comes up -</p>
               <p>Q. Had he come up before you made the observation? - We were looking at it when he came up, the prisoner comes up and says, d - mn me, hold your lanthorn over there, and let me look, it is impossible for any man to get in there; I made him answer and said. I don't know, they might for any thing I can tell; he then says again, I am a man of property, and perhaps of as much property as the gentleman that belongs to this house; I then made answer to him, perhaps you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160017"/>may, for any thing that I know, and if you have you had better to be at home minding of it, than to be out at this late hour in the morning; after that he directly walks round the corner in Park street, he was then absent from me about ten minutes longer; he then comes back again, and comes up to the door, I set my lanthorn down at the front of the door, on the step; he then fits himself along side of it;

             le-bone watchman said, it is pretty near three o'clock; yes, says I, I believe it is; the watchman then went away, and I walked over to the other side from the street, facing Mr. Willes's door, and the clock had struck three whilst I was there standing; he said watchman, you may go and cry the hour,(he was then sitting by the side of my lantorn, at Mr. Willes's door, at that time) you may go and cry the hour, I will sit here at the door, as I am a man of property, while you are gone; and I made reply again, I do not want you to tell me my duty, if I don't know it, I will not ask you to shew it me; with that he got up and walked away, went round into Park-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him any more? - Not till he was brought back again to Mr. Willes's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this glass of the window broke? - No, it was the curtain made it appear so.</p>
               <p>Q. But you thought it was broke when you made the observation? - Yes, when we made the observation.</p>

               <p>Q. I don't know whether you were present when the prisoner was searched? - I was not</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I believe at the time the prisoner came up to you, he was pretty much intoxicated? - I did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me that you did not know at the time the prisoner was not in liquor? - I cannot say whether he was or was not, for I did not take that particular notice, he might have had a little drop, but I cannot presume to say.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you are very attentive to your duty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If any man had been breaking into this house you must perceive it? - I do not go near the house, no nearer than Green-street Chapel, which is rather better than an hundred yards to the front of Mr. Willes's door; the chapel is on the right hand in Park-street, and Mr. Willes's house is on the left hand of Park-street, in Hereford-street; my beat from the chapel is to come forward to Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square, and then back again up into Park-lane, and part of Norfolk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you go on your beat? - At nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you remained there until this period? - Yes</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you walk up and down on this beat? - Every hour, and every half hour.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after that the watchman said he supposed the window was broke, that this conversation passed with the prisoner? - It was; I thought he had been a servant in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had pleased to have gone away, you would not have prevented it? - He might have gone away from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If he had been in a state of complete intoxication, must not you have observed it? - she had I must have observed it, but he might have had some little.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any rattles spring on the 19th of August, at night? - I did not, the patrol called to me, and told me that there were rattles springing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160018"/>Q. Where did you go in consequence of that information? - I went along Mount-street, and made for Park-street; after I got into Park-street I see the men go along with their lanthorns very fast, and I pursued after the lanthorns, till I came into North-row, there I see a parcel of watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that at the back of Hereford-street? - It is; I asked the watchmen what was the matter? and they said there was a house broke open; after that I was making into Mr. Willes's stable.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door of the stable? - Wide open, the door opens into Northrow; I was going into the stable to see what was the matter, I met the prisoner at the bar coming out; I am certain he is the man; as he came out of the stable he looks up to the top of the house; I see he had a pair of turned down top boots, the straps turned down, and I judged him to be a servant belonging to Mr. Willes's house, I took no more notice of him, but goes on through the stable into the house, where I see Mr. Willes with a poker in his hand, and his servant along with him; we hunted about the house, but could find nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this man. the prisoner, again? - I never see him till after I came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate what you see to Mr. Willes? - I did, after a bit; the servant went and got the keys of the stable, and he said, he could not think which way the door was unlocked, and unbolted, for he found the key in the same place where he put it at five o'clock in the evening; I made answer and said, I dare say it was your fellow servant, for I met your fellow servant coming out of the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of what the servant told you? - As soon as the servant told me he had no fellow servant, I went out of the house and asked the patrol where that man was, with a pair of boots on? he said, he had been black guarding there, and had gone down to Park-street; with that I immediately set out after him, and told them if I could see him I would bring him back again; I overtook him just in the middle of Grosvenor-street, as he was crossing out of Park-street; I catched him in the centre of the street, I clapped my arm on his shoulder, and I told him that he was my prisoner, for I took him on suspicion of breaking into Mr. Willes's house; he told me I had no business to collar him, for he was a gentleman of property, and he would not go back with me, I told him he should, and I kept hold of him till I met the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go back willingly or not? - Not very willingly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he would not go back more than once? - Not more than once; I said I would take him back to Mr. Willes, and if he chose to set him at liberty, well and good, but I did not; I took him back only part of the way, and then delivered him up to the two patrols, and they carried him to Mr. Willes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say you were going your beat, and that extends part of Park-street, and part of Mount-street; I take it for granted that it is usual for each watchman to go their own beat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Unless on extraordinary occasions you do not go out of your beat? - We do not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after the rattles sprung that you came out of Mount-street? - I did not hear them spring, I was told they sprung.</p>
               <p>Q. But in consquence of that you went into North row? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you went into the house, and the prisoner had passed you, and you met the gentleman of the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160019"/>and his servant, and you examined the house along with them, that occupied some time; now what distance was it that you met the prisoner, from the house, when you apprehended him? - I cannot say positively, I dare say it may be about an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be occupied about the house? - Nigh half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found this man only about four hundred yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. You had bolted the outer stable door, had that a lock to it? - Yes, the outer door had a lock, and I took the key from that door, and the key of the coach-house, and laid them on a shelf in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the other keys? - I left them in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And found them in the door - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the key of the outer stable door? - On the shelf, where I laid it, in the same place</p>
               <p>Q. To Wade. Did you see any thing of Dawson that night? - I never see him till he came out of Willes's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had not given Dawson any information? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see the prisoner near the stable? - No, I never see him nearer the stable than the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen the prisoner before you see Dawson? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him in Park-street before Dawson came out? - Yes; I heard him enquire which was the way; he had gone near ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. To Dawson. You said that when you apprehended the prisoner, he was about four hundred yards from Mr. Willes's, and you then had been about half an hour about the house; from what time do you mean? - From the time that I see him till I went out after him; we had been looking about the house about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you came out of the house, before you see Wade? - Not a minute, I don't believe it was, for he stood right facing the door; I was speaking to the patrol as well as Wade, and asked them where the man was? and they said he was gone down Park-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you pursued down immediately on the information that you received from the patrol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took him? - Not above three or four minutes; he was speaking to a watchman in the street.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a patrol? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to this house in consequence of any alarm? - Yes; I was standing in Park-street, at the head of Mount-street; the watchman was going half past two, I heard a rattle spring, and I apprehended it was from Oxford-road; I ran along Park-street as fast as I could; I went into North-row, seeing a number of the watchman standing about the stable door; the stable door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Whole stable door? - Mr. Willes's stable door. I immediately went into the stable, which communicates with the dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the stable had Dawson come up? - Dawson was up before me; he out ran me; he was the first person that I see in the house after going into the body of the house; I likewise went along with Mr. Willes and the servant, in order to search the different rooms and apartments. After I came out I see the prisoner at the bar standing at the corner of Hereford-street, in Park-street, when I went into the stable I went through the house, and came out at the area door, in Hereford-street; after com<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160020"/>ing out of Hereford-street I see the prisoner at the bar, standing at the post, at the corner of Hereford-street, in Park street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - William James, the other patrol. Says he, gentlemen, I think it would be more proper for you to be on your walks, than to many of you here. I made answer, that it was our duty to come to the sound of a rattle, or any cry, that we did not mean to stay any longer than such a sort of business required. My partner, James, then spoke to him; he said to him, who are you sir. who are so very inquisitive about our business: He made answer and said, that he was a man of property, and a housekeeper, and very probably he had as much to lose as that gentleman whom they had attempted to rob. I turned about and went to the patrols that belong to that ward. I did not see him again till Dawson took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more before Dawson took him? - He said an hour or half an hour was no object to him, and he would wait there to see that we all dispersed. I see no more of him till Dawson had him in custody, four or five minutes after, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Dawson delivered him into your custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take him? - To Mount street watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go quietly? - Yes. He wanted to go by the way of his own house; we told him he must not, he might send for any body he wanted when he got to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on him - Nothing but a bit of chalk and a bit of twine about fifteen inches long.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The time that the prisoner gave you a bit of civil advice, was the first time that you had an opportunity of seeing him? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you disperse after this? - We did, as soon as Mr. Willes had fastened the door and windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Wade that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Wade when you first saw him? - He was at the front of the house in Hereford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner or Wade first? - I see Wade first about half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any conversation between the prisoner and Wade? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not guilty of the burglary, nor do I know any thing at all of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray where did the prisoner live? - I really cannot tell you, somewhere about Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and he drinking together that evening? - We were. I was superintendant in the house this day; the landlord of the house was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what time do you recollect the prisoner came there? - The prisoner came to the house about nine, within a few minutes under or over, on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week? - I cannot recollect. He left the house about a quarter or it may be twenty minutes, I cannot be particular to a few minutes, or half an hour after one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he been occupied during the time he was in the house? What I want to know is whether, in point of fact, he had been drinking during the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160021"/>he had been in the house? - He had. He expected two or three to meet him there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think he was perfectly in a sober state when he left the house? - No, he was not; I cannot pretend to say he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been drinking a deal of liquor? - He and his friends had been drinking a few pots of beer; but they got some spirits in the mean time, though I did not serve it them, I got it for them, and they paid me for it. I should have thought bed would have been the best place for him.</p>

               <p>Q. He expected some friends to meet him there? - Yes, he had three or four friends come there about half after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. And they all went out together? - Yes, altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of these friends? - Really I cannot tell that. I knew but one man, and he has gone into the country with a gentleman.</p>

               <p>I wanted to convey a letter to Mr. Brathwaite, to return half a guinea that he sent me by my little girl, which, for particular reasons, I did not think proper to accept; I wrote it at a watchmaker's shop, in Holborn, one Mr. Pearce's.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? - On Saturday, the 23d of May, between ten and eleven in the morning. I wrote the letter to Mr. Brathwaite; I said, 'Sir, ingratitude is not my characteristic, nor I hope never will be; it is impossible I can permit the inclosed to be received, it was given to my little girl.' I then inclosed the half guinea in a piece of paper, and then put the paper and half guinea into the letter, wafered it, and then sealed it carefully down with an instrument from the watchmaker's shop board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wafer that bit of paper that you put the half guinea in? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fix it under the seal? - No, I did not; but I put it in that situation which I conceived more secure; then I put it in the letter, and put a cover over that letter to prevent its being soiled.</p>
               <p>Q. But before you put this cover on this letter, did you put a wafer to this letter? - Yes, I secured the letter very proper as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter was secured by a wafer you say, did you put a cover over that? - I put a piece of paper over that to prevent its being foiled.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the direction? - On the letter, and I put the blank cover on it, to prevent my hand from dirtying it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that blank cover sealed? - No, it was not. I made a reference to Mr. Pearce, he was at work in his shop, says I, do you think this is safe? I wrote the letter and put the half guinea in it in his shop; I then said, I wished that I had somebody that I could send this letter to the Post office by; Mr. Pearce made answer, if my <placeName id="t17950916-6-crimeloc28">porter</placeName>

I then went down to the porter's house and I saw the porter's wife, the prisoner's wife,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160022"/>Rainsley, he is porter to the foreign office, I asked where her husband was? she said he was up at the office; I asked her if the would be so obliging as to let her daughter deliver that letter to her husband, to deliver it to Mr. Braithwaite.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to? - To the porter's daughter. She returned in the course of twelve or fifteen minutes; says she, I have delivered to him, and he will deliver it directly. I said, my dear, I am very much obliged to you, I have no money now, if I had I would give you something for your trouble. I returned again the same evening between eight and nine o'clock, and I see the prisoner standing at the door, I said to him, Rainsley, did you deliver that letter to Mr. Brathwaite? he said, no, he had not; I asked what was the reason? he answered, because he was out of town. I was satisfied with that answer, and conversed with him for some time after, it may be twelve or twenty minutes; I said, you will give me the letter I will not trouble you, I will take it to the house myself, and give it to his maid; I said, I am sorry you have neglected delivering it, I wish you had left it He said, no, sir, I will deliver it on Monday; I said, I will not trouble you as you have not delivered it, I am determined to take it myself. After some hesitation I was admitted into his room where he lives, and before I got in I heard a kind of whisper, a found like 'st 'st; when I got in, I said, Rainsley, give me the letter, if you please; he gave it me, and prior to the opening of that letter I said, Rainsley, Mrs. Rainsley, and young man, come here, and I opened the letter before them, and the half guinea was gone</p>
               <p>Q. Rainsley gave you the letter you said? - Yes, or his wife; I cannot tell which, out of a drawer in the house. I imagined the half guinea was gone, frora the outside, before I opened it, and when I opened the letter I read the contents to Rainsley, and I said to Rainsley, where is the contents, the half guinea? he said there was no half guinea; I said, there was an half guinea, and by God it must be returned; he said, it was a likely story that I should send Mr. Brathwaite half a guinea; I told him I should not condescend to explain to him the reason, but there was half a guinea sent to him in the letter. Then he abused me very much, he insulted me very much, and took a view of my dress, and the son also. I felt myself very much hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the paper in the letter? - The paper nor the half guinea was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put in so loose that it might tumble out? - From the appearance of the letter the wafer was opened, but I do not present to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the letter with the wafer wet or dry? - Dry.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the letter or wafer, did you expect any thing had been done to it at the time? - No, I did not at the time. I then left the house and went on Monday morning to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife say any thing at this time? - No, she returned abuse, and treated me with a vast deal of contempt, in consequence of my supposed authority. I went, on Monday, to Guildhall, and related to Mr. Alderman Coombs what I have related to your lordship and asked his advice, he answered that it was a very awkward piece of business, and he thought I had better drop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know the fact one way or the other, whether Mr. Brathwaite was or was not in town? - I cannot ascertain that. I endeavoured to subpoena him to prove that, but he is gone out of town a very great distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not had your half guinea? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160023"/>Mr. Fielding. Look at these gentleman. How long is it since you was dismissed from the Post office? - Four years last May.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has that man at the bar been at the office? - A long time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you presented your memorial to the Post office for reinstatement, in consequence of which the secretary and Mr. Brathwaite sent you half a guinea a piece? - In the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Before I go any further be so good as to tell these gentlemen how you get your living now? - By honest labour. I am in the army way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send your memorial by? - By my little girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing given to your little girl? - No, it was money that I claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no money given to your little girl? - Yes, this half guinea was given to my little girl, but I could not receive it, because I was defending myself against a report of Mr. Brathwaite's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took it into your head to return this half guinea? - I think I received it on Thursday, and I returned it on Saturday; I think it was the 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you write this letter? - At the watch-maker's, in <placeName id="t17950916-6-crimeloc29">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Q. How came you to write the letter there? - Because I knew the person, and it was near where I did my business; I wrote it there because I shewed my friend my resentment, and I went there to ask him to let his porter take it to save the expence of a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had written this letter, what was to prevent you from carrying it to Mr. Brathwaite yourself? - From point of delicacy, as I had been in the Post office I did not like to deliver it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it to this man's house? - It was his duty to deliver it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his house at the office? - No, but he was on duty, and it was his duty to receive all letters directed to his superiors. I supposed to find the porter at home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found he was not at home, but his wife, why could not you have as well taken the letter yourself as send it by the child? - I have related the reason once, and I have no other reason whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. In the evening you had the curiosity to come back again to the house? - Yes, and I will tell you the reason of that curiosity. There was a very unpleasant circumstance had happened at the office, and I wished to know the nature of it; but I had not the most distant doubt of his sincerity at the time. In the course of the conversation I asked him if he had delivered the letter? he told me he had not, "the reason was because Mr. Brathwaite was gone out of town; I was satisfied with that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not contented that he should keep the letter till Mr. Brathwaite came to town? - I did it from this principle, as I had no money to give him I would take it myself to Mr. Brathwaite's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You was angry at him for not having left the letter in the office? - I was rather displeased.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your letter was given you again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you told us that you called his wife and the son when you opened the letter, for what purpose was that? - That they might all see the half guinea was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. So when you said there had been a half guinea in this letter they were all angry? - No; they took a review of my dress and so on.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brathwaite was the occasion of your being dismissed from the office? - I fancy so; after he superceded me he said, the office wanted weeding, and he offered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160024"/>me an annuity of sixty pounds a year to resign, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing else after the alderman had dismissed this complaint? - He said I had better summons him, and I took the summons myself, and gave it to his wife; and she said, go along you fool to Bath; and flung the summons in my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attend the summons before the alderman? - He did; but there was no merit in that, for he must. The alderman said he could not grant a warrant, I had better go to the grand jury, and relate my story there, he could not grant a warrant. This was on the 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you prefer your indictment? - As soon as the grand jury met.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had indicted him you took him up by a warrant? - Yes, a certificate was given me, and he was taken up and carried before Alderman Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you opopose his being bailed there? - Not in the first instance; in the second instance I did. He abused me very much, and the clerk said it was not bailable, and there I left it. There were two gentlemen there ready to have bailed him I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me when it was that you took it into your head to address a letter to my lord Chesterfield? - I took it into my head to write a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote to him the 2d of July, I believe? - (A letter shewn him) That is my letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the contents of the letter? - I dare say I do.</p>
               <p>The letter read.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, with the greatest respect and humility I beg leave to address your lordship, as his Majesty's post-master general, being a duty I owe myself in particular and the public in general, to acquiant your lordship of the following fact. In consequence of the last memorial I had of presenting to your lordship, I sent to the secretary for answer by my little girl; Mr. - knowing the child belonged to me, politely made her a present of half a guinea, Mr. Brathwaite also made her a present of half a guinea, which I could not permit to be received, and returned the half guinea in a letter by Mr. Rainsley, the porter in the foreign office; with the particulars of Rainsley's conduct; I shall not intrude upon your lordship's time, but only observe that I have related the whole of the transaction to the grand jury of the City of London, who have found a true bill against the said

            , for a capital offence, and he is committed to take his trial at the Old-bailey. The grand jury expressed their surprise that I did not acquaint Mr. Brathwaite of the robbery; I told them I did when I sent the half guinea. Mr. Brathwaite has permitted Rainsely to attend at the office, &amp;c. without ever enquiring into the truth; and at the very time of his being taken from his duty Mr. Brathwaite ordered Messrs. - to bail the man, if Mr. Brathwaite did not know his duty, I knew mine, and could not permit him to be bailed, &amp;c.

               <p>I am a watch maker, in Holborn, about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 23d of May, Mr. Rowning coming to your shop? - Perfectly well. He related that he had received a present from Mr. Brathwaite of half a guinea; and he observed, that he could no in conscience put it into his own pocket, because he had an affair at take with Mr. Brathwaite. He then wrapped it in a small piece of paper and enclosed it in a letter, and then sealed it with a wafer.</p>
               <p>Q. He first enclosed the half guinea in a small piece of paper; Did he put any wafer or seal to that? - I did not perceive that he did. He then put the piece of paper with the half guinea into half a street of paper and folded it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how it was solded? - I cannot describe that. He then sealed that letter with a wafer, and took an implement that we use and jagged the wafer to prevent its opening of itself; he then asked if my porter was in the way, that he might convey this letter for him to Mr. Brathwaite, at the Post office? I answered, he was not in the way, if he was he should take it down for him with pleasure, Mr. Rowning then put the letter into his pocket and went down, as I conceived, to the Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he enquired for the porter, will you take on yourself to say that the half guinea was in the letter? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Rowning drew your attention to what he did? - He merely asked my advice whether I supposed it would fall cut</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he had the curiosity to ask you, as you had seen the half guinea put in, to have the goodness to accompany him, and to take care that it was delivered into the Post office? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not request you to attend him that there might be no mistake in the midway? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. He carried away this letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry it away immediately, while it was yet wet? - It was yet wet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Prosecutor. (A letter shewn him) Is that your hand writing? - Yes, it is. This is the letter I afterwards sent to Mr. Brathwaite with the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You observe it is dated the 23d of May? - It is the 23d of May. (Read)"Ingratitude is not my characteristic,&amp;c. (as before.) I inclosed the half guinea to you this day week, which Mr. Rainsley thought proper to detain the letter and embezzle the money."</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160026"/>Q. Do you remember a letter being given to you by Rowning? - Yes; he came about ten or eleven o'clock, and said, Mrs. Rainsley, have you a little boy that will take this letter, and if you will lay out a penny or two-pence I will pay you when I have money, for I have not money now. My mother said she was very sorry he was so much like herself; he asked if none of the neighbours children would go? my mother said she did not like to trouble them; and then he asked if I would go? my mother said she did not know how to spare me, but as it was to oblige him I should go. I went up with the letter, and my father was gone up to Christ's Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this, Saturday? - I do not recollect the month or the day of the month. Mr. Rowning desired me to give it to no one but my father, for my father to deliver it to Mr. Brathwaite.</p>
               <p>Q. Not finding your father at the office what did you do with the letter? - I brought the letter back and laid it on the top of the drawers, the same as he delivered it into my hand. My father was gone to Christ's Hospital, as I understood, for one of the clerks of the Post office. Before I came back Mr. Rowning was gone, and that our lodger knows, she was securing the stairs the same time as he went out, before I came home with the letter. After this a gentleman came from Camberwell, his wife was very ill, and he came for me, and I went with him, and did not come home till Monday morning; I went about six o'clock on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home when Mr. Rowning came in the evening? - I was not above a quarter of an hour going to the office and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your brother there at the time that man came in? - Yes; he is out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the letter? - When I went out it was on the top of the drawers, as Mr. Rowning left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor, Mr. Rowning, after this letter was delivered to you? - No, I could not, because I had not seen my father.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Rowning had delivered you the letter, did you see Mr. Rowning any more on Saturday? - No, I did not; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never told Mr. Bowning that you delivered it to your father? - No, he was gone before I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you never did? - Yes, I tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Mr. Rowning has sworn that you told him so, he has sworn that that is false - I tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rowning has sworn in plain terms that you told him that you had delivered that letter to your father? - I never see him till the Thursday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him on Thursday? - No, I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have never spoke to him after he delivered the letter to you? - No, never at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were at home of your family at that time? - There were my mother, my father, and my sister, and myself, and our lodger. He came to know whether my father had delivered the letter to Mr. Brathwaite, and my father told him he had not, because as he was not in town he could not deliver it till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Brathwaite out of town? - Yes, I know he was, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Rowning say on that? - He said, can I see that letter again?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160027"/>my father says to me, Sam, go and fetch the letter that laid on the top of the drawers. I went and brought it, and gave it into his hands; he came in doors with the letter, and my mother was ironing, and our lodger was sitting in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the letter before he came into the house? - Yes, I gave it him as he stood at the door. When he came in he broke open the letter and said, where is the half guinea that was in it? my father said, if there was a half guinea in the letter it is there now; he said, he would he upon his oath that he put half a guinea in the letter; my father told him that he knew nothing at all about it, and did not like such expressions in the neighbourhood, and he begged he would depart; and he brought a summons in about a week after from the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the alderman? - Yes; but Mr Rowning pushed me out and said I had no business there</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You were at the door when Mr. Rowning came? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your father come home that night? - About a quarter before two, to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the letter then? - No, he did not; he took it up in his hand and said it could not be delivered before Monday, for Mr. Brathwaite was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter lay then from the time that your sister brought it back till night, except when your father took hold of it. - Yes.</p>

               <p>I had a silk handkerchief took out of my pocket, I think it was the 14th of August; it cost me seven shillings and three pence; I should suppose it was very little the worse for wear; it never was washed; it was on <placeName id="t17950916-7-crimeloc33">Snow-hill</placeName>

I did not see any body take it at all; a woman that was sweeping the street said, there goes the man that picked your pocket; I turned round as quick as I could to pursue him; says she, him in the green coat; I called out, stop the pick pocket. I ran as fast as I could, and he ran likewise; but the crowd thickened, and he was taken about thirty rods from the place where he took my pocket handkerchief; he slung the handkerchief away, and it was picked up. I did not see the picking of the handkerchief up, but I thought I see it fly in the air.</p>

               <p>On Friday, the 14th of August, between one and two in the afternoon, I was at the end of the Old-bailey; I heard the cry of stop thief! I looked up Giltspur street, and I see the prisoner at the bar running; before I came up to him I see him throw the handkerchief out of his hand; I did not stop to pick it up then, I had it afterwards; I followed the prisoner and took him running, about one hundred yards off. The gentleman came up, says he, he has picked my pocket of the handkerchief.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160028"/> I took the man to the counter, the prosecutor went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did the last witness give you a handkerchief which he had picked up? - Yes; he gave it to me to look at, and asked him if it was mine? I told to the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Giltspur-street, and I heard the cry of stop thief, and the man ran by me, and he crossed over towards Cock-lane; which is nearly facing, and in crossing over be threw the handkerchief from him. The man came and took hold of me, and let him run forward.</p>

            , the other prisoner, she seemed to want to push by me; I had no idea of what they were about as they were so genteelly well dressed. Presently, after a very genteel dressed man brushed opposite me, he had new boots and leather breeches on, dressed as if he had come off a ride or going out; brushed between me and the prisoner Hannah, and said, ma'am, that is the house that was attacked last night, meaning the crimping house, my servant that was walking behind me said, ma'am, have you lost any thing? I put my hand into my pocket and said, good God, James, I have lost my purse; on which he went after them, and took this woman, Mary, and brought her into Mr. Potter's, the haberdasher's shop, where I stood with her while he went in pursuit of the other woman and took her, and they were both taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a purse was it you missed? - It was one of the patent purses, a striped one, whether it was a silk or a mixture I don't know; I gave four shillings and sixpence for it, but I had had it some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the purse? - Five guineas, and four sixpences of the new coin, and one shilling at the other end.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The commitment only said four guineas? - It must be a fault then, for I had five.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been walking about London that morning? - No, I had been no further than through the Park. What makes me so particular about the silver that was in my purse, I stopped at Mr. Green's, in Bond street, where I laid out two shillings out of the three that I had. As near as I can tell, then, it must be from twelve to one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160029"/>Q. When the street becomes a good deal crowded; so from Mrs. Green's till you had some conversation with your servant, you had no conversation to consult your purse? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Charing Cross, I believe there was a great crowd there? - No, there were not, not above five or six people.</p>
               <p>Q. The house had been gutted, had it not? - I don't know any thing about it, but the man that passed said, Ma'am, that is the house that was attacked last night.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that one of the prisoners pushed against you, as if she wanted to pass you, as you wanted to pass her? - I was between these two women, the further woman interrupted my passing on, and the other seemed to want to pass me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a person came up to you in a blue coat, and caught your attention? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That happened before any charge was made against these two women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the woman went readily with you, and desired to be searched? -She said we were welcome to search her, and she turned every thing out of her pockets, and she asked, ma'am, did you find my hand in your pocket? no, I said if I had, you should not have got it out so easily.</p>
               <p>Jury. Pray what time was it you were at Charing Cross? - Between three and and four; I believe it was.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a widow we understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it that this happened at your shop, that you have come to relate? - The 20th day of last July, about three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160030"/>o'clock in the afternoon; the two prisoners came into the shop to look at some muslin handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at this time? - Only myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them by sight before, or were they strangers to you? - Entire strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. On their asking to look at some muslin handkerchiefs, what did you do? - I shewed them some, they bought one, and paid me a shilling in part.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price they agreed for? - Half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both bargain with you? - They both whispered together, but it was Hill that bought the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the earnest? - Herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about it? -She told me she would give me the shilling, and she would come again by and by, and have the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. That you agreed to, did you? - Yes; then after a little while they left the shop and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they seen any other articles than the muslin handkerchiefs? - They looked at some cottons, a great many; they took them up in their hands as they hung up, and asked the price.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they look at as they hung up? - Cottons for gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. But they did not bargain with you for any of the cottons? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in your shop altogether at this time; what time do you imagine they staid? - I cannot say justly, it might be ten minutes,</p>
               <p>Q. And then they went out together? - Yes, both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you miss any thing, either during the time that they staid in your shop, or after they were gone? - Neither, till a gentleman came to the door, and asked me if I had lost any thing (Mr. Algar.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long after they wore gone, did Mr. Algar come to your door? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a neighbour of your's? - No, I never see him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence of some enquiry from Mr. Algar, did you then miss any thing? - Yes, I looked immediately, and desired him to run after them.</p>
               <p>Q. On Mr. Algar's coming to you, what was it you missed from your shop? - The first was dimity, that stood in the window, and a gentleman's worked muslin handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss the handkerchief from? - It hung in the window also.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you acquainted Mr. Algar of this, and he went in pursuit you understood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see them come into the shop, and you see them go out of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had they of taking these things, and your not observing them? - I did not see them, the door is at the edge of the window, and I was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the door face the counter? - It is at the end, the counter goes up end ways to the window, and the door is at the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed only these two articles then? - Not then I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of the prisoners? - Mr. Algar ran after them, and brought them back in a very short time, it might be five or ten minutes</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before Mr. Algar brought the prisoners back, and after he had given you the alarm, missed any thing else? - No, I did not look, I was so surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring them back to your shop, do you mean that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought to your shop, what passed? - There were another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160031"/>or two with Mr. Algar, one was Mr. Pearce, and the other was a person named Hobdill, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought back to your shop, was there any search made? - The constable was with them, and they searched them, and then took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them searched? - No, I did not, I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when they came back? - I asked them why they robbed me of my goods? they said they had got none; and while we were talking Mr. Algar brought the goods in himself; the constable was in before with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Algar bring the prisoners back, or the constable? - The constable came in with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Algar bring with him? - He brought all the property with him, some cambrick which I sell at twelve shillings a yard, near two yards of it, not quite; the dimity that I had missed from the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not missed the cambrick till that time? - No; another muslin handkerchief I missed, and a dirty yard of muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring the muslin handkerchief likewise? - Yes, altogether, and about a yard of muslin, and a lace cap.</p>
               <p>Q. As to two of these articles you had missed them before, but what do you say to the cambrick, the yard of muslin, and lace cap how do you know they were your's? - They were in the shop before, I am sure of it; they had been in a box where I had been taking some handkerchiefs out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that box stand? - On the counter, where I was shewing them the handkerchiefs out of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the handkerchief which Hill had agreed for, was not the handkerchief that was taken away? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen them in the same box? - While I was looking the handkerchiefs out I see them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you see them then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not missed them before Algar returned? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them first afterwards? - As soon as Mr. Algar brought them in.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things that were so found? - They tossed them over the pales before he got at them.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking you now as to your own knowledge, what became of the articles after they were produced at your shop? - Tied up in an handkerchief, and the constable took them with him.</p>

               <p>Q. And they are here I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. You say you are a widow woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any family live with you? - I had one daughter, but she was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner in your business? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you taken any account of your goods in your shop? - About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold any article in the course of that day, the same sort as these we are talking about? - I don't know that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear to the best of your recollection, that you had not sold any articles of the same quality in the course of that day? - I can, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons do you think might have been in your shop, and purchased different articles, in the course of that day? - Nothing of that sort as I know of that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Hill was the person that looked at this box, that my lord has been asking about? - Yes, she was the person.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a place where they had gone by? - Yes, it was at the turning of St. George's-row where they threw them over.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them throw them over? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing the things lay there, what did you do, did you take them? - Yes; the officer and me first took the girls to Mrs. Tidd's.</p>
               <p>Q. Leaving the things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not take them by the things, and pick up the things? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after having taken the things to Mrs. Tidd, what was done? - The officer desired me to go and fetch the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to? - To the corner of St. George's-row, in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pick up there? - I picked up a piece of dimity, and a gentleman's half handkerchief, and a piece of irish, and two muslin handkerchiefs, and a soldier's stock, and a cap, and a piece of cambrick.</p>

               <p>Q. This parcel, whatever it contained, was above a hundred yards from you when you first see it? - I dare say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was not possible for you at that distance, to know what it contained? - No, I did not know what it did contain.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a public path, were you were pursuing these women? - Yes, but they went over into the field, over some high pales.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you did not take up the parcel then, but you took the prisoners away, back again to Mrs. Tidd's. How<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160034"/>long a time might clapse from the time that you left the parcel in the field, to the time that you got to Mrs. Tidd's and back again? - I don't know, it might be ten minutes, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the parcel was laying there all this time, in this field, a hundred yards from the path, and so it was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Many persons in the course of a quarter of an hour pass this path? - Yes, I dare say they do, I am not well acquaint ed with the place, I have not been there long.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a plumber and glazier, and headborough of Hoxton. On Monday, the 10th of July, I was going with some goods of my own business into French-row, to do a job; I see Mr. Algar running very fast, and I enquired of a girl that stood by what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of any informations you received, join Mr. Algar? - No, I went an opposite way, thinking to meet any body that be might be in pursuit of; I went past the green gate, Mr. Algar went up Ratcliff row, I went up the City-road, and looked into a field, where I supposed that the prisoners might have come, for I apprehended in my own mind, that they came down St. George's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation is the field that joins George's-row? - North west of the green gate; I see the two prisoners in that field, and I suspected them, and I approached them slowly, expecting to see the man that was in pursuit of them overtake them, which accordingly I did; when he came up to them, he said something of this nature, it is you that have stole the goods, or something like it, I cannot exactly recollect the words; and Elizabeth Hill swore at him, and made a blow at him;

             I thought behaved in a very becoming manner, she cried; I told Hill that if she made any piece of work, that I would tie them both together, I shewed her that I was an officer, and they came along with me, I took them to the prosecutrix's house (Mrs. Tidd's) I searched their pockets, and found a number of duplicates, but nothing that was of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the property was picked up in the field? - No, I see something white laying in the field, at the distance I suppose of eighty yards from the place where I stood and where I took them; my feet were almost as high as the sence; and I said to Mr. Algar, you had better go and fetch the goods, for fear they should be takes away; this was pretty near to Mrs. Tidd's house, and he went and brought the goods; what I have got in this bundle. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Tidd own them? - Yes, she owned them immediately, she said they were her goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were produced before the magistrate, and you have had the care of them? - Yes, I have had the care of them ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. So the distance where something white was discovered, was about eighty yards?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after before you see something white again? - As nigh as I can judge about six or seven minutes, I cannot tell to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Hill was pretty violent, she made use of her tongue, the other prisoner conducted herself very becoming? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hill. This gentleman told me when he came up, that I had wronged a woman; I said I had not, they did not lay hold of our hands, nor nothing, but we walked to the shop, and they searched us, and found nothing on us.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a goldsmith, No. 3, opposite St. George's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say respecting the present indictment? - I was passing at the time; I went down George's-row when I heard the cry of stop thief, I was going to pass it till I heard the noise; I see the two prisoners come running before me</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in the row when you first see them - Yes, and Mr. Algar; I see him behind them, and he hallooed out stop thief! and I see two women come running, and I did not offer to stop them, because I was afraid indeed. When they came up to me, which was in St. George's-row, where I stood, they turned round the corner, and then threw some things over into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them throw any thing in the field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say which it was? - No, I cannot positively say that, it was one of the two, but which I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it like? - It appeared to me like linen, white.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from the place? - I did not take particular notice, but I look on it it was about ten or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do on seeing it? - I walked down into the field where they ran to after they had thrown the things over.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it one or both that threw the things over? - It was but one as I observed, but which it was I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see them do? - After one had thrown the things over, they then ran down the field, by the side of it, Mr. Algar he went after them into the field, and I walked down after them into the field myself, and then I see Mr. Pearce come across the field, and he took them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the picking up of the articles - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not go back with Algar? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You never see the things at all till you got to Mrs. Tidd's? - I did not see them at Mrs. Tidd's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to Mrs. Tidd's? - Not that day, but I see the things before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at the time the things were thrown over, you were ten or fifteen yards distant; how far might you be from the corner, where the turning was? - I suppose about five yards from the corner.</p>

               <p>Q. Had they thrown the things before you turned the corner or after? - I did not turn the corner, they turned the corner; it was after they turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you see them do it? - Yes, I did, they had turned the corner, and I was opposite them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the same story; did you tell Mr. Williams that you see them throw what they did throw over into the field? - Yes. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told Mr. William's exactly as you said now? - Yes, exactly, to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that you see the prisoner in the field, but whether they had thrown away the things or not, you did not know? - No, not to my knowledge, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago were you examined before the justice? - I did not set down the time, it may be four, five or six weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say whether you said so or not before the justice? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hill. The magistrate took him back to lock me up, because he would not answer, they asked him a great many questions before he would say any thing.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160036"/>(Mrs. Tidd deposes to the things, as all having her marks on them, and were in the window, and in the box from which she shewed the handkerchief that the prisoner Hill bargained for.)</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Tidd. What is the lowest value of all these things together, that you can set on them? - Two pounds fourteen shillings and eight-pence was my selling price.</p>
               <p>Jury. What would they cost you? - About two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long might you have had these articles in your shop, may you have had them a twelvemonth? - Not a twelvemonth, I might have had some of them six months.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of dimity is there? - Eight yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hill. Sarah Dancer and I were walking up Old street, and I passed by that gentlewoman's door; we came down a turning, but what turning it was I don't know; we passed by this gentlewoman's door, and I saw this handkerchief at the window, and I went in and asked the price of it, she asked me half a crown, and I bid her two and four-pence, she said she could not take it; then after that a woman came in for half a yard of flannel, and she asked me if I was in any particular hurry? and I told her no; she told the woman she had no flannel; the woman asked her if she had any tape; the woman bought some quantity of tape of her, but what I cannot tell; I told her I would not trouble her for nothing; I bargained with her for a bed gown, and she asked me two shillings a yard, and I did not approve of the bad-gown, and I gave her a shilling off the handkerchief; she took out a piece of the bed-gown to see if I would approve of it, I said I would consider of it; I came out of the shop, and went down the street; I don't know what street it was, I see a mob, Sarah Dancer, and I made up to the mob, there were about seven or eight people, I cannot tell exactly how many; and that gentleman in a white coat tapped me on the shoulder, and said I must go along with him; I asked him where? he said I had robbed a gentlewoman; I went with them to the prosecutrix's house, and then they asked me if I had any objection to take off my things? and I said no, and they took me into a passage, and took off all my things, and they told me to put them all on again, and I did, and then they got a coach and put me into the watch-house, and then they took me before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Dancer called five witnesses who gave her a good character, said she worked at childrens pump making.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hill called two witnesses to her character, and said that she had lived in service.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of day did you see them there? - It was from twelve to two; I see them there and left them in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Any number in them? - None at all, I am sure they are these me I missed, because I took them in myself of the man. I went from there to Mr Sander's, the constable, to ask his advice, what I was to do in the business; and Mr. Supple gave a very good description of the man he bought them of, and therefore Mr. Sanders said he thought he knew the man, provided he came down in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q.

I left a gentleman's service as coachman, the 3d of July last; knowing Mr. Sanders for some years, and he knowing me, I went to lodge at his house; I was promited by a gentleman a place in the Custom-House. But as to these shoes, I was walking along the street one morning, and these shoes lay in the street, I picked them up, and thought they would sit me, and I enquired of some children who were at the door near where I picked up the shoes, whether they knew the shoes? they said they knew nothing about them, and I took them to this man's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these shoes the last time you see them here? - The last time they were in my parlour window.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a hair dresser? - Yes. This lad recommended to me by a person of the name of Beech, about eight months ago, about nine weeks ago he began first to leave a stick; he used to come in and say, Mr. Davenport, I will leave this stick (as customers often will leave their sticks) he used to come of a Sunday morning to be dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he leave the sticks? -Sometimes in the shop and sometimes in the window, and then he would call again in the course of that day; sometimes he would leave them a day.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the prosecutor came to your house, had you any thing left there? - There were five, one left the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all five left in your shop? - Yes, at different times, and he had not taken them away. Here is an umbrella, which it may be about a month ago, I asked him if he would get me a second hand umbrella, if he could get me one cheep I would buy it of him, as he was a customer. About a week after he brought an umbrella, and said, here is an umbrella that cost me, at prime cost, six shillings; and I made him a small tail and gave him five shillings for it. Here is a whip which was left on Saturday morning with one of the sticks, and taken away again on Saturday evening; and on Tuesday, after he was committed, it was put down the area of my house, and I found it there, and took it down to Mr. Moore directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160040"/>Q. Had you no suspicion? You knew he lived at the stick shop? - I knew he was in the stick line. He left some cards for me to give to my customers, if any body wanted any thing in his line. He brought a stick at a time and left it, which, as a customer, I could not refuse.</p>
               <p>Q. To Moore. Is that a lawn umbrella? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a ground ratan, a stick with a sword covered with horse hair,&amp;c.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know all these to be your's? - The umbrella I will swear to it from ten thousand, because of the make of it; if it was put among ten thousand I would pick it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You sell a great many umbrellas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that this was not sold? - Yes, I will venture to swear this was stole, because we missed it from the shop, and nobody was in the shop but my wife and I, August the 16th. I here is this piece of white leather to it, which none but the man that made this puts in. This is the very one that I missed, because there was none that was so marked in the shop but this one, there were ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever made any other like it? - Yes, I have. This is the whip I had made a very little time before this was stole, there were a dozen of them, and I missed one; I know it is my whip by the mounting of it, we get them up ourselves. This old crutch stick I have seen number of times in my warehouse; I don't know what induced him to take that old thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you any custom in your shop to allow your apprentice and foreman to fell after working hours? - I certainly gave the prisoner privilege to sell my goods, but not to pocket my money; I allowed him that privilege one week but he made a bad use of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him five per Cent. for for selling? - I did for one week only; it may be six or eight months ago; I put an end to it that very week.</p>

I met with the prisoner the corner of King street, on the 6th of July last, to the best of my knowledge, between twelve and one in the night, as near as I can tell; I dined in Oxford-road, I staid till the afternoon, till that time. I lodged in Stockwell, in Surry.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you going home then to Stockwell - Yes. She asked me to treat her; I told her I had no money; afterwards I told her I did not much mind treating her, for I would have a glass of gin myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was pretty far gone in liquor at this time yourself - No, I was not. I was coming away from Oxford street about eight o'clock, and I met with an acquaintance, and went back again, but I was not the least in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you to treat her without money - I had money, but I was not willing to let her know I had any. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160041"/>her to go one side of the way, and I would go on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go? - Yes, to the Broad way, to the Cumberland Arms, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this that you got to the Cumberland Arms? -Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the house open? - Yes; the door was shut, but we knocked at the door and got in; the people were up at the house; she had a glass of gin and I had a glass of ale; we came out of the door after drinking of this; there was an acquaintance of mine that sat in a box, and had a pint of ale, and I had a glass of that with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect to find him there, or was it by chance? - No, it was accidentally. She asked for a glass of ale, and it was given her by me; she asked me whether I was going with her? I told her no; which she stopped till the ale was drank up, the ale that this man was drinking of. I went out of doors, and she followed out after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed with her that she was to follow you? - No, I told her I would not go with her. When I went out of the door I wished her good night; she turned her hand about and snatched the watch out of my pocket, close to the door in the street; I catched her by the hands and insisted on having of it again; she swore she would be damned if I should, she would have two shillings from the landlord of the house for it, or on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any talk about the landlord having this watch? - No; I don't know what her meaning could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed before to give her any money? - No, I told her that I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing passed in the house about the landlord giving her two shillings? - No, nothing was said till she said she would get it of the landlord. I catched her by the hand and held her fast, and she made a very great noise, and I was afraid of getting into the watch house; I thought of getting it more easy, I followed her in to the landlord of the house, she had the property under her apron; I got hold of her gown tail up to the bar door; she asked for Mr. Luxton, the landlord, that she wanted to speak to him; he replied, what do you want? when I stepped from that bar door round into the parlour, to speak to him to take the watch; (you go round into the parlour to get into the bar) but before I could say any thing to him I missed

            ; I ran out of doors without saying any thing to Mr. Luxton; I went up and down the street, and see nothing of her; I came in and told Mr. Luxton what had happened; he told me that he was very sorry for it, that he would try and find her name cut, and where she lodged, by an acquaintance of her's that she had some conversation with before; he found her name by one of the girls that came in; her name was set down and where she lodged, and I stopped there all night; Mr. Luxton told me to make myself easy, I should find my watch the next day. When I got up the next morning I had a particular acquaintance that called in, that came from Stockwell, he was acquainted with Mr. Luxton, which Mr. Luxton wished him to go with me and take this girl. We went, my friend and me, Mr. Luxton was ill with a scalded leg; we went into Peter-street, Westminster; she had been moved from there about three days; we were directed to Pear-street, to the best of my knowledge.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you go to Pear-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find her? - Yes; in a back parlour; I cannot tell you the number, a private house. My acquaintance went in while I stood at the door; he asked her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160042"/>what she had done with the watch? she said that she had never seen any; I heard him. He brought her out to the door to me, and asked me whether that was the person? I declared that was the girl that was in my company the last night. He took her up to the office, and I followed close behind; when we had got near the office she declared that he had never seen the watch; but before we had her over to the office, my acquaintance went over for a runner, which I was left in care with her at the public house opposite; she said to me the time we were alone, you know that you carried the watch yourself to the landlord; I told her that she was a false woman for so saying, and I insisted upon it she should be punished if she would not deliver the duplicate or the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no intimation of its being pawned; not till after. Immediately the runner came in and took her in possession, searched her, and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched in your presence? - No. He came to me from the office, and went down to the house where she was taken from, in Pear-street; we found nothing there belonging to me, neither duplicate nor nothing; there were new shoes, and bread and butter, and tea, &amp;c. in the room. We went back to the office and went to the pawnbroker's that is opposite almost, in the same street a the office, the office is in Queen-square, of the name of Brown to the best of my knowledge; the runner asked if there had been such a watch there that morning; the shopman said, there had, but he did not take it in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - We went to the office, and she was committed for further trial.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not got the pawnbroker here? - No; the justice would have sent for him, but the runner got the pawnbroker off on account of saying he had not taken it in.</p>
               <p>Q. What house had you been drinking at in Oxford-road? - One Hanson keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you dine? - About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What company were you in? - Twenty or thirty. This is a house of call for the trade of carpenters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you was perfectly sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go with this woman out of your way going home to Stockwell? - Nothing more than wishing to have a glass myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your dividing, going different sides of the way? -Because I was afraid of people seeing me with her, as a woman of bad character, as I was well known thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no sort of connection with her? - Never, not till she took the watch from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he is saying he is telling a great many stories; I never had the watch or did I ever see it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said about my watch before they went out? - No, nothing at all. They came in again, the woman came in first, and I was at the bar, and the says, Mr. Luxton, I want to speak to you; and I made her answer in a hurry, what do you want? In the mean time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160043"/>Mr. Knowles was coming round into the bar, through the parlour, to speak to me, while he was coming round she went away; from thence the young man ran after her, and he came back and told me his story; I told him I was very sorry for if, if I could find out the person I would. Accordingly I found out the person, and I told him and his acquaintance in the morning where he might find her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out where she lodged? - By one of the coachmen, who told me that she lodged at the Cross Keys, in Duke-street. I made Knowles stay there that night till the morning; I thought it was very hard for the man to lose his watch. He was sober when he came into my house. In the morning there was a friend of his came to the house, and they found the prisoner at the bar, and took her to Queen-square; the justice sent for me. She told the justice that Knowles had left the watch with me for two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming home very late one Sunday night, and I light of this man, and he asked me to go and have a glass of something, and I went with him to have a glass of gin, and he called me on one side in the house, and told me that he would give me two shillings to go home with me; and I said that was too little; and he said, that if I would not take it there were plenty of girls that would. With that he went to the bar to speak to Mr. Luxton about something, but what I cannot say; and I staid in the house all the time, and had half a pint of gin, I and some girls, and we drank the gin, and I came out of the house directly, and I left this Mr. Knowles along with this man in the watering house, talking to him in his own bar, after he gave me the glass of liquor. In the morning he came down to me to my lodgings, and he swore that I had robbed him of his watch, and I said, I have never seen it. With that he and another man began pulling me about, and I said, don't ill use me, gentlemen, I will go any where with you, and they took me down to the office in Queen square, and from there I have been committed to prison ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see it on the 14th of August? - Yes. My man brought these two women whom he had taken with wheat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the wheat that they had? - Yes; the wheat was in their aprons, with about half a foot of straw, cut off as level as could be</p>
               <p>Q. Did the quantity cut off appear as near as possible to be the quantity that was wanting on the sheaves. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of sheaves had they? - As much as they could carry; and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160044"/>had in the house of one of them two five bushel sacks full.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they had a bushel? - No, it may be half a bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other corn down in the neighbourhood? - Not a bit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you found in their aprons all cut in this way? - Yes, every bit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you found in the house? - Yes. In the afternoon we found the straw hid, a great deal in the field, and some straw throwed over the hedge into a lane, which was adjoining to it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HAWKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a servant to Mr. Jones? - Yes The 14th of August I got up about five o'clock; I was at this field about a quarter after five, I see he two prisoners in the little lane close to the field, it joins the field; they had two bundles of corn; I took the corn from them; I will not say whether it was up on their heads or under their arms; they said they would make me sorry for taking their corn. It was wheat about half a foot long, ears and all; the corn was almost as high as I am that was in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any corn in the neighbourhood besides your's? - Yes, some standing corn just by, belonging to Mr. Nellett. Afterwards I went into the field, and there was some straw that was left in the field where the wheat had been cut from it; I went a little further and I found some more, and I went a little further and I found some more. It was left as it was cut off. I suppose they were not above six yards from the field when I first saw them. I carried the bundles into the field and then I followed them; I took them and took them to Brentford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to their house? - No. My fellow servant see them before me.</p>
               <p>Court. I want to know in what condition you found the straw. - A good handful together, and then another handful, and so on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any straw about the wheat that had been reaped? - They had pulled it out of the sheaves and then cut it off about the girt.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they had been gleaning, would it have been scattered in the same manner? - They could not be gleaning there, because the corn covered all the ground, it lay scattered for the sake of drying.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Maywood. We were leasing at the Old Hats, and I picked up four handfuls of corn, and we went across Mr. Jones's field for nearness, and we met Mr. Jones's man, and he asked us where we had been? and I said, it is nothing to you where we have been; and he said, that is my master's property, and I will take it away from you.</p>

I went after him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160046"/>and followed him about two hundred yards from Mr. Lewis's door; I said, my friend, and I catched hold of the piece of cloth, is this for sale? he said no; I said it is very odd; you offered to sell it to a person in the lane, and not to sell it to another; I took him into a public house over the way, as there was several came round, seeing me lay hold of him; he told me that Mr. Webb had given him this piece of cloth to sell for him; I told him he must go before the magistrate; I went to Mr. Webb's house, Mr. Webb was ill, he was not able to attend before the magistrate; the magistrate committee him from Friday the 17th, till the Friday following for. further examination, when Mr. Webb attended and swore to the cloth; this is the cloth, I have had it in my possession ever since.(Deposed to by Mr. Webb, as the same kind of cloth which he sent to Matthews and Hollies for their inspection, about ten or twelve days before he sent the prisoner to bring it back again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg leave before I speak to the indictment, to speak to a few transactions relating to Mr. Webb and me since our first of all knowing one another.</p>
               <p>My first acquaintance with Mr. Webb was about seven years ago; I was placed by my father as a shopman to him, he kept a cheesemonger's shop in Fenchurch-street; I lived two years with him as shopman, and then I got another place, at one Price's, in Whitechapel; I lived with him two years and a quarter, in the same capacity, and where Mr. Webb called on me frequently, to see me; a few days after I left Mr. Price I met an acquaintance of Mr. Webb's, who told me that Mr. Webb wanted to speak to me; accordingly a few days after I called on Mr. Webb, Mr. Webb told me that he had heard I was out of place, and he wanted a person to mind his counting house and warehouse; I lived with him fourteen months; in the course of that time I had the care of his counting house and warehouse, the first opening of it in the morning, and the last shutting of it up at night, sometimes there have been six or seven hundred pounds worth of property in that warehouse, likewise I have had notes and cash to the amount of seventy or eighty pounds, to pay bills, likewise I have received money for Mr. Webb, for money that has been due to him; at the end of fourteen months my friends thought of fixing me in business for myself, but it was knocked on the head; however by the character I had borne, they got me into a place in the fore part of the day, which brought me in a very competent livelihood; accordingly Mr. Webb said, if you choose to come and call on me in the afternoon, to see if I have any thing to do for you, you may; accordingly I used to call every afternoon on him, to see if he had any thing to do; I acted in that capacity I suppose nine or ten months, sometimes I have had the amount of ten or twenty pounds worth of linen, sometimes I have been to receive money for goods that he has sold, and sometimes I have had money to pay to the amount of forty or fifty pounds, not only for him, but for another gentleman that used to come to his house, that I can mention; in all which Mr. Webb on his oath must say that he has always found me act to the utmost, with regard to the integrity that he reposed in me. The very day that this affair happened, having nothing particular to do; Mr. Webb was exceedingly had, and he told me that he had two pieces of linen to carry to the other end of the town; one piece was two shillings and nine-pence a yard, and the other was two shillings and eleven-pence; I carried these two pieces for him to Covent-garden; when I came back I asked him if he had any thing else for me to do? he gave me a note to go to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160047"/>Messrs. Matthews and Holmes, to bring back four pieces of linen; accordingly I went to Messrs Matthews and Holmes, I went to the shop and the gentleman told me to go round the corner to the private door, and I should have them; accordingly I went round to the private door, and waited about five minutes, when a woman came down with the linen in her hand, they were tied up in a brown paper, and rather loose; I received four pieces of the woman; as I was coming home with the four pieces of linen I called into a public house where I generally resort to read the news paper, or have a glass of ale; in order to tie them up; the woman of the house said to me, what is the price of this piece? (taking a piece up) I told her two shillings and five-pence a yard; she said she thought it was very dear; I told her I would leave it with her, and she might consider about it, accordingly I left it; I went home to Mr. Webb with the three remaining pieces, I told him as soon as I came in with the pieces, where I had left one of the pieces of linen, and there were three; he immediately sent me with one of the three pieces to Cornhill, to a shoe-maker's there, which I carried and delivered safe; I came back to Mr. Webb again, and fetched several things in for him; says he, if you are at leisure you may call on me again between two and three o'clock I left Mr. Webb then and went immediately to the public house where I had left the aforesaid piece of linen; I asked the landlady whether she liked it? she said by comparing it with some that she had in the house, she thought it was not equal to some she had bought at two shillings and three-pence a yard; I told her that I had a customer for it, and I would take it away; I took the piece of linen to a customer which I had for it in Ratcliff-highway, one Mr. Price; when I came there I was informed that he was gone into the country, as I had not brought the linen before he was forced to buy a piece; I then took the linen and immediately thought of bringing it home to Mr. Webb, and had no intention of offering it to sell. As I was coming along with it under my arm, along Rosemary-lane, there happened to be a kind of noise, several people were assembled together, I just stopped to see them, accordingly this gentleman he was walking up and down his shop, and it is customary in Rosemary-lane, if they see a man with a bundle or any thing under his arm, they say, will you buy or sell, accordingly that gentleman says, young man, will you buy or sell, he says, what is that under your arm? I said, it is a piece of linen; says he, don't you want to sell it? says he, let me look at it; I said, you may look at it, if you choose to give the price you may have it as well as another; accordingly he walked towards the shop door with the linen in his hand, and he stood at the shop door and opened it, and asked the price of it; I told him two shillings and four-pence, he told me then that he would give one shilling and eleven-pence a yard; I told him I could not take no such money, I went away with the linen, and he called me back, and I understood that he said he would give me a penny a yard more, which was two shillings; I told him that he had no occasion to trouble me any further, that if he did not choose to give me two shillings and four-pence I could not sell it, for it I sold it at that rate I should not get a farthing by it. I took the linen and went off with it, I had not gone above thirty or forty yards before I was accosted by a gentleman who came over the way, he said young man, have you got that to sell? I said on my first answering, no because my full purpose and intention was to carry it back to Mr. Webb, but however there came up another man behind him, and said, I think that linen is stole, stole, says I, I don't know what you mean by that; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160048"/>said, you must go along with me, so he took me over to a public house, there I staid a quarter of an hour or more; while I was in the public house he asked me where I had it from? I told him, he took me to the justice, and he went to Mr. Webb, and I was confined two days and two nights before Mr. Webb came; when he came I had no examination at all, the justice told me I must be committed, accordingly I was committed to prison, where I have been nine weeks.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I always found him strictly honest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you when you bought the four pieces, where he had left one of them? - I was so exceedingly unwell I could not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever suffered him to sell pieces of cloth for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever brought you the money instead of cloth before? - No; I had let him have some pieces of cloth on his own account, and he had spoke for some linen yard and half wide, at two shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this piece, a yard? - Two shillings and four-pence. The note that I sent with the linen to Messrs. Matthews and Holmes was not sealed, it is possible he might see the price.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you sent for the things again, you did not send in your note for four pieces of linen, but only for such things as were to be returned? - That was all.</p>
               <p>Q. To Levy. When this lad was coming up Rosemary-lane, did you propose to him to buy or sell? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Levy. Is is not a customary thing for people that walk up and down their doors, if they meet any person going up or down, or with a parcel, to stop them? - It is customary for some.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Webb at a former time had four or five dozen of pattern waistcoat pieces; accordingly he gave them me to carry to a house for sale, they did not like them, he sent me back for them, I got them, and kept three dozen of pieces, and brought him the other two, and I told him, and I have kept them for a week or more, and I offered them for sale, but the price he affixed on them was so much that I could not get any thing by them. Mr. Webb in former times has told me, that any time that I wanted to dispose of a piece of linen, he would affix a price, and I might sell it, and get what I could over to myself. This piece of linen, I would not sell under the price that was affixed; it is well known to every person in Rosemary-lane, that they sell cheap and buy it cheap; but my full intention was, which if I could not fell it to a man that wanted it to wear, to carry it back to Mr. Webb.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he drinking there? - Yes, he was, with some acquaintance of his. Going backwards he came back again to his company, and he stopped and drank the value of half a pot of beer, he left some remaining in the pot; he said to a fellow acquaintance of his, I wish you good night. So he went a little way from my house, the value of a hundred yards, then he got over some pales.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - No. He must get over two parcels of rails before he could get at the back place to take it out, my boiler was in a back place belonging to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fixed? - No. It was in a shed that leads to the building, a yard by itself, it opens by a small gate, and it leads to the house; there is a door out of the house into the shed. I see it that day about nine o'clock in the morning, it had been there perhaps for two months. The 2d of July I see it, the same day, I see him with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160051"/>Q. Had you missed it before you see him with it? - I did not; I see him about three hundred yards from the house; I was near the house corner then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he was gone out? - Hardly five minutes. I was at the corner of the house, outside, and I see him throw the boiler over Squire Baranoe's pales; I did not know what it was, but I see him throw something over; I supposed he see me; I cannot say he did or did not; but he left it there in a corner; he got over the pales again and went forwards on the road; he threw it from the field into a yard where they sold sheep or beasts.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you see him in a field about three hundred yards off? - Yes, of Mr. Baronoe's. I thought it was my boiler, or something of that sort. I followed him, and I went towards the place where the boiler lay.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you see laying there? - A boiler.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner then? - Going along the road. I said to him, you have been doing wrong; I cannot justly say what he said to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boiler? - I took it myself to my house, and I took him away to the justice; but in the first place he was taken to the cage.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you got the boiler? - I had the boiler that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how do you know that to be your boiler? - I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he get the boiler to take it from the place in which you see it lay that morning? - The back door in the yard was open; he got over the paling close to the building. I know it by the iron work, the handle of it; I had it about a year and a quarter; I know the person that made it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out after him, thinking he had taken it? - No, I went out after other business, but I see him throw something over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went out of his house I stopped to make water, and I see something laying, and I got over to see what it was, and when I see what it was I got over the pales again, and the prosecutor came after me, and said it was his.</p>

               <p>Q. On Tuesday, the 4th of August, where had you been, in the evening? - I went to have a pint of beer at the Bunch of Grapes, the corner of Green's-court, in Peter-street, one end comes into Little Poukney street, and the other end into Peter street. After I had drank my pint of porter, I came out of Green's-court into Peter-street, about eleven o'clock at night, I see the two men driving some sheep into Peter-street, Peter-street has no thorough fare, but the court where the public house is, that is Green's-court; and I watched them to see what they were going to do with these sheep, and I see one out of the two take one by the horns to pull it up, and the other man drove the next after; then they drove them to a rag shop and green shop, in the court; when he got the sheep to the door, he pulled it on the step of the door, and pulled it into the passage, and the other man drove the other sheep after it; when he got them into the passage, he drove them through the passage into the yard, and shut the door after them.</p>
               <p>Q. The rest of the sheep followed? - Yes, they all followed, and went in then; after they were all in they came out and shut the door, and went some where to drink together, I don't know where they went to, but they went away from that house; so after I had seen them drive them into this passage, where I had seen them drive them into, I went in where I had a pint of beer, and acquainted the landlady with it; I immediately goes to that watch-house of St. James's, I told the constable of the night my suspicions, and they came along with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Who came along with you? -Holmes, the constable of the night, and Carpenter, the beadle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go with them? - They came out with me from the watch-house, and came with me to the place where I had seen the sheep go in; they knocked at the door some time before the door was opened. We found the sheep in the yard, and in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep did you find in all? - Seven sheep and three lambs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who opened the door to you? - The landlady of the house opened the door.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you see any body else at the time but the landlady of the house? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had seen the sheep in the yard, what did you do then? - Drove them out, and carried them to the work-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at that house besides the landlady? - We were coming out of the house and I met the prisoner, and he was dressed like a drover, and I charged the watch with him on suspicion; he was in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to the house when you stopped him? - Very near, about four yards from the house, coming to his lodgings in that house; he lodged in that house where the sheep were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he endeavouring to do? - When we first came up to come home he wanted to run away when he see the mob at the door; we went round the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160055"/>corner, and the watchman catched him by the coat, and I desired the watchman to hold him.</p>
               <p>Q. He took him, did he? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same person that was coming towards home that you had seen? - Yes, that is the man that I charged with the watch, and went to the watch-house and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us just now that there were two persons drawing these sheep into this house; the one by laying hold of the horns, and the other by driving the sheep. Do you know that the man that was taken was either of these men? - I cannot swear to the persons of either, but this is the man that was stopped an hour afterwards, when I brought the constable and beadle, by seeing him in a dress like a drover, and coming to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose house it was where the sheep were in? - Mrs. Harrison's, a widow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time did you begin to spend the evening? - I imagine it might be about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go with to the public house? - I went to the public house with myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the public house? - I staid about a couple of hours, as I generally do when I have done my work.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking a couple of hours in the public house before you see what you tell us? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. The watchman who took them is not here now? - The man that had the care of them is here.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes he not to be here? - I don't know, it is not my fault.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - In Green's-court, St. James's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge with you in August last? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of August, or any time in the beginning of August, do you remember any sheep being brought to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many there were? - The prisoner was a lodger of mine at the time that he drove them; he knocked at the door between eleven and twelve o'clock, I got up and let him in, and when I let him in he came into the passage, and when he came into the passage he said, will you be so kind as to let me put a few of my master's sheep in your yard for a little while, and I will take them to my master's when the rest are ready; I replied, no, I had no room in my yard for sheep. With that I went into my own room and shut myself in, very much terrified indeed; in three or four minutes after that, the sheep were brought into my passage and put into the yard; they put them into the yard and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the persons that put them into the yard? - I see them through the door, and heard them speak, I heard that man at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lodged with you? - Going on of two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew his voice, did you? - Yes, I knew his voice very well. Then he went out, and there were people up in the public house smoaking of their pipes, and there was an alarm from that public house to my door, they see him drive them in.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had they been gone out of your house before the alarm was given? - About an hour afterwards. This alarm was given between twelve and one, and they put them in between eleven and twelve. I would have made the alarm myself but I was afraid of going out of my own parlour door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160056"/>Q. Did you see the people that made the alarm when they knocked at the door? - I was glad when they came, and I went and opened the door, and went and see the sheep in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many there were? - The constable and the people that were there said there were ten, and they were taken out and put into the yard of the workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Phillips and others coming to take them away? - Yes, they took them to the workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Spencer after this? - Yes, at the door of the house; he was coming to the door at the time that the alarm was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him stopped? - I did not, I was in my own place; but they had him at the door at the time that I opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the justice the next day? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What is your watchman's name? - I am sure I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. But you know this watchman very well, if you don't know his name? - I don't know that I should.</p>
               <p>Q. What watchman was this? - He was the watchman of Peter-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the headle? - He lives in our parish; he is a very well known man.</p>
               <p>Q. But he is not here, is he? - No, I have not seen him here.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers have you in your house? - It is only two stories high, and two rooms on a floor; I have got a lodger in my one pair and in my two pair, at this time; I have only two lodgers and a single man besides, his wife is in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Your door was not locked at this time, your street door? - I opened it; it was locked; I let him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him out? - No, I did not, or else I would have made the alarm myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the key? - There was no key to the door; but nobody can get in when it is fastened and bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that this man came in? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did you sleep in? - In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came had he any light? - I had a light in my room; I generally burn a lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the room do you burn your lamp? - In the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. That is away from the passage? - Yes, it is away from the passage; the light is right opposite the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so frightened at his asking you to let him put some sheep in? How came that to frighten you? - It did frighten me, and when I was in my room I had not power to come out again. I have two small children, and work hard for my living.</p>
               <p>Q. You know sheep are not-lions? - It was a bad time of the night to bring things into my yard; that was the reason that frightened me so very much, so that when I had got into the room I could not have power to come out again; and when the alarm came to the door I plucked up my spirits and went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you see this man? - Yes, I did; at past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know who this man worked for? Did not you know that he worked for a Mr. Steele? - I have seen his master, but I did not know him by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you ever said that you never see that man that evening? - I see him between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you did not see him that evening? - I never see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160057"/>him until he came and knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to any person that you never see the prisoner that night? - I never told any body but what I tell you; if I did, I did not tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you told the truth or not, did you tell any body that you did not see the man that evening? - I never told any man but what I tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken, did not you tell Mr. Steele that you never see that man that evening? - No, I told him as I tell you; that I will be upon my oath; this was between eleven and twelve, and it was not three minutes, or between three and four minutes, after he had asked this permission that the sheep came in, and I was terrified in my own room, and they were brought in by him and another man; I heard him and saw him through the hole in the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray what is this hole in your door? - It is my key hole.</p>
               <p>Q. I think that you told me that you were extremely frightened? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you see him and the man through the key hole of the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord you were so frightened that you could not stir in your bed? - I did not; I told him when I got into my own room I was terrified, and could not get out.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet in that state you see this man through the key hole? - I see him pass me through the key hole, and heard him talking.</p>
               <p>Q. So you are sure that in that state of fright it you was in, you see him through the key hole, will you stick to that, thought you have once sworn it, that in that extreme state of alarm in which you was in, that you see him pass through the key hole? - I was so alarmed that I was not able to stir out of my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, when did you see Phillips last? - I see him a little while before I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not at the public house with the last witness? When were you at the public house with Mr. Phillips? - Since I have been waiting about this business; but not at the public house with him; I don't go to public houses with men. I never was here before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk over this business with him, or between you and him? - I never knew what he had got to say; he never told me what he had got to say, only he alarmed the place at the first. I knew he did that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you so or not? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you told me that he did not tell you what he had got to say? -He did not tell me any thing particular, but that he was the person that see the sheep brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I will ask you whether he did not tell you the whole of what he told us to day? - No, he did not, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you that he was there first, and he told you that he see the sheep brought in; did he tell you that he gave the alarm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you this? - I cannot say. I dare say that was not what he had got to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Were you before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard what he had got to say there? - No; he was examined before I came.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in your shop before Monday morning? - Nothing, but when I put the key into the door, I could not turn the key, and I observed to Mrs. Akerman that I had forgot to lock it, it was shut, but not locked; when Mrs. Akerman made answer and said, that she had been out on that day, and that it was very improper for me to leave my shop door open, in case I knew it; I made answer and said, as long as she was in the house I was contented, for I was sure that she would take as great care of my property as myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing about locking your door when you went away? - I cannot say; on Monday morning a woman came in for some irish cloth, which I was confident that I had left in the shop on Saturday night, eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this? - It might be half after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your shop had been open some time? - Yes, the shop was open at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not observe any thing particular about the shop till this woman came in? - I did not; on which I went to look for my goods, and could not find it, and she went away, saying that as I had been so often unfortunate, she had no thoughts of my ever finding it; she was the carpenter's wife that worked for me. I have been losing for these two years, which has impoverished me very much. Curiosity led me to enquire further into the shop, and by looking at several parcels, and examining the shelf, I discovered I had lost some neck handkerchiefs, the irish cloth, some stockings and gloves, and various articles that I sold in the shop; I cannot swear that I lost all the articles from the Saturday night, but the piece of cloth I did, and a half handkerchief, for I left them on Saturday night, the last thing I did, on the snels, and a pair of silk stockings, marked M. B. on which I rung Mrs. Akerman's bell, Mrs. Akerman did not come to me, but sent a person that was up in the garret, down; I then after I had recovered myself, I went up into Mrs. Akerman's apartment, and told her I was robbed, and wished to know if she left the house in the course of the day; she told me she did, she said she was very sorry, and seemed very much hurt at the news, and could not conceive who it was could do it; I wished for her to let Mr. Akerman come with me to Bow street, to get a search warrant, in search of my property; I intended to have searched that house where that young man lived, who dined with them on Sunday, and also my own house. Akerman was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160063"/>not at home; she seemed very much hurt that I should accuse the young man, and said she thought him innocent; I told her that I could not think him innocent, for the neighbours assured me that there was nobody in the house that day but Akerman and his wife, and this young man, and their child.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is that child? - About two years old. I was not satisfied, but I said I would take a warrant out against him, on suspicion, she begged I would go over and look at his boxes; he was in the street, and I called him over, and told him I was robbed; he said he knew nothing of it, but he was willing to be searched, or taken up on suspicion; on which I acquainted one Harley, a carpenter, who built a parlour behind my shop, and Harley told me to make no more hesitation, but to put on my hat, and then we went straight to Bow-street; we could not be supplied immediately with a search warrant; on my return home I came into the shop, and Akerman came into the shop? door, on which I told him that I was robbed the day before, he seemed very much affected indeed, at my telling him, and went up stairs hastily to his wife, what passed there I know not, but in a very little time he went out with a bundle of something, what it was I cannot say; on which the painter, who was painting the parlour, whose name is Samuel, who see him go out, says, why don't you stop that man with that bundle, I made answer and said, no, it is Mr. Akerman, I have such a good opinion of that man, I would not insult him so much; with that I went up stairs to his wife, I see nothing, I came down again, and when I came in, there was a woman came in of the name of

I said that I might see the tracks where somebody might have come in while Mrs. Akerman was absent, she said it was of no use, because any body that robbed me would not be so foolish to leave them on my premises. I went up stairs, entered the back garret, and I see the feather bed very high, on which my curiosity led me to see what was concealed under the bed, between the bed and mattras I discovered my property tied up in a pocket handkerchief, to the amount of twenty-eight pounds on that day; it is imposible to mention all the articles, I have brought some for your lordship to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any cotton stockings there? - Yes, to the best of my recollection I think there were five or six dozen; some muslin neck handkerchiefs, I cannot say how many; about fifty pair of leather gloves, one piece of muslin, and two very small remnants, near five yards of russia duck, three remnants of flannel, about seventy skains of silk, a small quantity of ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think all these were worth, the prime cost? - About twenty-three pounds. On my finding these goods I was very much alarmed, and fell into screaking fits, and the people of the house came to my assistance, Fordham and Samuel, I told them to the best of my knowledge I had all my property, but I did not know the thief; I came then to Mrs. Akerman's apartment, where I found her very much distressed indeed, Akerman had then left her, she threw herself on her knees, and craved for mercy, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160064"/>she was the thief that put them there, she said Akerman did not do it, but he drove her to it; I was very much hurt to see her deplorable distress, I told her I would be merciful to her, but to deliver me up all that she had of mine; she then said there was a great deal of my property taken out by her husband, Akerman, and concealed in a trunk, in the apartments of

I went down immediately to Bow-street again, to have the advice of the clerk, how to act; while I was waiting at the office, a friend of Akerman's, a woman, of the name of Barks, came to me to Bow-street, she came with a young man to me, with an express order from Mrs. Cadney, that she thought she had found the whole of her property and begged that I would not proceed any farther on the business.</p>

               <p>Q. That young man was Jefferies, I understand? - I believe it was the young man that dined with them, as I understand, the Sunday before I immediately went back to Mrs. Cadney's house, I was told that Mrs. Cadney was up in Mrs. Akerman's room; we went up stairs, Barks and I, when we came there the prisoner at the bar-seemed to be in a very distressed state, and I was rather fatigued, and I sat down in the room a few minutes, after I sat down she downed on her knees, and begged for mercy, and she seemed penitent for what she had done, she acknowledged she had done the robbery, and further said, that if Mrs. Cadney would forgive her, that there was a great deal more of her property in a trunk at Mrs. Barks's apartment, which she would deliver up, if she would forgive her; this

             orders for Mrs. Barks to do as she thinks proper with my property. me, I. Akerman" August 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did he deliver that to you? - He delivered it to me to part with his furniture, to make the most of it I could, he had two rooms of goods at Mrs. Cadney's.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it allude to any thing that was in the trunks? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the trunks? - I know the trunks were brought to my apartment about nine days after the last quarter day; Mr. and Mrs. Akerman asked me if I would be so kind as to let their trunks stand in my apartment, as they were going to Scotland; on that morning that I fetched the trunks away, Mrs. Cadney gave them warning to quit the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How got they out of your house again? - I really don't know; I went to keep Counsellor Swaine's house last summer, and I had two keys to my door, and to my padlock, because I let my room to single men while I am out, and Akerman had one key of each lock, as the trunks were at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to your house for the trunk, and the trunks were gone, did you observe whether the door was broke open, or opened with a key? - It must have been opened with a key, and I had but one key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no sign of its being broke open? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with the key of the door to Mrs. Cadney's? - About last quarter day Mrs. Akerman gave Mrs. Cadney warning to leave the room at the half quarter; Mr. Cadney rather demurred at leaving it the half quarter; I said, as they were going to Scotland and the goods were going to be parted with, it was very well that she had got the half quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went with the key, did Akerman send you, or did you go of your own accord? - I went of my own accord. Mrs. Cadney knew that I had orders to part with the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knew where the trunks went to? - I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know now? - Yes, they went to the corner of Quebec street, to Mr. - , a baker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had two keys you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these trunks brought to your house before you suspected this robbery? - Yes, Mr. Cadney helped me to cord up these trunks, and take them down to my apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you orders to dispose of the goods as you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he gave you the orders so to do? - Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>Q. Who directed you there? - Elizabeth Barks. I went with her there, and she shewed me the prisoner Akerman and his wife. I asked him what became of the remainder of the property? While I was speaking to him he pulled two handkerchiefs out of his pocket and threw them under the table; I asked him what he threw there. and picked them up (produced) and put them into my pocket directly; Mrs. Cadney swore to them at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cadney. These are such handkerchiefs as I told in the shop; they have not been wore nor made up.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no particular mark? - No.</p>
               <p>Konnedy. Then I searched him further and found nothing about him but his pocket book; then I searched the bed in the room, and between the sacking of the bed and the bedstead, I found this waistcoat, wrapped up in this manner (produced) with these things inside of it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cadney. I believe the waistcoat is my husband's, but I cannot swear to it, there is no mark.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any direction that you had, what did you do on the 15th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160068"/>of July? - I went down the alley, in the warehouse, where the Camsoy teas were exposed to sale; I concealed myself there behind some of the chests; I observed the prisoner at the bar come into the alley, and he took a bag out of his pocket and filled it up out of a chest, No. 3841, and when he had filled that bag he put it into his pocket, and he went to another chest, No, 3970, and there he tore the lead open and filled a bag also, he put that into his pocket also; and when he had so done he came back to the former chest, No. 3841, and took some out and put it into his pocket and apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the labourers wear aprons in the warehouse? - Yes, and they have a pocket in it to put their tools in. After that he came out of the alley from between the rows of teas, and I followed him out of that warehouse and through another, which was empty; I never had my eye off from him; I followed him through these warehouses, came up to him, and I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, Bristow, Mr. Wilson wants you; says he, goodness, what does he want with me? I said, I cannot tell you, Bristow, what he wants with you, but you must go with me directly. Accordingly he walked down one pair of stairs into the yard, and when he got there he said he wanted to go to the necessary; I told him that I could not suffer him to go there, he must go to Mr. Wilson; says he, for God's sake, Rickman, don't take me; says I, I am sorry for you, but you must go there. Accordingly, when we got to the counting house door, he made a bit of a stand, having some reluctance to go in; upon which I took him by the shoulder and forced him in. Then Mr. Tarrant, a custom house officer was sent for to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he find? - One pound four ounces of tea; one bag in each pocket, and some loose in his apron pocket; he begged for mercy, and said it was distress that had driven him to it.</p>
               <p>Q. These chests that he took the tea from were in the company's warehouse? - Yes, in the company's warehouse, where nobody was employed at that time to work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said in the last place that there was no man to work on that floor, when there were thirty of forty people there. On what floor was it? - The congou floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How can that be bohea tea then? - No, it was Camsoy tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Could I have gone out of the warehouse without being searched? - No, you could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you expect a guinea for this from the company? - How can I expect that which I have never been promised.</p>

I went immediately into the counting house, and there was the prisoner at the bar standing inside of the counting house, Mr. Wilson said, the man there has got some tea in his pocket, and you must take it from him; I went up to him and said, you have got some tea, and I must have it; on which he put his hand into his apron and took some tea out, and I took the remainder out of his apron.</p>

               <p>Q. What tea is it? - Camsoy tea; it is better than souchong, and not so good as congou, a black tea, all bohea. (produced.)</p>

I was at work on the congou floor, where the congou and camsoy teas are, and I had an accident to spill this tea out of the chest, which got into the dirt, and I could not think of putting it into the chest, because it would have spoiled the whole, and I thought there could be no harm to take a little out of two chests and put it in this other chest.

When the lads went to do that, he seemed to object and ran into the street without his hat; he was brought back again by the lads and the constable; I then told them to examine his pockets, and he did begin, and pulled out the leg of a chicken in a bit of paper that he had; the constable observed that as he was come back he had better be taken into the room and examined; and then, I believe, he found some tea spoons on him; I was not present.

I had three spoons missing that day, and this man attended a large company of forty or fifty who were at tea. He is a man that gets his bread by waiting from house to house, by the day; he waited at my house on that day. I cannot swear to the marks because they are not marked with my name; there were three missing when we counted the spoons, which we did the first opportunity after we found this; we might have counted them a week before; we do not count the tea spoons every day, but we do the table spoons. This napkin in that they are wrap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160070"/>ped up in I cannot swear to; we had a great many napkins about that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Who are your partners? - John Farley, &amp;c. In consequence of this man being stopped at Mr. Wiltshire's, I got a search warrant to search his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man employed about your house? - Yes, for four or five years as an extra <rs id="t17950916-22-deflabel119" type="occupation">waiter</rs>

               <p>Q. He was not discharged from his occasional employment at the time of his being apprehended? - No, he was not; he was sent out once or twice from the house, being in liquor. Mr. Wiltshire had the search warrant, and I went with Mr. Wiltshire to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were his lodgings? - In Welsted-street, Sumer's Town.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there did you see any thing of him? - No; he was in custody on Mr. Wiltshire's charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know this to he the prisoner's lodgings? - The woman is here that he lodges with. I found five napkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Who executed the search warrant? - The officer of Bow-street; he is here, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these napkins? - In the apartment; the prisoner's wife was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to know her before this time? - I did not. Some of the napkins were made up in child's clothes, and some into a cloak apparently for a woman. Those that were not made up were found in the front room; the doiley was in the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were not made up? - Three. The constable brought the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to speak of your own knowledge to the napkins that were made up, as being your property? - Yes; they are marked with our usual mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I always take a clean napkin along with me to bring home the broken victuals in.</p>
               <p>Witness. We always give every occasional waiter the broken victuals.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know they were the prisoner's lodgings? - Only as informed by Mr. Bleaden and the other gentleman that went with me. I found the woman up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course did not know that woman before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you search? - The back and front garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the habitation of the prisoner? - Yes; I was informed so by the landlady.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find them all in one room or in different rooms? - I believe most of them in one room, if not all.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they? - Napkins and one doiley.</p>
               <p>Q. Any things made out of napkins? - Yes, a child's cloak and a bed gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these things shewn to the prisoner afterwards? - None of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These are the napkins that I was to bring back to Mr. Bleadon's waiters, they gave them me to take home the broken victuals with; and I always made a rule for my wife to wash them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have known him these eight years; he has lodged with me a twelve-month the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did he lodge in? - The two garrets, one at the front and the other at the back.</p>
               <p>Q. What family had he in your house? - A wife and two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time when Mr. Bleaden came with the officers to search his apartments? - Yes, I was at home then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up with them to the apartment? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them what apartments the prisoner lodged in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing was found or produced? - I keep an haberdasher's shop, and I was below in that apartment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Woollivant knows nothing ill of my character? - I never heard any thing against his character before in my life, and I was quite surprised when I heard this account.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Two of the napkins I can swear to by the stamp of Bleaden and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any number on the napkins? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. As to these napkins having been in your house any particular time preceding this is impossible for you to speak to? - That I cannot say, for we lose such quantities it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how long you have had these napkins? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160072"/>Q. Can you say they were lost a twelve month before this time or less? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a doiley, is that in the same situation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been employed about your house? - I believe about four or five years, sometimes two or three days in a week. I particularly know the child's skirt, it is made up of napkins; here is my marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never took any thing out of the house without asking my employer, the waiter. As for some of the things made up, my wife bought the things of a person that came round the place. The last time I was working there, the last two days I had no cloth, I asked Mr. Thorn, Mr. Bleaden's head waiter, if he would let me have a cloth to carry home my supper with? and if I get a cloth of any person where I work I always take it back again the next time I go. It is possible I might make a mistake and change my own napkins for one of Mr. Bleaden's; some times we are not sent home till one or two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

             solicited me to know where I was going; I told her I was going home to my wife and family; she asked me to step with her into an alley, for she had some, thing particular to speak to me. Accordingly I did, when I came into the alley I clapped my hand on my breeches to the chain of my watch; I asked her what she wanted me for? she said, nothing; I took hold of the top of the chain, and she took hold of the body of it and twisted the chain in two, and delivered the watch first to one woman, and that one delivered it to another and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she got the watch into her possession and broke the chain? - Yes. So I left her, and they took the hat off my head, and by running in pursuit after these that had got my property then in hand, I slipped my foot and fell down.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner by sight before? - Never in my life. Then I went into the street, and the watch was going his round, he was going into the alley, and I told him that I was robbed of my watch and chain, and hat. The watchman went round along with me, but he could not find any hat nor none of the girls; I went along with the watchman, and then in about ten minutes I returned to the alley, and near about the same place where I lost my watch, I found my hat laying in the gutter; accordingly after I found my hat I returned back again to go into the street to go toward home, and when I came to the street the prisoner at the bar was sitting on some steps quite unconcerned; I attacked her, and asked what she had done with my watch? and told her if she would be so kind as to let me have my watch again, or let me know how I might get it, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160073"/>would give her four or five shillings, and let her go about her business, and not give her in charge to the officer; with that she cursed me in a very profane manner, and that instant that officer came up, and I gave charge of her. That is the very girl that pulled the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I at the end of the court when you lost your watch? - No, you was not.</p>

               <p>I am a painter and glazier by trade; I am headborough of the parish; I was officer of the night at the watch-house; I heard the man demanding of his watch, I was going my round, and I came up to see what it was; I asked what was the matter, and what led him there? he told me that he had been robbed of his watch, and the prisoner at the bar it was that robbed him. She was present at the time; he gave me charge of her as the woman that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the prosecutor sober at the time? - He certainly was not cleverly sober, but he was sensible enough to know what he said and did, for he said exactly the same before the magistrate the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was about eleven o'clock at night I came from over the way, from a public house, and I set me down at the end of this court for about ten minutes, and two girls came running down and jumped over me, and said, there is a man going to beat us; about five minutes afterwards this man came down and said that he had been robbed of his hat and watch; he said nothing to me, but went into a chandler's shop, in the mean time, when he was gone, a girl came down with a hat under her apron; says I, that is the man's hat; says she, don't you say nothing about it, I will go and throw it over the wall; and she went away, and I saw no more of it; after that he came back to me and said, you are the girl that robbed me, and he called our officer twice, and the officer came up, and he gave charge of me, and they took me to the watch-house, and searched me. I am sure if I had robbed that man I would never have been there.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is any thing true that the girl has said? - No. There were three girls.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Chandler. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop (we had light all the lamps) he asked for a pair of buckles; I was so busy at that time with a lady I could not serve him, I let him stop about three minutes, just before I went to him, he said, are you going to serve me? On my going up to serve him I found the silver buckle drawer pulled open about twelve or fourteen inches; I told him that I suspected him taking a pair of silver backles out of this drawer, and I insisted on searching his pockets. I found two pair of silver buckles in them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the boy near the drawer while you were serving the lady? - He was close to it, and no other person near it. I took the two pair out of one pocket.</p>

I asked her how do you do, and I asked her if she knew any thing about my watch, and if the knew any thing about it, if she would be so good to tell me or help me to the ticket; she said she knew nothing about it; she said she knew nothing either about the money or the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I met him first in the night, he asked me if I would go home along with him? I told him I would not, I had got a place of my own; he then asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160075"/>me if he might go along with me to my place? I told him, yes; and I asked him to give me something to drink; and we went to a house where there were-seven girls, and we had a pot of beer, and we came out, and he said he would give me half a crown to sleep with me all night; I said that was rather too little, but he said he would make, amends another night, and I went with him, but he had no watch, for he did not know what it was o'clock, and he asked the watchman going along.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I did give the girl a pot of beer, and in the room. I gave her two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch then? - Yes, I had.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. On Monday the 6th of July, I was sent for to the pawnbroker's in Short's-ardens, Drury-lane, who told me that a person, who was stopped there, had offered a watch to pledge which had been advertised. In consequence I went there and took the boy, the prisoner, into custody. The pawnbroker produced the watch at the office; and Mr. Stark was sent for, and he said it was a silver watch with a cap to it, which cap I found afterwards, which was particularly described as belonging to the watch, that was lost, but was taken off the watch at the time that he pledged it; the pawnbroker stopped it, because of the number of answering the description without the cap.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of his person? - Yes; He offered it to pawn, on Monday, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160076"/>6th of July, between eight and nine o'clock; I asked him whose it was? he said it was his father's; I asked him where his father lived? he said in Back-lane, Oxford-street. I had a suspicion of its being stole, and I stopped him. I looked over the book, and saw the watch had been advertised from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the watch a cap on as advertised? - No, it had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Except the cap did it answer all the other particulars? - Yes, it did. I asked him if he had ever pawned it before for his father? he said, yes; I asked him about how long his father had had it? he said, five years.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it ever since? - I have.(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. To prosecutor. I find, by your servant, that this watch was missed the 25th of June, was the boy then in this house? - Yes; he left the service on the 27th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to this, and about this time, did this boy come to this bake-house? - I have seen him in the bake-house. He was the boy that brought the beer that I used to give the man of a night; every night I had a pint of beer brought regularly at eight o'clock, and he used to come for the pots in the morning sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had the watch? - I think I have had it between seven and eight years, to the best of my knowledge; I bought it of Mr. Rutland, Oxford-street; I think I gave him four pounds ten shillings for it; it was a second hand watch when I bought it. I have valued it at three guineas, I would not take four guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a man came in one evening for a pot of beer, he puts a pocket handkerchief down and went away and left it, and in the pocket handkerchief lay two watches, and he never came back to look after the two watches, and as I was going away I never told my master that I had found them; and when I left my master I went to pledge one, and I was stopped and sent to prison. I am quite a stranger in this country; there were two bad boys enticed me away from my father. I have no-frends here.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Mr. Williams? - No more than a neighbour. About seven o'clock in the morning. Wednesday, the 22d of July, when I got out of bed I went across my room to look at the window, I see the prisoner at the bar at Mr. Williams's window; I could not tell at what, but looking more at her, I see her pulling something out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. It was at the parlour window? - Yes, about three steps up, she could get at it; by pulling something by little and little out of the window, it came presently out in a lump, which she quickly lapped up and clapped under her arm, and then I cast up my window and called out, Mrs. Williams, you are robbed. The prisoner was making off, and I called out stop theif! and one Mr. Dixey was coming past, and I said, Mr. Dixey, stop that woman, She has robbed Mr. Williams; on my saying that she dropped the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it picked up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A tent bed furniture. I then told Mr. Dixey to hold her till I put on my clothes and I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Dixey hold her? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the bad furniture? - it was given to Mrs. Williams, who declared it was her property. A Mrs. Turner that picked it up gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it given to her? - I did, at her own door. She said it was her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner within hearing? - Close to her own door at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it? - Striped, brown and red, and white. Here is the furniture; I am sure of this to be the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the woman? - I never see her before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you receive it of your wife? - I took it out of the parlour. I can swear to it by the figure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up to get some myrtles at Islington; I deal in myrtle trees; there was an uproar at this gentlewoman's door; by and by, when I got a little way on, a man stopped me, and said, I must go back; I said, what must, I go back for? they said I had stole that property; they afterwards let me go. I was going up the next day, and a gentleman stopped me again, and said they would have me before a justice; and I said, for what? and they took me before Mr. Wilmot, in Hog-lane, and he told them he must send me to this place; where I have been eight weeks for nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Cooper. Did you let her go? - Yes, the first morning, on her promising never to come that way again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you let her go? - A whole day.</p>

             came into my service; on the 2d of August, my wife missed the muslin apron; in consequence of that she was searched; I had a strong suspicion of her, and I gave an officer charge of her, and in searching her he found the gloves and handkerchief in her pocket, a cambrick handkerchief and a pair of silk gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when she was searched? - Yes. In her pocket was the duplicate of the apron that was in pledge. She cried and made a piece of work, but finding a great number of duplicates, and believing she had been and offender before, I was determined -</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the things? - The officer has them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her? - Yes, by the mother; the mother took and shewed us the house; but I am sure it was a disgrace to the house to mention in this Court that such a girl should come out of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I ever behave amiss? - She never behaved amiss, no more than pilfering every thing that she could lay her hands on.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear it is my wife's apron by some stains in it at the corner, by hanging it over the corner of the door. The black silk gloves I bought of Mr. Jones, on Holborn-hill, myself; the cambrick handkerchief I can positively swear being at my beside the night before it was missing; it happened to be put into a banbox along with some small linen, and the cat got in and tore the lace to pieces.</p>

The things that were in my pocket I took them from the children that were playing in the yard, for fear that they should lose them. Gentlemen, I assure you I had no view in keeping them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. At the time that you searched this woman, did you tell her what you were going to do? - Yes. She refused to be searched, said, she knew nothing at all about any thing.

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160082"/>Q. Did you ever find any of this property again? - Yes, at her niece's apartment. Sarah Rote; in consequence of a search warrant I attended with an officer, and a man servant of mine; I found at Sarah Rote's apartments in Bethnal green, two duplicates, one of the duplicates was for a silver tea spoon at one pawnbroker's, and the other for a waistcoat at anothers; I found at Mrs. Rote's also the ivory box, a tin snuff box and a napkin.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after the time that you lost these things, did you find the duplicates? - I believe it was the day following, as soon as the magistrate had granted a search warrant, I went with the constable and man servant so Mr. Richard's in Brick-lane, where I found a silver tea spoon, which I can safely swear to be my property; the waistcoat I found at Mr. Manger's, it was pawned for four shillings, Mr. Manger produced it, and supposing from the size, and its being pledged by the same person that it was mine, which I had not missed, but I can safely say it is my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe the prisoner that lived with you stands in relation of aunt to the other prisoner? - Yes, as I have a ways understood.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Rote knew nothing of you, nor you of Rote? - I do not recollect seeing her much, she has been at my house occasionally.</p>
               <p>Court. Spiers is a married woman, I suppose? - Yes, she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to know, that Spiers, the eldest prisoner, ever lodged at the prisoner Rote's? - Yes, certainly, by Mrs. Rote's account and her's, only they differ as to time; she left my service on the 6th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not married then I suppose? - Yes, I believe many years before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did her husband live at Kensington? - No, but we knew that she had a brother that lived there; we did not find her at her brother's, we found her at the back of Kensington-square, after looking for her a long while; the moment I see the prisoner, I asked her where she had been, that she did not come to her brother's? she said they had met her in the field, and told her there were two men looking for her; I told her that these two men that were looking for her, were myself and my master; she said she thought it was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160083"/>runners looking for her for the old affair, and said she was afraid to come; I told her no. There was nothing more said that time, till she was in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You then took her and got a coach? - Yes, but not directly, because we could not get a coach at Kensington; I asked her in the coach what she had done with all my master's table spoons? she said she knew nothing of them; I told her I was sorry for her niece, Sarah Rote, because I thought that she had brought herself into a very disagreeable situation; I told her that we had found an ivory box, which her niece had said she had given to her on Saturday last, or Sunday morning early; she said no, she had not stolen it then, she took it away with her when she left my master's service, in her work bag, or work basket, I cannot exactly say which; I said she could not have done that, because the box had been seen several times in the house, after she had left my master's service, and had been seen particularly on the Saturday before the robbery was committed, by Ann Carroll.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You only represented to Spiers that you was sorry for the niece, because as you apprehended, finding some of the things there, it might draw the niece into a scrape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She said that she gave the ivory box to the niece's child for a play thing, I believe? - She did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. On Friday, the 21st of August I went with a search warrant to the apartment of Sarah Rote, in Hare-street, Bethnalgreen; I enquired for Mrs. Spiers, I understood that she lodged there; she told me that she was there the day before; I told her that I had a warrant to search the apartment, the lower apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived there? - Rote; and I searched the place, and found a napkin, which Mr. Haynes believed to be his property, and two duplicates; I asked her how she came by them? she said she did not know that they were in the house; then this ivory box was found; Mr. Haynes mentioned something about a box, she immediately went to a drawer and shewed this box, Mr. Haynes said immediately it was his box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This undoubtedly is my box, and the contents that are in it is mine, the key of the pembroke table drawer, it was in my house the Saturday preceding the time of the robbery, which was on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you suppose that these things were taken out of your house? - We have a tarrier dog, which would have made a barking if it had been any strange person, and there is a very easy method for any person who knows the house to get into every room on the first floor, and by knowing her conduct before, I was well convinced it was somebody that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160084"/>very well acquainted with the house, and with a dog, for I never heard the dog bark all night.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the prisoner Spiers that lived with you? - Yes. Here is a napkin found at Sarah Rote's, that is mine, it is marked rather in an unusual manner, with pen and ink, by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. To Rivett. You found that the prisoner Spiers had been at Rote's that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you spoke about the ivory box, she immediately said that she had got it, that her aunt had given it her the day before? - She did.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you apprentice to Bloomfield? - Yes. On the 16th of July this woman came into our shop, in company with a man, about eleven o'clock, or it might be near twelve, on Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Bloomfield at home, or gone out? - Gone out; the man said he wanted a pair of shoes, while he was being sitted I see the prisoner at the bar go to the further end of the shop, and take a pair of women's slippers, she took them off a shelf on a bureau bedstead; I could perfectly see what part; my mistress tried on the shoes on the man, and I was standing, and see the prisoner go and take the shoes, I see her put them into her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she said any thing about slippers, or wanting to look at them? - No, only the man about shoes. I stopped about two minutes, expecting my master would come home, in order to detect her, because I was afraid, on account of the man; just before he came home I accused her of stealing the slippers; the man had not bought any shoes; I immediately bolted the door, the man was in the shop at that time, she denied having stole any, she said she had not got any, she was sure she had not, and she struggled very hard to get away; directly as I accused her my mistress laid hold of her, my mistress, by the assistance of a lodger secured her, and my mistress put her hand into her pocket, and took the shoes out, I see her; while I was gone for a constable the man burst open the shop door, and got open the private door, and got away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the slippers? - My master has had them in his possession, we have got them now. He came home while I was gone for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the slippers taken out of her pocket were delivered to your master? - Yes, they were.</p>

               <p>Clarke. She had pockets on, and had another pair of shoes in her pocket that did not belong to us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The woman of the shop asked me three shillings and sixpence for the slippers, and I paid her three shillings and three-pence for them; the constable knows that I had no pockets on; the woman herself ripped my petticoat out of the binding; and there was another woman in the shop that see I had no pockets on.</p>
               <p>Witness. She said not a word respecting any thing for herself, but only the man. (The slippers produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I see her pockets on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the constable came, the boy put on his boots, and said, now you shall go to Botany Bay, and I shall get something by you, and when I was searched at Bow-street, I had no pockets on.</p>

There was a woman drinking tea with me at the time, she was in my room, he told her he had got some washing for her, and she went out with him, to shew him her place, so when she went out with him I called out to her and said, you are wrong, for the man has stole my spoon; then I locked my house up and followed them, and the woman also followed them, and I followed them till other people stopped them, that was half a mile from my house, and the officer came up directly, this man broke the spoon before he was stopped; I did not see him, I see him put his hand into his pocket, but other persons see him break it and throw it away.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the employment of Mr. Smith? - Yes, a foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the care of his business? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say to the loss of any butter? - No, further than having missed some some time ago; we had some come in out of a vessel, but what vessel I forget; it belongs to Messrs. Bell and Higginson; three hundred and ten firkins came from Ireland, it was landed on the wharf the 31st of July; it was placed in Mr. Smith's warehouse, exactly opposite the wharf in the course of rather better than a fortnight afterwards, Messrs. Bell and Higginson sent me an order to have it weighed, and I found three firkins missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are five in the indictment? - There was three out of another vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all this landed on the 31st of July that was missing? - No, some was landed on the 4th of August, and placed in the same warehouse, to deliver to different persons; on missing the three firkins I informed my employer, Mr. Smith, that there was a deficiency in the three hundred and ten, and I thought it very strange how it could go.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of it? - In consequence of same discovery of Mr. Dyke's I went into the yard with Mr. Smith, where Mrs. Harris lived, and looked at an empty firkin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time missed any part of the butter, landed on the 4th of August? - No, I had not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this yard of the house belonging to the prisoner, Elizabeth Harris, near Mr. Dyke's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this that you went? - On Thursday, the 13th of August? I missed the butter the day before I found this firkin, or the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see in the yard? - Nobody at all; the yard opens into the house; the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go through the house into the yard? - Yes; by finding this firkin of butter with the mark and number, answering to what I lost. I took it into the warehouse; and my employer went up to the office and fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that to your warehouse? - Thirty or forty yards, not more; we searched Mrs. Harris's house, and found nothing in it; on the next morning I went with an officer to a warehouse adjoining to her house, a warehouse that was building, and found two firkins of butter, one a whole firkin and the other three parts empty, there might be five or six pounds in it.</p>
               <p>Q. These buildings were open I suppose? - Yes, but they had been under lock and key all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there at this place? - The carpenter that was at work there. They were taken away and put into our warehouse; my employer and me and the officer went from there down to Anchor and Hope-alley, in Wapping, the same day, and there we found one firkin three parts full, and another empty, at the house of one Mr. Walton, a tallow chandler, and they were taken to the Rotation office, in Goodman's fields, and left there till the time of examination came on. The firkins are in court.</p>
               <p>Q. These firkins contained butter, of different persons? - Of two different persons, and the last of which arrived on the 4th of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say there was three hundred and ten casks landed? - Yes, I counted them out as they came into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. This yard which you describe as Mrs. Harris's yard, I would ask you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160089"/>whether it is not a yard to which a great number of premises communicate? - Not that I could perceive. The yard was boarded round on one side and a wall on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not Mr. Dyke's premises communicate to this yard? - Not that I know of; it is ajoining to it.</p>
               <p>Q. This warehouse that is building does not belong to her house at all? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. This warehouse was repairing in such a way as to be open? - The warehouse was building.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the warehouse secured that these three hundred and ten firkins were put in? - By a bar across the gates, and a padlock on the side door, only locked at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any marks of violence as if the warehouse had been broke open? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Jacob Hillman? - I employed him as a <rs id="t17950916-34-deflabel189" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

               <p>Q. Was he employed in watching and removing the other parcels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain that these parcels were both stowed safely in your warehouses? - They were both.</p>
               <p>Q. What persons were employed about your warehouses? - There were divers persons employed at the time of removing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in the day time the doors of the warehouse was open? - Yes; but I was attending it myself; I left the prisoner in the warehouse several times when I had occasion to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key of this warehouse? - I did; I opened it myself and I shut it up myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Hillman? - Yes. Hillman came to my house in the month of July, and asked if I knew of ever a baker's place, if I could inform him of any body that wanted a servant as a baker. He is a baker by business, but he could get no employment, and therefore he went to work as a bricklayer's labourer, and I gave him work at my house. One morning in the month of August, I went to Mr. Smith's warehouse, and I asked Mr. Smith's servant if he had lost any butter? I had seen a quantity of butter in Mrs. Harris's house, not in a firkin, in the month of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Mr. Smith's? - Yes. I went to the house after my pots, I see it laying on the table; it may be ten or fifteen pounds, I cannot positively say to the quantity; it was laying opposite to the door, and the door was wide open. It was in a lump.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information of what you had seen at Harris's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How that butter, which you see laying at Harris's, came there, you don't know of your own knowledge? - I do not. I see an empty firkin there in the yard the same day as I acquainted Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160090"/>Smith's man what I had seen in Mrs. Harris's house. It was a little yard belonging to her house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you enter the yard? - By going through her house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other communication to the yard but through her house? - No other to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any other houses open into the yard? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your house communicates with this yard? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you look into the yard? - Yes, from some leads on the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body can go into the yard without going through the house? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a public or private house? - A private house. She had the whole house.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Harris and you have been acquainted for some time? - I suppose for five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Mrs. Harris you should be very glad of her company as far as Bristol? - I can take an oath I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have intimated to Mrs. Harris that you would be very glad for her to accompany you to some place or other? - Why should you ask me that question? I will swear I never did.</p>

               <p>I live in Anchor and Hope-alley, Wapping; I bought four firkins of butter of Mrs. Harris, on the 5th of August; I am a tallow chandler. On Wednesday the 5th of August, I was going along Wapping, and I see Mrs. Harris before me, she turned up a small court, and I walked fast after her. She owed me some money; I had not seen her for near twelve months before then; she told me she had no money, but she had some butter to sell, and asked me whether I would go home with her and look at it? I did; I went home with her, and there were two firkins standing in her yard, and an empty firkin. It was in the court where she lived where I overtook her; and I bought them two of her, in part of my debt; my debt was three pounds all but a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to give for the butter? - Sixpence a pound. It was a salt butter; there was somewhere about a hundred and six pounds of it; I only took it in part of the debt, she had some of the money. On Monday following she sent to me informing me that she had two more firkins, if I chose to have them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her business? - I was told she kept a lodging house. She said she bought it over the water; when I dealt with her, and she got into my debt, she dealt in butter. I went on Monday and agreed for them two, one firkin was in her yard, and the other was standing in her room, out of the firkin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken away the two that you had bought before? - My boy fetched them away the same day that I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you any account of the last butter? - I don't know that I asked her. It was the first time that she told me that she bought them over the water. When I went to look at the second butter, the prisoner Hillman, was at the door, the door was a jar, that to, but not fastened, and when I came up to him he shoved the door open, and went in before me; he asked me if I wanted Mrs. Harris? I told him, yes; he said, she was at the public house, and he would go and send her; he went, and she came to me; then I bought the other two firkins of her; I bargained for them in her house; the two first I bargained for at her door; I was coming away; she wanted more for them than I chose to give.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160091"/>Q. What did you give for the last two? - The same as before; I gave her a guinea on the two first, and I gave her four or five and twenty shillings on the two last. It was the Wednesday after that I gave her the last money. When I went there the Wednesday after Hillman was asleep in her parlour; I then told her it was so falt I did not think I could use it, I would be glad if she would send me any body to buy it, and she said, she would send a gingerbread baker, or a biscuit baker, and he would buy it. I wanted her to take the firkin back instead of the money; but it coming to more than the money, she said she would send somebody to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the firkins? - Mr. Smith had two, one with butter in it, and the other empty standing in my shop; and the others my servant broke up and burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. What use did you make of the butter? - I melted it; but I should not have given that price for it, as a tallow chandler, if it had not been for the debt that she owed me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Hillman lodged in her house; you see him sleeping there? - I don't know that he lodged there, he was there.</p>

The prisoner lived with me three weeks, and it did not suit me to keep her any longer, and on Friday night, the 14th of August, I told her I did not want her any longer; so she went out and said nothing, and said, she would be up with me; she knew the time we generally go for the milk. I went the next day, Saturday, about one o'clock, to meet the women that were coming with the milk, and what money I had in my pocket, two guineas and two half guineas, I put into the drawer and locked the drawer; it was a chest of drawers in the parlour; John Jones he is the landlord. I rented the lower apartment, two rooms; I left the money there, and looked to see if every one of the drawers were locked, and they were locked, every one, and the windows I fastened down with a gimblet, between the two sashes, and locked the door. At four o'clock I came home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160092"/>and when I had sat down for about ten minutes I wanted the money to give to a master bricklayer that I serve with milk, and I found the drawer open; I looked at the windows, and I found one of the gimblets pushed in, out of the window. There is a door going out of the chamber room into the passage, and that is always bolted inside and locked, she opened that door, and went out of that door (as I suppose) that way into the passage.</p>

I said I knew nothing about his money. This gentleman asked him what he had lost? so they searched me and took what I had about me, and said that key unlocked his drawers; it was the key of my box, and if it unlocked his drawers I cannot help it; and they took me to the House of Correction, and offered me half a guinea if I would own it was his money; and this gentleman took me up to the House of Correction and gave me to the turnkey, and said, I was taken up for fourteen guineas, and to let nobody come into see me.</p>

On Tuesday, the 4th of August, in the evening, nearly eight o'clock, or a little after, I believe, I was writing at the desk, the corner of the warehouse, and the prisoner came pretty near me before I perceived him; he asked some question about the Portsmouth waggon and the White Hart; I told him that the Portsmouth waggons came to the White Hart, in the Borough; he said, is there not a White Hart in this street? I said, no; I asked him if he had any thing? he said, yes; and turned round, and I see part of a box in his hand behind, under his coat; and I followed him, and he went rather hastily out, and I repeated it, let me see the direction, sir, several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a great coat he had on? - No, it was not a great coat. After he got from the warehouse door, perhaps eight or ten yards, he spoke very loud, he is coming, he is coming, two or three times to a man that was standing in the gateway; he ran off, and I after them, and he dropped the box just where he stood in the gateway, and I stopped and brought the box back to the warehouse; I followed him no further. Mr. Omerley said they must have the contents of the box, and I carried it to their house in Great Russel-street myself; I put my seal on it, and other marks; I am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you get at the prisoner again? - I carried it back into the warehouse, and immediately returned back to the gateway, and he was being brought in at the gateway before I reached the outer part of the gateway; it was not two minutes first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the same man was brought back to you as you see drop the box? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - I don't know, perhaps a shilling; at that time it had books and papers, which I don't know the contents.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray, what time was this? - Not long after eight if any; I had had a candle some time; it was a dark place where I wrote, especially when waggons stand against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have the misfortune not to see very well? - Thank God I see very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You wear spectacles? - People at my time of life generally do.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in this situation that you see the person who asked you about the Portsinouth waggon? - He came near, within about a yard; I had a candle burning that gave a good light.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lost sight of the person after the box was dropped, before the person who really is the prisoner, was brought back? - Not much more than a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the inn that the box was dropped? - It was in the Inn gateway, in Friday-street, two doors from Watling-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew the man before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160094"/>Q. You have described this to be the person that keeps the inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not there at that time? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you stick up notice that you will not be answerable for any box that may be lost, in consequence of the great business that you have got? - No, we do not. At the time that the embargo was laid there was a bill stuck up, that we were sorry that we could not forward the goods, and hoped people would not be offended, and that we could not be answerable for the goods in case of fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, who are in partnership with Mr. Russell? - Nobody at all; there formerly were two others, but not at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the yard when the box was taken? - I was. I don't know what conversation passed between Mr. Bancrost and the prisoner, but I see the man come out of the warehouse with the box in his hand (I really believe it to be the prisoner) he stepped on two or three steps, and then he put the box under his his left arm; Mr. Bancroft followed him, and said, I insist upon seeing the direction before you go any further; he kept walking on, did not answer, and he mended his pace, walking faster till he got on a run down the gateway. I was close after Mr. Bancroft when he dropped the box, and Mr. Bancroft stooped for the box, and I pursued after the prisoner at the bar; he set on a run as fast as he could possibly run; I kept up close to him; I had a catch once or twice till I got to Watling-street, and then I took him; I did not see the box again till I came back to the warehouse with the prisoner; I see him before with the box, and see him let it fall by the side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that you see let the box fall, that you ran after and took? - I verily believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time he dropped the box? - No. This is the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. I believe your's is a pretty large inn yard, is it not? - No, we call it a small yard.</p>
               <p>Q. An inn of considerable business? - Yes, some business.</p>
               <p>Q. Several persons coming in the course of the day for goods; besides which you have a coffee room and a tap room open for all comers and goers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Towards the hour of eight, when it becomes rather dusk, you have a good many frequent this place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you and Mr. Bancroft called stop thief? - The tap boy called out stop thief! and then I likewise, and, I suppose half a dozen more.</p>
               <p>Q. Several persons collected together? - There were not above three or four where I took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you the man that first took hold of him, or a gentleman in the street? - A gentleman coming from St. Paul's, along Watling-street, said, I believe you are the thief; and he rather turned him into my hands; I was close after him; I said, yes, sir, this is the thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you believed he was, but you was not sure, you would ask Mr. Bancroft? Have you never said so? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When that person was laid hold of, did he make any resistance? - He said, you are wrong; I am not the person; you are greatly mistaken. I said, you must go along with me; says he, I will go along with you any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he was an housekeeper, effered you his address immediately, and said he would go wherever you pleased? - He did.</p>

I had been to Pitt-street, Blackfriars; on my return home I called at one Mr. Thacker's, right opposite the Old-bailey; I was going from there to Whitechapel, I went by the back of St. Paul's, just as I entered Watling street, I heard the cry of stop thief! I did not run, I was on a sharp walk; a gentleman says to me, are you the person they are crying after? I made a reply, I am not; and the two men came up and said, where is he? is this the man. I told them I would go any where in the world with them. In every examination I shewed them I was an innocent man, and could have made my escape, but I would not.</p>

This must have been about eight o'clock, for I was at Cante bury-square at half past eight.</p>

About four or five o'clock, on the 10th of July, the prisoner came into my house, and asked for a penny worth of beer; I served her the beer in a penny pot; a lad came in to call for some beer, and she asked the lad to drink out of the penny worth; I just earned my back to get his beer, and she went out of doors with a pint pot; when I came up the boy told me; I asked which way she went; I went out after her, and took the pot on her, and brought her back to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen her before? - Yes, four or five times that day; I wish I had not. I missed as many pots as cost me sixteen or twenty shillings within two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pot? - Between her gown and her apron. I asked her when she came back what she was going to do with it? she said, she washed for an old iron shop in Grub-street, and she would fell it for a penny or three halfpence.(Produced and deposed to)

I see the prisoner drinking a penny worth of beer, in a penny pot; and after she had drank part of it, I see her put a pint pot under her gown; she offered me a drink of her beer; I refused, and she put the penny pot down and went out, and she told Mrs. Hill that she would pay for the beer at night; I acquainted Mrs. Hill, and Mrs. Hill acquainted Mr. Hill, and he went out after her. This is the same pot; here is my name on it, in my own writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband is very bad, and he used to fancy this gentleman's beer, and I used to go every day to this gentleman's house, and used to carry my own pot for the beer, that is, another public house pot, where I have had my beer for these three years, and one day I made a mistake and brought away one of his pots for my own pot.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did she ever bring another pot? - Yes, she has once or twice of another publican's.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a servant or a stranger? - A stranger. I was in the shop alone, sometimes I serve in the shop; he came into the shop, on Monday, the 3d of August, between the hours of eleven and twelve, to the best of my recollection; he desired to see some metal lockets; I took four out of the window, two plain ones; one enamelled one, and another; the one that I missed was the only one we had in the house of the sort, an old locket, this was an oval one, the other three were round ones; he wanted something shewy, as it was to make a present of to a young woman; I pointed out this locket in particular to him, and he took it in his hands and looked at it; he then pointed to a gold locket in the window, with his finger, but did not touch it, that had a device on it, and said he wanted something like that; I took out that locket and told him it was gold, and it would come much higher than he would like to go to; he looked at it and returned it to me again, and said, if it was gold it would; I put it into the window again, when I turned round I missed the oval locket which I shewed him before.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160099"/>Q. Then you turned from him to put that locket in the window? - I was obliged to, to get at the window. I said, what was become of that locket which I had pointed out to him as best suiting his purpose? he said I had taken but three out of the window, and they were all there; then I said, that I would take my oath that I had taken four out of the window, and I could find but three; he then desired I would search him; I said, it was a disagreeable thing for me to search any body, what could become of that locket? and there was only him and I in the shop; in the mean time our young man,

               <p>Q. After you had given him this silver and halfpence, what past then? -He wanted some more, and I gave him some more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at this time collected or alarmed? - Very much alarmed indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing with him at that time? - I moved a little out of the road that I was in, and then I saw a stick in his hand and held over my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much money you gave him the first time? - I cannot say. He then laid his hand on my cloak and laid hold of it, and said he wanted it; I said I would take it off; I took it off and gave it him; I untied it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. He pulled it off, I think? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After that had passed what became of him? - He went from me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of giving information of this? - I immediately as he left me turned round and see two gentlemen, and I screamed out to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him before you screamed out? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you had it? - About two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. In justice to the prisoner, I would ask you, did he behave with any uncommon violence or severity to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did the thing as mildly as the thing could be done. I don't know whether you was ever robbed before? - No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Court. He did not use any particular violence, nor did not swear at you? - No, he did not</p>

Will you be so good as to tell my lord and jury what you know of this business? - I was walking in company with Mr. Bufford, on the 20th of August, across the field leading to Chalk Farm; when I got about the middle of the field, I heard Mrs. Butler cry out stop thief! the men has robbed me; and I and Mr. Bufford immediately pursued the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the man? - He was at some short distance, within sight; we pursued the man as far as Chalk-lane, where he got over the stile, I suppose about a minute before me; when I got over the stile I found the prisoner at the bar in custody of Mr. Bufford.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the same man as you see in custody? - I cannot say that, because I am rather short sighted.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the cloak taken from the prisoner? - I did not. When I came up the prisoner had a stick in his hand, rather a large one.</p>

               <p>I was walking across the field to Chalk Farm, and I observed the prosecutrix throw up her arms, and immediately I see the prisoner run off, and Mr. Colling-bridge and me ran, and at the end of the field he got over the stile, and I got over after him first, before Mr. Collingbridge, and I found him on the other side of the ditch, and I got up to him and took hold of his leg, and he slid down, and there was this stick and this cloak, which I took from him. Mr. Collingbridge then came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cloak when you came up? - He had it in his hand when I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the person that you see running from Mrs. Butler? - That I can fastely say.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the morning? - Nearly on five; I see Mac Donald in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go down stairs? -My wife waked me, and said there was somebody in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body in the house yourself? - I did not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mac Donald inside or outside of the door? - Inside of the door</p>
               <p>Q. Had the door been locked the over night? - Yes, I locked it myself; the bar of the door was forced open, that which fastens it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of Mac Donald? - Yes, I never see Mac Orkhill but the night before. I looked to the left, and I see Mac Donald in the bar, taking the money out of the till, and putting it into his pocket; I could not tell whether it was silver or halfpence; he still continued taking the money out of the till, and putting it into his pocket; I says, Mac Donald! Mac Donald! Mac Donald had lodged in my house two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was Mac Orkhill you see inside of the door, and Mac Donald you see taking the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure that you knew Mac Donald? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the same certainty to Mac Orkhill? - Yes, I can; they were both in regimentals; I says, Mac Donald! Mac Donald! for God's sake, says he, what is the matter, Mr. Young; my wife answered and said, Mac Donald, what is it you? my wife followed me down stairs, and stood on the right side of me. Says I, when you have done walk forward, I said so to Mac Donald; as soon as he came out of the bar I laid hold of the skirts of his coat, I took him towards the foot of the stairs, I went up some stairs, and he was up one; my wife went up stairs to alarm the house, and one Haydon he came down stairs first, a lodger to me, and as soon as he see Haydon, Mac Donald made a sudden plunge, and got from me, Haydon followed in pursuit of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160103"/>him; he came back and told me he found it was of no use, he could not overtake them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both run away? - Yes, both; I immediately went in pursuit of a constable; I followed them down to the Barracks at Knightsbridge, they told me at the Barracks that Mac Donald had been there, and had half drest his horse and gone; I staid there some time, they were called over, and I could not see either one of them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the call over? - That might be half after six, or seven o'clock, within a few minutes; I see the corporal, and the corporal told the general, or colonel, or whoever he is, that he was deserted</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this did you get your money? - I did not, nor no part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you lose in all? - I cannot say to a pound, nearly on twenty pounds, in halfpence and silver, from a till in the bar; I locked it myself the over night; it appeared to be forced. This happened on Wednesday morning; on Friday I went with the constable to the King's Arms, Tower-hill, to take Mac Donald; he had entered into another regiment, the Louth Volunteers; we found the other man at the Barracks at Knightsbridge; he stood centry the same day.</p>

               <p>Q. Mac Orkhill you had never seen before that night? - That night he came to lodge with Mac Donald.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Mac Donald was taking of the money, did Mac Orkhill see what he was about? - Yes, it was daylight almost.</p>
               <p>Q. He was standing in a situation that he could see? - Yes, he was standing opposite.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Mac Orkhill only. When you came down, the person you say was Mac Orkhill had the door open in his hand, and he went away directly, did he not? - Whether he heard me or not I cannot tell, he passed from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you see him in the act of going out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you are as sure of Mac Orkhill as you are of Mac Donald? - I never see the man before.</p>
               <p>Q. That is any thing but an answer. Whenever you see Mac Orkhill, you was as sure of Mac Orkhill as you was of Mac Donald; you did not mistake there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this house? - Nearly six months, better than five.</p>
               <p>Q. The till happened to be very rich? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I think it is a rich till that contains twenty pounds? - It has been as rich a good many times before and since.</p>
               <p>Q. You always thought it was somewhere about twenty pounds, and always said so, you are sure of that? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body comes and represents you have said otherwise, they must tell a lie of course? - Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Q. Estimating the value of your till, you never said there were ten or twelve shillings in it? - That day I did not know what I had lost, till the next morning, my wife did not tell me; I started off after them as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you had not lost more than ten or twelve shillings? - I might say so, or I might not, to my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to recollect that, because it is an important thing? - I will speak the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Try your recollection, and tell me whether you did not say to more persons than one that you had not lost more than ten or twelve shilling? - I don't know to my knowledge particularly what I did say that morning, I might say so, or not, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160104"/>Q. Don't you believe that you did, and don't you know that you did? - I could not tell at that time what I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body that you had lost ten or twelve shillings? - Can I say a thing that I don't know from my heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Then now, thought you have taken up the men for robbing you of twenty pounds, yet you cannot tell whether you never told people that you had not lost more than ten or twelve shillings? - I might say so, more or less, I never said positively that I had only lost ten or twelve shillings not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You were always sure of the person of Mac Orkhill; when you see him; you never in your life could mistake any man for Mac Orkhill? Perhaps you did not hear the question, I will repeat it; you was always sure, &amp;c. - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pitch on any other person as Mac Orkhill; yes, or no? - When I see him I knew that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That is any thing but an answer, but I will have an answer I assure you; on your oath the next morning did not you pitch on a man of the name of Waller, and say that is Mac Orkhill, and that I will swear to? - The next morning?</p>
               <p>Q. I will not be particular to the morning or afternoon, at any time before Mac Orkhill was taken up did you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you swear positively? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will refresh your memory a little; on your oath did not Waller remonstrate to you for having pitched on him as Mac Orkhill, and you begged his pardon? - No such thing ever passed. Such a thing might pass, and it might escape my knowledge, one soldier being so much like another.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a thing might then pass? - No, it never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I tell you Waller is here, and I give you time to recollect yourself, I will give you leave once more to give me an answer; did you pitch on Waller as

               <p>Q. Now you have sworn positive? - Have I sworn positive? I did not, besides the man that did it; I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a plain answer, yes, or no? - Not to my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see there is nothing like bringing people to the ten; you have sworn positively three times you did not pitch on him; on your oath did not you beg the man's pardon, saying one soldier is so much like another? - I might say that, but I never did beg the man's pardon, I might ask them a civil question, and they might give me a civil answer, the same as other people do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, six on that man as Mac Orkhill? - Not to my knowledge, I might say several things that morning that I do not recollect; did I take the man up on suspicion?</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you pitch on a man of the name of Mac Naughton, as the man that had robbed your house; yes, or no, and I will not be trifled with? - I say, no, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it he is a man one would believe, a man of credit, is not he? perhaps you may have said this to some person; I think there will be about forty pounds in this business, and it would be a very pretty job to take them, meaning the two persons? - Very likely, I said many things that I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you say that, because I shall call the constable? - I might say so, I cannot say that I did or did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you could not talk about it? - Very likely I might talk about it, I will not be on my oath about it, because I don't know whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you believe, upon your oath, that there was a forty pounds reward for taking up these people? - Who was to give me the forty pounds reward? I do not believe it, nor know any thing about it; I could not tell whether there was any such thing or not, I might talk about it, but I had not experienced it; I will not give you my oath on that subject.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 29th of July, I heard two men get up and come down stairs, which waked me, and I heard one go out of the yard door, and open and shut it several times; it was about five o'clock in the morning; the other went to the bar door, and forced the lock back, I heard it all, I was awake; the bar door was locked the over night; and I heard him go into the bar, and force at the till, and open it, and when it opened it made a gingling, and I awaked my husband, and told him somebody was in the bar, and he ran down stairs, and I followed him, and the first that I see was Mac Donald, in the bar, with his hands in the till, taking out the money, and putting it into his pockets; I called out Mac Donald, but he made me no answer, and my husband called Mac Donald twice, and then he came out and asked him what was the matter, and my husband catched him by the coat, and I ran up stairs to alarm the other lodgers, and the first I came to was

            , and he ran down stairs before me, and when Mac Donald saw him coming down stairs, he forced away from my husband, and ran out at the door, and that was the last that I see him; I see nobody else; I did not see the other at all, I heard two, but I did not see but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Mac Donald had lived some time in your house as a lodger? - Yes, he had. It was broad day light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your husband has no other business but the public business? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He gives change from the till as well as you? - No, he does not, he is more in the tap room than he is in the bar, he brings the money to me, and I give change.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose when you went to bed again you talked over your loss? - He went immediately up stairs and dressed himself, and went out and got a constable, and went after them; he never asked me about it till night; there was about twenty pounds in the till, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a large sum of money to be in the till, a very extraordinary sum, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160106"/>never had so much money in the till before? - Yes, we had, but we never had been robbed before, and so we had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long have you been in this house? - About six months.</p>
               <p>Q. And twenty pounds in the till, in silver and halfpence; is it always your custom to leave your till in the bar at night? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. How much beer do you draw in a month? - Ten or eleven butts, besides spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what is the probable receipt in the course of the day? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You never took twenty pounds? - No, not in a day.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first examine to see how much money was missing from this till? - I had not seen the till that day, for my husband had the key of the till in his pocket, out with him; the last time I looked in the till was on Sunday night, then there was fifteen or sixteen pounds in silver and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been robbed, how soon did you look at your till? - I never looked at the till until night.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you find missing? - It was all gone, but about sixpenny worth of halfpence, and a few farthings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Prosecutor. Where do you live now, do you live at this public house still? - We have left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now? - In Calomel-buildings, No. 10.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to this till, when you went up stairs to dress yourself, after you see the money, did you lock the till, or how did you leave it? - When I went up stairs I left it open, when I came down I locked it; the money was gone, except a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before you went out in pursuit of the prisoner, you knew what money was missing? - I did not know particular what was in the till, my wife did, I don't know when I had looked in it before, to know what quantity was in it.</p>

               <p>I am a lodger. The wife came up stairs and awaked me, and I went down stairs, and I said, O, Mac Donald! and he gave himself a turn round, and got away from Mr. Young's hand, and went through the door, and went out, I went out after him, and Mac Orkhill was about ten yards from the door, when I got to the door on the outside; I had never seen him before the over night; he has got a tooth that stands rather out, on the right side, I took particular notice of that in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two men that you see in the morning, in the same uniform that you see the over night? - Yes, I drank part of a pint of beer with one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all about the person of Mac Orkhill? - All that I have got to say is, I see him within six yards of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the person that came into the house the over night to lodge? - Yes. I pursued them up the court, and Mac Orkhill says to Mac Donald, d-mn you, come forward, or we shall both be taken. I followed them to Portman-mews, and I durst not follow them any further, and I immediately turned back and came home and dressed myself, and went to the Barracks with Mr. Young; and Mac Donald had dressed one part of his horse, and left the other undressed; I went all through the stable, and could not see him, and we went to a public house and had a pot of beer. and the corporal came and said Mac Donald had deserted; I could find neither of them there, and I came back again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You had been living some time with Mr. Young? - It is not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160107"/>long since I came from abroad, and lodged with Young.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a sad loss of Young's? - I cannot tell what the loss was, he told me twenty pounds, two or three days afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you ask him that? - I did not stop in the house, I was not at home, except at dinner, when I did not stop five minutes in the house, nor did not speak to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor they to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You see Mr. and Mrs. Young when you came home in the evening? - No, I did not see Mr. Young.</p>
               <p>Q. Now had not you the curiosity to say, ma'am, what have you lost? - I never asked her that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor she had not the curiosity to tell you? - No, she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that they told you three or four days afterwards? - They told me that they counted it, and it was twenty pounds that was missing.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps Mr. Young might tell you that very probably he might get forty pounds for it? - I declare upon my oath he never mentioned such a word to me.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were following the people all the way; were you in your shirt? - I had a light flannel jacket on, a pair of trowsers and my slippers; I followed them as far as I durst follow them.</p>


               <p>Q. Still you was always behind? - A good reason, because I could not catch them.</p>
               <p>Q. You was then always behind? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see this tooth behind him? - I see his tooth the over night, and the next morning we stood face to face, waiting for Mac Donald's coming out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him waiting? - How could I see him waiting, as soon as Mac Donald came out he ran on.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with Young, did not you see the troops drawn up? - Yes, I see them drawn up in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will touch collar; was

               <p>Q. Were they not drawn up when Young mentioned the fact, and was not Young told that the man was there, and he might point out the man if he could? - Not to my knowledge; they were drawn up.</p>
               <p>Court. You was with Young the whole of the time that Young was there in the morning; he did not pitch on any man for Mac Orkhill? - It was in the evening he pitched on a man.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Young see him there, standing centry? - No, it was me and my partner only.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Young. You say you did not know till the evening that the twenty pounds was missing; your husband's account is, that he locked the till when he came down stairs; did not you want to go to the till in the course of the whole day? - No, I did not, I had plenty of halfpence and silver in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him when this enquiry took place, about his being robbed? - Yes, I did, at eight o'clock in the morning, when he came to the Barracks at Knightsbridge, the troop were then parading.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mac Orkhill, then there or not? - He was the next file to me, the next man to me, on the left hand side; Young asked the corporal to look over the men, for the man that had robbed his house, and he did, and when he had done he said the man was not there; he took no more notice of Mac Orkhill than he did of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - Not at that time; in the evening I had. In the afternoon Thomas Bennet and me were going to the stables, in Portland-street, and we met Young, and he came up to me, and he looked me very seriously in the face, and he stopped Thomas Bennet, and he said I was the man. In the evening when I see him at Knightsbridge I asked him what reason he had for thinking I was the man that had been concerned with Mac Donald in robbing his house? he begged my pardon, and said, that one soldier was so much like another that it was very hard swearing to any man; and I think Mac Orkhill was present then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pretend to know Mac Orkhill then? - He did; but I dare say he did not, because he took no notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn at all from himself what was the amount of his loss? - I heard him say that morning, that he supposed that he had lost nearly twenty shillings in halfpence and farthings, and he dared to say there was some silver among them.</p>
               <p>Court. You knew Orkhill very well. Has he not rather a remarkable tooth? - He has one tooth that stands out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever in your presence? - No. I asked him particularly how much he had lost? the first answer he made me was he did not perfectly know; and I asked him a second time; he said he was not perfectly certain. there may be ten shillings in the till and some farthings, but not exceeding fifteen shillings; he told me there was some silver in the drawer, a few sixpences; but he did not say whether they were taken away or not. I went and informed the captain, and he had captain Lee's leave to look over the ranks again, which he did both the front and rear, and the man that was with him, and he said the man was not there.</p>

The bed was in the parlour, locked up, the glass was in the club room, that was not locked, there was no key to that door; the door that locked up the tap room locked up the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them? - About eight o'clock in the evening. I cannot say I see the glass there the day before, but the bed was in the parlour when I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these people any connection in your house? - They lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see your things again? - On the next day, at Mr. Warner's, the White Rose, the corner of Rose-lane. The room that fastens the parlour had been broke open.</p>

On the 15th of last month, August; I see him in the street, Prince's street, Westminster; he was walking along towards meeting me; he asked me if I see a woman pass me? I said, yes, just gone by, about a minute since; says he, she has picked my pocket of my watch, I insist on your going along with me. I turned back, and we got up to the woman; and he says, this is the woman that has picked my pocket of my watch; she said, she had not got it, nor had not seen it; I said, Jane, you must go to the watch-house to be searched. She stooped down and dropped the watch by the side of us; Roper, says she, there lays the watch, take it up and say no more about it. I did not see it go out of her hand, but she said, there it lays, take it up and say no more about it. The prosecutor took it up himself.</p>

I said, going home; says he, will you take me along with you for a walking stick? I said, no; says he, will you take me with you? says I, sir, what compliment will you make me? he said he had but a small trisle of money about him; he said, he had some things of his fellow servant's about him, and he gave me eight-pence halfpenny, and he unbuttoned his things, and wanted to be very rude, and he wanted sadly to prevail with me to go along with him to his master's kitchen; and I would not go with him, and I wished him good night; and he came after me and said I had got his watch, and he went to the place where we were standing, and he picked up the watch, and he said, will you go home with me? I said, no, I will not; and he said, then I will have my revenge of you one way or the other, and he met with the patrol, and said, there is that b-ch has robbed me of my watch; and the patrol said, where is the watch? and he said, I have got it; and they took me to the watch-house.</p>

In consequence of some information which you received(I don't ask you what it was) did you go to a house, <placeName id="t17950916-44-crimeloc257">No 11, Windmill-street? - Yes, I did, near Finsbury-square</placeName>

I believe they call them; there was a board put up, and on the window nigh the board, there I found them; I found some of the same sort of things in the front kitchen, a small cutter and three other screws, and one smaller than the other two. I then went up stairs into the garret, and there I found three punches with G. P. and D. on them, and this piece of metal that appears to have been cut out with one of these cutters, one of these small ones. I then found some other little things on a shelf that I am not acquainted with, I found them on a shelf in the back garret. I believe the black ball is to take the deadness off the metal. I then came down stairs, after having searched the other rooms, and at the bottom of the stairs I pulled up a cushion, it appeared to me like a cushion of a one horse chaise, and underneath that was the press. I then went down into the front kitchen, and there I found the fly; and with a candle in the back kitchen, underneath the kitchen stairs, between the stairs and the support of the stairs, I found this leather with these silings, or something to that purpose, and in the shop I found this bottle of aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other man in the house? - No other man was in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160114"/>Mr. Knowlys. On your going into the necessary, you say you asked the man if he was the landlord of the house, he told you immediately? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not make use of any language of this sort, what is that to you, but he told you directly about it. There is one part you have forgot to tell us, part of his dress was unbuttoned? - I believe it was, I cannot positively swear it was or was not, but I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say these things that were found, were some in one place and some in another, no ways collected for the purpose of use? - I described every place where they were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Two of these cutters were laying close by a window, that would catch the eye of any person on the out side of that window? - No, I don't think it could, because it was in the yard, and the window was very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to examine whether there were any marks of chalk on the press at the time? - I did not see any chalks, I did not take any particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say there were none. Now this man kept a broker's shop? - That was our information.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find it so, because I ask you the fact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a quantity of goods there, such goods as you usually find in a broker's shop? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had no apron on? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have attended trials of this sort? - No, never before.</p>
               <p>Q. His hands had no particular mark on them? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. This thing that you call the press, was laying where? - On the next step going out of the shop, on the first or second step leading up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose other things apparently on sale in that shop, laying close to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Grates and other iron things? - I see no other iron things but grates.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The window you say was close to the back yard? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Q. You are one of the officers at Bow-street; you went with Kennedy on the 5th of September, to the house? What time of the day? - About four o'clock in the afternoon; it is an open shop, at the front there is a parlour behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you? - Miller, Rivett, and Kennedy, we all went together; I went into the parlour, and there was the wife and servant girl in the parlour, and a child, that was all the people that I first see then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go then? - I went up stairs; there is only two pair of stairs in the house; I did not find any body there, I came down again; when I came down again Kennedy had got the prisoner in the parlour, I searched him, and tied his hands, and set him down in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on his person? - Only three shillings and three sixpences, all good; the rest of my brother officers they went to search in the cellar, and different parts of the house, and I stopped with him in the parlour; he whispered something to his wife, which I understood to be the vault, with that I called to one of my brother officers to stop with him, and I went to the vault to search it, and on the floor, by the side of the vault, I found this paper, with these sixpences in it.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is the vault from the house? - About fifteen yards from the house, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the paper contain the same as it does now? - It did, there are sixty-eight pieces; and then down in the vault I found this scissile.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean on the soil? - Yes, in a paper, tied up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160115"/>Q. When you found these things in the vault, you brought them into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what circumstances belong to the other piece of metal which you have in your hand? - It was part of the sciffile, we cut it out to try, when we tried the press, the cutting engine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were the cutters fixed in the press? - Yes, there was only the fly wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the piece of metal in your hand, you cut out of some of the sciffile, with the cutter, as you found it, applying the fly to it? - Yes, just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut it out yourself? - There were several of us together; I held the metal. In the two pair of stairs back room there was a lathe fixed, it is to turn any thing, or to clean any thing with; when we knocked the lathe to pieces, and in knocking the lathe to pieces, there dropped a shilling out of the lathe, Miller picked it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This is a common broker's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was present at the time the prisoner was apprehended? - No, I came down afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When you see him had he any apron on? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were his hands dirty or greasy at all? - No, I do not apprehend they were, nothing more than common.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a witness in some of these trials before? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the use of some of these articles, would naturally dirty and greasy peoples hands and stain them? - Yes, the aqua fortis would.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the cutting engine was not fixed at all; nothing can be done with that without the assistance of the fly? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The fly I believe was found in a different part of the house? - I understand it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you put the fly to the instrument, in order to cut the shilling, or sixpence? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. You are one of the officers that went to this house with Kennedy and Carpmeal? - Yes; the first that I observed was Kennedy going into the vault after the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before you see Kennedy going towards the vault? - I had not; I see Kennedy bringing the prisoner out of the vault, I took the prisoner into the parlour, and I remained there with him some time; with that, Carpmeal and I went (after we had left another person with the prisoner in the parlour) to the vault, and Carpmeal picked up a paper containing a quantity of sixpences; I took a hatchet and broke open the seat of the privy, and stooping down I picked up a handkerchief with something in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what that handkerchief contained yourself? - I did not; I then remained again some time with the prisoner in the parlour behind the shop; then I went up stairs, in the two pair, there was a lathe, and in searching about I found these plyers and this file in that room, and in knocking the lathe to pieces, to get it from the floor, where it was nailed to, this shilling dropped out of it, and this little bit of scissile; I put a mark on the shilling, that I might know it again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. You searched up stairs I think? - I went to take down the lathe, I did not search there at first.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found the rooms up stairs full of these kinds of fragments of furniture? - Yes, what commonly is at brokers shops; in the front room there were some glasses and china, and two or three tables.</p>

               <p>Q. You are an officer, you went with the officers on this occasion? - No, I was not at the first search, I was at the second examination, and Mr. Vines, the solicitor for the Mint, was enquiring for some files and things that were missing; some one of the officers answered, there were some files, but they did not bring them with them; and the prisoner said to a man standing very near to me, be off, and get them out of the way; I then desired the doors of the office to be fastened, and put two officers to each door, and Mr. Mac Manus desired me to go to the prisoner's house; I went to the prisoner's house, I found a little girl and a man, who were taking care of the house; I went up into the back garret, where the lathe had been fixed, it is only two pair of stairs high, there I found these two files laying on a chair; I went down into the cellar, and there I found the block which the press is fixed on, it sits exactly this press. In the parlour in the cupboard, I found these two pair of plyers, and this cork, and this set of weights, and some scouring paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These files you may buy at any broker's shop? - No doubt, one of them appears to have been used very fresh, and the other is rather rusty, and broke.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at an old broker's shop, it is impossible to find things that oftener meet your eye than a pair of plyers? - I have seen them in other shops, but I cannot say in brokers shops.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you one of the officers that went to this house of Tunstall's? - Yes. When we went to the house to make search, I believe I was the first that went up stairs where the lathe was produced from; it was fixed in a manner ready for working, every thing was complete with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing yourself that day? - No, not that day; I went there again on the 9th; we thought there might be something more that was left, that had not been taken away on the 5th. On the block I found this bit of scouring paper, that has been cut by one of the cutters apparently, there is a hole of the bigness of a sixpence in it. In the shop, by the first stair foot going up stairs, where the press and cutter were taken from, I found these two files, they were laying open, by the other things; being disturbed I believe; in the room where the lathe was I found these trowsers, which have been apparently used, underneath a chair; there were several old chairs in the room, packed one in another.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there remarkable in those trowsers? - Being very black. And a waistcoat was found where I found the files, on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there about that? - Nothing but dirt; and here is some more scouring paper. that was found in the shop the second day.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing else there? - No, only the block that was found in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This time that you speak of, going to this house, was four days after the prisoner was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The scouring paper perhaps you may have seen before in the course of your life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any grates in this broker's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Probably you may know that scouring paper is used to clean grates? - Probably it may.</p>
               <p>Q. The files lay perfectly open? - Just on the step, going out of the shop.</p>


               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160117"/>Q. Common files? - They are, but you will see the marks, as if silver had been on them.</p>
               <p>Q. The trowsers have the appearance of being dirty; I think hard working people may have dirty trowsers? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. These trowsers laid under the frame of a chair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had been under the seat you would not have seen them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The waistcoat that was laying on the stairs too was open? - That was laying on the first step, close to the files.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had an opportunity of seeing it? - Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Court to Kennedy. Did you see any of these files when you were there, and why did not you bring them away? - Because it was the first time that ever I was on any thing of this business, and I did not know so well what was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the files there? - Yes, on the block, and the sand paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any files any where else? - In the window I believe there was one. I am not certain, I know there were some on the block. (The things produced.)</p>
               <p>Dixon. The first is the block, the next is the press, which is fixed on the block; here is a cutter and punch, all fixed ready, and here is the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the cutter for? - To cut blanks out the size of a sixpence, or any other size, by changing the cutter, undoing the screws, and also the same by unscrewing the punch.</p>
               <p>Jury. There are many businesses that use these tools? - Yes, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now let us have the lathe? - This lathe may be applied to many things, it may be used to turn any small article that is to be done quick; they have been used very frequently in edging shillings or sixpences; after the blanks have been cut out they leave a rough edge, and by turning with a small file it takes the roughness of the edge off, and makes the edge smooth.(The shilling shewn him that sell out of the lathe.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does that appear to have been turned by the lathe? - It does; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the scissile. - There is none here that corresponds to the size of a shilling, but all to the size of a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the scouring paper? - There does not appear to have been any used. They may use it after they have used the file, if the edges are left a little rough</p>
               <p>Q. Is the file necessary? - Yes, and that file I found in the back garret appears to have been used very lately, for the metal all appears in the teeth of it. The cork is made use of after they are taken out of what they call the pickle; that is, after they are edged and made all ready they throw them into aqua fortis to give them the appearance of silver; that that is produced is aqua fortis without being used; it is called pickle after it has been used. Here are some filings that appear to have been filed off this kind of metal that these blanks are made of. Here is some cream of tartar that is mixed with the aqua fortis in general.</p>
               <p>Q. That piece of blacking, what is the use of it? - I have frequently found it in coiners houses; when they are finished they are generally too bright, and they use such as this to dull the appearance to make them pass; it is bees wax and lamp black, I believe; sometimes it is done with foot, and sometimes with bees wax and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at this parcel of sixpences; take some of them comparing them with the scissile and with the cutter, do they correspond with the size? - Exactly so, allowing for the edging of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160118"/>Jury. Is the metal plated? - No, it is a mixt metal, and when it is put into the aqua fortis it draws the silver outside, what little there is of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Are all the things you have been explaining, a complete set of things to make a shilling or sixpence? - I see nothing wanting to make them in the state they are in. There is no impression, there is nothing else wanting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you never see the press fixed in the way in which you have put it, in the house in the possession of the prisoner? - I was not there when it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. The aqua fortis you have found has never been used? - Certainly not, if it had been used it would have been green.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, of what use is the mixing of cream of tartar with the aqua fortis? - To give them a colour; I have heard so by an accomplice in this court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it has ever been given in evidence, that they mix cream of tartar with the aqua fortis? - By an accomplice I have heard so. I have scarcely ever apprehended a coiner but I have found cream of tartar.</p>
               <p>Q. These filings must be whatever a person is engaged in the trade of button making; he must file the blanks that he cuts out? - He must.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore wherever the trade of button making is carried on, there you would be likely to find such filings? - No doubt of it, if it was the same kind of metal.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not analized the filings or the metal that is now produced? - No.</p>

            , a button-maker, and by his not paying me the rent we differed; he owed me almost three months rent, at so much a week, and he had a good many people coming after him, particularly one that I did not like. When I found that I could not get him away, I threatened him with law for four or five different times, till at length I frightened him in such a manner that he did not come any more; he locked up the door and went away, and in two on three weeks after I got into the room, there were three gentlemen in the shop whom I asked to go with me to break the door open, that came to buy something in the shop; I took out the press, and I took it down stairs, and I set it on the stairs of the shop, and a good many more articles I took out of the back room; and the aqua fortis bottle my wife said that she would put into the shop, to try the silver that she took. The fly took up too much room to stand on the press, I took it off and put it down in the cellar and left the frame of the cutter standing on the step of the shop; then this day fortnight, I had been out about some business, and I came home about four o'clock, when I came home I went into the shop, went through the shop, and through the passage into the back yard, to the vault. I did not see any body in the shop, nor any body in the passage, nor any body in the parlour; I heard a noise up stairs, I thought it was my wife felling some goods to some customers. I went backwards to the vault, and there I sat till such-time as I had need get up, and I heard somebody in the shop; I in a hurry put my hand into my pocket to pull out some paper, and my pocket came out some part of it, being in a hurry, I ran to the necessary door with my breeches down, to see who was in the shop, and this gentleman, Mr. Kennedy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160119"/>came and met me at the door of the necessary, and asked me if I had been throwing any thing away? he looked round the necessary and saw nothing, and brought me out into my own parlour. I have nothing more to say.</p>

               <p>Q. What way of business are you in? - An optician.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been employed by the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, in carrying out goods for him, four or five months occasionally. His family consists of four children, a wife, and servant, some part of the time, and a lodger in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your employment for the prisoner, did you ever happen to learn what that lodger's name was? -His name was Hayton.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did he occupy? - The two pair of stairs back room. He went under the name of a button-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in his room? - I never was. I have seen him shew various kinds of buttons to different people in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since he left the lodgings? - Four or five weeks ago, to the best of my knowledge; I cannot say to a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave his lodgings without giving notice or what? - I have heard the landlord say it was for not paying of rent. I have often heard the prisoner ask him for rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to his room after he went away? - Yes, I have been in his room since. I have seen Hayton shanking buttons in his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what kind of tools he worked with - No, because I never was in his room; I have stood at the door and see him, but never was in his room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You are an optician. Who do you work with? - One Mr. Linnell, on Snow-hill; I have not been there this fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then till within this fortnight you have worked with him? - Yes; I have worked with Linnell occasionally these six months.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by occasionally? - Sometimes work was not brisk.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the sixpences. Was that the commodities that Hayton used to deal in? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire place in this two pair of stairs room? - I never was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him shanking buttons, and yet you don't know whether there was a fire place in the room - I do not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                        targets="t17950916-45-victim494 t17950916-45-viclabel261"/>? - Yes. About the latter end of July, the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I could give change for a five pound note? I told him that I fancied I could; he called for a glass of shrub and water. He gave me the note into my hand; I see it was a Plymouth note, I desired him to endorse it, to put his name to it, which I gave it him for that purpose; and in the time that I went up stairs to get cash for the note, the note was endorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note that you took when you came down stairs, the same note that you had received of the prisoner when you went up stairs? - It appeared to me the same; I cannot positively say; it has the same appearance, only with the name endorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ink wet or dry? - I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name endorsed to it? - I don't know that; I cannot say how it was spelt; I did not take any particular notice, because he was a man so much respected by the company there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner write before? - Never did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down again, did you receive the note of him? - It was laid on the ledge of the bar. It was endorsed, but I don't know by what christian name.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it from the ledge of the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was there at the time? - Yes, I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cash the note? - Yes. When he had drank the shrub and water says he, I believe I owe you something, what is it? I did not recollect at that moment, I said, that I believed that he did owe me something for eggs, gin and water, and beer, to the amount of a shilling or fifteen-pence. I had not two half guineas, I wanted to give him half a guinea's worth of silver, and one half guinea in the change. I went into the parlour and asked if any gentleman in the parlour had two half guineas for a guinea? I came back and gave him the full change for the note, and he paid me out of it. I kept the note, I did not see him for eight or ten days after, till I see him in prison, in the Borough New Gaol I believe it is; I went and got admitted, and asked him, in the presence of another young man that was in company along with me, how he could give me a forged note? He answered that he did not know it was forged, and that I should not lose by it; I immediately told him that I was a poor man, and could not afford to lose by it; and he said, I should not lose by it, he said. he got it of that fellow Catapodi for a debt or money, or something of that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then taken before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination? - I did. (The note shewn him) This is the note I received of the prisoner, that I took off the ledge of the bar, that I gave him cash for.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same endorsement that was put on it when you received it? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Messrs. Hankey's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you present the promissory note for payment? - Yes, I did, to one of the clerks; he is not here; they refused payment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had the prisoner been in the habit of frequently using your house? - Yes, he was; he has dined there with his friends, three or four times.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160121"/>Q. I take it for granted that to a stranger, you would not have given cash for a country bank note? - No. I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I would presume that you gave him this money more on the credit of his endorsement than on considence in the note itself? - Most assuredly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the prisoner have been under the necessity of resorting to a fraud on you if he had wanted this money to this amount? - No, he needed not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have given him this money on his own note? - On his own account I would.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some other persons in your house at the time he got this money from you; and after he got this money did he not go in and associate with them? - He was there but a very short time; he wanted eggs, and my wife did not like to send out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take every means to find out such a person? - The first I did was to enquire of these houses whether they had any person of that name in partnership with them; they told me they had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you successful from the information that you could get in finding out whether there was a person of that name of Howard lived there? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I have no doubt but that you made a very general enquiry, but still it is possible there may be such a person at Plymouth? - One of the partners of Bulteel's went round with me to many respectable tradesmen. I afterwards searched the parish books and the Post office, and such a name as Howard was not to be found.(The note read.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I should be very sorry to take up the time of the court, but I would wish to state the simple facts that occur in this case. Some months back I was in the habit of going to Islington and Hornsey to spend my afternoon, there I got acquainted with a man of the name of Catipodi; he infinuated himself into my favour, and at several times borrowed money of me to the amount of six pounds; when I asked him for it, he always avoided giving it me, but at last he appointed a certain day; I went to Hornsey at the time, it was the 3d of August last; I told him that I was rather short, as I had been from my ship a considerable time; Catipodi evaded as usual, and said, he had no money in his pocket except a five guinea bill; which I took of him. I went to town about seven in the evening; I went immediately, as the most probable place to get this note cashed, where I was best known in town; and whenever I was in town have bore a most respectable character by every body there; I offered the note to Mr. Robertson as soon as I came in, I asked him if he could change it? he said, yes, he could. He went up stairs and brought down four guineas and a half, and borrowed half a guinea of one that is a witness in my favour. After this I asked for some eggs for supper, which he could not oblige me with, being rather late; so I drank my shrub and water, and wished them a good night. The very next day I was apprehended for being concerned with Catipodi and Davis, whom I had been seen with. It is hardly probable, in the minds of any rational being, to convict a man for going to a house where he was perfectly well known, endorsing a note with his own name, where the majority knew the place of my resort; and I should certainly have called the next day had I not been apprehended the next day, which was the 4th of August.</p>

On the 12th of August, Wednesday, I fastened the bar fast at two o'clock in the morning, the bar enclosed in the coffee house, in a till where we keep our money was deposited a ten pounds bank note, No. 1330; four guineas in gold, and near three pounds in silver; this drawer was locked; in another drawer unlocked were ten desert spoons, five table, and about a dozen of tea spoons, and two boat ladles in the bar; and a silver strainer and ten bottle ladles and a dozen tea spoons taken out of another drawer which was outside of the bar; I see them myself on Wednesday morning; our house was exceedingly full on Tuesday evening, and I was under the necessity of carrying in them things myself. After locking up this drawer where the money and bank note was, I then locked the outside door that fastens the bar, as I do not live in the house; we both of us have private houses.</p>
               <p>Q. You have servants that lay there? - Yes. Going out of the back door which leads into Dean's-court, just at two o'clock, the same morning, I found a back parlour window open, having had company in there, and they staid very late, they had left the window then; I had two servants up, and I called them both, and I waited till I see them make that window fast, and likewise the back door. About half after six the same morning, I was called on by one of my servants to inform me that the house had been robbed. I came to the coffee house immediately, went into the bar, and I found all that property gone, and I believe much more, only that is what I can swear to; I examined the bar, and found the lock taken off the bar door, the lower shelf taken down inside the bar, where the drawer runs upon, and the grove that the drawer runs upon, broke off, or unscrewed, I cannot rightly tell which. I waited till I could go to Mr. Alcock, to know what to do in the business, as he was very poorly, and he then sent for Mr. Hunt, who is a constable; we waited till about nine o'clock before we sent for a constable, and likewise I sent to the police office, and one Mr. Miller came down; he examined all the servants; afterwards Mr. Miller looked outside of the club room window and saw somebody had been over that wall; I observed the print of a hand over a door that leads into a club room; this might be between ten and eleven; this led me to a suspicion that it was

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160124"/>Q. In what way do you suppose that the person got in or got out of your houses Were any of the outer fastenings of the house broke? - None, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any circumstances that will lead us to a conclusion whether the person broke into the house, or broke out of it? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this print of the hand was over the door; was the door open? - It was close by the window, almost inside. The windows looks on leads over the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window open? - Yes. This is the window that it is supposed the person got in at.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you ordered some window to be shut? - That was the lower back parlour window. This window that I am now speaking of belongs to the club room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a room over the parlour? - No, nothing but leads; then even with these leads are the windows belonging to the club room. I rather think they got in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they returned the same way? - No; we suppose they opened the back door; my servant found the back door open.</p>
               <p>Q. You had ordered that back door to shut? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the person who was inside open that door without any difficulty? - Very easily, without any difficulty at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find that back door? - Open; my servant had been in before that,

               <p>Q. Did you sleep in the coffee house? - Yes. About a quarter after one in the morning I was setting the book belonging to the club, and I heard a noise in the street; I went out to see what it was and they were dispersed, and the prisoner at the bar accosted me, and I did not know him; he accosted me at the end of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he formerly lived with Mr. Berry the time you did? - Yes. I asked him who he wanted, and what he wanted? he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with the other people in the street? - No, by himself. I asked him if he wanted any body there? his answer was, d-mn it, don't you know me? I then said, Peter, how do you do? I asked him where he had been so long that I had never seen him? he said he had been cut down lately, that his uncle had behaved very ill to him, and that he meant now to go into the country. I put my hand into my pocket and found that I had the key of the cellar, and I asked him to go in with me to drink a glass of wine; and he said, no; I said, there was nobody up but myself, if he would go in and drink a glass with me, he went in with me, and I fastened the door, and we went down stairs into the cellar, and we drank two or three glasses of wine together.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour was this? - It was about three o'clock, as nigh as I can guess when I parted with him.</p>

               <p>Q. How was it then, light or dark? - I could not discern any person, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish any person's face so as to know him again? - I could a few yards. I fastened him out, and went to bed about three, as nigh as I could guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person that went to bed? - The last.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went in with you, there were none of the servants up? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants are there in the house? - There are ten in the whole men and women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the back door? - I fastened the back door. At half after six in the morning I was called up by the porter's boy, William Leech.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what could induce you to go out at that time of the night to speak to this young man? - I did not know he was there. I went out on account of the noise in the street; nor I did not know him when he accosted me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say you are a waiter in this house? - Yes; first and last going on of nine years; the last time between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you been in the interim? - I lived at the Six Bells, Dove-court, Lombard-street, three months.</p>
               <p>Q. A short time! What time of the morning was it you went out? - About a quarter after two.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out because you heard mob? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160126"/>Q. You was the last up in the house? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went out and left all the doors open when there was a mob at the door? - I did go out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not recollect your old friend when you met him. He had been a servant in the same house? - He had; but it was so late in the night that I did not know him; he never spoke till I spoke, who he was, and what he wanted, or whether he wanted any body there or no?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was an hobgoblin that you should accost him in that kind of way? - He standing before me, and looking me full in the face, that was my reason for asking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you say just now, that when the prisoner accosted you, you said you did not know him? - I did not know him; he accosted me.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him into the cellar to drink, though he had been such a stranger to you. Honest Isaac is an honest man indeed. How much did you drink in the cellar? - Two or three glasses, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shut him outside the door? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what distance did you go from this house to where the mob was? - Only to the top of the court.</p>

By the time I had searched the apartment, the prisoner came, when he came into his room I shut the door and told him my business; on which I searched the prisoner, and found no property on him; he had a new pair of boots on, I asked him where he got them? he said, of Mr. Hardy; I asked him what he paid for them? he said, eight and twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say Mr. Hardy lived? - I did not ask him, because I knew where he lived. I asked him how long he had them? he said, about five days. The prosecutor was absent he came in by the time I had done searching him, and I told him what I had done, and that now we must take him before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. The boots are not the prosecutor's? - No, they are the prisoner's by purchasing them at Mr. Hardy's, though not paid for them.</p>

I told him; Mr. Berry came up soon afterwards, and said a few words, and looked over the things that were about me; he then asked me to get my dinner, I did, and then asked me to go to Union Hall; the magistrates were not sitting; they asked me to meet them at half after six, or seven in the evening, I told them I would, and which I did, I was there before Mr. Berry came, waiting for him.</p>

I told him, and I came up stairs and wrote my directions in a small book that I had got; this was on Wednesday, between one and two o'clock when I first see him; when we came out of the cellar I suppose it might be near three o'clock; I gave him my direction, and desired him to call when he pleased on me; which he put in his pocket, and walked out of the house, and I locked the door; and it was four by that time that I got home; it was nearly three before I got out of the cellar, and twenty minutes after three before I got out of the house, so it was four in the morning before I got home; afterwards I went about seven o'clock, and coming up Carter-lane, at the end of Dean's-court, I picked up a ten pounds note, it was wrapped up, quite screwed up, this was the same morning, the 12th of August; the landlord will inform you I was out by that time in the morning.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What Hotel did you enquire at? - King-street Hotel; I then went to St. James's-street, to Peros, thinking it might be a mistake; the people said also that there was no captain Brown lodged there, nor yet his steward; then I enquired at three Hotels in Jermyn-street, and there was no such person at either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say? - When I refused to let him have the note back again till I had enquired about it, then after that he asked me if I would let him have part of the money, that he was very much destitute, I told him that it could not make much odds to him for one night; he then said he was sorry he had been so long in my debt, but he said now he was going as captain's steward, he could be of service to me, he then ordered a quarter of a pound of eight shilling, and a quarter of a pound of ten shilling teas, and some sugar, he did not order any thing else then, but he said he would have some more things of me, as he had kept me out of my money solong; he took the teas and sugar and was going off, but I said to him, Mr. Hanson, you have not paid for it; dear, says he, Mr. Sills, you have enough in your hands; I said there was so many tricks in the world that I could not let him take it without paying for it, for the note might be worth nothing for what I knew; he said he should want it the next morning for his breakfast; I told him then I would bring it down to him the next morning, when I came down to him to King-street Hotel; and I put it in my pocket the next morning to take to him for his breakfast, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say he would be the next morning? - In the Hotel, King-street, that his master was there, and he should be there himself in the morning.</p>

             but at No. 363; when Mr. Falk gave me the bill, he said that Martin was a very capital man, that he had one brother a master taylor in the Strand, and the other a master of a ship, and that they were very capital people, and that I had not the least reason to doubt the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what that Robert Martin was? - Yes, he told me he was a slop seller, and knew him very well, and Martin did know him very well, and he owes him money to this time; and Martin served the ship's crew of one captain Peckman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any quart pot on the 27th of August? - Yes, I see him take the pot, about four o'clock, rather turned the middle of the day, at that time he came to the bar and had a glass of gin; he had used the house frequently, this six or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160132"/>seven years, backwards and forwards; on this particular day I looked at him, and he shoved the pot to the other end of the table, he was standing in a box in the tap room, I don't think there was any body in that same box with him; he shoved the pots under his hat, and I looked at him, I see him shove the pot from one end of the table to the other, with his hat, and he was stocking his hair, and was talking with the company in the other box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hat laying on the table before? - He pulled it off his head, and it was laying with the crown downwards; I had spoke to several people in the house about it; I missed the pot from the box, and did not know which way he had conveyed it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his manner at that time did not strike you? - Yes, it did, but I was called away, I had occasion to go to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent? - Not half a minute; and he came out at the same time, of the tap room door, and went out into the street; I followed him about three or four doors, and I said, Durand, you have got a pot of mine, and I touched him over the hat, I thought he could not hold the pot in his hat, on his head I found it was not there, and I put my hand round his waist, and felt his pockets, I thought I must really be mistaken, for I felt nothing; I said, if you will come back with me I shall be satisfied, and I certainly will take you back; when he came back I pulled up the bit of apron that he had before him, and he had the quart pot in his breeches, he pulls the pot out of his breeches, and gave it to me; I said, you rascal, what do you mean by taking my pot? he dropped down on his knees, and begged for mercy; I said, you rascal, how can you expect for mercy, when I have flogged my own children through you for these five weeks; he and no answer at all, but begged that I would not prosecute him, for the take of his family; I took him to Marlborough-street, and he was committed. This is the pot, it had remained in my possession ever since.</p>

Was you in this house this afternoon? - Yes, I see the prisoner in the top room, I took no notice of him till Mr. Payne thought he had took a pot out of the box, and brought the prisoner back; he was in the middle box; the prisoner went out, and Mr. Payne went out after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the prisoner do any thing before he went out of the box? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did Mr. Payne go out after the prisoner? Not half a minute, I see Mr. Payne go out in a hurry, and I went just out after him to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to the door? - Yes; Mr. Payne was bringing of him back, and he took him into the kitchen, and I see Mr. Payne take up the apron that hung before him, and there was the pot inside of his breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask Mr. Payne whether he took the pot from me, or whether I gave it him?</p>
               <p>Payne. The prisoner unbuttoned his breeches, and I took it from him when he pulled it out of his breeches; I see the pot inside of his breeches before ever he pulled it out; the pot was quite warm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he was before the magistrate he swore that he took the pot from me. I was very bad for about five months in St. Thomas's Hospital, and I am now under the doctor in the goal. I never committed such a crime in my life before; I have a wife and family of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160133"/>three children; I am very sorry it happened; I throw myself entirely on the humanity and clemency of the court.</p>

            , of Gray's Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any thing else? - Four five guinea bills, either payable there, or at the town where they were drawn, or at Sir James Esdaile's; three Blandford notes and one Cobham, all payable at Messrs. Esdailes. He was to take the money and go to Mr. Potter's at Chelsea, and sell a cow that was left at Mr. Potter's, and he went and sold that cow for ten pounds, and kept that money and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to do with this draft? - He was to take the money, and to bring it to me in the country where I live, that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him in what way he was to get change for these notes? - I did not. I live at Bush, near Watford, in Hertfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before he was apprehended? No, not from that day he went off till he was brought into custody, the 6th of July. I have travelled four hundred miles after him, at last I advertised him, and I had him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you been in the habit of employing the prisoner at the bar to make purchases for you? - Yes, he has bought and sold for me different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he had large sums of money at times in his possession of your's? - Yes, sometimes he may have had three or four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he lately come to any balance of his accounts with you? - No, not for a fortnight before; that was for road charges. As for sums of money I sometimes gave him a hundred, sometimes two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the account unsettled with him for charges, or for sums of money received? - Only for charges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have settled with him for money that you have given him in the course of your business to make purchases? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had employed him for about two years? - Somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not desire you to give him the drafts, it was your desire of him? - I gave him the drafts to go for the money according to my order.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned friend has stated to the jury that you never heard any thing of this man from the time that he went off with the money till he was taken up? - Yes, I never see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160134"/>Q. Have you never heard by letters from him, saying, that he had lost the money, and was exceeding sorry? - Yes, I had letters from him about a month or six weeks before he was taken; I don't know that I had ever another.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have not you received many letters from him, acknowledging that he had lost the money, and wishing very much to come to an account some how or other, to give him time, as he wished, to work it out? - He seat me a letter that if I would meet him a hundred miles off he would give me some trifle that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he never given directions to any one person to apply to you to settle this business, for you to give him his time? - Nobody made any proposals to me. A man came to me once, and said that he had but twenty nine shillings left.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he or did he not in the letter say, that he had lost the money? - Yes, he said he had lost the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This draft and notes that you gave him, he was to get cash for them? - No, he was to go and get the money for them, cash or notes; I did not order him to take cash or money; but a man that wanted to take that quantity into the country, I should have thought would not take cash, he would have taken bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure that you delivered him this, not at his requisition, but by your own desire, and for your own voluntary purpose? - To be sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes, in fact, were changed at Messrs. Coutts and Co. and at Messrs. Esdaile's and Co.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you delivered to him the notes and the check; and he received the money on the notes and check? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then all you mean to say is, that you gave him this check and notes, and you never see the value of them? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many months had elapsed, and how many times had this money been advertised before the letter came that he had lost the money? - I advertised him several times.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it before he told you this story of his having lost the money; and was it after he had been advertised, or not? - Four or five months, I dare say. I advertised a guinea reward, several times for taking him, and nobody would take him; he was in Lincolnshire, and then in London, and backward and forward several times. I never see him. but I was told so; but when I advertised five guineas reward, then in the course of a month, I had him brought out of Rutlandshire.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you see Mr. Dennett write that draught himself? - The prisoner received the draft himself of Mr. Dennett.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you present? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did the prisoner bring to you a draft drawn by Mr. Dennett on Messrs. Coutts for seventy-eight pounds? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which you delivered to him again? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body here to prove the sale of the cow? - Yes, Mr. James Potter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potter was called and did not answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the court that there was not evidence sufficient to go to a jury.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys contended there was, because Mr. Knapp had proved by his own cross examination of the prosecutor, that the prisoner had acknowledged to receiving the money, because he had written that he had lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner must be acquitted, because that letter is not produced, which is an acknowledgment of receiving the money; and the clerk who paid the money does not prove that he paid it to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come alone, or with any body else? - No, there was a lad with him. I went to the door, and I says, pray what do you want? and he said, he wanted a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said so? - John Lewis. I told him that there was no porter sold. I I did not sell any; he asked me what then I sold? I told him nothing at all; he then said to the boy, come in my lad, and he swore he would have something before he went out; the words he used were, I believe, he would be d-d but he would have something before he went out. I said no more.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you see Lewis kick this Galley? - Yes, at the outer door, as he opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after this? - I don't know, I did not see him any more, the door was shut, and I never see him again.</p>
               <p>Q. What door? - The outer door of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shut the door? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what was done to the house? - I was in at the neighbours. The minute the door was shut I ran backward to my house, and ran in and fetched a key, and locked another door at the end of the passage, nor joining to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your house stand up a passage? - Up a long passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Then by the door of the passage, you mean the door at the outer end of the passage in the street? - Yes. I went in to search a key to lock another door that is at the end of that passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in doors into your own house? - Yes. Before I came into my yard, I tried my neighbour's door at the side, to run into their house, but it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock that door of your's? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You tried your neighbour's at the side that is in the passage, I suppose? - Yes; and I stood in the yard about a minute; while I stood there, the inner door was burst open, the pannel burst through; the second door of the passage that I locked; I thought then I must make my escape, and I went up one pair of stairs, I could not come out but at a window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at the time that the pannel was burst through? - I was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the pannel was broke? - Yes, a wide pannel. I then went up stairs of my own house, and I was lifted out of window over the boards of a small parlour, into a neighbour's house, and assisted into their house, and I saw no more of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were being lifted into your neighbour's house, who were about the house? - Immediately as I got out of the house, the mob came in; the servants of the house cried out, Mrs. Ostliff will be killed, and people came and helped me out of the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160137"/>Q. Did you see the mob? - I did not get up to look at them.</p>

               <p>Q. When the mob went away how did you find your house? - They were above three hours and upwards I think before the gurards could come.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what damages were done. - There was a great deal of damages, the furniture was all broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Never mind the furniture. What damage was done to your house? - The windows broke, the bricks a good deal hurt by throwing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the window frames? - Some of the window frames were entirely out, and I had some gentleman's property that were going out of England, with books, and trunks of wearing apparel, and my own clothes, every thing was taken away; these things were taken out into the street, and broke to pieces and tore.</p>
               <p>Q. I think your husband was not at home at this time? - He had not been in town for these seven months.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has your house been without a licence? - It is three or four years; I cannot tell exactly. It had no licence before my husband came to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Ostliff carry on the recruiting business for himself, before he went down in the country? - He did, but not after.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there no other there besides these two belonging to colonel Blake's regiment? - There was a serjeant Steward who has now entered into colonel Blake's regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Then serjeant Steward, at that time, did not belong to colonel Blake's regiment? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The serjeants of colonel Blake's regiment constantly lived in the house? - Yes, they slept in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your husband a lease of the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a tenant at will? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you let the whole of the house to colonel Blake? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you let the whole of the house to colonel Blake? - I let the beds, not the whole of the house; I have an apartment in it myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160138"/>Q. You told me just now that you let the house to colonel Blake? - Yes; I did not know that it was improper; I let the house to colonel Blake for his regiment.</p>

               <p>Q. Then was the house colonel Blake's or your's after you had so let it? - I was the mistress of it, I lived in it; I only let the lodgings to colonel Blake.</p>

               <p>Q. What rent do you yourself pay for the house? - Two and thirty pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the parlour, bed room, and dining room that you keep, do you keep them entirely to yourself; not your bed room, but your parlour and dining room? You told us there was a recruit drinking tea with you. Did they, or did they not use any one of the rooms in common with you? - If they are gentlemen I let them eat, dine and breakfast with me. I never had any body but what was very quiet.</p>

               <p>Q. You say that your house was down a long passage from the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any part of your house come into the street? - No, only this door at the end of a long passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing paid to you for any assistance you gave to these men? Did colonel Blake give you any thing for furnishing these men with victuals, or any thing of that sort? - No; I had nothing but a guinea a week of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that passage to your house? - I cannot say how long; it was the depth of a house, two rooms in depth.</p>
               <p>Q. Somewhere about ten yards perhaps? - There was a room in the front and another room in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two doors in the passage, and both of them must be past before your house could be come at? - Yes, they must.</p>

               <p>Q. There is a door to your house in the yard? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your house door is the door of the house in the yard? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the inner of these two doors in the passage from your house itself? - I believe it is about the distance from me to your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. Then to come to your house, after one has gone through the passage, one must cross a yard? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there being the sign of the King's Arms, it was nothing extraordinary this man coming and asking for some beer? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. You refused to give him any beer. Why even if you sold beer, he was so drunk you would not have given him any? - I did not see him intoxicated with liquor at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively that man was not most dreadfully drunk? - I said but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not drunk when he came to your house? - I cannot swear he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he most beastly drunk when he came to your house? - I cannot swear any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not drunk? - I cannot do that.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear neither one thing or the other? - I cannot do that. I did not conceive him drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160139"/>Q. But you will not swear he was not? - No, I cannot swear he was not, as I had so little to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you let apartments in this house for any other purpose than that of recruiting? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You reserved a part for yourself, and considered yourself as mistress at the time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body at your house of those whom you call the mob? - I heard the mob; but I was so ill I could not look.</p>
               <p>Q. What noise were they making? -A great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular cry? - Hallooing and crying out they would set the house on fire.</p>

               <p>Q. You are enabled to form a plan of the premises on paper, so that you can explain the form of the house to his lordship? - I have just done it. The outer door of the passage, you enter it from Charing Cross, that is a covered passage by one or both of the houses adjoining, on the one pair of stairs floor, each of the houses adjoining to that passage have a door in it; that passage, I believe may be about twenty-four feet long, at the end of which there is a door, which goes into the yard belonging to Ostliff's house, that yard, I believe, may be about fifteen feet square, at the further side of the yard is the door of the dwelling house; on the left hand side is what was called the tap room, and on the right the kitchen, each of them having a window looking into the yard; on the left hand side of the yard there is a small room, to which you enter by a door from the yard only, and in which room there is a window which looks into the yard; on the right hand side of the yard there are two small rooms, to the first you enter from the kitchen, and to which there is a window looking into the yard; to the inner room you can only enter from the last room, and that is lighted by a sky light; these rooms on the right and on the left side of the yard are one story high only, and it was over there where, I presume, Mrs. Ostliff made her escape, into one of the back windows of her neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the house of Ostliff is perfectly distinct from the others that have their doors in that passage? - Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. What is the width of the passage? - About three or four feet.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160140"/>Q. Was any answer made? - The answer was made that there was none fold in the house; it was made by me for one, that there was none fold in the house, nor had there been any for some time; he said, he would be d-ed but he would have some. I went to the young man that came with him, Hollis, and desired him to walk out, not to breed a riot there Lewis got up and -</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been sitting? - Yes, he was sitting at the same time. Lewis got up, and the lad said, he would go out, he did not mean any offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Lewis got up from his seat? Yes. Hollis was going, Lewis took the lad Hollis by the collar and brought him back again; he then swore he would be d-ed if he should not come back and have some porter. We then told him again that the licence was lost, and there was no porter, nor any other liquor sold there, Lewis said he did not care for that, he would have porter I then told Lewis if he did not go, I would acquaint his colonel of him to-morrow; he then said he did not care a d-mn for that, he belonged to the third regiment of guards; and shewed me the buttons at the same time; he then said that we were a set of knidnapping thieves. Steward then took Lewis by the collar and led him to the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the street door, do you mean, the door coming out of the house into the yard, or the door at the end of the passage? - The door at the end of the passage the further end against the street.</p>
               <p>Q. That which goes to Charing Cross? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between them in the passage, that you heard, of any consequence? - Nothing that I heard of any consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. When Steward got him to the end of the passage, what became of him? - A recruit that we had in the house, Galway, was shutting the door, Lewis then turned round and kicked the recruit on the thigh, and said, he was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what became of him? - A short time after that, about five or six minutes, when the door was shut -</p>
               <p>Q. When was it shut? - He immediately shut the door, and shut both Lewis and the lad that came with him out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the lad come along the passage, from the room of the house to to the end of the passage, out at the street door? - He went before Lewis, by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the recruit immediately shut the door? - Yes, after he received the kick.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you say Hollis had gone down the passage before Steward took Lewis down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then Galway shut the door, and Lewis and Hollis were both shut out into the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the door remain shut before any thing else happened that you will have to relate? - I believe it was about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was it shut, when Galley had shut to the door? - There was a spring lock, I believe, on the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other fastening? - There were bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bolts bolted on the door being shut? - Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after the door was shut? - We all went back into the house, and about five or six minutes afterwards I went to the door to open it, I went by myself; when I opened the door Lewis was standing in the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by accident that you went to open the door, or did any thing happen to occasion you to do it? - Nothing happened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160141"/> that occasioned me to open it, it was generally kept open.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed Lewis in the middle of the road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the middle of the road? - In the middle of the street, by Charing Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the lad? - He was standing there, and Hollis, the lad near to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any people then about? - None at all; he comes up to me, and struck me, and said, d-mn your kidnapping eyes, there, take that; there were two grenadiers that were standing by they got before the door, and prevented me from going into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they interfere? - They did, they swore that if I attempted to come in they would knock my eyes out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they standing when you said so? - At the street door, both of them, they got between me and the door.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said that you see no people by at the time? - Not before he struck me, they came up while he was striking me, and got between me and the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after this? - I was obliged to defend myself for some considerable time against Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. When those grenadiers prevented you, did Lewis do any thing? - He came up to strike me, and repeated striking me for some considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more to you? - Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say you was desending yourself as well as you could against Lewis? - Yes, till such times as a gentleman belonging to the next house adjoining to the street door, went to get into his house, he assisted me in getting me from the door; I was obliged to get into his house, the grenadiers prevented me from coming into the passage; as I was going in Lewis called out, stop the kidnapping thief; he then told the mob -</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people begin to assemble then? - A very great number, there were then several hundreds before I could get in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How many, speak within moderate compass, might there be about this house, before Lewis spoke to that mob? - Two hundred. He told them there were people chained down in the cellar, and one nearly dead; I heard him myself, he spoke these words as I was trying to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what cellar did he say? - In the King's Arms, in the cellar belonging to the house; he said there were back ways to escape by water.</p>
               <p>Q. This was spoke to the multitude that was there? - They were all there, and he spoke it out loud in order that they might stop me. I then got into the door of the house adjoining the passage, and got through the passage into our own house; the front door adjoining the street was then shut and bolted; I don't know who fastened it.</p>

               <p>Q. The front door of the passage you mean? - Yes, I went up and see it myself shut and bolted; I then sent for a constable to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send? - I don't know any name in particular, but any one I could find.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went for the constable? - The landlord's daughter of the next house adjoining; I desired that somebody would go for a constable in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. There being a house on each side of the passage, they could hear you desire that somebody would bring a constable? - There were several people with me then in the passage; I desired somebody to go that was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a constable brought? - There was one immediately,

               <p>Q. How did he get admission into your house? - In at the door that I came in at, the time Lewis struck me. When he came he searched the house, and went out to satisfy the mob that there was no such thing in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened on this? whereabouts were you? - In the passage at the same time; the mistress of the house then sent a girl to go for the horse guards; I heard her send; Mrs. Ostliff did. In the mean while they broke open the front door, but there are two other doors before we came to the house door, and they were all fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. The outer door to the passage you found bolted, you did nothing additional to the door? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing else to any other door? - I shut one of them to, somebody else shut one of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you do yourself? - The last door in the passage; there is a middle door in the passage, then there is the passage door from the yard to the passage; I shut and bolted it myself, I don't know which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You see them shut and bolted? - Yes, I see them all three shut and bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. What other doors were shut and bolted? - The middle door prevents us from going into the next house, that comes into our passage.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two doors in the passage, that opens into other houses? - I do not recollect now whether each of them open.</p>

               <p>Q. How far do you come along the passage before you have a door, from the end of the passage? - There is a door at the end, that goes into the next house.</p>
               <p>Q. At the end of the passage there is a door that opens into Ostliff's house? - Yes, there is, but there is another door at the end of the yard; there are three doors besides the house door; the doors are exactly opposite one another.</p>
               <p>Q. But they do not all shut up the passage of Ostliff's house? - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>Court. At the end of the passage there is a door that opens into the yard, that was also secured? - Yes, it was, it was pushed to, but I did not lock it myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there is another door more than we were aware of; then there was a second door in the yard, how was that secured? - I shut it to, the same as the front door, and bolted it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been after this outer door was shut, and you had got into Ostliff's house, before any thing happened that alarmed you? - It might be nearly half an hour, or rather more, I don't know exactly the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What then happened that alarmed you? - They broke in all doors, then we were all of us obliged to jump out of the one pair of stairs window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing more before you made your escape? - I see them all standing in the passage, as many as could be, and threatened they would kill every one in the house, several of them threatened with very bad oaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you see them was from the house? - We were in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near had they come to the very house door, before you made your escape? - They came to the last door in the passage, and broke it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you see them rather on this side of the passage? - Yes, in the yard; some of us got out of the house before they came into the yard, after they made these oaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay before you made your escape yourself? - I staid a very short time, but they were all gone before me, I got out and assisted them out, and got in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you assist them out? - I got on to the leads, there was a little parlour a little distance, adjoining to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You assisted them out on the leads belonging to Mrs. Ostliff's house? - Yes, and they went along these leads to the third house, a wine vaults, to one Mr. Ray's, and got in at their one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. By which they made their escape? - Yes, I remained in the yard a short time, till they came into the yard, some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You made your escape at last the same way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you made your escape were you in any situation where you could see what happened in Ostliff's house? - Yes. I was up in the house where we made our escape, in the top garret, and which overlooks the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what past within your opportunity of seeing it? - I see him go into the house, and bring out the goods, linen, furniture, and bedding.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the whole of it? - No, there was a little left in the top garret, which they could not go to, they brought out linen and boxes with clothes, and the furniture, nearly all that was below; it was entirely destroyed in the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Having this opportunity of looking at them, to speak within moderate compass, how many people might come into your house? - The first I see was two little boys, I believe two little blue coat boys.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by the frames? - The window frames, and glass windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing more? - I see them in the street destroy several things.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they knock them out? - Yes, frames and glasses, altogether.</p>

               <p>Q. What, your situation enabled you to look into the street as well as to the house? - Yes, there was a front garret to the house, from that I could get into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see any thing further about the house? - Nothing further.</p>
               <p>Q. Either in the one place or the street, or the passage, did you see any thing of Lewis, the prisoner? - Not at all, I see nothing of Lewis after the door was shut, as I mentioned before.</p>

               <p>Q. And then the horse guards came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the beginning of this affair, to the time that the horse guards came? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be two or three hours? - Yes, I dare say it was, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing when the horse guards came? what time did you get to examine the house? - Nearly eleven, or twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the street did you observe any thing of Lewis then? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you came into the street? - I did not go into the street directly, there was such a mob round the door; I got into the house the same way as I got out.</p>

               <p>Q. When you had any opportunity of examining the house, about eleven or twelve o'clock, what observation did you make on it? - It was a mere skeleton, the furniture was all out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any part of the brick work loose? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Q. How were me cases of the doors and the cases of the windows? - All entirely broke to pieces, there was not one lost at all at the bottom part.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the inside of the house, the partitions? - Torn about very much, all broke to pieces, nearly so.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no door shut, but they came in at once? - Yes, the door was always kept open in the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. It was five o'clock, in the month of July when they came? - Some where there abouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any the least pretence for such a tale as this man had put, of their being men chained down in the cellar, and of their escape by water? - None in the least, nor never was to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was their any other recruit but Galway? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And that man helped to put him out of the house? - He shut the door after him; Galway came back to the house, and got out of the window likewise, to make his escape, the same way as I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any person confined? - Not a soul, but a little boy about fourteen years of age, a servant girl and a recruit.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any confined in the house? - None, and the boy and girl were servants of her's.</p>
               <p>Q. These persons, were they confined or imprisoned? - None in the least; all frighted out of their wits.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any trap doors in the house? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search with a view to discover whether there were any trap doors or not? - I did, all over the house, at her request.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found none at all? - There was none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you made this search, were there many persons about the house? - A number of people assembled, I dare say to the amount of two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they peaceable and orderly at that time? - No, very riotous.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way were they riotous? - They said it was a kidnapping house, and there were a number of people confined, and I contradicted them, and said it was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had searched the house, did you tell the people on the outside what appeared to you? - I came out and said, I am well known in this parish.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said that, you contradicted them; was it after you searched the house? - It was, and I offered to resign myself to the mob, if I did not tell them the truth, and if any one of them would go in with me, I said I would take any one in with me, but I would not go in with more; repeatedly I said to them, where is the drummer, the man that has made this riot? they told me he was over the way; I went over the way to him, and I found him sitting in the Ship, in the kitchen, at Charing Cross, with a pot of beer before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that drummer again if you was to see him? - That was the young man at the bar. I said to him, young man you have been guilty of a very great indiscretion, in making a riot about this woman's house, without any foundation; says he. I suppose you belong to the kidnappers, and you are come to vindicate their cause; no, says I, young man, here is my authority, and I had my truncheon, I took out my truncheon; I said, you see I am a parish constable; now young man, you have acted exceedingly wrong, come into the house, and testify to the mob, all to be false, that there was nothing in it, and let us try to disperse this mob if we can, before more comes; he refused going, he told me that I wanted to serve him the same, to take him in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by taking him in? - In order to trepan him; I offered him my address, I said I lived in Chandos-street, you know where to find me if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160146"/>any thing amiss comes of it; you know there is justice for me as well as there is for them; a number of people all sitting in the box, began to say they would go in if he went in; he would not go without I would take all the rest in who were sitting in the box; I said, if you will not go, young man, and assist me in dispersing this mob, worse will come of it; a number of people that were in the room, and about the door, began to hustle me, and use me extremely ill, and I was glad to make my escape; he did not use me ill himself, but the people that were sitting in the box did, and the people about the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they begin to use you ill? - They told me I was a crimp and a kidnapper, and come to defend their cause. I escaped then to the horse guards, and begged of the guards to go along with me; a sergeant and twelve soldiers could have quelled the mob at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go that time to the horse guards? - For to get a guard to protect the house, and we would have kept the house from being hurted, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did it from apprehension of danger to the house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. This hustling that took place on the outside of the door, was it within sight of the mob that were assembled about this house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any more of this? - I went to the horse guards; they told me they could not grant my request, I must go to a magistrate; afterwards Mrs. Gitliff's boy came running over to me, and I went to see for a magi strate, but there was none; so I brought up two constables from Queen's-square, and the mob were then breaking into the house; the constables said they would go and fetch Serjeant Kirby, at Knights-bridge; do you stay here, Broadfield, and to the best you can. A great number of the mob then began to ill treat me, and said I was come to have a watch over them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they doing at this time? - They were going in in a great force; I could not get up into the passage, but at last I escaped, and got home, and shut up my own house, for they said they would be at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Just as you came the door of the passage was broke open? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the mob in the passage? - They were in the passage, and in the house, full.</p>
               <p>Q. During the tumult were you enabled to distinguish any person in particular? - Yes, but I had no force, I was frightened to get away as fast as I could, because the mob told me they would be at my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you went to the Ship you found this young man with a pot of beer before him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Being drunk he got that to sober him a little? - When I see him he certainly was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him very truly, that he had been guilty of a great deal of indiscretion, and you wanted him to go along with you? - I did, and shewed him my staff.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you shewed him your staff, he did not like to go along with you? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He had so much sense as to give you a'frational answer? - He said he was not sorry for raising the tumule about the house, and the house deserved to be pulled down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his expression? - He was not sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at the Ship, was it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what it was he had done? - He said there is this young lad coming in just now, I went with him to have some porter, and he said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160147"/>wanted to trepan and kidnap the lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say they wanted to trepan and kidnap? - The lad that was with him, John Hollis; he said it had been a kidnapping house, and they wanted to kidnap the lad that was with him, that he went in to have some porter with. With that I made answer, if I can make nothing here, I must go as quick as I can to the horse guards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The prisoner continued sitting in the box of the tap room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were afterward surrounded and bustled with some people outside of the door, consequently the prisoner was not with them, nor they with the prisoner? - They were not.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it you were hustled? - At the Ship door.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was in sight of the mob that were collected together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the people come from that hustled you there? - Different bystanders that were about the door, that were collected by my telling them that they had no foundation to stand there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is this Ship situated? - Nearly facing this gentlewoman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room where these people were sitting, the room that leads this way? - No, it is the room that is backwards, the kitchen; the tap room is in the front, but this was in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you live on the 12th of July, when this happened at Charing Cross? - At Mr. Marshall's house, Charing Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a daughter of Mr. Marshall? - Yes, he keeps a green grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 12th of July? - Yes, between five and six o'clock I see him in Mrs. Ostliff's yard; he came in and asked for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that at any time? - Yes, I see him jump on the goods, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any persons about the house when you see him jumping on the goods? - Yes, a mob about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of goods? - I cannot say, there were many different sort of goods.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time that the mob were bringing the goods out? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell my lord and jury the state of the demolition; when was it you see it? - I believe it was on or about the 29th day of August. The outer door next Charing Cross seems to have been forced off its hinges; it then lay in the passage with all the six pannels broke; the door at the other end of the passage seemed likewise to have been forced off its hinges, and was not to be found; the upper pannel at the door in the house, was likewise broke; most of the sashes, and of course the glass was destroyed, and some of the internal doors, as was likewise the door in the small room on the left hand side of the yard, and the sash of that room, as well as on the right hand side of the yard, there was a very little left of one of the sash frames. These were the most material damages that were done to the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Mrs. Ostliff. You are on your oath; how soon was it after this evening, that you had an opportunity of looking at your premises again? - I never went into the house for two or three days.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it when you see it then in the same condition as when Mr. Craigg looked over it? - Yes, it was.</p>

I went out of town the 2d of June, and I came back the 4th of August; I left her in charge of my house alone; when I came back I found my house in a very uncomfortable situation, exceedingly dirty. Afterwards when I came to examine, I found the windows were broke, table and chairs broke, that shewed there had been very disorderly behaviour in the house; I complained of the house being very dirty to receive me, and she fell a crying, and said, she had been a very bad girl, she said, she had kept very bad company.</p>
               <p>Q. This was exactly as it passed between you? - Exactly; I had not been two minutes in the house. She said she had bad connections, and had pawned a great many of my things. I said, you have used me very ill, who have you pawned them to? she said, to a young lady that was with me, whom I had brought out of the country with me, if she would come along with her she would shew her. The young lady said to me, ma'am, you need not go, for I have seen a little here that explains all; it was a letter that she had picked up in the kitchen. On which I said to the prisoner, tell me what you are after; says she, I will give you the duplicates. In consequence of that she gave me a great many duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trace the property by these duplicates? - Yes, at five pawnbrokers that are now in court.</p>

I never lost sight of him; he dropped the ham.</p>

               <p>I live at Islington; I belong to the India House. On Friday, the 31st of July, I sent one of my children to school; I gave a boy in the neighbourhood, one of the witnesses, his box of linen to carry to the stage (James Hall) I desired him to meet me at Bishopsgate Church; by some mistake he went to a different part to what I directed him, and lost the box.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it contain? - I cannot charge my recollection particularly, but childrens linen chiefly, which I marked myself the night before, about nine o'clock.</p>

I said, yes, I was waiting for a gentleman; and he stands a little while by the box, and then went and sit down a little while on a stone, and then comes to me again, and asked me if I was waiting for Mr. Thornton? I said, yes; and he said, you must come along with me just down here to our house; and he said, you have waited longer than you expected to wait, have not you? yes, I said; he lays, you must come along with me, to our house, at the foot of the bridge. Going along he asked me whether he should carry the box; I took the box and followed him some way; then going along he took the box off my head, and he said, I was going out of my way, I might go home; so I observed that Mr. Thornton was to pay me; he said, Mrs. Thornton would pay me; so I left him and the box. I thought the box was going to Mr. Thornton, so I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man that took the box? - I think I should know him. I think that is him (the prisoner) but I am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him? - In two days time.</p>
               <p>- GARNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a hosier by business, and I am Collector of the toll at Moorgate; I happened to know the prisoner and his companion that was with him, by a recent matter, of one who was robbed by them in a similar manner. On Friday, the 31st of July, between eleven and twelve, as near as I can guess, I see the prisoner and another with him, coming along London Wall, by the back of Bedlam; I was standing at the corner of Fore-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160154"/>street; knowing their characters, I had my eye rather watching them; this prisoner came first, waving his hand, in a perspiration as if he had been running; it directly struck me, and just behind him was his companion, who went with him every day; his companion had a box on his shoulder, the prisoner had not any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were in company together? - I am sure they were; I see them every day, half a dozen times almost. They then turned up the right hand of Bedlam, to go towards Moorfields, but they turned back again and went down London Wall. Curiosity led me to go to the corner of Coleman-street, to see which way they went, and when I came to the corner of Coleman-street, this prisoner was turning the corner, which is a green grocer's, and this prisoner seeing me, he immediately turned back, and made his companion go the back way again. In consequence of that I did not watch them any further then; seeing them go by Bedlam Wall, near Moorfields, happening to go that way, I knew where they went to; they were going through alleys to Mrs. Samuel's, in Grub-street; I takes a different course, and went through Fore-street, and went to Grub-street, and told the constable, Humphries, in Grub-street, that there were two thieves, and to go with me; he immediately took his stick and came down stairs, and I went up Grub-street with him, and I told him the alley they would come through with the property to Samuel's; we were waiting a little while, and we see the companion come empty handed to see that the place was clear, I suppose, and not finding any thing on the man that we stopped, I said to the constable, let us go through the alley and right up to the room where they live. Accordingly we went through the alley and let the other go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's lodgings? - We did, and found him, and a woman, his wife, in the room; and there was the property that is here, scattered about the bed, and the box with all the things turned out, and the box standing under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same box that you see his companion have a few minutes before? - According to the size of it it was; but it was tied up then in a brown apron; there was no other box of the size in the room. We secured the box and looked over the things; and he said they were his. The prisoner wanted to go out of the room, and I put my back against the door, and told him no. Accordingly when he wanted to shift, the constable came forward and helped me to tie the things up. When we were coming to Guildhall he wanted to make his escape, he made a sudden jerk and away he run from the constable, but we soon catched him again.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a locker, under the employment of the Excise office. Were you in the warehouses of Messrs Mashiter, Johnson, Bing; and Platt, on the 8th of September last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it their private warehouse? - It is a warehouse under the survey of the board of excise; I don't know whether it is their private warehouse or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar employed in that warehouse on the 8th of September last? - I believe a labourer there.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day did this matter take place? - About eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the custom of the labourers to leave the warehouse at that time? - Yes, to go to breakfast. About the bottom of the stair case I detected the prisoner with some coffee in his right high breeches or trowsers pocket, I don't know which, I believe he had both on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons going out at that time? - None but him. I observed somethings project on the right side of his breeches, which created my suspicion; I put my hand to him and found it was coffee beans. He was searched immediately in my sight; I saw it turned out of his pockets, it was raw coffee; that in the trowsers or breeches was loose, about a pound, he had got this handkerchief in his hand, and there was a clerk to Mr. Mashiter examined the handkerchief, when I found the coffee in his breeches I see it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was found in it? - Raw coffee. It all amounted, what was found in his breeches and handkerchief together, to upwards of five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other commodity in this warehouse but coffee? - I believe cocoa nuts. The casks were most of them open at the top.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this coffee on him did he say any thing? - He said something in a foreign language, but I did not at all understand him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160156"/>Q. Have you had that coffee in your custody ever since? - I have. It is West India coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the man speak English at all? - We desired him to, he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can he speak English? - To my knowledge he cannot, I never heard him speak English.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The sacks were all open up stairs, and some of the bags were broke, and the coffee came out, and I was bringing it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Witness. There were coffee beans laying very thinly all over the floor; you may pick up half a dozen in a foot square.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were these warehouses from whence the coffee was taken? - Over the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any coffee deposited in those warehouses? - Yes, a great deal, West India coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your warehouses are open to any merchant that lodge goods there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the warehouses belong to Messrs. Mashiter, &amp;c? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man any authority to carry away any part of the coffee? - He had not.</p>
               <p>- HANCOCK sworn.</p>
               <p>I was employed in these warehouses; I was called to from above stairs, and when I came down I see the prisoner and coffee in the possession of Willgrove, Willgrove had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been up in these warehouses where this coffee was? - I can hardly say. That morning there were sixty bags for exportation up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quantity of coffee scattered on the floor? - In different parts of the floor there is coffee scattered about which falls over, and then it is swept up and put into parcels by itself, to be cleaned.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose that is scattered by those that come to look at the coffee? - And by the coopers likewise; it is swept up by itself, and when there is any coffee wanted to make up the weight, then it is sifted and put into the cask to make up the weight; that coffee is taken care of as well as the rest; there was nothing but coffee in the second floor, three or four hundred casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on which floor this man worked? - The second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks may there be there, between two and three hundred? - I don't think there were as many as that; there were sixty bags that were going for exportation that morning, when this man was ordered there to aid and assist in delivering them, and the bags were not open.</p>
               <p>Q. But they may have holes in them? - Not them, when they are delivered, because they employ one man to few them up, and another man to deliver the goods. I spoke to him and he answered, but I did not understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Walker. Does the prisoner understand English? - Not that I know of When I employed him that morning I only asked him his name. I never see him before.</p>
               <p>Q. To Hancock. Did you observe that coffee whether it was sweepings? - It did not look like sweepings of the floor, it looked like clean coffee; I went and examined the coffee; there were several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160157"/>parcels opened close by the loop holes, but that might be by other people, and not by him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went with another man in the morning at six o'clock, I went to the warehouse, the second story, to work there, and I picked the coffee up at one place and another, and this is what I spilt, I picked it up and tied it in a pocket handkerchief, and we could not understand one another, and he took me and stopped me with the coffee on me; I brought it down to give it to them, because it was spilt; I had not worked with them any time then, and he took the handkerchief away from me directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in the cart? - Yes; he delivered them all but one, and he said, he must go and wash his hands; he went into the yard to wash his hands; there was nobody at home but myself, and I went to the door listening to the men counting the sacks, I told the men to be so kind as to stop, while I went to see what the man was about who was washing his hands; as soon as I returned up the passage to the man, he went into the kitchen, and the watch lay on the dresser covered over with the work bag, and I came down the passage, and I see the man come out of the kitchen, and I told him he had no business in the kitchen; his answer was, he wanted to see for something to wipe his hands. He comes and stands at the coals for a few minutes, there was a man came with some beer, I went in for some money to pay him; as soon as I came out to pay him, there was a man past by in a blue coat, and the prisoner at the bar said directly, ma'am, there is that fellow just come out of your house; says he, I would have you go and look; I went and looked round the kitchen, and the watch was gone off the dresser; I came out and charged the prisoner at the bar with it; and he said, if I thought he had got it, he would go to the White Lion and get a character directly; and he went there; I told the two coalmen to be so kind as to go after him to see what he had done with it. The men went after him, but they were not quick enough, he went in such a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a watch was it? -A metal watch.</p>

               <p>Q. You belong to the coal cart? - Yes. All that I know about this business is, that first of all I was telling up the sacks into the waggon, and the gentlewoman came out and told me to stop; I had got fourteen told up into the waggon; she asked which way my fellow servant had gone, she had missed him a good while? with that she went backwards and see him washing his hands, and she came out and had the remainder told up, and afterwards she went in again, and came out and accused the prisoner with the watch; he pulled out and orange and dropped it on the ground, and said, he had got nothing more in his pocket; and he asked her to accept of the orange; she did accept of the orange, and he ran away towards the White Lion; I pursued him first, and my fellow servant followed, and I was up first, and he knocked me down, and my fellow servant came up afterwards and said, now see if you can knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I put my hands down, and see no watch, nothing at all but an orange that he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Was he searched at all? - I believe he was searched, but it was some time after this accident happened. He had been in this court some considerable time, and there are some not of respectable characters live there, and I suppose that is how the watch went.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Bryant. Ask him if he did not search me before I went away? - No further than my fellow servant felt about him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he searched before he went away from the court? - No, he was not by no soul.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man, Mr. Darwin, searched me before I went away; I never went no further than to a house the back of the White Lion, and my friend was not at home, and the last witness came after me, and said, I must go back with him; I said, I will go back with you, and I struck him, but not to knock him down; they only want to clear themselves. They met me and asked me to go with them; I went with them; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160159"/>the coals were all delivered, I went down to wash my hands; they accused me afterwards with this, and I went for my friend to come forward; he was not at home; I was talking to his wife when they came up to me; I said, I would be righted, and they took me up. The next day I was before the justice, and the justice admitted me to bail, and I was at work till last Thursday twelve o'clock; I beard I was indicted, and I came and resigned myself up voluntary; and one of the evidence know that I have worked ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I consented it to be made a petit larceny, and he was admitted to bail, thinking he might be of some support to his family.</p>

On Monday the 25th of July last, I went out about half after nine, and returned about half after eleven, I cannot say to a minutes; I left every thing safe and found, all the doors locked up; when I returned I found the party wall all cut down, and I went up stairs and the oats were gone; that door was not locked. They broke down the party wall joining their premises and mine, so that two people might get in; I went up stairs and missed my oats and sick and all, there was rather better than a bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. Your door remained as you left it? - The room door was just the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the oats afterwards? - No. When I missed it I went down stairs and see the oats scattered about the place, and from that I had a suspicion of this person, and the watchman took him up the next morning in the highway, with the sack upon him; he lives in the next place, he and another man rents it; I see the oats scattered out of my place, and on the wall and into their premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to suspect that he had them? - No, no other than tracking them into their place; the next morning he was going to market with the sack on him, and I gave charge of him to the watch man, as he was going to Covent-garden. They opened the sack at the watch-house, and there were several cats shaked out. The sack was one that I borrowed of this man, and when I put the oats in the sack, the oats burst out of the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep oats in the sack? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any oats in it till you put the oats in it? - I don't know indeed. I am sure of the sack, because when I put my oats in it, the oats bursted out of two holes, and then I put same has in the holes, and put the oats in. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160160"/>more notice of the sack not being mine than being mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The prisoner keeps a horse, does not he? - He did keep a horse.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not this place next to your place, a stable belonging to a friend of his, in which he kept his horse? - His is the same as mine, a coach house and rooms over it.</p>
               <p>Q. But he does not live there? - No, he does not.</p>


               <p>Q. Now be so kind as to tell us how this stable was connected with your's? - Mine is the corner place, and there is but one party wall, and that belongs to me; it is the only wall in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to say that this was your party wall? On your oath answer me, sir. - The party wall belongs to the place that rent. I don't know how to answer. I don't understand what I am to say.</p>

               <p>Q. You are to say the truth, because I will have it; and shall have it presently? - Nobody desired me to say nothing; nobody has told me to say any thing, but just to speak the truth, as I thought myself, to say what is right.</p>
               <p>Q. You must give me a positive answer? - No person has not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear that positively. Then, sir, what are you? - I get my bread by selling things about the street, garden stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you and he were old comrades? - No; he frequently used to go out a dusting. I kept his company no more than if we had a pint of beer, I always paid my share of it; I never went out with him to sell any things at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deal in oats as well as in greens? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you buy oats and sell them again? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Be kind enough to give me a desoription of this party wall; how it separates the other stables from your's; whether it is built up from the bottom to the top? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that this stable of the prisoner's generally his the door left open in the day time? - I cannot say; I have seen it open, but not to say constantly.</p>
               <p>Q. When the horse is not there, the stable is left open? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, sir, was you ever told that there was a large sum of money in the case of a conviction for a burglary? - No, it is not that I have heard that, because they have offered me a horse and cart, and money besides, to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, upon your oath, heard there is a reward of forty pounds? that would be a pretty fortune? - I have heard that. I cannot swear who told me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the other witnesses on this trial? - John Wade, the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any patrol, or any constable besides? - There is the sergeant of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of those was it told you about the forty pounds? - Never a one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it told you? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you learnt this? - I don't know indeed. I did not do it for the sake of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been a week ago? - A long time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, which of them was it? - Neither of them. If I was to say so I must tell a lie; they never advised me, good or bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, who pays the rent of this place in which you lodge? - I pay it myself, and have been there near on two years.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of connection has this stable with your house? - There are the rooms over the stable, the room that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160161"/>live in is over the stable, by the lost, and the coach house is joining the stable.</p>
               <p>Court. The wall that is broke you take as part of your premises? - Yes, I do; my landlord said that it belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What may he the value of these oats you lost? - About five shillings, as near as I can guess.</p>

             came to me, and said he was robbed; he took me down to his place, together with the sergeant of the round, and shewed us the party wall broke, and there were oats scattered about the place. I took the prisoner into custody and the sack about half past four in the morning, and took him and the sack to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sack on the prisoner? - Yes. It was taken from him in my presence, at the time that he was charged in the watch-house. I could not discover any thing in the sack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I think you seem to be half and half now? - I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in a public house? - I have been in a public house for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you and the last witness were talking all this over? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very odd if he should recollect it and you not recollect it? - We have been talking about nothing further than wishing to be rid of it as fast as we could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the last witness has said that you and he were conversing about the evidence, he must have told a lie? - I cannot answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you the story over again if you like it. - It is a thing I cannot answer; it is not in my power to answer it without telling a lie. If I was to say so it would be telling a lie. I know nothing in the world of what you are talking about.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what that man is indicted for? - He is indicted for stealing oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the nature of the charge against him is? - I am no counsel.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem to keep your own counsel extremely strict. Do you know what this man is indicted for or not? - Yes, I know for what he is indicted, he is indicted, for oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know what the charged against him is? - He was charged for breaking the wall and stealing the oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the consequence of that charged - The consequence is just as the jury please to make it, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know that you are to have a reward if this man is convicted? - Upon my oath, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a watchman? - As much as three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, sir, to repeat that you have been three years a watchman, and that you don't know of a reward of forty pounds on conviction for a burglary? - I don't know it; I have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to say, when you came into conrt to prosecute that man for his life, that you knew nothing of a forty pounds reward? - It is a thing I am quite ignorant of; I only give you a clear evidence, and that is all I can say to you. Upon my oath there was nobody desired me to say any thing more than I have said.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160162"/>Q. Upon your oath did not you know that there was a reward at the time that this trial commenced? - The reward I paid no attention to, nor neither am I looking for any, but doing justice between man and man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you had this conversation with the last witness? - I don't know that ever we had any conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the last witness has said you had, has that man sworn true or false? - I think he must have sworn false, for I do not recollect I conversed with him in such a manner.</p>
               <p>- BATES sworn.</p>
               <p> I am lanthorn bearer to Mary le-bone watch-house. On the 16th of July the prisoner was brought in, about half past four in the morning, and the sack along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in it? - Some oats that shaked out on the table; the sack was spread on the watch-house floor, and Thomas Bishop said he could positively swear to that sack; in consequence of that I locked him up with the sack, and when I went to take him before the magistrate in Marlborough-street, about half after ten, the sack was gone; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the sack? he made no answer; I immediately told the magistrate that it must be certainly done by some of the parties that were with him in the morning. I never found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it ever been found by any body? - No further than one porter told me that this was the sack that he took away from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You locked the prisoner and sack up; where did you put the key? I generally hang them up; we have several different places, sometimes in the parlour, and sometimes in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the key that morning? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. You locked the sack up with the prisoner, and when you came back this wonderful sack, which contains all the magic in it, was gone? - I look upon it it was gone by his parties who came to see him; there is a hole where you can put a quart pot through.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you always as careless as you was that morning? - I have always taken care what I have to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you heard about this reward? - What reward?</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired that it should be made a burglary? - I know nothing about it, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if your two friends have said that you advised this prosecution as a burglary, they must have told what is false? - I don't know what they have said, I have said the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer - If they have said that to be sure they have said what is false, but I suppose they have not said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who heard this conversation before the magistrate? - There were many people in the office, the same as there may be in this court.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any sack there with oats in it? - Yes, there was. When I came back, about half past twelve, the wall was broke, and the bricks put into the hole, and I went up stairs after I came in; and there was a little sliding along of the sack, and a little streaking of oat corns.</p>

               <p>On the 12th of July last, I was coming home from the country very early in the morning, and I was surprised at finding Turnley, one of my apprentices up at that time; in Consequence of information received, I had the prisoners apprehended.

               <p>Q. To Gossett. Do you know whether you had coffee under your custody, in these warehouses, 15 and 16? - A vast quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other person any custody of coffee in these warehouses besides yourself? - None. I should inform you that the prisoner was not a servant of ours, but a cooper employed by the merchants to cooper the casks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was working for Mr. Pugh, there were seven of us in the whole, it was very warm weather, and I pulled off my hat, and in pulling my hat off my wig stuck to my hat, and I worked on till one o'clock, till dinner time; with that I clapped my hat and wig on, so as it may be now; I know I never put any coffee in, nor knew none to be there; the officer that locked us out of the warehouse, he searched me all down, at last he lifted up my hat, and there was some coffee in it, some few grains, and he said, you have some coffee there. I never put it in myself, nor know how it came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses? - No, I had none but my shopmates, and they happened to go down first, I was the last person that came down. I has worked twenty years before this for Mr. Pugh.</p>

            , I found in his waistcoat pocket, as near as I can recollect, about a pound; at this discovery he seemed very much alarmed, and proposed to take it out, to which I had no objection to; this was on the first floor where we were then; he went down into the cellar, and I stood at the upper door at the first floor door. I heard some coffee fall as though it fell out of his pocket; I did not hear any thing of him for some little time, and I concluded that he had made his escape; I desired the foreman of the warehouse to go down to see whether he was gone or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he go down into the cellar for? - To take it down to the cellar to return it. His being quiet in the cellar, I concluded that he was gone. When the foreman came down he was not there, he had made his escape out of the loop hole door; at his coming up he told me that the prisoner was not there, and by accident be put his hand on the hogshead where the blue jacket lay, and found eight or ten pounds of coffee in that jacket. The prisoner acknowledged it was his jacket in my presence, but first of all he denied it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - No, nor any thing of the kind. The foreman went in pursuit of the prisoner; the coffee was taken our of his jacket and put into a handkerchief, and it weighed eight pounds, in the presence of Mr. Pearson, the proprietor, the constable, myself, and foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the warehouses from whence this was taken, all under the Bull porters? - Entirely.</p>

I then went after the prisoner, and took him in Thames-street, in about five hundred yards; I went up to him and took hold of him, and desired him to come along with me down to my master's to take his money, for I told him I thought he was a man not sit to work among us; he seemed very much agitated; he did not make any resistance, but he kept walking on, and passing the Steel house coffee<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160168"/>house, I see master, and I backoned to him, and he came out, and we took the prisoner.

               <p>Q. Were you employed on the 29th of June last to supervise Mr. Wallis's brewery, West Ham? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was then in the service of Mr. Wallis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And formerly had been an excise-man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what past on the 29th of June? - I went there to survey; Mr. Gregory was there at the same time, in the brewhouse, in about ten or fifteen minutes after I had been there, Mr. Rogers came in, and finding that Mr. Wallis, his master, was then abusing me, he, Rogers, took it off his hands, and began himself to abuse me, using very illiberal language, calling me a dirty scoundrel and said that I was villainous liar, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160171"/>dirty scoundrel, and I should be exalted, and said, you will be hanged, you dirty scoundrel, you will.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue this sort of language? - Near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any provocation, or any ill language at all? - Not the least, I never said one single word to him; I was once in a very parlous situation, for Mr. Willis, the master, swore that I should he put into the ton of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that this day? - Yes; and Rogers said that I should be exalted as high as the vats, the vats that contain the worts, I suppose they are seven or eight feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had thrown this abuse on you, did he do any thing to you? - I went to rest my book on the usual place, against the ledge of the window, to enter my survey, he walked before me, finding where I wanted to put my book, and turned his back against it, and prevented me, and still kept abusing me for a dirty scoundrel, and I desired him to stand on one side, he refused; I then addressed myself to Mr. Wallis, and requested that Mr. Wallis would either desire him to go out of the brewhouse, or command him to be silent, that I might take my survey, but Wallis made me no reply. On this, going to rest my book on the window, I laid my hand on him, and desired him to stand on one side, to let me put my book on the window, that I might take my survey, after having repeatedly desired his master to command him to be silent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put your hand on him in any degree of force or violence? - None in the least, I had my book in one hand and the pen in the other, and this survey book, open in the place where it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. On that what did he do? - He struck me in the face, and repeated his blows several times, till Mr. Gregory pulled him off; he struck me on the eye, and cut my lip through, and other places about the face and head.</p>
               <p>Q. This must be done with his first then I suppose? - Yes, with his fist, his fist shut, his clinched fist.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blows do you think he might give you? - He might give me six or seven, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they violent? - Yes, as violent as ever he could with his clinched fist, at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of the blow on the eye? - It was black, and I could not appear for eight or nine days, and I was obliged to apply conserve of roses to it, and other things, and I was otherwise injured about the side of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to return any blow to him? - I never returned one single blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, Mr. Jones, given him any provocation to do this? - None in the least, he had at the time before threatened to shoot me, and said that he loaded his pistols ready to shoot me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Mr. Rogers and you I believe were not on the best terms? - I considered myself on the best terms with the defendant.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some reason to think so; had there never been any connection before between you, in which you was the unfortunate party? - On the 3d of November last he took a warrant out against me, in consequence of my coming forward to give bail for Mr. Higgins.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was no other reason?</p>
               <p>Court. Had you a dispute in November between you and Rogers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You say you had some words with Waths, his master, before he came, and then when he came in he took it off his hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence of that dispute was about a measurement or beer? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160172"/>About a charge that was made by the supervisor and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not be sent for? - I heard Wallis say to some of the men in the yard, call Rogers; I believe he came in consequence of being sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you and he quarrelled, I observed that in your manner of telling the story, you said that you put your hand against him; did you lay hold of him and pull him about, or any thing of that sort? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not threaten him to turn him out? - No, I did not, but I desired his master to send him out of the brew-house, or command him to be silent.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not suppose you can deny it, if it was so, that after you had actually put him out of the room, that Wallis said, why did you turn him out? and your answer was, why it shall not be long before I turn you out? - No, I desy any man to say so, and speak the truth about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect for what purpose you put your hand against him in that way? - I did as I said before, I wanted to put my book on the ledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you touch him? - He stood against the middle of the window, and I had not room.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the place particularly chosen by you? - That was the place in Mr. Wallis's house where I always rest my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have a rule never to rest it but in one particular place; and so you softly put your hand against him? - To remove him from that place.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not appear for some days, you was so hurt; did you go on with your survey at that time? - One of the officers surveyed for me that day, and the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make three days survey yourself? - I do not mean that it debarred me from doing my duty, I did do it, part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you might even on the very day, within an hour or two have gone to some other place to survey? - I made no survey till the following evening, six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to let me look at your book (looks at it) I see the article on the 29th, "Mr. Gregory on survey, obstructed in survey." How happened this to be put between the first article and the last? - I believe you will see.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go on with your business that same day or not? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Was this written the same time? Did you take any further survey that day or not? - To the best of my knowledge I did not; I went to the supervisor, and then to the excise office, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gregory had been there before you, and taken his survey? - I cannot take on me to say whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are supervisor? - No, I am not supervisor.</p>
               <p>Q. From any conversation that has passed since, you really don't know whether he had taken his survey or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you doubt whether he had or not? - I don't know, I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not measure it, and Mr. Gregory did? - I did not see Mr. Gregory take a single gauge in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whether Mr. Gregory before you went, had taken the survey? - Upon my oath I did not know, nor don't now know, nor ever asked to this moment.</p>
               <p>Court. The first article is, Mr. Gregory on survey; do you ever two survey together? - Yes, Mr. Gregory was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you found another officer there on survey, did you go on with a different survey? - I go on totally different; I don't know what he did, nor he don't know what I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160173"/>Q. Do you make a survey of the same articles as he makes a survey? - More officers than are appointed at that house, owing to the different offences discovered at that house.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to ask you is this, whether in point of usage, or in the line of your duty, it is the ordinary line of duty, to have two persons taking the survey; one after another? - Yes, it is the case in general throughout London, and in some houses there are three or four officers go one after another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you found one officer on survey, is it the common and ordinary mode of business of the excise, for you to proceed on the business of the survey, notwihstanding another officer is there? - 1l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. We have heard of a warrant when Rogers took out against you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that warrant discharged when it came before the magistrate? - No, the magistrate said it was a trick warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not tell me just now, that the magistrate discharged that warrant? - No, I was bound over in in recognizance.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you put your hand against this man, to remove him from the window? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you an officer of the excise on the 29th of June at Mr. Wallis's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You see Jones and Rogers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what passed between Jones and Rogers on that day? -When I went into the brewhouse first, there was no person in the brewhouse; I took my gauges as usual, what was necessary to be done, and then spoke to Mr. Wallis, and told him of the irregularity .</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what passed between you and Mr. Wallis, tell us what past when Rogers came in? - Mr. Rogers said, you are a lying villain, you will be exalted as high as the vats, the board are tired of you, and you are a villain; Jones said, they have proved you one, and not an ingenious one neither; then Jones went towards the window, and put his hand towards Mr. Rogers's coat, for Rogers to go out of the way for him to write.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for you to put your book on this place to write? - It is a cleanish place, I have seen Jones do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then? - Rogers then began to strike Jones about the face and head, he, Jone, endeavoured to screen his face as well as he could, till I came to his help, but he never struck or attempted to strike.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Rogers continue this beating of him? - He repeated a good many blows.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Jones get out of his clutches? - I stepped forward and pulled Rogers off, and that ended it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Jones after this? - His eye was very black, and his lip was cut.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Some days before this you had measured a gine, respecting which there was now a dispute. I believe you measured it twenty-one barrels and three firkins, did you not? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Q. However the fact is this, your measurement, and the measurement of Mr. Rogers agreed? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Your measure and Mr. Jones's measure did not agree, Mr. Jones made it some barrels more than you? - Mr. Cooper did I believe, it was Mr. Cooper that found the increase, and pointed it out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cooper and Jones persisted in a higher measurement, and Mr. Wallis in a lower measurement; don't you know that Mr. Wallis's measurement agreed with your's? - I believe it might, I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160174"/>I have heard Mr. Rogers say what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What you heard Mr. Rogers say what it was, is not what I am asking you; did it not agree with your measurement? - Yes, nearly thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones make any measurement of that? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is Mr. Cooper? - The supervisor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was it not this dispute about the measurement, that occasioned the dispute with Jones and Rogers? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the beginning of the dispute that morning; Mr Jones and Mr. Wallis were quarrelling about this measurement? - Mr. Wallis abused Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones did not quarrel at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some sort of quarrel between Mr. Jones and Mr. Wallis, about this gile of beer? - Mr. Wallis said that Jones was a perjured rascal, and after that Mr Wallis sent for the men in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he send for, he sent for Mr. Rogers, did not he? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send likewise for Claridge? - Claridge came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other? - I don't remember any other.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came then the dispute continued between Rogers and Jones? - Rogers began to abuse Mr. Jones, and said he was a perjured villain.</p>
               <p>Q. That quarrel between Jones and Rogers likewise respected the former gile of beer, which was in dispute? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you first recollect a little more particularly about this dispute; did not Mr. Jones attempt to push Mr. Rogers out of the brewhouse? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he neither attempt to push or pull Mr. Rogers out of the brewhouse? -He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so, Mr. Gregory? - I always said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say any otherwise to any body in your life? - I cannot say, I perhaps might.</p>
               <p>Q. Try your memory a little further? - I might.</p>
               <p>Q. What you are in the habit of giving different representations of a fact? - I was willing to say to any body that asked me about it, something short, something agreeable and pleasant; I was in a penlous situation then.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you give a different representation of that fact? - I give the truth here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you given a false account? - It may be some of the neighbours have asked me a question.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the persons to whom you have given a total different account? - I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are swearing for your bread I will ask you no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The measurement was a matter that had passed some days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cooper took the measurement after you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cooper reported that he had found an increase? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which made Mr. Wallis very angry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That matter is now depending in the Court of Exchequer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So then before Rogers had began to abuse this man, Mr. Wallis was abusing him, and called him perjured villain, and then he called Rogers, and Rogers began to call him a perjured villain likewise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const addressed the jury on the part of the desendant.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers had measured that gile of beer which was the subject of dispute? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Court. What was Rogers, one of your servants? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was your clerk, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Rogers came out of the counting house into the brewhouse, where you and Mr. Jones was, tell us what past between them? - I asked Mr. Rogers to look and see what he had got the gile of ale that was brewed the Friday before, to inform Mr. Jones what he had got.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the gile of ale the subject of dispute? - Yes, it was Mr. Rogers opened his book and told him that he had got twenty one barrels three sirkins, which was the whole of the gile; in consequence Mr. Rogers said, it was a rascally charge, Mr. Jones had made a charge of four gallons and a half more. There was some alteration between Mr. Rogers and Mr. Jones in conversation, and I believe there was such as, you lie, and you lie, on some former conversation or animosity that they had had before; and Mr. Jones said, you rascal, get out of the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones said that to Rogers? - Yes. In consequence they had another word or two; but I was so much agitated by the officers charge, that I did not hear particularly what past. Mr. Rogers pointed up, and said, you will remember the vats for that; relating to some former matter, and Mr. Jones shut his book and held his book in his left hand, and took hold of him with his right hand, took hold of his coat below the lappel, with the knuckle part of his hand towards his body, and pushed him to the brewhouse door, with his elbow; in consequence of his pushing him down to the door, he forced Mr. Rogers against the post that the door hung upon, and the door still was between his legs; Rogers said to him,(he had still hold of his coat) you rascal, or you villain, or something to that purpose, take your hand off me, or I will strike you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he, prior to that time, struck Mr. Jones? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his hands off him? -He struck him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his hands off in consequence of that threat? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What past next? - Mr. Rogers struck Mr. Jones first.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Rogers never struck Jones till he had previously pushed him to the door past, and he desired him to let him go? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he strike? - I believe it was two or three blows, for Gregory, who stood near, went and separated them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Rogers go then? - As soon as Rogers was loose he walked away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160176"/>Q. Till Gregory intersered to part them, had Mr. Jones even let go of Rogers? - I believe he had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you complained of this man having over charged you, and the magistrate dismissed the complaint I believe, in another instance besides this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There it went against you? - Yes, it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers was the witness for you on that occasion? - Yes, he surveved.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet Mr. Wallis was unfortunate there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So much for that. I take it for granted you were perfectly cool on this occasion, even before Rogers appeared? - I believe I told him it was a rascally charge, and he used me very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance, did not you use such language as this, you are a perjured villain? - I did not abuse him very much, but I was rather warm, I am not accustomed to abuse Mr. Jones in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, where was it that Mr. Jones began to push Rogers? - It was between the first and third square, he had his back towards the square; Mr. Rogers stood with his back towards a window.</p>
               <p>Q. At which window Jones was going to finish his account? - It is the most ill convenient in the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. So Mr. Rogers likes the most ill convenient place in the brewhouse. Another thing, Rogers did not abuse Jones at all? - There was not much difference in their abuse I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you observed very accurately all that passed? - I believe I did, I was on the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told us a little while ago, you was agitated, you did not hear what past between them? - I did not, I was so agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you describe particularly all that passed. You did not interfere to take Jones from Rogers, your servant? - It was momentary, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know how far he pushed him? - It may be about three yards, or two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. So he laid hold of him, and was pushing him along? - He was; he had only got him by one hand, and pushed him with his elbow; he laid hold of the off side of his coat with his left hand, and his elbow just met him at his stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it for granted, you thought Jones was extremely wrong on this occasion? - Yes, I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. You never thought Rogers was any way wrong in the business? - Yes, in striking him. It is what I did not give any countenance to.</p>
               <p>Q. So Jones was active in pushing this man about, and when Rogers struck him he struck him again? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He took all very quietly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps just sheltered his head? - No, I don't know that he did; he had hold of his collar at the time that he struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Rogers hold of Jones's collar? - Yes, under the lappel.</p>
               <p>Q. So he was laying hold of the coat just under the lappel, and he had the elbow of the same arm in the stomach? - Yes, I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Q. That was exactly the position in which they were? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Rogers striking him before he was taken off? - Not a minute hardly; he gave him two or three blows.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not give him a black eye? It was not a black eye the moment that Rogers was taken off him? - I did not see him. The next day I see he had a black eye. I had no opportunity of seeing him then. Jones walked out directly and left the premises.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you did not part with Jones on this occasion? - I did, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160177"/>I'disapproved of his conduct in striking him.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps you turned Rogers away the next day? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He is, however, in your service, is he not? - He is not, nor has been from that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately is it since he was a witness for you? - It was when we were at Guildford, about a week ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he is a witness for you in the Court of Exchequer? - I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a good many informations against you in the Exchequer? - There was one about six or seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there are informations against you to the amount of six or seven thousand pounds? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer to compromise if there was any? - I did offer to settle it for a certain sum if there was any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe you would offer to compromise any thing, rather than have a law suit in the Court of Exchequer? - I certainly would.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a cooper, I believe, to Mr. Wallis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being present, the 29th of June, at any dispute about the difference of measurement of beer at Mr. Wallis's brewhouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there before Rogers came in? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a difference in dispute, and Rogers compared his account with Mr. Jones's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me all that passed from the first of his coming in? - Mr. Wallis asked Mr. Rogers what he had got in his book? and he said, twenty-one barrels and three firkins.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the measure that had been before taken by the other officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did Mr. Jones make to that? - Mr. Jones did not make any answer. Mr. Wallis asked Mr. Jones where he had taken his account from, as he said there was no such quantity there; and he objected going, said, he had no business to go. He did not go, and then we sent for the tunman our of the yard, to correspond, for to ask him what he had got; and he said, no more than twenty-one barrels and three firkins. Then some conversation took place between Jones and the tunman; then Mr. Wallis sent by the tunman, for Mr. Rogers; and he brought up his book, and he said there were twenty-one barrels and three firkins, they all agreed; Mr. Rogers said, it is a rascally charge, there is no such thing on the premises; and Mr. Rogers said to Mr. Jones, you remember the vats, Jones. There was a summons to Guildford concerning the vats, what they held.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no mistaking it for any thing else; you understood it so? - I did. With that Mr. Jones took hold of Mr. Rogers's coat; Rogers stood at that time against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what did Jones do after that conversation? - He made up to Rogers, and took hold of his coat and shoved him out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Jones say any thing at the time? - Not any thing. While he had hold of his coat he said, you rascal, get out of the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time had Rogers struck or attempted to strike, or gone towards him in an attitude as if he meant to strike him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it the same instant as Mr. Wallis did? - I did. And Mr. Rogers made a reply, if you don't take your hand off, Mr. Jones, I will strike you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this said loud enough for every body to hear that was present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Gregory was present, then he must have heard it? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160178"/>Q. Did he repeat it once or more than once? - I think twice, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. And that before he did strike him at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having so said, did he take his hands off? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Rogers afterwards struck him? -He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to say whether during the time he struck him he still continued to hold him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he continued holding of him? - Just by lappel of his coat under his collar.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he struck him twice, that is a fact? - Yes, he did, twice or three times, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Gregory, we are told, intersered, and he parted them? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Till Gregory interfered he still had hold of Mr. Rogers? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers went away? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Jones went away? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you see Jones afterwards have a black eye? - Yes, the next day he had. I did not see him that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that you and your uncle, Mr. Wallis, are on very excellent terms with Mr. Jones? - I have no occasion to be against Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you quarrelling with him, almost every day? - No, I do not speak a word to him, no further than he comes in and says, good morning, and I says the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Your uncle was extremely cool to him on this occasion? - He did talk to him concerning that gile of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. He talked to him as mildly as you and I talk together? - Really I do not recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect one part of the story and not the other? You do not recollect whether your uncle was in a passion with Jones or not? - He might be. He asked him where he found that quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath? - I cannot say on my oath. He did not seem in a passion when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying he might be? - He might have been before that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what past when you was there? You know I know you. You have been before Mr. Bofauquet and other magistrates. Was not your uncle in a passion with Jones when you was there? - He was not when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say that he might have been in a passion? - I thought he might have been, concerning the beer, before that, but he was not at the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps your uncle was not in a passion, nor took any part in the transaction? - Yes, he might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind I speak at this very time. Was not your uncle very much agitated? - Yes, I dare say he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know he was? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell that? - No, I cannot tell that; I did not hear him say any thing to Jones.</p>


               <p>Q. How near were you to your uncle? - About two yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so far from them as you are from me. On your oath, did not he call him a perjured villain? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself. On your oath, did not he call him a perjured villain or a rascal? - Not to my knowledge he did not; I did not hear any such a word while I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Any word of abuse? - Not while I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as any thing that you have told us? - It is.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160179"/>Q. Now, pray, what was Jones doing when Rogers was standing with his back against the window? - He had been to tell the casks.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Jones to move up to where Rogers stood? - On account of Mr. Rogers speaking to him in that manner, telling him it was a rascally charge, and he might remember the vats.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never made any attempt to minute down any thing? - Yes, he did after the fray was over.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Jones stood after this affray was over to minute down his observations? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did Jones push Rogers? - Two or three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner? - He pushed him by his stomach against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Rogers strike him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He struck very gently, I suppose? - I do not suppose he struck very gently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike him violently or not? - I cannot really say.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it? - Yes, I see it. He did not appear to strike hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he struck him? - Yes, under his eve.</p>
               <p>Q. Not hard? - It was not very hard to my appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Jones carry the mark of it? - I see it the next day afterwards, and the day after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones came to your house every day for a long time afterwards? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the next day following? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rogers had been a very good servant? - He was for any thing that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been your uncle's surveying officer before he was dismissed? - He had surveyed for him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he was turned away the next day by your uncle? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remoustrate this with your uncle, that Jones was wrong in the beginning? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you think Jones was wrong in the beginning? - He might be in the wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. He might be in the right, might not he? So you really formed no opinion in it at all, whether he was right or wrong. Your mind perhaps was passive on the occasion. I take it for granted you are perfectly indifferent about this defence, whether Rogers is convicted or whether he is acquitted, you don't care a pin about it? Where is the difficulty in telling us whether you care about the event of the prosecution? - It is nothing concerning me; it does not make any difference to me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are quite indifferent about it? - It cannot make any difference to me. I would wish to say right on both sides.</p>
               <p>Q. You never, for instance, desired people to come forward to be a witness on this occasion? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care of that now. Have not you applied to people to be witnesses on this occasion? - No, I did not, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never applied to Harris to be a witness on this occasion? - Yes; Mr. Wallis desired me to step up to him, and desire him to step down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. This thing will not affect you, let it go which way it will? - No, it will not.</p>
               <p>Q. My friend seems to understand something about your uncle's conversation. You was not present at the conversation between Wallis and Jones? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing passed between Wallis and Jones while you stopped? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the minute was made after the fray? - Yes, I see him make it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160180"/>Q. You told my friend that you see him there the next day and day after, and every day in the course of his business? - To the best of my recollection he came every day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Jones say any thing about your master? - I heard my master say to Mr. Jones, why did you turn Mr. Rogers out of the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would you, or why did you? - Why did you. Mr. Jones turned about and said, and I will turn you out, sir, before I have done with you. He said that to my master. That was all I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had Rogers lived with your master? - About three months. I am not certain; some where thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. He was turned away the next morning? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You live with him still? - I live with Mr. Wallis now.</p>

               <p>Q. It was before you was summoned at Guildford? - I don't know about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you to put down the words? - They did not; but she bid me to keep them in my memory.</p>

Tell us what account he gave you of this transaction at Mr. Wallis's, on the latter end of June, or the beginning of July? - He told me that Mr. Rogers and Mr. Jones had a kind of dispute, in the brewhouse, about something or other, and that Mr. Jones used, Mr. Rogers very ill, by pushing him out of the brewhouse. Mr. Rogers was sent for about an overcharge of four barrels and a half of beer, that Mr. Jones had made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you this unasked, or was any body about with whom he might be alarmed or afraid? - It was voluntary. And many times he has told me that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160181"/>has not liked to be in that situation under Mr. Jones.</p>

               <p>Q. What morning was it you discovered any thing amiss to your house? - Tuesday morning, the 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. The night before, who was the last up in your house? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the 6th? - Yes; nearly on the stroke of twelve, as near as possible when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed in what state of security did you leave your house? - The street door bolted with two bolts, and the bar door was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bar door open within or without? - It opens within.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is within the house? - Yes, within the house; within the lobby.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bolt the street door yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And the bar door, how was that fastened? - That was bolted, a catch first and then a catch that pushes further.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your windows all left secure? - I will not say they were. I went round the coffee room, and they appeared as usual; but I will not take my oath that they were all fastened with the cheek bolts; they are slide up shutters. There are only two rooms on the floor, the bar and the coffee room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say whether the shutters of the coffee room windows were fastened or not? - I cannot; the shutters were up, but whether they were fastened or not, I cannot say; one shutter draws up half way, and then another draws up over that, up to the top; the pin was in the middle between the shutters, but whether the side bolts and catch was in I cannot say; I am sure the pin was in, because I had made a particular piece of work with my servant for losing the iron pin, and I made use of a wooden pin; the wood served the same as another pin provided the cheek bolts had been in. The sashes were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance in the course of the night? - Not till my servant came up to me about half after five, and told me the house was broke open,

            , he is here. I got up and found my bar broke open; there are two bars in the house; the tap room is below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean that bar was broke open that you spoke of as being locked? - Yes; that I locked with my own hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160182"/>Q. Describe how it appeared to be broke open. - There are two screws that screws the cap on, that goes on in one side of the door post, and the two screws were wrenched off, and the cap down. The street door stood half open on a sort of jar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that any violence had been done to that door? - None. That was opened inside apparently, and the other door that opens in the passage, after you enter through the street door, that was put back, and tied back by a knot in the string; I had left it put to over night, but not bolted. My windows were put down the same as I could see as I left them the over night, but I see the mark of a foot step from the area gate, which comes across the cellar flap on to a bearing iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that area gate locked? - It was locked, but it was apparently wrenched open, room enough to push it away. the cap of the area gate was pushed on one side, it was put to as when I left it, but the cap was pushed on one side; where they let down the beer there is a large cellar flap within the area; then the foot step was from that across about a foot, it was wet; then they went from that across to the other area again; I have two fronts, it is a corner house, there is an iron rester between the two areas, and they got on that to get into the coffee room window, there was the mark of dirt and wet on that rester; I observed there was a mark on the first window in the coffee room, apparently the mark of a shoe; inside I could see no mark of any foot, only on the sill. I found the windows and shutters apparently as I left them the over night, fastened with a skewer. Then I went below in the tap room; the bar of the tap room that my man keeps was in the same predicament as my bar was above stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The bar room door below, how did you find that? - I found it with the cap off and the two screws out, the same as my own bar up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other violence about the house? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss at that time? - A great many things; rum and brandy, and wine, and table linen, and tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, where was your rum and brandy that you missed, the over night? - Standing in my bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you miss? - I cannot particularly tell, because there was large cags of rum and brandy, as well as what we keep in bottles; there was some wine gone, and some peppermint.</p>
               <p>Q. You put none of these things in the indictment I observe? - I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any tea and sugar? - That was in a loaf, standing in the bar, and two pounds of moist with it; the tea was in three different cannisters, and in a paper besides I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as to the table cloths? - They were missing all out of the bar. The cotton was in the bar, eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the childrens frocks? - I do not particularly know that, there were some in making, and some for patterns that they were cutting out by.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about any shoes? - I don't know a great deal about them, they were in the bottom bar; my man I believe does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any silk stockings? - Yes, one pair; they were out of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Any handkerchiefs? - Yes, from the same place, out of the drawers in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs do you think? - I don't know the number. Two table spoons, all in the bar, and the beaufet in the bar; three tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. What weight might the loaf of sugar be? - I believe sixteen or seventeen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160183"/>pounds, I am not particular to the weight of it. There was above four pounds of tea in different caddies, and some from the grocers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the house belonging to any person supposed to be there? - No, I found nothing, no otherwise than they had got the rummers down and appeared to have been drinking wine; there was wine left in the rummers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left any light burning in the house? - None, but what I burn all night myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they taken any thing else? - The money out of the till, but nothing but halfpence and farthings; the lid was lifted up when I found it in the morning, the bolt was not shut in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see afterwards any part of your property that you could speak to? - I see them all again at the magistrates, the next morning; I see articles that I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the things did you see your spoons? - No, nor the new linen.</p>
               <p>Q. You see your stocking? - Yes; them I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What is your christian name? - William.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep this house entirely yourself? - I do, I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. You have some lodgers in your house? - I have four; I believe there were four then.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at six o'clock in the morning you received an account that the house had been broke open, by one of your lodgers? - No, at half after five, when my servant came up to me in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep in the house that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to bed first you or Mr. Hodson? - I; I went to bed about a quarter past twelve. I locked my apartment up; the tap room and the bar below.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the key? - Carried it to bed along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure any other part of the house? - No, only the lower part.</p>
               <p>Q. You fastened the windows of the lower part? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the state in which the windows of the coffee room were left before you went? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbance in the course of the night? - No, I did not hear any noise at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is any watchman to your house? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning? - Five o'clock; I was the first up in the house. I found the tap room door open, and I found the bar broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep below stairs or above? - Below stairs, on the ground floor, in a little parlour, facing the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the lower bar? -About three or four yards. I found the bar door broke open, and the staple broke off of the lock, and the tap room door open.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you left it at night? -Shut it to; there is no lock to it, only a latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your bar? - Yes; a new pair of shoes wrapped up in brown paper; they had taken the shoes and left the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had these shoes been left there? - Only one night, by a brother of mine, who made them for one Mr. Briggs; he was to call for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Briggs, where did he live? - In Somers Town.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160184"/>Q. Did you miss any thing else from that bar? - No. I went up stairs and found the bar door broke open just the same as mine was.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what was missing from that bar of your own knowledge? - Not any thing particular. I found all the drawers pulled out, and the cupboard door broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever afterwards see any thing that you knew to be the property of Mr. Hodson? - No, only I can swear to the shoes; I have not seen them yet.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all you missed from the lower bar. Were there any drawers in the lower bar? - No, nothing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say you did not know any thing of this till five o'clock in the morning, when you see the place broke open, this was the 7th of July? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was day light a considerable time before that? - Yes.</p>

            , and Hazle, and another man, and thinks I to myself, here are three men that broke open the house in Gower-street, a little time before. These two prisoners had two bundles, each of them a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were they coming? - Out of the Turnpike road, that leads from Paddington to Islington, into a brick field belonging to one Mr. Haycroft.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a road through the field? - No, there is not where they were going.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did they pass you? - Their clothes touched me. I said to them good morning to you, gentlemen, and the words they said to me were, good morning to you watchman; and the words they said to one another were, that watchman has got some suspicion of us, then says the other we had better go across the fields; I cannot say which of them it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to them when you heard them say so? - I was not four yards from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when they said that? - Just at the back side of Southampton place; they came into the fields to go to the south side of Southampton-place; then the other says, we will go our way into a turnpike road again, and then he will not have so much suspicion as he has got.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you had wished them a good morning? - Just afterwards. Then I made the best of my way to the front of my houses along side of the road; and then thinks I to myself, they were a parcel of bad fellows, and I went on a reservoir which the new river company are making there just at the back side of the King's Head, at the corner of Tottenham Court-road, and I see the prisoners looking about them, all three of them; then I see them go into Charles-street, near Tottenham Court-road; they were about four hundred yards from me when they went into Charles-street, and then I thought if there was another watchman in Charles-street, which I used to find there, I thought we might take all these three fellows there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160185"/>Q. Did you find any watchman in Charles-street? - No; I went and called one Croker up; I found him at home; he is one of the patrols belonging to Bow-street; I went to him, No. 4, Tottenham-court road; I called him up; and the words he said to me were, what is the matter, Underwood?</p>
               <p>Q. You told him your suspicions? - Yes; and he went with me; we went out of the New-road into Fitzroy-square, and the first watchman I met I asked if he had seen three men with two bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the three men again? - Yes, I see them again between Windmill-street and Percy-street, in Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the watchman that you enquired of in the square? - I cannot say; he is the watchman now in the square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from Fitzroy-square? - All the way down John-street into Windmill-street; then went out of Windmill-street into Tottenham court-road, down as far as Percy-street, and I turned myself round and see these two prisoners at the bar coming down Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Croker with you or not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man with them or not? - No, he was not. And the words I said to Croker were, here are a couple of them coming. I went up towards them to meet them, and as soon as Henry Hale see me coming within the reach of the bundle he said, d-n your eyes, take that; he threw the bundle at me, and away he ran; Croker picked up the two bundles; then I ran as far as Windmill-street after Hale, and I ran into John-street, and in John-street Hale pulled this frock out of his bosom and said, d-n you, then take that too; I picked it up, and I followed him as far as Colvil-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both run the same way up Tottenham-court-road? - Yes, till they came to Store-street and Windmill-street, then Hazle turned up Store street, and the other, Hale, up Windmill-street. I followed him as far as Colvil-court, and into John-street, till I was almost out of breath, and I see two watchmen that stood at the bottom, and I begged them to stop this Hale; I cried out stop thief! and they never offered to put their hands to him, and they let him go; then in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Hale was brought backup to me, at the Sun, by one Turner (he is here) the corner of Windmill-street; then after we had Hale to the watch-house, then we went to a place where we thought they came across the fields, into a field belonging to Squire Mortimer. I never see him go across the field, nor never see him in the fields but that was the strait road for him to come to Southampton-place.</p>
               <p>Q. From where? - You may come across from the Duke of Boulton's, and several other places. It is the way I thought they came. When we came there we went to see the ballast there, what they put on the turnpike-road, and I see it as if scattered about fresh; then I searched out, with a stick that I carry with me every night, and I searched out some tea and sugar, tied up in an handkerchief, and we searched about a little bit longer, and we found another bundle of linen, and table cloths, stockings, and a child's frock, in the next heap to it. Then after that I had intelligence that Hazle was taken down to St. Giles's watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Croker was with you at this time? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of Hazle at that time? - No, I see him pass up Store-street.</p>
               <p>Q. To what watch-house did you take Hale? - To Pancras watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160186"/>Q. What was it that led you to go search this field of Mortimer's? - I thought these men had come across that field, because as I heard two men at watch in Store street say that they see two or three men in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is this field to any place where you see the prisoners? - It is just along side, it is but just a road that parts the field from my row of houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason for knowing whether the prisoners had been in this field or not? - I had reason enough, because from the corner of my beat I had seen nobody in the road. I never see them in Mortimer's field.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Mortimer's fields to any place where you had seen them? - Not thirty yards from my place, Southampton place; they came out of the road into my field.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see them, were they coming as from that road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you ever see them to Mortimer's field? - It was about fifty yards from it, where they met me in the field. When I was up at the end of my place I could not hear or see any body in the road, and when I came out of my place again I see them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Mortimer's field is the front of Southampton place? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the things you found in Mortimer's field? - Croker has them. I picked up this frock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a watchman, sir, you seem at your ease here? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been here before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is your watch-house? - Pancras watch-house, is about a quarter of a mile from Southampton-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the next watchman belonging to the watch-house to which you belong? - In Charles-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you generally carry a rattl with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a rattle with you on this occasion? - I had; I never sprung my rattle till I got into Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the men were gone away you sprung your rattle? - No, he was not gone away; he was in my sight when I sprung the rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this field immediately adjoining that road? - No, near about forty yards from where the common sewer goes across.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not see them cross the field if they had come across that field? - No, I could not; it was a foggy morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance were they when you accosted them, and they accosted you? - They came along side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that these men, having these bundles with them, were so incautious as to say that you had a suspicion of them? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after that you also swear that they mentioned the road they were going saying we will go across the field into the turnpike road? - Yes, but they said something before that, that was part of what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is this reservoir where you went to reconnoitre? - At the back side of the King's Head, at Mr. Francis's cow yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did you see them? - In the turnpike road.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance when you got on this reservoir was it to the place where you saw the prisoners at the bar? - They were going into Charles-street, not ten yards from the reservoir, just across the turnpike road.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that before they were ten yards out of your sight, you thought it necessary for to get on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160187"/>place of this kind on purpose to see them, do you mean to swear that too? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that this was a very foggy morning, I think it would not assist you much to get on the top of a reservoir on a foggy morning? - You know it sometimes comes over, and then it casts away again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay on this reservoir? - About five or six, or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left this reservoir, you went from there to Mr. Croker? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going to Mr. Croker, you stopped to speak to somebody in the road? - No, I did not. till I came to Fitzroy-square, after I called Mr. Croker up.</p>
               <p>Q. If you could see them on the reservoir, they could see you on the reservoir? - They might if they had looked back, I don't doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently they must have known that you got there only for the purpose of watching their movements? - I don't know what their thoughts were.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned with Mr. Croker? what distance of time? - When I see them again it was about a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it from the time that you got off this reservoir, to the time that you see Croker? - About five minutes, I cannot say to a few minutes, it was not more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time that you see Croker, to the time that you returned to this place, and see Hale and Hazle? - Not a quarter of an hour after, I see Croker.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it you first see these men after you returned with Croker? - I went towards Percy street, and I see these two men coming down Tottenham Court road, towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it of course they must see you? - Yes, when I came pretty handy to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is Percy-street from this reservoir? - About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what reward there is on this occasion? - I never had nothing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess what reward there is on conviction of a burglary - What can I guess when I don't know any thing at all about a reward?</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath you don't know nothing about a reward? - I do not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since you was at Great Marlborough-street? - The 7th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the sitting magistrate on that day? - I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Conant the sitting magistrate? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon your oath before Mr. Conant, had you not a squable about the division of the reward, even before this man was committed for trial? - I never heard it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no squable with any other persons? - I had not; I was bound over with a forty pounds appearance, that is all I know about money.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the conductors of the patrole belonging to Bow-street</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - At Tottenham court, in Hampstead-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the 7th of July? - Yes, between three and four in the morning Underwood called me up, he told me he had seen three men together, of whom he had suspicion; I dare say it was not three minutes before I came out to him; I got up and dressed myself, and put my cutlass under my coat, and came out directly, I dare say I was not four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160188"/>minutes dressing myself; he told me that they had crossed the field across the Hampstead-road, and into Charles-street, I knew the direction of the place very well; we ran up the new road, towards Paddington, then crossed Fitzroy-square, into Russell-place, and down Charles street; I believe that Underwood ran into another street, but in our pursuit we had not overtaken these fellows, we ran very fast indeed, we had given it up almost, we had got as far as Percy-street in Tottenham Court-road, through different streets below Percy-street, towards St. Giles's, and we thought we had passed them, and we turned back, and Underwood turned round and said, master, here they are, he knew them, I had not seen them before that moment; he said, here are two of them coming, I see the two, and I told him to make on towards them, and I kept in a line; he walks pretty smart to them, as soon as he got pretty near them, they each of them ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough before they ran, to take notice of their persons? - In regard to their clothes I was, more particular with regard to Hale than I am of Hazle; they ran from Percy street towards Windmill-street and Store-street; just as they ran, being apprehensive who we was, I drew my cutlass; each of them dropped a bundle from under their arm, they dropped them between Percy-street and Windmill-street, and this bottle of spirits was dropped on the stones, and did not break.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who dropped it? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these things that were so dropped? - I picked them all up as quick as I could; and the public house was open at the corner of Windmill-street, the sign of the Sun; I got these things into the public house, and put them into a seat, and then pursued down Store-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bundles? - No, I had not time, it was momentary; I pursued then after that prisoner, Hazle, down Store-street; Underwood pursued Hale up Windmill-street; when I got down Store-street, some of the people told me that he was got off, and I returned towards the Sun.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him in Store-street? - I did not; I see him take that way; I was returning to the corner of Store-street, I looked up, and there I see Hale in the possession of a couple of watchmen, towards the Sun, in the road, coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those two watchmen here? - Yes. I then ran towards Hale, and the watchman that had got him in possession, and I came with them to the public house, the Sun, and there I searched them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have had them bundles in your possession ever since? - I have, except leaving them over the way while I have been waiting here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent from the Sun, before you returned to them again? - About three or four minutes. The watchmen then took Hale to the watch-house, then Underwood expressed, to me something of suspicion, that seeing them coming across the fields where his beat was, where were some gravel pits; in consequence of which I went with him to this field; they call it Squire Mortimer's fields, it adjoins Upper Gower-street; he shewed me the pit, I see then some of the Gravel which had been turned over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you made the observation yourself, or he and you together? - Both together; there in turning over the place we found two table cloths, and a napkin, and a little child's frock, and one pair of stockings, in another place, just by, in the gravel, this I pulled up, or he, I am not sure, we were both together; this bundle containing two handkerchiefs, a quantity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160189"/>of tea and some sugar, in consequence of which we took this out, and was going towards home, and we met a gentleman with two young women with him, coming towards my house to inform me that a house was broke open near that spot, and that another man was taken, and that he was in St. Giles's watch house, and Underwood and I went and see him in St. Giles's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Which prisoner did you see there? - Hazle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that Hazle was one of the two men that you pursued? - I am not so positive to him as I am to Hale, I believe him to be the man, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure that Hale is one of the men? - Yes, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Hazle was searched? - No, I was not; it was an hour and better before I was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say very fairly, Croker, you are not so positive to Hazle as to Hale? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might the prisoners be from you at the time you first see them? - Fifty or sixty, or a hundred yards it may be.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a tolerable clear morning? - No, it was a foggy morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that the last witness spoke to you about this reward? -He never in my life asked me such a question; I know there is a reward, but if any of them had asked me such a question I should immediately have stopped his tongue.</p>

            , from the two, and the other two, the two prisoners, came down to the corner where I stood, the corner of John-street and Windmill-street; I was standing at the corner of Windmill-street, in Tottenham-court-road; and with that Croker and the watchman they came up towards the place where I was, and at the same time as Croker came up they threw two bundles away; I was within eight or nine yards of them; them are the two at the bar; I am sure of both of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by each throwing a bundle? - As soon as we came up they threw the two bundles away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick them? - I did not, I pursued one of the prisoners, Hazle, and he puts his hand into his coat pocket, and took a bottle out, and threw it away, and smashed it against the pavement; I pursued him down Store-street, and in pursuing him down Store-street he puts his hand into his pocket again, and slung a black silk stocking, new vamped, on the ground, and I picked it up; I pursued him as far as Gower-street, Bedford-square, and he ran out of my reach, and then I turned back, and gave the stocking to Underwood; I see him running down as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160190"/>far as the long fields, I see him running down the new road leading to the Duke of Bolton's, I see him at a distance; he over run me, I could not run any longer.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see either of the prisoners? - This same morning; when I went back I see Hale with the four watchmen, coming up Windmill-street, I knew the man very well as soon as I see him; I never see him till I see him at the office, about eleven o'clock the same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure that Hazle is the man that you pursued? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You seem very positive about this man; you pursued him and lost sight of him, and after that you met the prisoner Hale in custody of the watchmen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they say to you when you came up first, here, this is the man that you are looking after, and then you said yes? - They never spoke a word to me, only I assisted them.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - A watchman in Gower-street, Bedford-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this morning, the 7th of July? - Yes, a little after four I heard a hue and cry of stop thief! come down Store-street, I had been just calling the hour of four, I was at the door, about No.22, Gower-street; several people came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body particularly? - None but the prisoner Hazle; I see him about five or six doors up Store-street, he was coming towards Gower-street, towards the fields, running very fast; I ordered him to stop; I was in Store-street then; instead of his stopping he presented a pistol to me, and kept going on, I made a blow, thinking to catch him across the shins, to bring him down, I struck him on the outside of the left leg, but that did not shorten his pace; he took to the fields, and I finding he got the heels of me I sprung my rattle, and kept going on, and the watchman came from Southampton-row, and he seeing the watchman coming towards him, he went over some pales towards the Museum, into a little garden there, and said, good by, I am gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go in? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you pursue him? - To the corner of the pales going down from Gower-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him get over? - Close to the back door of the Museum gate into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you when he spoke, good by, I am gone? - About the distance I am from your lordship. In a very little time afterwards I heard a servant woman call out, here is a man in our garden; I went round and was let in at No.3, and I went over the wall of No.3, into No. 2, and there he was in the garden, secured by a gentleman's servant, laying on the steps, on his back, almost fainting.</p>

               <p>Q. And that was the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, Hazle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the gentleman to whom this garden belonged? - I do not, no further than the number. I told him he must get up and come along with me, and I and another watchman brought him out; I asked him when I brought him out, where is the pistols that you had in your hand? pistols, says he, did you see any such thing in my hand? I told him yes, and would be on my oath of it; says he, you are a wicked man, you will swear any thing then. I conveyed him to the watch-house, I and another watchman, to St. Giles's, he was searched there by the watch-house-keeper, I was present; there was one black silk stocking found in his pocket, he said it was his own, and there should be a pair of them, and a silk handkerchief, but there was no handkerchief found in my presence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him get in? - I did not; the first that I see of him was, his trying to make his escape over the wall, but could not; I gave an alarm where he was, and from that he kneeled down in the garden, behind some everlasting sun flowers; I see him doing something in the mould, but could not tell what he was doing of; he came up the garden and stepped on the steps that led down to the back room, stepped up on to the wall of No.1, Gower-street, went over the wall in No.1, Gower-street, from there I see no more of him till he was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him on the wall of No.6 or 7, before you got up? - I had not seen him on the wall of No.7; he goes running down the side of the wall of No.6, and jumped into the garden of No. 5; he goes out into No. 4, into No. 3,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160192"/>and so on till he came to No.11, Bedford-square, which is the honourable Mr. Cavendish's garden; he could not escape that wall into the square, he made his return to come back again, he came down again from No.11 to No.1, Gower-street, on the top of the wall, from one garden to another; he comes from No.1 to No. 11 the same, in the out dwelling, which is Mr. Choir's; I takes hold of the prisoner, I asked him what business he had, and how he came there? he said that people had been using of him very ill, throwing sticks and stones at him, but intreated me in a very familiar manner to release him, and he said he would go off quietly about his business; I told him I should not release him, but I calls out watch, I knocks against the door, there was no knocker, but I kicks at the door with what violence I could, to make them let the watchman through there; it was near five minutes before any person came, at No.3 a servant got up, and they came over the wall of No.3 to me, but they took the prisoner through the passage of No.2; I delivered him up to the watchman, and held him by the slap of his coat through the passage, and went with him by the watchman, holding him by his coat; when he was taken to the watch-house he was then examined, I was present when this black silk stocking was taken out of his pocket, he said it was one of his, that there was another of them, but some how or other  he had lost it, there should be a pair; he felt in the pockets himself, and said that there should be another, he did not find another; there was nothing more found on him.</p>

            ? - Yes. I happened to meet Mr. Beetle about four months before this depradation was done, in the City-road, he told me that he knew me; I knew him, but would not make myself known to him; he said he was certain I knew him when he was an apprentice; he asked me where I lived? I told him I lived at <placeName id="t17950916-64-crimeloc370">No.40, Skinner-street</placeName>

He came to see me there; he see my little children coming from school, and he said, Mrs. Crowther, I shall bring my wife down to tea with me. He came several times, and he told me that his wife was very bad with a white swelling in her knee -</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us how you lost your watch? - Mr. Beetle came on the 8th of July, I think it was Wednesday, coming up stairs he said he had an acquaintance below; I said, undoubtedly ask your acquaintance up. I had nothing in the house to drink, and they seemed a little naturally in liquor; I fetched a pot of porter from the Weavers Arms, in Skinner-street, and when I came up with the pot of porter I see the stranger that was along with Mr. Beetle come out of the back room; I have two rooms where I have lived these ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him go into your room? - No; I was gone for the pot of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave these two men in your room while you went for the porter? - Yes; my eldest daughter was there. They staid and drank the beer; they went down stairs after drinking the beer, and went away. About half an hour after that I went to the back room, I went to go about my work, and I cast my eyes to a little mahogany case, and I missed the watch out of it. Mr. Beetle told me he would be back in twenty minutes, I waited patiently twenty minutes; finding Mr. Beetle did not come back, I was afraid that the rogue was played with me by his acquaintance. I was told where he lived, I went to his house, but I did not meet with any kind treatment there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the prisoner? - The next day, coming out of his own door, about half after nine, as near as I can guess. I thought that he rather walk ed fast, and I told my husband that was the person that I suspected; he asked me, I told him I did not suspect nobody but the acquaintance of Mr. Beetle; my husband said, if I did not suspect him he would not cry out stop thief; I said, I suspected the acquaintance that was with him, and I did not know where to find him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160195"/>Q. Did you stop the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, my husband stopped him; he abused my husband, which I compute to his liquor, for he was very much in liquor; he told my husband that I was a very bad woman, and he had lain with me.</p>
               <p>Q. But what did he say about the watch? - He did not say any thing. He was taken before the magistrate; Mr. Bare coming up said, shall I take him into custody? my husband said, yes; he took him in custody. He was taken before the magistrate, and he abused my husband before the magistrate, which exasperated my husband very much. The magistrate asked if he had been searched? Mr. Bare said, he had not; and there was a watch taken from him with no chain nor seals to it; I saw it in the clerk's hands, it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the name or No.? - No. The chain was an old metal chain; I don't remember that there was any key to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The justice was very loath to commit him without the number or name being known? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The stranger that you say came with the prisoner, you see come out of the back room? - Yes, the stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the stranger since? - I have taken two or three for him; I have heard that he is gone on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you swear to the watch if you was to see it? - No, I don't think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the next morning you was at the prisoner's house, and you found him at home, where he was most likely to be? - Yes, coming out of his own house.</p>

There was no other servant not no other person had a box in that room. I acquainted her, and agreed to discharge her; I insisted on searching her before she went away, Thursday the 19th, and, besides the pin cloth of ours, there was a piece of muslin and a piece of lace; I insisted on searching her also before she left my house, as well as her box, that I might see if she had a sixpence that was missed the over night; she was very loath to be searched; I went out for a constable, and just as He was coming up stairs, (she see him) she pulled several things out of her pocket, and among the rest were my silver knee buckles. The things were taken before the Lord Mayor; the buckles and pin cloth have been in my custody ever since. My name is on the pin cloth in full length; I know the buckles by the pattern, I have had them six or eight years, they are quite plain, and there are two or three scratches on them; I did not miss them at the time; the last time I used them I put them in the beauset and dining room, where I should have gone for them when I wanted them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found them did you find they were wanting? - Yes, they were wanting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. On the morning of the 19th you say, when you went to search the prisoner's box the box was open, and in the box you found one pin cloth? - I see my wife take it out of the box with a number of other things.</p>
               <p>Q. You have other servants in the house? - Yes, some young men.</p>
               <p>Q. And children? - Yes, I have eight children, but they were all at Islington. While she was with me she behaved exceedingly well, excepting finding these things on her, which I was very sorry to do.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer; I produce the property in the indictment, all the articles, they are all here. On Monday the 7th of this month, I was going up the Old bailey, and I perceived the woman prisoner with something in her apron and the man along side of her; I had a suspicion, I went up to the woman, and the man went a little way on; I asked the woman, good woman, says I, what have you got here? says she, I have got some linen; I asked her how she came by it? she said the man had given it to her to carry, and was to give her eighteen-pence. I immediately called the man to come back; he came back to me; I asked him whether he had; he denied it. I then took them both to the counter; he denied knowing any thing of the property, or that he ever hired her to carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they walking and talking together? - I thought there was some conversation, but I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he knew the woman? - No, he denied knowing her. The next day they were taken before Mr. Alderman Lushington; the woman gave just the same account she had done before. Mr. Alderman Lushington ordered them to be advertised; and on Friday Mrs. Parry came before the alderman to claim the property; and I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. If you please to remember when you took hold of Mr. Bacon, you said, where are you going to? I don't know what answer he made you, and then you turned round and said to me, what have you got there? and I said, it is that man's; and then he went on a little way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bacon. The articles I never see till the man called me back.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know the gowns it is property I am entrusted with; I am a <rs id="t17950916-66-viclabel381" type="occupation">laundress</rs>

               <p>Prisoner Smith. I was coming from Whitecross street, through Paul's-alley, and nearly at the top of the alley this man overtook me, and he had a bundle in this check apron, under his left arm; he asked me where I was going? he said he was going to Drury-lane; and I lived in Shire-lane; so under the gateway he asked me if I would carry this bundle? I said, I did not care; and he gave me the bundle into my apron, and he came down Aldersgate-street, and into the Old-bailey, and then that gentleman stopped him, and asked him where he was going? and with that he said to me, what have you got there? I said, I did not know; says he, whose is it? says I, this man's. With that he made off a little, and Mr. Jostling called him back, and took us both to the counter; and he said he would give me a shillings or eighteen-pence, it being fair time; and he being my own son-in-law, that has worked on his own account for some time, a taylor, I did not know but it was for his own work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bacon I am innocent of this affair, as false as there is a God in Heaven. I left my own house, where I live in Barbican, No. 52, going down Snow-hill I heard some man calling out after me, Bacon! I immediately stopped, and it was Mr. Jostling, and he said to me, Bacon, do you know what these things are that this woman has got tied up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160198"/>her lap so very close? and I said I did not know one article there, you may depend upon it they are not mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Jostling. What time was it you met these people? - Between four and five, or nearly five.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 26th of August, I was engaged behind the counter, where I usually attend in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner and another man came into our shop and enquired for some ribbons, of a young man who stood forward at the time, one of my servants; but from an idea given me by him, I served him myself; I took the ribbon drawer out for him to choose; he after some hesitation, desired to have two yards cut off from one piece, which I did, while I was doing that I see him take one piece of ribbon and put into his pocket; while I was doubling this ribbon up, he took another piece, which I did not see him take; I did not miss it, but I found in the event afterwards that there was another piece taken he went; out of the shop. He paid for that I folded up, and I took the money myself; he took it himself with him. After he was served with his ribbon and going out of the shop, I set myself on the counter, and as he was outside of the door I snatched at him; I led him back again down the shop, by the assistance of my young man, and when I got him at the bottom, he begged for mercy; he took out the two pieces of ribbon, which I have here with me, and threw them down. I went for a constable, which I gave him in charge of.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you got the two pieces of ribbon? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept them till now? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is one of them pieces one of which you see him take? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they both of the same colour? - No, they are not. I could not swear which of the two pieces I see him take.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you see the colour of the ribbon that you see him take? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that he did take a piece out at that time? - I am confident of that, though I cannot tell the colour of it; one of these is yellow, and the other is a striped.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a pretty large quantity of ribbons in this drawer? - Yes, a great many. I cannot miss one piece or two from a drawer of the size these were in; both of them are mine, because they have my private marks on them; I know the hand writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are there no other persons interested in this partnership but Mr.

            ? - There are not.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a large drawer full of ribbons? - It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160199"/>Q. These are not uncommon patterns? - One of them was made for us and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was more made than this one piece. Those that you sell in pieces, do you sell with your private mark on? - Most assuredly; it cannot be taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. And if you had seen them any where, after you had sold them, in other peoples possession, you would not have been enabled to swear to them by that private mark of your's? - Certainly not; but I think I can speak on my oath that one piece of ribbon was in the drawer the time I opened it, for I recollect the piece of ribbon very well being there before this person came in.</p>
               <p>Court. Which piece do you speak of? - I recollect that they were both in our drawer before this circumstance took place, and one piece is, I think, in two lengths, (It was unrolled and found to be but one length) Then that is my mistake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you mean to swear that that is the precise piece of ribbon? - I am speaking from circumstances; I have no other way that I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will go to the other ribbon. This is a very common pattern, may be seen in man haberdashers shops? - I don't know that it may at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing particular in the pattern? - Nothing. We never had to my knowledge, but one piece of this ribbon. That is a half piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you always in the shop? -Generally I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people fell in the shop as well as you? - Yes, perhaps five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to take on yourself to swear that the persons in your shop, without your knowledge, might not have sold the very identical pattern, or, at least, ribbons of the same pattern? - I believe we never had that pattern or colour before, to the best of my knowledge; and it is impossible to speak to it otherwise, from the multiplicity that we have in our shop.</p>

               <p>Q. There was another person with the prisoner in the shop? - There was; I lost sight of him when this man was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him since? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pretty near to the prisoner at the bar in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been of the opinion that it was the other person, and not the prisoner at the bar? - Never in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time the man took this ribbon out, had you observed sufficiently the drawer as to say they were in the drawer? - I see them just before, I did not at the time; I observed them in the course of the day; I am in the habit of shewing the drawer very often in the course of the day, and I see them both in the course of the day in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen this sort of yellow ribbon before? - I don't know that I have.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have it to my counsel almost, but I would wish my counsel to put one question to that gentleman, where that ribbon has been since it was taken.</p>

               <p>Philby. I put my initials on it when I took it from the constable, by his direction, because I was unacquainted with the usual mode.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a woman too? - Yes. I lost one sheet, one table cloth, and two tea spoons. She paid fifteen shillings and sixpence; she paid me five shillings earnest, and half a guinea when the week was due, when I sent my servant up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took these things? - Because when I went up I found my things were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been in town but seven weeks, and I have been five in prison; I was taken out of her house by Mr. Small.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in your house at your lodgings the time she was taken up? - Yes. She had been one week; the week was out the day that Mr. Small came.</p>

               <p>I was servant to Mrs Greville about three weeks. My mistress desired me to take these things to pawn, a sheet, a table cloth, and two tea spoons.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160201"/>Q. Who did you pawn them with? -At Mr. Freer's. She bid me pawn them in my own name; I believe the tea spoons were eighteen-pence a piece, and the sheet and table cloth for eleven shillings, or eleven shillings and sixpence, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life was she in? - I don't know.</p>

She said that when she took her money she would redeem them, which she expected every day, and she had some to take.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you live with before you lived with her? - I lived once in Hungerford-street, with Mr. Sheldon, carpenter and undertaker; Mr. Sheldon's was the only place I ever lived in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She says she came from a place; I had her from her father. Mrs. Robinson, her mother, has known me for some years; her father is a master taylor.</p>
               <p>Jury to Robinson. Where did the prisoner live before these three weeks? -With Mr. Small, Dean-street, Soho, No. 26, a very creditable house, a quiet house.</p>

               <p>Q. No gentleman with her? - No gentleman at all. She represented herself to be the wife of a captain Greville, and that she had been used to live genteel; and as a confirmation of what she said she had a recommendation to one Mr. Robinson, who gave her a very good character, and said, she would prove a very good lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Robinson? - A tailor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160202"/>Wild-court, Wild street, near Lincoln's Inn fields. They gave her a most excellent character as any person could possibly have; in consequence of this we let her the apartment, and Mrs. Greville took possession on the 29th of July: but she had not been there many days before we had reason to suppose that we had been very much imposed upon, with regard to the character of the lady, and of course we gave her warning to quit at the week's end; she said, it would be putting her to very great inconvenience to quit the apartment so abruptly, and wished to stay another week till the fortnight was up; I told her it was my wish to be perfectly genteel to her, and if it would put her to so much inconvenience, she should stay another week. Then the day before the second week was up she went away and did not return to the house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did she go from you? - Tuesday the 11th of September. We never received a farthing of her money. We could not take possession of the room; the drawers were all locked; she represented herself as out of town, the servant was there, but she came back on Monday the 17th, and slept in our house. She went out again the next morning, and we see no more of her till she was taken. What put us in possession of these facts was, after she slept in the house on Monday, the servant came in and asked my servant if her mistress was returned; she said, no. The servant went up to turn down the bed against her mistress came, and went out again immediately, and did not return any more. The next morning I went up and found one sheet off the bed; in consequence of this we had the closets and drawers opened, and found the things missing, a silver pepper castor. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things all let to her in lodgings? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were there when she went into the lodgings? - Yes, I see them there.</p>


               <p>Q. When was she taken up? - The Friday following as Mrs. De Rosia sent to enquire her character at our house, and we found she was not far off, and we went and apprehended her. She had the two lodgings at the same time, mine at eight and twenty shillings a week, and Mrs. De Rosia's at a guinea and a half, and was robbing both at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. That you don't know of your own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the lodgings of Mrs. Small.</p>

               <p>I am a publican, keep the White Lion, St. Giles's. At half past nine in the evening, on the 22d of July, the prisoner at the bar came and called o a pint of beer at our house; during the time he was drinking of it, some other people came into the box; when he went out some of them informed me that he had got some pots about him, they thought they heard them rattle. I followed him out, and desired him to come back, and told him that he had some pots about him; he said he had, his wife scoured pots; I insisted on his coming back. He came back with me, and I found these pots on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine; I believe he took one pint out of the tap room.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was this? - Saturday, the 25th of July, and I understand that she went to my box, and took the watch; I was at home working all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your miss your watch? - Between three and four o'clock, out of a little box that stood on the table, in the lower room first floor.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did your wife return? - About half after three, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe there are a great number of these girls liable to be taken up, as disorderly in your house? - No, there is but one woman in my house, a man and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. This girl had lodged in your house about nine months? - Yes, she lodged up stairs, and came down to attend my wife while she was bad, I thought it was the wife of the man that she lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is in Salt Peter Bank? - Yes, it is at the top of it. The last time I had seen the watch was about ten o'clock in the day, I had not seen it since that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a silver watch? - A silver watch; I put it in the box myself, and told her not to shake the box, for fear of breaking the glass; I gave her the box to put down, it was not locked, it went down with a spring, I shut it to and gave it her, then I went out along with my sister, about a little business.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return? - Between three and four; as soon as ever I came in I asked where she was? and they told me she was gone out; and I took the box off the table and looked into the box, and see the watch was gone, I went to put my apron in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found the watch since? - No. I never have; I went to a pawnbroker's where it was offered, he is not here.</p>

             put on her hat and cloak and went out, and I see the watch in her hand; she came there Saturday about five o'clock, she went out and never returned till eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Round give her the watch? - No, her back was towards me; I cannot tell what they said together, because they went on the stairs, and whispered to each other; when she came home she said she could not sell the watch; then she went out a little after that, and she came back again and said how that she got two shillings for it; she gave Round a shilling, I see her.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it? - Silver, a one case watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160205"/>Jury. How did you know it was a one case watch? - I see them pull the inside out of the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You examined it then very accurately? - I see them when they laid on the bed, open it.</p>

               <p>Q. I hope you had not eyes behind you; I thought you told us that your back was towards them? - My back was towards them, and then I turned my face to hang up some stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were the works of the watch? - I believe they were yellow, a kind of brass, like another watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Mrs. Round bere? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Never any quarrel between you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now stop a little, take care of yourself; never any quarrel between you? - No, there was no quarrel between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she never struck you? - Yes, she struck me once.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that happen without a quarrel? - We had one or two words, and then she struck me; I do not call that a quarrel, such a few words as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that she had struck you a blow, and that you would never forgive her, and would do for her? - On upon my life I never did say such a yord. I never said them words if I was to be struck a corps this moment, I said she struck me in the time of my sickness, and God Almighty forgive her, for I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long was it before you told these people of it? - It was two or three days after this was done, when I went to Mrs. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever use these expressions to Mrs. Brown? - Yes, I did mention it once to Mrs. Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had you to tell Mrs. Brown? - I was saving what a sad thing to strike me in the time of illness; it was hard to strike me at the time that I could not help myself, and she was stronger than I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you see this pretty watch? - About a month before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I never knew him previous to my going with the search warrant. On Monday, the 17th of August past, I was taking up in the nursery some plants to take into the country, there was a shower of rain, which occasioned me to go with our foreman into the house called the great stove; as soon as we went into the stove we sat ourselves on the curb, and the foreman in looking round missed a plant from a pot, he looked along the shelf and missed other exotic plants; he then looked into the bark pits. he missed another plant out of the bark pit, I see a vacancy, the earth was turned out of the pot, and put under a sheet of paper, upon the tea the pot that was so emptied was partly hid by some other large pots, standing on the curb, We then left that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160206"/>house and went to a house called the geranion house, and there we missed other exotic plants, having been pulled up by the roots, and the root of one plant left in the pot, broken off, one of those plants so missed, was one that we has bought of Mr. Colvill, a nursery man in Chelsea; I was told that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these plants growing in pots? - All growing in pots. On missing these plants I spoke to my father about the business, and he advised me to got a search warrant; I got a search warrant on Friday the 21st; we went to Bow-street, and Mr. Bond sent a man with our foreman to the premises of this Fairfield; Mr. Colvill had been there previous.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your foremen's name? -

            . One of our young men was in the stove at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to make the search? - To the house of the prisoner, Fairfield, at Chelsea, I found him there, on the officer of the public office knocking at the door, and asking if Mr. Fairfield was at home, the officer went in, and I followed him, and I asked Charles Fairfield, the prisoner at the bar, if he had any plants of mine, he answered no; we told him we had a search warrant against him, and wished to look over his premises; we went into his garden situated at the back of this house at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a gardener by business? - I believe not, he is an artist I believe; I think to the best of my knowledge some of the plants were found in his little stove that he had got there, and I am certain as to the garden, I think part were in his little out house, and part in his garden; when we found all we could see belonged to us; we put them in a basket and took them to the public office. The plants are in court.</p>


               <p>Q. When you took them did the prisoner say any thing respecting them? - He said he had bought them, he said further more from the manner in which we treated him, if he was not found guilty, we should suffer for his character; I think he said he bought one plant of Mr. Turrin; it was a geranion I think; I don't know that he pointed out which plant; we took him with the plants in the coach, and he was examined at the public office, and committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. Pray in what description of place were these plants of your's? - in a house, the major part of which is glass, called the hot house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not situated in your nursery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore to Court. Then I humbly submit that this could only be a trespass at common law.</p>
               <p>Court. At common law it certainly was only a trespass to steal things growing in the ground, but these plants were not growing on the freehold ground, but in pots.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. The nursery in which this house stands is tolerably open, a public place, and a gentleman has liberty to walk in the nursery to look at such plants as he wants for his own use? Have not persons of every description access to this place? do you stop any body from coming in? supposing I was to come tomorrow, would you turn me out? - Conceiving you to be a gentleman I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a path through it? - There is, but this part is all paled in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you come here to identify the plants? - I do not come here to identify them, but the young man that has come here will do it.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160207"/>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, perfectly well. On the 17th of August, about half past nine in the morning, I came from breakfast, and morning, I came from breakfast, and went into the stoves, where I particularly remarked two small plants in the long stove, in pots, the elica masonia and the mesembrianthimum.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very common plant? - No, it is a common genus, but a new species.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were they in a good state? - Yes. in perfect health, growing. From thence I returned back about my work, with Mr. Grimwood, and went to look out some plants to take into the packing shed, and from that I returned again after some more plants, and took them into the shed again, where I observed the prisoner at the bar in the packing shed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not observed him there before? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Grimwood there then? - No, he was not; I asked the prisoner how he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him before? - Yes; he told me he was pretty well, and asked me how old Mr. Grimwood did? I told him he was indifferent, but better than he had been for some days before; I then after I had set down the plants in the packing shed, returned with the young man that was with me, to go to Mr. Grimwood, junior, Mr. Wicks, the foreman, and a gentleman's gardener that was there, and as I was going with the hand barrow the prisoner followed me, when I turned to go up the walk, I observed the prisoner to go to the door of the stove house, open it and go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the same stoves where you had seen these two plants? - In the me range; I then proceeded to my ork.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of that? - I did not; in about half an hour after I had observed the prisoner going in, I and Mr. Wicks, the foreman, we were going to take up some more plants from the front of the stove of our beautifulls; there came a heavy shower of rain that hindered us from going there; we went into the houses where the plants were, on the curb of the bark beds; Mr. Wicks, the foreman, cast his eye on the shelf where these plants stood; the first plant I observed was a Botany Bay plant, called the banksieur gone, and the two plants I mentioned before; a turneria ulmiformia, and a Botany Bay jeslamine to be gone out of the pots also, standing on a shelf in the front of the stove; the elica masonia had a glass over the pot; I had took the glass up to look at it, and put the glass over it again; the mesembrianthimum was on the same shelf, but no glass over it. Then we went to the other house called the geranion house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it communicate with this? - No, it does not; we observed one plant gone which I called a geranion becanaton, which was purchased of Mr. Colvill about a month before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it of a particular kind? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your master give for it? - About three pounds, or three guineas, I don't know which; that was taken out of the pot together with some others which have no specific name that I know of; we returned again into the stove, where we had been before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing from thence? - Out of the bark bed a pot had been taken, the mould scattered on the bark, covered with a paper, and a pot thrown behind some other plants that stood there on the curb.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what plant had been contained in that pot? - No, I do not, but we missed another plant taken out of the pot, and the pot still remained in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160208"/>bark bed, a plant called neamanthis multistora.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any others? - I believe there was, but I do not recollect them by name.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had seen the prisoner in the garden, was it that you went into the stove and missed these things? - It might be about half, of three quarters of an hour, it was not more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner gone at the time that you made this discovery? - Yes. I believe he was, I did not see him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Shall you be able to identify the plants when they are produced? - Yes, I shall.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Wicks missed the plants, you discovered what you had observed? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had permission to come into your garden? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. I believe Mr. Grimwood is a nurseryman to a very considerable extent, to as large extent as any man? - I cannot say, he has got a very large assortment.</p>
               <p>Q. In this hot house I take it there are a very considerable number of plants? - There are some considerable number.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master, however large he deals, has not monopolized all the exotics in Europe? - Some, and some I have never seen any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pretend to tell me that in glancing your eye along this house, you can identify the plants? - I went to see whether this elica masonia wanted water or not, and I lifted up the glass to see whether it did or not, and this mesembrianthimum, I went to see whether that wanted any or not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are the foreman? - I am. On Monday, the 17th of August last, Mr. Grimwood and I, and William Bird, went into the great stove; I directly observed a plant pulled out of a pot, it was a Botany Bay plant, what we call a banksieur; I directly looked along, and I observed a little elica masonia gone, that was on the shelf, and I looked a little further and I observed a plant called the mesemorianthimum gone, and I turned round and looked into the bark bed, and I observed a sierra leona bulb pulled out of the pot called the neamanthis multiflora; then I observed a Botany Bay jessamine pulled out of the pot, in the same house; from that we went to a house called the geranion house, and from there I missed a geranion mecanaton, which was bought about a month before of Mr. Colvill of Chelsea; there were several other geranions taken, but they were of the bulbous kinds, they were dead down to the pots; one was a geranion penatum.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the others? - New kinds, without any name, any further than geranions, I do not particularly recollect any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it that you went and missed these things? - Near about twelve o'clock, between eleven and twelve, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner that day? - Not that day. The evening before that I had observed the plants, I see nothing disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe in consequence of this you applied for a search warrant? - I did, on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the prisoner at the bar lived? - I did not, I think it was about two days after that I gained that information.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday did you go with the search warrant? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Colvill go with you? - No, Mr. Grimwood and an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160209"/>Q. Had Mr. Colvill been there before you went there with a search warrant? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in tell us what you found? - The prisoner at the bar was then at work, I think he was painting; Mr. Grimwood asked him if he had not plants of his? he said no; we then told him we must go up into his garden, and take him along with us; we went into his green house, and there I found twelve plants, the same that we had lost the Monday before, and on the premises I found four other plants, two in the garden and two in the green house, that we had lost before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here to be produced? - Five of them are. The prisoner said he had bought them; he could not say where he had bought them, nor what he had given for them; he said this at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody have they been ever since? - I have had them under my own care.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. With respect to some of these plants you have mentioned, they are very common plants? - This sort of bankfieur is not a very common plant, there are more sorts of bankfieur than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you had gone to Mr. Fairfield's house without the ceremony of a search warrant, from what happened when you did go, did not you find that you might have seen all these things without insulting this gentleman, and taking him up; was there any thing like concealment? - They were put into the house, except two, and the elica masonia had a glass over it in the house.</p>
               <p>JAMES COLVILL sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are a nurseryman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Messrs. Grimwoods? - Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold him any plant of the name of geranion mecanaton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About how long before you was made acquainted with this business? -About a month; they bought two, and gave me six guineas for two, a red one and a white one.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any application of theirs, did you go to Mr. Fairfield's house? - Yes, on Monday, the same Monday as the plant was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Mr. Grimwood's property there; I speak only of the geranion that you sold to him? - Yes, I see that on the prisoner's premises, the red one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that so particular a plant in its nature, that you was able to distinguish it so as to swear to it? - Perfectly; I received the information on Monday; on Thursday I went down to Fairfield's house with a little bill.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the prisoners premises did you see this plant? - At the further end of the hot house; I knew it, it was not actually in the same state as it was when I sold, because the leaves were getting yellow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. You say this geranion was in the same state, only it was materially altered; a considerable alteration takes place in a month in a plant, I take it? - In some plants</p>
               <p>Q. And there has been in fact an alteration in this plant? - The leaves were decaying.</p>
               <p>Q. So this is the only geranion of that kind in Europe? - No, I have got several.</p>
               <p>Q. And this you say was considerably altered? - There were only two leaves on it, it is not a fast growing plant, it is of a har I texture.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this gentleman's house with a little bill; now I ask you whether you did not go for the purpose of gaining information for Mr. Grimwood,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160210"/>and the little bill was a mere pretence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Fairfield is your customer? -He was about two years ago, or rather better; if I was in Mr. Grimwood's shoes I should be very glad for him to have done the same for me</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Fairfield has at different times bought plants of you? - He has, to a very small account,</p>
               <p>Q. Did he manifest any unwillingness to shew you his plants? - He did not, I wish he had; when I went on Monday to Mr. Grimwood's, Mr. Grimwood the elder said, will you go and get a warrant along with my foreman, then on a second thought he said no, I will stay a little longer, very likely the prisoner will be shifting them; it was concluded he would let it alone for two or three days; I took the bill down that day, Mr. Fairfield was not at home; on Thursday Mr. Fairfield was at home, and he took me down his garden, very fond of shewing me his collection, to my great surprise I see all the plants that the foreman described to me, that they had lost on Monday, much more to my surprise I see the plants which they told me they had lost in the spring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In short you went with this pretence of a bill, in the way that would create the least alarm or suspicion? - I did in some sort. but it was determined that a search warrant should be out.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this geranion had two leaves, had it more when you sold it? - No, it had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only variation it had undergone was, that these leaves were becoming a little yellow? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that plant of two years growth? - No, it was a cutting from one of my others, it was an established plant, or else Mr. Grimwood would not have bought it; it was a cutting from another the autumn preceeding, a cutting from one of my own, under my own eye all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made other cuttings from your own geranion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold those? - Yes, several.</p>
               <p>Jury. As a gardener, if you take a plant out of the pot and move it, is it not likely to fall by moving of it? - No, it is not likely to fall, it is not a succulent plant.(The plants produced)</p>
               <p>Q. To Wicks. Is that the same geranion mecanaton that you bought of Mr. Colvill? - I am sure it is, it had leaves on it when I found it, but by being pulled up the leaves are falling off; they are gone; the day I lost it the leaves were in pretty good health; when I see it at Fairfield's the leaves were yellow, from its being pulled up out of the pot, the breaking the roots; when I potted it again I observed the roots had been broke, it was taken away in his pot, but badly potted, and I have re-potted it since; I am sure it is the plant; it is alive now.</p>
               <p>The elica masonia has been re-potted, this species is a very scarce plant, we cannot buy one under five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that that is your master's? - I am sure it is; we had another.</p>
               <p>Q. But are they commonly to be found? - They are not, it is very scarce by the price of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should suppose it very improbable for such a tender plant to be pulled up by the roots, and to keep alive after? - That is dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you find any other of the kind on Fairfield's premises? - No other of the kind. At first fight I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. The mesembrianthimum are you able to swear to that? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160211"/>Q. What is the value of that to those that are curious? - Half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that to be found in other gardens? - I never see it but in one. I am positive it is the plant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other of the kind in Mr. Fairfield's premises? - I did not observe any. I also transplanted that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. I understand that these plants not only understand a change, but you also reported them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to this geranion, may not a man who has interest with his Majesty's gardener, at Kew, have plenty of them? - I cannot say.(The three plants deposed to also by Bird.)</p>
               <p>Q. To Bird. Can you swear positively to them? - I can; I never see two plants alike in my life, exactly similar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now studying botany? - Yes. I have been with Mr. Grimwood a twelve month, and it has always been my delight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. From your knowledge of botany you tell us that you never see two plants like; there are other gentlemen here who will till you a different story. Are you sure that your knowledge of plants is such that you cannot be deceived in a plant? - I am not deceived.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there not been persons discharged from Mr. Grimwood's service for stealing of plants? - There was one discharged under the apprehension of stealing trees out of the nursery.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a gentleman should be here that should say that you told him last night, that there were two plants of a kind stolen, what will you say to him? - I will say that he speaks falsely.(Mr. Colvill deposes to the geranion mecanaton, as the one he sold to Mr. Grimwood.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore to Mr. Colvill. There are two ways of speaking to your knowledge of a plant. I want to know whether you can speak with complete certainty to the identity of a plant? - That plant is booked against the firm for three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. But looking at that plant, supposing it to be potted and repotted, and by the change that would be produced at the expiration of a month, should you be able then to speak to the indentity of it? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you identify that from one of the other cuttings which you had made and disposed of? - We can tell the face of a plant, especially of that scarce sort, as well as we can tell the face of a man. This here was more singular than the rest, and it had not altered any in the time that Mr. Grimwood had it, and therefore when I see it first I knew it again immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have counsel who will conduct my defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore to Mr. Grimwood, junior. Did you know that the things that were taken at the prisoner's garden must be produced at the trial against the prisoner? - Not till I was informed by Mr. Bond, and when the examination was over Mr. Bond told us particularly to take them into our own care, for the better preservation of the plants, and that I was to produce them at Hick's Hall, as well as here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hope to make out your case of felony with producing the things stolen? - I knew nothing of that matter at all. The plants were very illy shifted when found, as such we shifted them to a greater advantage of the plants, as we were in hopes of saving them; and had we not had permission of the magistrate, we should not have done so; I had my doubts whether we had a right to bring them away in Mr. Fairfield's pots; Mr. Bond told me we had. We turned them out of his pots, the earth not being proper for the plants to grow in, nor the mode<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160212"/>of planting, for the better preservation of them, we shifted them according to our knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they would be the better for the purpose of shewing them to the jury in this case? - That was not the case. It was for the preservation of the plants, in hopes that they would live.</p>

               <p>I am a nurseryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider yourself to have a competent skill in Botany? - By no means; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you made it your study? - I have travelled upwards of fifty thousand miles in search of plants.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear this student of botany give his evidence just now? Do you think that he could have that certainty that he pretends? - There is no man on earth can say that, for there is a likeness of every plant on the face of the earth, of the same species and genera.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, when you have been positive to a plant, had occasion to alter your judgment? - I have. Indeed I would as soon swear to a turnip as to one of these plants. If my child was here present, and his life was at stake I would not give my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have any back wardness to proclaim it if you had that knowledge? - No. I have discovered above three hundred new species, and fifty new genera myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I don't know whether you have been busied in the cultivation of plants or no - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to distinguish that you cannot distinguish one cutting from another? - It is impossible for you to distinguish an heath cutting from another of the same kind, not after they are gone out of your sight.</p>
               <p>Q. That is exactly the thing which I want to know, whether when you have the two cuttings in your hand, one is not perceptible from the other? - There is so little difference that if I was to turn about I could not tell which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You know cuttings have no flowers on them in their first cuttings? - Yes, I beg your pardon; for we never collect specimens without flowers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you cannot distinguish one cutting from another of the same plant? - It is impossible. Good God! only ask yourself. I remember last spring I was so foolish and hardy enough to swear to a plant, when I had a caution given me by Lord Coventry, which I shall never forget.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it is only since last spring that you have taken up the opinion that you cannot swear to a plant? - No, it never was my opinion, but Lord Coventry confirmed my opinion against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that cuttings of the same plant are all alike? - There is no other difference than a large cutting or a small one.</p>
               <p>Jury. Does the face differ, supposing they are cuttings of the same plant, will the leaf alter and grow different from the other? - Yes, they will some times, when they are put under the glass one plant will grow quicker than another, and that will alter the habit of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In a rare plant should you not take so much notice of that plant as to know it again? - By no means. There are plants such as these are that I could not swear to after I had sold them one day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Moore. You have frequently sold plants to Mr. Fairfield? - I have; I sold him the plant neamanthis multiflora.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you ever sell him the geranion mecanaton, or elica masoma or mesembrianthimum? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you made botany your study? - A little; I am not what they call a proficient, nor do not pretend to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Fairfield ever buy any plants of you? - Yes, he has frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing these two plants to have been in his possession a considerable time, and exchanged from one pot to another, do you think you should know them again? - Not at all; there might be a plant I might know.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you depose to that knowledge, on oath, at the distance of a month? - No, because it grows out of your knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I would ask you supposing, for instance, you had any remarkable plant in your possession, and was to part with it for three or four days, do you think you should be able to swear to it again at that distance of time? - No, I would not swear to it. There might be a plant that I might know, but I would not go to swear to that plant, because it might alter during the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not deal in rare plants. Have you any at four or five guineas? - No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. You sell plants? - Yes, in the common line.</p>
               <p>Q. In regard to those that you sell, should you like to depose, on your oath, concerning those that you sell, after they have been out of your possession and potted and repotted? - Potting and repotting makes a material difference, that throws the plant into a decline.</p>
               <p>Q. Into such a decline that you would not swear to it? - Not after it has been out of my sight for a time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You deal in common sort of plants, but even there with respect to them that are not potted and repotted. and have left you but three or four days, perhaps you can swear to them? - It make a material difference whether they are taken out of the small pot and put into a large pot, because then the change of the roots has not that effect; if it was a small plant and has got small roots it might have that change that I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this, whether you could not identify a plant after it had been out of your hands three or four days? - If it was an old plant, and was taken out of a small pot and put into a large one, I don't think that it would have that effect on a plant but a person might know it. I am of opinion that a person may be deceived if a plant moves young.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you are at all conversant in these expensive sort of plants? - I am not; I know nothing at all about them.</p>

               <p>I am an artist.</p>
               <p>Q. You paint flowers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have made the appearance of flowers your particular study? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, even with regard to plants that you have been employed to paint and trace accurately, whether at the distance of a month or week, you could swear to that plant again? - It is not possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been conversant in rearing or raising of flowers? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. If any man says that you can distinguish any plant at the distance of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160214"/>week, you do not believe him? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your art calls on you to be exceeding attentive to the subject you are delineating? - Yes, for twenty-two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding that, supposing you have been drawing a curious plant, and had been shewn that plant at the distance of a week, should you know it again? - I should know it to be the same kind, but not the same plant. I have found a difference between night and morning; I have drawn a plant by candle light, and the next morning I have been obliged to take a fresh drawing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think if you was told to take notice of the plant for the purpose of recollecting it at the distance of a week, that you should know it? - I should not. I may say it was the same sort, but not the same plant. It is not possible for any man living to swear to it.</p>

On the 31st of August, between the hours of seven and eight in the evening, I perceived a pane of glass broke in my window, and I see a boy's hand taking something out; it was whole just before: I immediately ran out, and the prisoner was going away from the window; I ran after him and took him the corner of Thames-street, and brought him back into a back room that I had at the back of my shop; in this room there was a fire place; he stood with his back to the fire place; I examined him and found nothing on him. I perceived that he put his hands behind him while I was searching him; I looked behind him, and on the side of the Bath stove that was there, there was the buckle that I perceived him take out of my window. This is the fellow to the same that I lost, that remained in the window; the fellow I missed out of the window.</p>

             with me up stairs to a room where the prisoner lay; I asked which was his box?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any box? - I did. I undrawed the nails. It was my box that the prisoner made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. In searching the box what did you find? - A great coat and ten empty bladders in the pockets, and one bladder half full, makin, eleven bladders in the whole; a square case bottle, empty; a funnel, and a rope. I nailed the box up again, and sent the boy to Mr. Singleton, the person who recommended the prisoner to me; as soon as he came I asked for the prisoner at the bar; the servant told me he did not come in all night. I went away before he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house has two street doors? - It has; one opens into St. Mary-hill, and the other in Little Tower-street. I locks all the doors but that in St. Maryhill; I did it that morning; and I shewed Mr. Single on the condition of the box. I then told the servants if he came in in any time, for the maid to go to the country house, and the two servants to watch the door, at my neighbour's, which I had asked my neighbour's leave.</p>
               <p>Q. This was Sunday. What time did you return on Sunday? - Between seven and eight in the evening; Mr. Singleton met me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of your servants did you find at home? - Touse, the prisoner at the bar; nobody else. I looked up for the two servants watching, and they came down and came over along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the key of the street door in Tower-street? - I locked that up.</p>
               <p>Q. On your coming in, did any thing pass between you and the prisoner? - I told him that I wanted him, and told him I must go to business, I wanted him up stairs. He came up stairs along with me, and I asked him for the key of that trunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160217"/>Q. Was that the same trunk in which you had made the discovery the morning before? - It was. He hesitated, but opened it; I told him I knew the contents of it before; he began to rummage his box with his hands; I told him to stand off, I would examine it again. I lifted up one great coat, which I found very heavy with a bladder in each pocket, full of rum; I lifted up the other, and that was the same; there was a case bottle that was full; there was nothing in this box, of clothes, but the great coats, neither morning nor evening; I asked him what he had done with the empty bladders which I had found in the morning, in the pockets? he told me he burnt them; I told him that answer would not do for me; I desired my servant, Wootton, to go for a constable; he downed on his knees and begged I would forgive him that time; I told him it would not do. I asked him what he was going to do with the rum? he said it was for his own use; I told him it was a very large quantity. The constable came, and I gave charge of him, and I see him myself in the Compter. When I returned home, I desired the men to search after the other bladders. In that bed room where the servants lay, the dressing place, two were found full of rum; we found them all in the night, the eight other bladders we found round the house; I was in the house, but I did not see them pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of rum was there altogether? - Upwards of twenty gallons, twenty-three or twenty-four gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the state of this rum, was it likely to be met with in the market? - Not at all; it was Jamaica rum just put into a large vat the over night, and which was not fine by Sunday morning; it was unfit for sale for a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you gauge to see what was lost out of the vat? - I did not. I ordered a sample to be taken from the vat and a sample from the bladders, and I tried them with the hydrometer. There were upwards of two thousand gallons put into the vat the over night; the rum was exactly the same quality, the same degree of strength, and the same foulness.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this vat kept? - In the cooperage; and no one could get at it but by going in at the trap door over the vat; there was no other way of getting at the rum in the vat.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that you found a rope and funnel in his box; by the assistance of that rope could any vessel be let down to reach the vat? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. You have never been able to state exactly the quantity that was lost? - No, we could not tell what we put in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. I believe you are a considerable dealer in this article you describe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was in a situation of the utmost confidence? - He was a clerk in my house for nine months; he was what they call a posting clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. In that situation, among other cares, he had that of notes and bills to a considerable amount? - Very seldom, sometimes he might.</p>
               <p>Q. You, of course, kept your valuables in a safe? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen that in any acts of confidence the prisoner had the key occasionally? - Never, only of the outer door; never had the key of the iron chest, only where the books lay.</p>
               <p>Q. On these occasions, when you have trusted bills and notes, and other valuable effects of that description to his care, have you had any reason to suspect his fidelity? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he had the good fortune<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160218"/>to be well recommended to you? - By a gentleman that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, another question. In your wholesale line of business, does it not happen sometimes to clerks, and to different servants in that situation, to deal privately and by retail among their friends? - I don't know. I don't allow it, and I have been thirty years in trade. I never heard of one in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not learned it from your brethren in trade, as a common practice, that such servants do so? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly aware that in such an article as rum, there is a very large trade carried on by sinugglers? - I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that smugglers deal in rum? - I don't know that they do.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you ever did keep your rum either in bladders or in case bottles? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Without asking you as to smugglers, are there not subordinate traders in your way who do keep their liquors in bladders and case bottles? - I never heard of it in my life; it is not a proper thing to keep it in.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the box on Saturday, you had waved the little ceremony of a peace officer, and in the presence of the prisoner? - I took my little boy with me. It is not his box, it is mine; but he kept the keys without any liberty of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday, by your description, you set a pretty assiduous watch over him, and left no one person in the house but himself? - I ordered them all away.</p>
               <p>Q. One other little plan was that of ringing very frequently at the door, to know what part of the house he was in? - I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a usual thing to leave your house with only one servant? - Never before without two, one clerk and one maid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn from your servant that any person rung in the course of the day? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have gone out, in point of fact, in the course of the day? - Yes; but he could not lock the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday night, when you described to him that you must now go about business, he readily gave you the key, and was about to examine the box himself? -He did not readily give the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Although you was assiduous enough to form this extensive scheme of his apprehension, it did not happen for you to gauge the vat to see whether any was lost or not? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, how much migl you find in the box of your's? - Four bladders full, and the case bottle full.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the other bladders? - I did not find them; the servants found them; two were in the room where he lay, in a dressing table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person sleep in that room? - Yes, two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they had been equally disposed, the rum might have belonged to them? - I don't know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you? - Three lay in the house, and three out of the house; I have about eight servants in all.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the proof of the Jamaica rum, there may be much about town in the same state and strength? - I mean to say this of that rum that was in this vat, there was none besides this in that state.</p>
               <p>Q. If another dealer in rum should put Jamaica rum, on Saturday night, into his vat, it would be as foul on Sunday morning? - It might be as foul, but not the same degree of strength. It is not imported from the West Indies in the state I put it in, it is lowered.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether other merchants lower their liquors to exactly the same tone,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160219"/>you cannot tell; but may it not happen to be that others may lower it the same as you yourself? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Will not putting rum in bladders and keeping it there, make it of a souler description than if it was kept in another place? - I know nothing of keeping it in bladders.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened to you to learn of those that you set to watch, that the prisoner, when he came in on Sunday morning, came in with a bundle under his arm? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner fell on his knees did not he implore that you would not accuse him wrongfully, nor risk his character? - He begged for mercy, and hoped as it was the first time, that I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had turned out that you found him selling smuggled rum, would you not have turned him away? - I certainly should.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you left him in the house alone? - I did, for that purpose, to see what he would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have gone out and shut the door either with the key or the latch? - There was no latch on the door, only two bolts and a chain.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was impossible for him to go out without leaving the door open? - It was, which I told the other people, if he went out to take care of the door.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was a fellow servant with the prisoner? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night tell us what past? - I went up with Mr. Jones and examined the box that Touse's things were in; we found in it eleven bladders, one of them might have about two quarts in it, somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the other ten? - Empty, most of them in his two coat pockets, which were in the box; there was a square case bottle, two sample vials which had some liquor in them, there was a funnel and a cord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Touse the next morning, Sunday morning? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come home? - Near about eleven or twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay at home that day? - I did not. I believe we all went out and left Touse by himself. Mr. Jones gave me charge to go over to the opposite house in St. Mary-hill, and watch, to see who went out and went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Wootton a fellow servant of your's? - Yes. I believe he went home; he came to me about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch? - I did. There were three people came to the door, one was the milk girl, and another was a person with a pair of shoes, which Touse took in, and the other was a person that came to enquire for one of our maid servants.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master came home, what time was it? - Between eight and nine o'clock. Wootten, and me, and Mr. Singleton, and Mr. 
               <persName id="t17950916-76-person845">
                  Jones

             all went in together; we all went up stairs, into the room where the prisoner was; he was cooking a beef steak; Mr. Jones told him he must proceed to business, and he must come into the other room; that was the room where we sleep, and where the box was found.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sleep in that room? - Yes, and Wootten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into that room? - I did, and all of us. Mr. Jones asked the prisoner for the key; which, I believe, he produced, and the box was opened; we found two great coats in it, and a bladder in each pocket of his great coats; four bladders; Mr Jones, I believe, took hold of the coats first; they were full, and the case bottles full. The prisoner came down on his knees and hoped Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160220"/>Jones would forgive him; and said, it was only for his own private use. Mr. Jones told Wootten to go for a constable, and Mr. Jones told him to follow him down stairs, which was before the constable came; we went into a small room, when the constable came I went for the coach, and they went away; I stopped behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say how he had come by the rum? - No, he did not. Mr. Jones asked him what he had done with the remainder? He said, he had burnt them, as he was in fear something would be found out; that was when we were in the room up stairs. We found six or seven bladders more that evening; we found two in the same room where the box was, and four more about the premises, in a house that was in the yard; they were covered up with shavings; they all contained rum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Were you one of those that let the prisoner in on Sunday morning? - I was. He brought a bundle, under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You was one of those that was set to watch the whole of the Sunday? - Not the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you relieved that day? How many watchman might have been on this poor fellow that day? What was your hour of duty? What time did you finish? - I came there about half after one, and staid there till Mr. Jones came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you see these three persons. Did they wait a long time at the door? - They waited about five minutes or thereabouts, as the kitchen was up three pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it ever happened to leave this man, or any other person in the sole possession of the house before? - I think it has.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you one of those that told the prisoner that you was to go out that day yourself, and you would thank him, if he would be so good as to take care of the house? - I did not, it was my turn to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we have got the eight bladders to six, I believe; two about the room and four about the premises? - Yes, and another we found two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants does your master keep about the premises? - Four in the house, and two clerks out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them servants the bladders belonged to you can have no idea? - I don't know whom the bladders belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that servants to distillers and liquor merchants deal privately among their friends? - I don't know of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you recollect of having heard of such a thing? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home you did not find the prisoner concealing the rum, but cooking a beef steak? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. This person was in the situation of posting clerk? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Rather a valuable and respectable situation in the house, I believe? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You never heard of Mr. Erwig's brother, your fellow servant, wanting that place? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hardwicke is one of your fellow servants? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hardwicke assisted the search? - He did not till after we found the last four bladders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say that he thought he could tell where it was? - No; he thought it was somewhere or other concealed.</p>
               <p>Q. But has Mr. Erwig a brother? - I have heard him say that he has two brothers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard him express a wish that he could possibly introduce him into Mr. Jones's service? - I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160221"/>Q. Suppose that rum should be put into a bladder, would it be as fine in that small quantity as it is in a large vessel in a body? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's must be a mislerious business then. If it had happened that any of you, in a respectable and wholesale house like this, had been detected by your master dealing privately for yourselves, he would have thought it a great offence against him? - I suppose so.</p>

               <p>Q. And if he had found you dealing in smuggled rum, he would have been more so? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. You would naturally have intreated him to forgive you? - Very possibly.</p>

               <p>Q. You went up stairs with him to this room where the box was. When you came up there, tell us what past between your master and Touse? - Master asked him for the key of his box, on which he hesitated a little to give it him; Mr. Jones opened the box, and directly as he opens the box, Mr. Jones orders me to go for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was in the box? - I did afterwards. There were four bladders in his great coat pockets, two in each great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing? - No. I went out of the room.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you as a friend to the prisoner at the bar, had recommended him to Mr. Jones's service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mr. Jones on the Sunday evening, when this discovery was made? - I did. Mr. Jones said to him, we must go to business; and went to the bed room; he said to Touse, open that box. In that case Mr. Jones found four bladders, a case bottle vial, and, I believe, two or three vials full of rum. The prisoner seemed very much agitated, and he sell on his knees and asked pardon of Mr. Jones, hoping he would not hurt him; Mr. Jones finding his property, said, you shall go to the compter; he said, he hoped he would have mercy upon him. The constable came, and he was taken to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any of the bladders were found? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. I understand that Touse, on being asked, opened the box readily enough? - He might have seemed a little confused.</p>
               <p>Q. As any other smuggler would. You stated the sample vials; are there any servants allowed them by courtesy? - I never should think my servant had a right to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You, perhaps, are also in the wholesale line of business. How long did that young man live with you? - He never lived with me at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the wholesale line of business; be so good to state candidly to the court, whether amongst you liquor merchants, servants do not deal for small quantities among their friends? - Not knowingly to me. I should not employ a servant that I knew did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your belief that there is such a practice? - I cannot say the fact as to that; I don't know of any such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not heard conversation among your fellow trade that such things are? - I do not recollect that ever I did; and I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that smugglers do, in point of fact, deal in rum? - I never knew what smugglers do. I have heard tell of such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, you have heard the mode in which they convey it about town is either by bladders or case bottles? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160222"/>It is a business I know nothing at all about.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in business? - I have been in business a dozen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Will not rum put into bladders, appear fouler than that kept in casks? - No, I should think it would be the same brightness.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it was not in your hearing when this young man was offered to go for a soldier or sailor? - Yes, I heard the offer made before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. And he preferred meeting the jury of his country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent of that that is laid to my charge; and I shall leave it to my counsel to plead my cause. I bought the liquor for my own private use of a smuggler.(The rum produced by the prosecutor, and deposed to by the hydrometer, sight, and taste.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             in the house? - Yes; I had been out, and coming up stairs I see the prisoner coming out of the room and the things in her apron, and I stopped her, she was in the room, the one pair of stairs front room; I asked her what she wanted? she said she had got some linen from one Mrs. Peter's of Saffron hill, to wash, and when she saw that I knew the things, she turned them down singly on a chair, the blanket, quilt, and curtain; I took them in my own care, and have had them ever since: I can swear that the curtain is Mr. Grayson's, because the fellow to it is to the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a room you live in? - No, Mr. Grayson, I cannot speak to the sheet or blanket, no otherwise than taking them from her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of this curtain? - Five shillings, if I was to purchase it I should not begrudge that for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What would the sheet sell for? - Two shillings</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She demanded of me the price of five sheets in the New Prison, and she said if I would give her a guinea and a half she would let me go.</p>
               <p>Winstanley. The prosecutor lost five sheets the same day, but he did not charge her with it in my hearing; he went to see her in the time of her confinement, and told her that if she would own whether she had the five sheets or not, that he would favour her, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it true that you offered to take a guinea and a half? - It is not, nor did I accuse her with the theft.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she accused of taking up any particular things? - Yes, the cotton curtain, sheet and blanket; Mr. Winstanley told her before us, and she replied that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160224"/>she did not know how she came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at all how she got into the room, whether that room door was locked in the course of the day? - I cannot pretend to say, it is generally locked; the bottom hinge had been forced.</p>

               <p>I am a salesman in Monmouth-street, and an officer of the parish; Mr. Escot, a person that is here present, came over to me, and desired me to step over to Mr. Grayson's, so accordingly I went over, and found the lower hinge of the door forced open, and the lock was forced back by some instrument or other; I went into the room, and found these two women, witnesses here, with the prisoner; I asked what she had done? the first woman told me that she found her in the room with these three articles in her apron, a bed curtain, sheet, and blanket, which were then laying on a chair, and I told her to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner deny that they were in her apron? - She did not, I asked her why she came there? she kept crying, and did not say any thing particularly, but before the magistrate I asked her what business she had there? she said she was looking for a washerwoman that lived on Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They searched me and found nothing on me; when this woman took me in the room, I had a bundle of my own with me; the justice of peace asked them if they found any thing on me of instruments to open this door, and they said I had no instruments on me. I am a soldier's widow, my husband was killed at Point Peter; and I made a mistake in calling at the house, being quite a stranger to the town, I was on the stairs below, knocking at the door when this woman arrested me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Winstanley. What time was it you see the prisoner with the things? - About a quarter after four.(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This casement hook was found in the room, some of the women picked it up that came to my assistance, in the room.</p>
               <p>Winstanley. This was brought down the day after the robbery, by his char-woman.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his Christian name? -John. On Wednesday, the 29th of July, about half past nine, I went from the New square, Lincoln's-inn-fields, to Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury, home to sleep; on going up the steps I attempted to ring the bell for admission, I believe it was then ten minutes before ten; on going up the steps of the street door I was going to ring the bell, but on turning my head I see the door was on a jar; I then did not ring, but pushed the door open with my hand; at the foot of the stairs in the passage, I see the prisoner at the bar and another man, each with a knife case in their arms, on seeing them three I asked them what they wanted? there was a lamp in the passage, they were under that lamp; on asking them what they wanted the prisoner at the bar, who was nearest me, answered, it is only a mistake; I then said, what do you mean by a mistake, you have been robbing the house, they said they had not, both of them, the prisoner said again it is only a mistake; I asked them what business they had with the knife cases in their hands? they made me no answer; the prisoner attempted to pass me, being first; I stopped himm, and laid hold of him by the collar, and told him be should not go till he could give me a better account of himself; a struggle then ensued, and the prisoner attempting to escape made his escape down the steps of the door; I had still hold of him; his companion was a distance behind at the foot of the steps; finding he could not get from me, he threw down this knife case on the pavement; he then threw back his arms as if he would have struck me, but he did not; on his throwing down the knife case his companion passed, and ran away, on his running away I called out steop thief! and watch! several times; I still kept hold of the prisoner; on my calling out watch, a watchman and a number of people came to my assistance; I delivered charge of the prisoner to the watchman, and at my feet lay this knife case, which I took up and took it into the house, and I found it contained twelve knives and eleven forks, the knife case was broke to piece, I took and set it down, and knocked violently against the door, and two of our maid servants came up; on my first going in to the door I see no marks of violence whatever, the door was in its usual state, and the key hanging on the arm of the chain, where it ususally does; I went up stairs for a pistol, and I searched the rooms, and found nothing material; the same night I missed, besides the two knife cases, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160227"/>trunk; I don;t know what the trunk contained; I went to the watch-house and the prisoner was there, and there was produced to me a spoon which I believe to be the property of Mr. Fonblanque.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you identify any of the property? - The knife case I can; the knife case was on the side board in the front parlour, close to the passage, and the trunk was in the passage up the stairs; I see the knife case before I went out, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a judge of the value of these things? - Not particularly I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that is the knife case of Mr. Fonblanque? - I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had you lost sight of the person, whoever he was, before you got the watch-house? - About ten minutes; from the time that I delivered him to the watchman, and the time that I see him at the watch-house, might be about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave charge of the same person to a watchman? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you whether you did not pitch on a person that did not turn out to be the prisoner at the bar, when you got to the watch-house? - No, I did not, I am quite sure of it; the prisoner at the bar was among a number of others, and he was behind them, and I looked about till I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never pitch on another man first? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Are any of these servant girls of the house here? - They are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you suppose these men got in; can you give any account of it? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen it? -Some days before, in the closet of the parlour, the crest is exactly the same, a family crest, a helmet.</p>

            , the servant of this house, She brought me a candle of seal it, she see it. Then I put my letter into my pocket, and went out till between the hour of four and five in the afternoon, then I came to the Bunch of Grapes again; I asked if Mr. Holt would be so kind as to give the postman that letter at six o'clock, when he usually came by; in the mean time the bell man came; I said, Mr. Holt, be so kind as to step out and give the man that letter; and I stood by the side of him and see him give the man the letter; the prisoner is the bellman; he asked him if he would take this letter? he said he would; he asked him if it would go safe? he said he would enter it in the book when he came to Lombard-street, and it would go safe; Holt asked him what it would come to; he paid him eleven-pence for the postage; and he doubled it once double in his hand, and he carried it away in his hand, he did not put it into the bag with the rest, and in the course of the week I had no answer to the letter that I sent, and I sent another letter, and had another letter describing that that first letter was not received; when I found the letter had not come to hand, I went to the inland office to examine the books, and they ordered me to come the next day at eleven o'clock; that was the Monday week after the letter was sent; the person that took it in was not there then; I then the next day, the person examined the books, and there was no such thing entered in the books; I went back to Well-street, and at five o'clock I met the postman, and I asked him what I was to do to get my money; that Tuesday, the same day as I was at LOmbard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - At the Bunch of Grapes door, where I put in the letter; I asked him whether I was to lose it or no? he said he knew nothing about it, he put it into the office; I asked him if that was all the recompence I was to have for it, I said if that was all I would go and get a warrant, and then I went and got a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this bell-man in your life before? - Never before, he took the half guinea, he was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard his name mentioned? - Never to the best of my knowledge, not I did not know his name when I got the warrant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner told you that it would be entered in a book? - He said he would enter it in a book when he came to Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you know the regulation of the office, that if a man does neglect to enter it in the book, and any thing is lost, he is obliged to pay for it? - I don't know, I don't want to prosecute the man, not hurt him, and she justice ordered us to make it up; I only want my money.</p>
               <p>Q. He did offer you the half guinea by the justice's recommendation? - At that time he did.</p>
               <p>Q. And who was the justice? - Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe besides that you claimed some extra money for expenses?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160229"/>- Yes, I claimed my expences; I did not want to he any thing out of my pocket; it is very hard for me to lose my money.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be very glad to know what the extra expences were? - The loss of my time, two days going to Lombard-street, and the expences of the warrant, and serving of the warrant; a guinea was asked in all to pay every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you asked nine shillings and seven-pence besides the half guinea and the postage, and he knowing that nine shillings and seven-pence would save him from a prosecution at this bar, refused to pay it? - I suppose that is the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the civility when you took him up, to acquaint the post office, that a man, a servant of theirs was taken up, to ask them what they would do for their servant? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was the letter directed? - To Mary Anthill.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you receive your letter? - On Friday, a week after I sent to Mr. Thorn, to desire him to send me a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that letter that came to you? - No, I burnt it at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that letter from? - From Mr. Thorn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he acquaint you with? - That he sent me half a guinea before in a letter, that he sent it directly as he received my letter, by the return of post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say the half guinea was inclosed in the letter? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very odd you should burn that letter; did you shew it to the post office? - Yes, I shewed it at the post office twice, at Bath.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to receive this letter? - Because I had not sent any answer to the first letter that he sent.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are one of the inspectors of the letter carriers in the post office. Will you be so kind as to tell us what is the practice of the office, with respect to letters paid money with? - The general rule is, when a man takes a letter that money is paid with, to have it entered in the money book.</p>
               <p>Q. In the hurry of business, does it, or does it not, frequently happen that that is omitted? - It does; the post master's permanment order is, that those that neglect that duty, shall pay the loss, besides a suspension.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man been in the employ of this office? - Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, what has been his character and behaviour in the office, good or bad? - To the best of my opinion as honest a man as ever was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hands does a letter pass through between here and Bath? - I cannot say, a great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the service of the office when apprehended? Supposing him acquitted, would he be taken into the office again? - I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to his settling of his accounts at the post office, has that man been regular and punctual, or not? -Always regular and punctual.</p>
               <p>Court. Do they turn them out of their office if they refuse to pay the money? - There never has been such an instance, but I am very confident they would be dismissed if they were guilty of such a thing as that.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter was put into the post office on Friday, the 21st of August; do you remember whether at that time there was any robbery of the mail, or any loss of letters complained of? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it not being entered in the money book, might it not go to Bath? - Yes, but a letter may go to Salisbury or Bristol and we never hear of it again.</p>
               <p>Q. But in general do not they come back to the office when they go wrong? - Yes, but sometimes they do not.</p>
               <p>- SPARKES sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you employed by the post office? - Yes, a deputy inspector; the prisoner was letter carrier, I have known him about two years, he made his payments always regular.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in court when Mr. Ferguson was examined, he has spoken to the practice of this entering in the money book? - That is the practice.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it frequently happen that that practice is omitted? - We have frequently instances of it, from the hurry of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the letter to be lost, the party can be no gainer by it? - He is liable to make it good, or forefeit his place.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think the place of a letter carrier is worth to a man? - Fourteen or sixteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Court. When there is any money in it, it is entered in the money book? - Yes, and they pay as a double letter.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you can tell us that a letter in going from here to Bath, must pass through a vast number of hands, and may likewise be lost by accident? - It may.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, supposing for instance it had occurred to you not to have a letter put down in the money book, and you was obliged to pay the money, would you, or would you not, have thought it disagreeable to have paid more than the money? - I would have returned the money contained in the letter, and the postage; I never knew any thing further.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor nine shillings and seven-pence? - I would not.</p>

               <p>- CABAIN sworn.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the 22d of August, the prisoner informed me that he had omitted to put such a letter in the evening before, that he had received it, I believe, in Oxford-road; that he had received the postage of that letter, and was informed that it contained money, that in consequence of that he brought that letter to the Post office, with the other letters for which he had received postage, that he had paid for the postage of the letter in the proper office, but that in consequence of the celerity with which business was obliged to be done with us, he had neglected to have it entered in the usual money book.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had paid the postage of it, it must have found its way into the Post office at the same time? - It must. some days afterwards, I cannot tell the distance of time, about six or seven days, he again came to me, and told me that that letter had not found its situation to the place where it was directed, he was apprehensive it must be lost: I told him if that was the case, as he had neglected to have it entered in the proper book, he would be answerable for the amount that the letter contained. The man acquiesced in that demand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not these things frequently happen? - It is unpleasant to say that it does frequently happen.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hands do you think the letter must pass through between this and Bath? - At least five or six; I don't think it can pass through a great many more.</p>
               <p>Jury. It does not pass through any more hands after the bag is sealed up on the road to Bath? - It does not; but at Bath it goes through several hands.</p>

               <p>I am president of the inland office.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. On the 1st of September he came to me, very much agitated, and said, that he had been applied to by a gentleman of whom he had received a letter containing money, who had informed him that the letter had not got to hand. I asked him whether he had received charge with it at the time, and whether he had seen it entered at the time he delivered it in? He said he had forgot to do that; I told him as that was the case he must pay the man whatever it was; which he promised to do.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was continued in the Post office as letter carrier, notwithstanding this thing had transpired, and he was the person that let you know that the fact had really happened? - He has been in the office about two years; I never had the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he be taken into the service of the Post office again? - Yes, he would.</p>
               <p>Q. They, I understand, take up this defence? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. It is at their desire that you attend? - It is.</p>
               <p>Court. When there is a money letter, and when there is not, do not they separate the letters? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. And they always distinguish that to the person that takes them at the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of these money letters do you think may be brought by a bellman at a time? - A man may bring three or four in the evening, and he may not bring one in the course of a week.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, Wilcox, in your service at the time this matter took place? - He was a twelvemonth from the 16th of April last. On the 4th of July, in consequence of missing bread before, I counted my bread that was left in my kitchen, there were twenty-six, twelve, and seven quartern loaves; on that day, I being unwell, had requested Mr. Lashbrooke, a neighbour, to be at the top of the street, in case he should resist. About ten o'clock in the morning he had been down to Westminster, serving all there; he then came in and put two loaves in his pail, and out he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - I did not. He went out with the pail to fetch yeast; in consequence of which I looked into the kitchen and missed two loaves. I immediately followed him; I came up with him about the middle of the street, or hardly so high, it may be twenty or thirty yards from the door; when I came up to him, I took hold of him, and I believe I said, you scoundrel, where are you going with that? I perceived two loaves in the pail; I do not recollect that he made any reply whatever; but requested me to let him walk without being held. I told him he need not be ashamed of me if he was not of his action. Mr. Lashbrooke came up within three yards when I laid hold of him. I took him to the watch house; I immediately left him there to go home with my fresh bread, which was laying in a very awkward state. I first see him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160233"/>again over at the Bear, in Bow-street; he then confessed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any thing if he would confess? - NO.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any threats? - Neither to my knowledge. I asked him if he was not ashamed to serve me in the manner he had done? He intreated me for mercy; he begged I would forgive him, on account of his children; that was nearly the expression he made use of; I told him he had no thought of me and my children, or else he would not have done an act of the kind; I said, I suppose let you tell the story, you would say this is the first time; he said, no, I don't say it is the first, it is the second; I said, you know I have put my hand in my pocket and lent you money, and when you have offered to pay me half of it, I said, you had better leave it and pay me when you can. He then went over to Bow-street, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. You had a good character with this man? - I had, or else he should not have been taken into my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Has he a large family? - I never knew he had but two children; but that day he told me he had a third.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Hungerford-market. On the morning of this day I was about a hundred yards from Mr. Freame's door, about ten o'clock in the morning. I see the prisoner come out of Mr. Freame's house with a pail at his back; he walked some little distance from the house; I see Mr. Freame come out of the house after him, which was a signal to me to stop him; I then crossed over the way then and came within six or seven yards of him, and by that time Mr. Freame had come up with him; I stopped him, Mr. Freame was behind him and I was before him. There were two quarters loaves in the pail, when taken off his back at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - I did not hear. Mr. Freame said, he had heard of people carrying iniquity in their bosom, but thou carriest it at thy back.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What is the value of these two loaves? - Ten-pence halfpenny a quartern loaf, and nearly all the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel. My master entirely left the business to his daughter; he entirely looked after the bakehouse. I, that morning, had taken out a great deal of bread; I always went down into the kitchen for what bread I wanted; I was going to serve customers with this bread, they lay in my way that I was going for the yeast; it was a considerable wet morning, and I put these loaves in the pail, and my master came out after me. I always used to make it my practice to take the bread out of the kitchen, while there was any bread in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was he at liberty to go down into the kitchen and take what bread he pleased? - No, he brought it into the shop and put it on the counter when the shop was emptied, and it was counted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were you ever there to do it yourself? - I was there, or somebody that I entrusted.</p>
               <p>Miss. FREAME sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever act in your father's business? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it over the custom in his business for the bread to go out without being counted? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not happen, by accident, that bread may go out and account given of it afterwards? - Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160234"/>Mr. Knowlys. Is not the bread, when taken out by the journeymen, always taken from the shop? - Always.</p>

The prisoner at the bar was smoaking his pipe in the parlour at the same time; he had used that house for a month before that, and never was out of it. When I was going home I asked the taylor where was the coat; and he put his hand behind him and did not find it, and there was nobody missed out of the room but the prisoner at the bar; we could not hear of him any more that night not the next day. I staid about an hour afterwards, but the coat was missed from about five minutes after he went out of the room; he never returned to the house; I never see him till last Monday week when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. What day were you at the Brick-layers Arms? - Saturday, the 15th of August, about eight o'clock at night. He was taken up in St. Giles's. The people that were in the room knew that he stole the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the coat ever found? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any people here that live in that public house? - No. When he was apprehended I told him if he would give me the duplicate of the coat, I would let him go about his business; he told me that he had sold it for four shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he never said he had sold it till you told him it would be better for him to do so? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker, at Tottenham. About eight o'clock in the morning, or a trifle after, Tuesday week, the 15th of this month, I see Smith go by with a bundle under his arm, by my house; I live about six or seven doors from Mrs. Gillam, about seventy yards, not much more. I suspected that he had stole this bundle. As such Miller sent for me to take Tooke in charge, and he informed me that Mrs. Gillam was robbed; and as such I said, I see a man go by with a bundle under his arm, and I did not doubt but he was the person that stole the property; as such I sent a young man, named Wagstaff, after Smith immediately; and he took the man with the property under his arm, against the place which we call the George and Vulture, in Tottenham; as such he brought him back to me immediately, and I searched his pockets, and in his pockets I found five pair of stockings, and three pair of childrens shoes buttoned up in the flap of his breeches. I have got the property now in court.(Produced.)</p>

               <p>I am a gardener at Tottenham. The constable sent me after this man, Smith, to take him, and I took him at the George and Vulture, at Tottenham, and brought him back, and delivered him to the constable, with the goods under his arm, ten pair of shoes and two gown pieces.(Produced.)</p>

               <p>Tanslev. I have had them in my care ever since. I found eleven silk handkerchiefs in the yard between Gillam's house and Miller's.</p>
               <p>Q. To Miller. These are the same handkerchiefs you delivered to the constable? - They are.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Tooke. On Monday, the 14th of this month, I was on my journey from Hertfordshire to London; being late in the evening I got a list as far as Enfield highway; from there I walked to Edmonton, where the Statute was then holden; I went into a booth, where I staid till quite day light; proceeding on towards London I had occasion to retire up a passage, where I had not been above two minutes before a man came in and called out Mrs. Gillam! and the people went out, and I went out, and this man laid hold of me, and said, that I had been in the house. What I stand charged at the bar with I am entirely innocent of, neither do I know any thing at all of the parties that were there. I was coming up to London in hopes of getting a birth on board a man of war.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. As I was going on Lower Edmonton, to my friends, going along in the morning I see this bundle laying in the middle of the road, and picked it up; I did not know where it came from; about two or three minutes before that I met two men running up the road. I was bringing of it back, and there were two men came and catched hold of me, when I resigned directly, and they brought me back; I never said a word. I have had my friends waiting here several days, but they are not here now.</p>
               <p>Q. To Miller. Is Mrs. Gillam the owner of the house? - She is.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a married or a single man? - Single man. Another young fellow and a woman was with her. I took in a handkerchief with a bundle, and which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160237"/>contained two silk handkerchiefs, &amp;c. all tied up in a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there another silk handkerchief besides? - Yes, in the jacket pocket. I laid them down along side of me on the bed, the bed was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undress and go to bed? - No; I sat, with the things, along side of her. I sent for a pot of beer and staid there till about one o'clock, and the other parties, they went away; I still had the bundle along side of me for ten minutes after they were gone, and I had occasion to get up to do something for myself, and the prisoner went twice to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the room? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your back turned to her? - Yes. When I came forward to the bed I missed my bundle; I asked her for the bundle; and she said she knew nothing about it. With that she went to go out, and I detained her from going out; when she found that I would not let her go out she seemed rather reconciled, and laid down on the bed. I sat up along side of her till I was rather tired, and I happened to fall back myself and drop asleep; with that the first thing that awaked me was her hand in my pocket, and I had about eight or nine shillings in it altogether; on my stirring with that she drew her hand away from me, and pretended to be asleep; I laid there some time and dropped off again, and she went out, and I did not see any more of her till the morning, she left me in the room. In the morning she came in, and I asked her for my bundle; and she said she knew nothing about it. With that I sent for a constable, and a constable came; the the pawnbroker's, and there he found a waistcoat that she pawned.</p>

               <p>I live with Mrs. West, in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did you receive that waistcoat which the constable has? - Of the prisoner at the bar, the 3d of July, in the morning, before ten o'clock; I had seen her before; I supposed that she had a husband that belonged to her. The constable called in the morning and I was not in the way, and he took the waistcoat to the magistrate, and has had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. To the Constable. Did you examine this woman - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any duplicates? - Nothing of the kind.(The waistcoat deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the waistcoat to sleep with me all night. About twelve or one o'clock he came and knocked at my door; there are two or three people more in the lodging house; with that they told us we might go to bed, we should be very safe; and when we awaked in the morning we found the door wide open. It was a common lodging house.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. On the solemn oath you have taken, did you give her that waistcoat? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any money? - Only some money to get some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid with her all night? - I did, when I found I had lost my bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner standing? - Within the passage. I went up and stood at the yard door, with my child in my arms, the yard of the house, and Mr. Cokum came down stairs, and he gave Mr. Cokum this paper; I see him, and Mr. Cokum turned it over, seeing so many names, but he could not make any thing out of it.</p>

With that he went up stairs, and I stood at the yard door, and I heard the shop door shut, and I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160239"/>the foot coming down stairs, and I heard it stop.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the shop door? - It is the top of the house. I heard the foot stop, and I turned from the yard door to go up stairs, and I met him on the last flight of stairs; he had got something under his coat; I said, what have you got there? and he said nothing, but pushed by me, and I stopped him at the parlour and pulled the gown from under his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this gown kept? - It was laying on the cradle; I had it to cover my child in the cradle, in the dining room, in the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pass that dining room to come out of the shop? - Yes. I have kept it ever since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I came down stairs the gown was on the banisters; she said so before the justice? - No, it was in the cradle.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street. On the 25th of August, there was a call of stop thief; in the street; the prosecutor lives just by my house; I went to the street and took the prisoner into custody; the mob was about him at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman did not take me, a shoe-maker took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Kennedy. He was delivered up to you, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the house of the lady? - A hundred yards, not much further. I took him strait to the office, and I told her to follow me to Marlborough-street office; she was among the people.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she charge him with? - With taking a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the shew you a gown at that time? - No. In searching him I found these fourteen petticoats, and every one of them is to a different trade, signed all by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came to this gentlewoman's house, I was recommended by a German, with a letter; I went up stairs, coming down stairs they gave me an answer that I was to call again the next day. There was a gown on the banisters, and when I came down stairs I never touched the gown at all; I am as innocent as a child unborn; I came out and went out of doors, and the lady called out stop him! and a shoe-maker stopped me; the said Mr. Kennedy did not make his appearance at all, he was only the officer in Marlborough-street. When we did come there I was committed to New Prison, Clerkenwell; I was there from Tuesday till Saturday, and then I was discharged from the justice; the lady did not make her appearance, and then I was remanded back to New Prison for three weeks; then on Saturday they found a bill against me, which I am as innocent of as a child unborn. I was quite entirely discharged from the justice.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was this man examined once or twice? - He was only examined once before me; he was to be brought up the next day on account of a watch that he had on him; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160240"/>thought to find out to whom it belonged.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Kirby knows very well. I have a wife and three small children, and have lost one of my eyes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecturix. Was he brought back to the house? - Yes, the mob brought him back, and then as we were going from the house again Mr. Kennedy met him.</p>

I remained in the middle of the road frightened, the shortest thing that I thought was to go and advise with the landlord where I was drinking. Then I went about to all the houses, and there enquired after her, and could not find her. The publican asked me where I lived? I told him at Mr. Bush's; we went to Mr. Bush's, and the publican, and Mr. Bush and me went in pursuit of this girl; after they were in the road they desired me to go back and leave them together; that if in case the girl should perceive me, she might have some suspicion; and I returned to the public house; Mr. Bush and the publican went in search of this girl in different places till they found her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money? - It is impossible to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the young woman? - Yes. I felt her hand in my pocket. It contained six guineas in gold, and eighteen shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BARE sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Marquis of Cornwallis public house, the corner of Well-street. On Saturday night, between nine and ten, this man came into my house and called for a pot of beer; about ten o'clock he went away; this girl was going out with him; he paid me for a pot of beer out of his purse, and the girl stood close by with him; I see them go out together. A short time after the poor man came in all of a frustration; he could not speak any English, and I could not rightly understand what was the matter with him, till he shewed me that somebody had taken something out of his pocket; I could just make out a few words, that he lodged at Mr. Bush's; I went with him to Mr. Bush's, and I asked Mr. Bush to explain what it was that man meant.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160241"/>Q. What is the prisoner? - I believe she is a girl of the town; she had come in for a pot of ale, but by some means or other she got into acquaintance with this man; they went out in company together posit vely. Then Mr. Bush told me how he was robbed; I went immediately in pursuit along with Mr. Bush, and between eleven and twelve I apprehended the prisoner, the same night; I see her have all these new things in her possession, and a quantity of clothes, which I thought fit to take from her. I found a number of gold rings, which she said she had been purchasing that night. There were eighteen shillings found on her, and six shillings and sixpence that she said she had given to some girl that was along with her. Here is a new pair of shoes, stockings, garters, gown, cap, new shift, and petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she bought all these things? - She was so much in liquor that I could hardly make out what she said. The folks of the house said that she had lost half a guinea out of her hand just before, but which I could not find.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor when she left your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she purchased these things that night? - She had no rings on her fingers when she went out of my house, because she paid me for a pot of ale that night. Here are the gold bobs, the ears had been bored that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bare sent a woman to pull the ear rings out of my ears, and she made my ears bleed. Mr. Bush will be upon his oath that that man had but eighteen pence when he came out. I went in first into Mr. Bare's house, I went in for a pot of ale, for a boatswain of a ship that was at our house; with that this old gentleman was there; he had been there drinking all day, and he spoke to me, and I went out with him, and there were two girls at the door, and he stopped talking to them, About two hours after I was drinking in a public house, and Mr. Bare came and took me over to his house, and searched me all over, and took a locket off my neck, and put me in the watch-house, and on Monday he came and put me in Newgate, and this gentleman came and said that if I would make up the money that I had from him, he would free me of it; I said I had nothing of his; and he gave me some little trisle that he had in his pocket, and bid me good by.</p>

               <p>Q. You have the lease of it? - Yes. About five o'clock I met the prisoner with the lead, coming out of the premises, wrapped up in a flannel jacket, under his arm, I see him coming out, I waited till he came up to me, and asked him what he had got under his arm? he made answer, nothing belonging to you sir? On that I insisted on his turning his waistcoat aside, and I see it was lead, with that I said, you rascal, you have been robbing me of lead; with that I attempted to get it from under his arm, he tried to prevent it, but I got it from him, and I found it was the hopper head of a trunk; I got a carpenter's chissel to open it, is that which first of all receives the water from the gutter of the roof, to carry it to the pipe, it is like a square bason; I see it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160243"/>the morning, I suppose about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fixed there safe? - Yes, it was fixed to the wall by a couple of wall hooks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the lead was recently taken? - Yes, by the wall hooks, which were drawn out, they were thrown away, there was nothing to cut, he took it compleatly, because it is nothing to cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the place from whence it was taken? - I did, the same day, and the two holes corresponded exactly with the two holes where the hold fasts were.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt it is your's? - None, perfectly satisfied. When I took the prisoner, instead of acknowledging his fault, he upt with his fist and knocked me down, and I believe he would have murdered me had it been in his power; he did not compleatly knock me down, but he knocked me as far as your lordship, and then I went after him and tripped up his heels, and he got up again, and I knocked him down three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike you with his fist first? - Yes, he did, after I had got the lead from him he struck me a blow just on the side of my temple. He was a <rs id="t17950916-91-deflabel516" type="occupation">task master bricklayer</rs>

               <p>Mr. Jackson. Was this person in your employ? - I had engaged him to do some brick work for me; he had not done any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose employ may you be? - In my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What other descriptions of trades might be employed in repairing of this house? - Carpenters.</p>
               <p>Q. No plumbers? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many carpenters might be employed in the house? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bricklayers? - Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said that you was raising the roofs of these house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they have been your houses? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to describe the contract between Mr. Wright and you, respecting these houses? - I made an agreement to sell him the two houses when the attick story was carried up; there was a specific sum agreed upon when this atrick story was carried up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to pay the bricklayer? - Me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you happened to receive any earnest money of Mr. Wright? - Not a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your agreement in writing? - Not a word of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been always good friends with this man up to this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does there happen to be any account existing between him and you? - He had done a garden wall for me.</p>
               <p>Q. When this happened were you in his debt? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been impertinent enough to tell you that you owed him five pounds? - I never paid him five pounds in my life, the work that he did for me had not amounted but to thirty shillings in the whole, and I gave him a guinea and a half, and he left the work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever ask you for any further sum that you owed him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have described a pretty good pitched battle at this taking, you did not strike the first blow? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not d-n his eyes for a rascal and a thief? - I told him he was a scoundrel and a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. What progress had you made in taking off the roof? - The rafters were taken down, and the top most likely uncovered.</p>
               <p>Q. The lead had been all taken off of course? - That was taken away by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160244"/>plumbers two or three days before.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of clearing the lead from different houses, have you ever employed the prisoner for that purpose? - Yes, one particular time I did, but that was another house, about a twelve month ago, and I forgot the lead, and I asked him to bring it down from the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. I think by your own account you knocked him down three times; did you happen to continue in possession of his person; pray did you let him go home? - He went away after I took the lead from him; I went to get the patrols to take him up; I did detain him a considerable time, but afterwards I left him in the care of two carpenters while I went for the patrol, and he got away from them, and I found him at home, laying on the bed, and his wife denied him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say that you would make him repent of this? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor nothing of that kind? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he happen to say to you, I will go with you where you please? - No, not a single syllable of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say after you had struck him, you are a bad man, did not I tell you where I found it, and I was coming with it to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it ever happened to you to be in any embarrassment about lead? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never called upon by any legal process whatever, to answer for a mistake of your own in having taken lead? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know that the prisoner at the bar was ever subpoenaed against you, to give evidence against you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in point of fact something like a legal process has issued against you for mistaking property in lead? - No, it was my own property. When I built this house, the house came to fifteen hundred pounds, it was built according to contract; there was a man that I employed in the building gave wrong dimensions to the plumber; when the lead was brought there, and laid down in this roof, one Mr. Dixon said, this is not the exact lead that is in my agreement; I was under the necessity of taking that lead up and get fresh lead, but there was some that I put into the gutters and other parts, and there was a certain quantity left behind, and there was an action about the extras for two hundred and fifty pounds; Mr. Dixon said there was lead left in the house, and that I had not allowed for this lead that I had taken away from his house; it was an action that I brought against him.</p>
               <p>Q. In that case, whatever the description of it was, he was subpoenaed against you? - He was, but he never came forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Since then there has been some little interruption in your friendship? - Never, or else I would not have done all I could to recommend him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated that other persons were employed in the house besides this man, might they not have taken the lead from the part to which it was supposed to be detached, as well as himself? - They might have done so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the lead of the gutters been taken down? - Certainly, and locked up, this had no connection whatever with him.</p>
               <p>Q. And this hopper remained with two nails? - It has no other support, it has no support from the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did Mr. Wright come in and out pretty often? - He did, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who happens to have the key? - There was no key on the door, the workmen were at work at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the visits of Mr. Wright, he gave directions how he would have things go on? - He was to receive no orders but from me; I don't think at this time that Mr. Wright had been there at all. I pointed out the way in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160245"/>I meant to do it, and he was satisfied.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 1st of September I erected a scaffold at the front of these two houses; in the evening Mr. Wright's carpenter took the lead down from these buildings; on the 4th of September I went to the building to see for Mr. Jefferies, for some materials to mix up the lime, to get on with the brick work, and I did not see Mr. Jefferies there; I went down into the lower part of the house, and I found this property among the rubbish, and the carpenters were at work on the premises at the same time; it was either ten minutes before five, or after, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What time did you go to your house that night? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to the prisoner's house? - It might be in the course of two hours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. It was not ten o'clock? - No, I fancy he was in St. Martin's round-house by that time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 28th of May I was sent to Mr. Boldero's, in Cornhill, for a hundred and fifty pounds, which I got in thirteen bank notes, four fives, five tens, two fifteens, a thirty, and a twenty. I put them in my waistcoat pocket, and at the corner of <placeName id="t17950916-94-crimeloc537">Milk-street, Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did they go down Milk-street? - I don't think they did. He that came to ask me what I had lost, so much took my attention that I could hardly take notice; I told him I had lost a hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge this man with it? Are you sure he is one? - Yes, I do recollect him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was he taken? - I don't know exactly; I believe it was the 13th or 14th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - About one o'clock in the day. He was taken by picking another gentleman's pocket. I had information at Bow-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160248"/>and they knew the person by my information.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you see him? - The 14th of July, at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are You able to swear that this was the man that came under your right arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt on the subject? - Not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that made the first stoppage? - That I do not recollect; there came a good crowd; I pulled my coat down, and I had no sooner done that than a taller man than the prisoner struck me with his elbow, and one rather shorter than him came before, and this is the shortest that got under my right arm, I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen him at Bow-street, should you have known him again? - I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Were you at any other office besides Bow street? Were you at Hatton-garden? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar there? - No. I was sent for there to see another, but it was a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as certain to the person of the prisoner? - Yes, as being one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so at Bow-street? - I did, that he was one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt more than you have now? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great crowd in Cheapside, occasioned by the Lord Mayor going in procession to St. Paul's? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one of the persons came directly before you; the prisoner under your right arm; why he must be stooping at the time? - I don't think he stopped much.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he did not stop at all? - I don't think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you as good an opportunity of seeing the prisoner, that was stooping under your arm, as the man that was facing of you? - I turned to him instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. You put these notes that you have described, into your waistcoat pocket loose? - All wrapped up together.</p>
               <p>Q. You put them into your pocket in Cornhill? - No, in Mr. Boldero's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them again before you got to Milk-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel them before you got to Milk-street? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you felt yourself in a crowd, you buttoned your coat together; that was not till you got to Milk-street? - My coat was not buttoned, because it is rather too little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that those notes were in your pocket when you got to Milk-street? - Yes, I am positive of it, not only that, but I had my hand on them not six yards before.</p>
               <p>Q. Originally I took you to say this, that you see the prisoner at the bar, that he was under your right arm, and you believed him to be the man that picked your pocket; and then, when my lord put it to you, the young man's life being at stake, you say you are sure he was the man? - I was sure he was one of the three; I believe him to be the man that picked my pocket, but I did not feel his hand in my pocket; and therefore I did not so positively swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any of your notes since? - Three of them came to the bank. I know him by his size and way of walking.</p>
               <p>Q. His size is not very particular, nor his person neither. Perhaps you have heard of a reward for a highway robbery? - I did not know pick pocketing was a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that there is a reward of forty pounds if you convict this man on this charge? - I do not; I can safely swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160249"/>Q. Were you ever in a court of justice before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at Bow - street, had you ever been at Bow-street before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. The man that struck you, was that done for the purpose or an accident? - The man came full drive against me with his elbow; it alarmed me a little; I suspected what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive as to the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I am innocent of this charge; for about three weeks before I had an accident, and I was very bad, and never was in the street all that day.</p>

               <p>Q. What is his christian name? - James. I know the prisoner by using our house four or five months; and I recollect, on the night before that this procession, went to St Paul's, his coming very ill to our house, with a pain in his side.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the procession to St. Paul's? - The 28th of May, the Thursday in Witsun week. He came in the evening before about nine o'clock, and begged the favour of us to sleep there; and he had bought a bottle of some stuff to take; and I slept out of my bed to let him sleep with my husband; we had but one bed; and he was so ill, he had fell down a brewhouse cellar some time before and had hurt his side; I did not understand whether it was inward or outward. In the morning after, I wished to go and see the procession to St. Paul's; but my husband refused, and went himself, and the prisoner never went out of my house all the day; I made him broth in the course of the day. I staid at home with him the whole day, and he did not go out till five or six o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure it was of a Thursday? - Yes, I am positive it was of a Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What procession was there on Thursday? - The children going to St. Paul's, as I understood.</p>

               <p>Q. You was not intimate with this young man? - No more than using my house. I understood him to be a <rs id="t17950916-94-deflabel538" type="occupation">seafaring man</rs>

               <p>Q. He was able to walk? - He was, he walked to our house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there no lodgings in Clothfair to be got for him? - He did not try for a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. So you set up all night? - No, I slept with the servants that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What servants have you in the house? - Two, both young women,</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they think it odd for you to go and leave your husband's bed and sleep with the two maids? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband is not here? - No, he knows nothing of the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160250"/>Q. O, yes, he must! He must know he said with a man instead of laying with you; How came you to six on the day of the procession? - On account of my husband going out to see the procession.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no curiosity to ask him then? - I knew it to be the time of the childrens going, and therefore I did not think of asking any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he got into St. Paul's? - He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the other maid servant's name? - Mary.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live with you? - She might live with me longer or shorter; she was with me a very short time; it might be a month, or it might be less.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she come from? - That I don't know. My husband went to the office at Snow-hill for her. I do not recollect her sirname at present.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the names of the two that you have now? - I know the names of them I have now; one of them I have had about six weeks, her name is

               <p>Q. It is very odd that the maids should be exactly the same name. Were they not the servants that lived with you in the month of May? - Upon my outh they were not, I had no character with one of them, for she had lived with my husband's father.</p>
               <p>Q. When these other two servants went, where did they go to? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. So this sick man was to be with your husband? - Yes, he did on that night. It was my husband's wish, seeing the young man look so bad.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the house? - Till six o'clock the next evening, and then he went out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner pick a gentleman's pocket? - I did not. Mr. Ghrimes gave me an account of it, and I went and see the prisoner at the corner of Exchange-alley, leaning against the corner of the alley, with this very handkerchief that Mr. Ghrimes has sworn to, wrapped round his wrist.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a red handkerchief with white spots? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it ever since? - I have. I said I had got a charge against him; I desired him to come along with me. He made no resistance, but he came along with me to the compter; and I found two more handkerchiefs on him, two knives, and a pair of sciffars, and six and thirty shillings worth of stamps, which belonged to one Mr. Hart, the corner of Lombard-street; but he would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you came up to me, Mr. Rule, you asked me what I was about? I told you I was about nothing, I was very much surprised at your asking me that question; says you, you have been picking a gentleman's pocket of this handkerchief! I says, I am surprised at you, I have had it above three months in my own pocket; says you that is nothing to me, I have got a charge of you, and you must go along with me to the compter; and I immediately acquiesced and went with him.</p>
               <p>Ghrimes. I am positive to the handkerchief that I see him take from the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be glad to know whether this young gentleman ever had seen that handkerchief, or had it in his hand before now? - I did before the Lord Mayor, and as soon as it was taken away by the street keeper; I had it in my hand and I am positive it is the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a person, if it can he admitted, that can swear to that handkerchief, that I had it for upwards of three months in my own possession, and once in washing it she had it a fortnight in her possission.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the shop when the lad came in? - Yes. On Saturday the 5th of September, the prisoner came into the shop and wanted a pair of shoes; I shewed them to him; while I turned my back to get some more, the prisoner took a pair and put them under his coat; my mother see him. I see my father take them from under the boy's coat. There is his own hand writing on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know your father's hand writing? - Yes. These are our shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into this gentleman's shop, on Saturday afternoon, and asked for a pair of shoes; there was nobody in the shop; I stamoed with my foot, and that young man came, and he asked me what I wanted? I told him a pair of shoes, and he gave me a pair to try on, and in bringing me another pair of shoes to try on, the slap of my coat got over the first pair. His mother came out of the parlour, (she knew me for a long time; I have served the gentlewoman with muffins these three years) and said I had taken a pair of shoes. I had the shoes on me stooping to unbuckle my shoe.</p>

I forgot what name; and I said to Mr. Hewson, I don't like that man. With that my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160254"/>friend got out and went on with his goods; and I went on about five yards, and I felt a sudden jerk in the cart, and I turned round; I was in Ludgate-street, I came over Blackfriars Bridge; I felt the sudden jerk at the bottom of Ludgatehill, going into Fleet-market almost; I turned my head round, and the man had got the box of soap out about three yards from the cart, or not that; I jumped out and catched him with it; the prisoner I did not catch him; I took hold of the box, and he tried to pull it away from him, and then I called out stop thief! and he let it go; with that I put the soap into the cart again, and a gentleman brought him back. He ran up a court in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he brought back? - Not more than a minute or two minutes, because there were so many people round.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was the prisoner? - Yes. It was as light as day almost with the moon.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he the box? - He had it in his arm; and I believe the half hundred of soap get at one end, and I believe it slipped on his toes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much soap was there? - It was fifty-six pounds when I weighed it, but it losed by taking about; it was upwards of fifty five pounds when I weighed it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there a till board to the cart? - No; and as there was none that was the reason that I catched you in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see me take it out of the cart? - I did; I turned round immediately on the sudden jerk of the cart.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him pull it out? - O yes. He did not let it go till I cried stop thief!</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable of St. Bride's parish; I know nothing more than his being brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor? - Yes, he charged him with taking half a hundred of soap. The prisoner's behaviour was not altogether decent at the time; he denied it. The box I have had in my possession ever since. The soap was delivered to the prosecutor by the direction of Alderman Clarke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask him whether the prosecutor did not say he was not sure whether I was the man or no? - I do not remember that. I know he he said before the alderman, that he had hardly occasion to look at him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Had you seen him for any length of time at the tail of your cart? - No, only when he tried to struggle with me for the box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had come from Machee's, the callico printer, where I work, in Surry; coming through Bridge-street I heard a calling out of stop thief! and I ran with the rest of the people that were running through Bride's passage, and in Harp-alley; I had not got any further than Harp-alley before some people ran beyond me and some behind me, and some people said, where is the man that stole the soap out of the man's cart; I said, I believe he is gone on. Then two men came up and said, they believed I was running; and they took me back to the cart, and asked who was robbed? somebody asked the prosecutor whether he knew the man? he said he did not know whether he knew the man or no; and he said the same before the constable of the night; but he said coming along Bridge-street, a man came behind him, and took the box of soap out of his cart, and he was not sure whether I was the man or not. With that they, no doubt, persuaded him I was the man, which when he came before the magistrate he swore that I was the man that took the soap out of the cart. He told the magistrate, that in Bridge-street three men spoke to him. The justice asked him whether he lost the soap where three men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160255"/>spoke to him? Yes, says he, I lost the box at the very place; says the magistrate, was this man with the men that spoke to you? and he said he was not with the men at the time. I never was in such a place in my life before; I am quite innocent of it, I know no more of it than any thing. I have had people to appear to my character every day in the week, and there was no bill found against me till yesterday morning, and I sent them home.</p>

             and his wife, for beating and abusing me; I met the prisoner at the bar at Guildhall; he tapped me on the shoulder; I was telling a woman that I had with me, that I wanted a warrant, and I never was before a magistrate in my life, and I did not know how to go about it; he said; as I wanted a warrant, he would instruct me how to go about the business.

                        targets="t17950916-99-off564 t17950916-99-crimeloc565"/>; he called for pen, ink and paper, and a pint of porter, and said, he would instruct me; he said a shilling warrant was of no use, if I would give him half a crown he would get me a bench warrant, and it would be a shilling serving; he pulled one out of his pocket, as he called it a bench warrant; I asked him if he was authorised to serve a warrant without going before a magistrate? for I was not acquainted with the business; he said, he was, he attended Guildhall, Poultry Compter, the King's Bench, and all other places of confinement; if I would give him three shillings and six-pence, he would do the business. I had but three shillings about me; I had a woman with me, and and I sent her for the money; and then he said he would serve the warrant on Mr. Reeves, at five o'clock in the evening, where I lodged, he had a little business to do first.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him where Henry Reeves lived? - Yes; he had put it down on his bench warrant as he called it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on that day, go before any magistrate? - No, I did not; I see no more that day. I left him then; he said he had a little business to do; and I went to the Bell again, and he was gone and told the landlord how he would serve me for making him fill up a warrant without giving him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave him no money? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. You and Mrs. Reeves had a quarrel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any blows past? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got the better? - I got the better, because I got the warrant; she beat me, but I did not beat her.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a good deal agitated after this quarrel; extremely anxious to bring her to justice? - Because I never was used in the manner in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Very anxious to bring her to justice and utterly ignorant how to proceed? -Very ignorant, because I never was before a magistrate in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. And meeting with this person, you begged of him to inform you how to proceed in this business? - He said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he explained to you, that one sort of warrant would be of no use,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160256"/>because of the bail; but the bail resulting from the other would be in consequence of twenty-four hours notice? - No, he did not say any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding this instruction on his part, you gave him no money? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not had occasion to be before a magistrate before, therefore perhaps you are unacquainted that such assistance is to be found in every police office? - I did not. He said he would manage and make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that he went to Mr. Reeves in order to make it up? - He did; he had money from him.</p>

             the woman we have just seen? - Yes. And he said, he should not serve it on me because he had enquired after my character, and I had a very good character, that he only shewed it me; I told him it was of no use, I could not read; he said, he should not serve it on me; I told him it was a thing I was quite unacquainted with; and he said, leave it alone to me, he would put me in a way how to get through it. Then first he said I must give him half a crown for serving it, and sixpence to go the next morning to stop the warrant. I was quite unacquainted with the business; I was never before a court of justice before in my life; I cannot read or write English; I gave him the half crown and sixpence; the half crown for serving it on me, and the sixpence if be would stop the warrant the next morning. He then sat down and wrote me a direction for to meet him at the Helmet, in Bishopsgate-street, and what his name was; he gave me the name of Smith; I have kept it over since.(Read by the clerk of the Court.)</p>

               <p>"Mr. Reeves to meet Mr. Smith at the Helmet, to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. Monday, July the 6th, 1795."</p>
               <p>The next morning I and my wife and another woman went to meet him; but he was not come. I could not stop, I was obliged to go to work; I went again about eleven o'clock, and then I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - The 7th of July, Tuesday, the day after. He was just come in, sitting along side of my wife. I went in and told him that I left my cause entirely to him; and just as I was going out of doors, he asked my wife whether she had any money? and he said, if she would give him half a crown, he would take out a cross warrant. I heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he ever got this cross warrant? - I never asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your wife gave him the half crown? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it? - No. I see him, again the 8th of July, the day after, then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160257"/>he was in custody, then I gave charge of him, then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he taken up on your account? - Yes. I met him at Guildhall, and I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Where do you live? - In Widegate-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that he has a wife and a large family? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you will be as candid to me as you have been to Mr. Knowlys and other people, with whom you have conversed on this subject. I think when he first met, he said he would undertake to make it up for you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that this woman, Mrs. Barnet, was extramely enraged against your wife, and meant to prosecute you? - No, I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you learned from your wife, or any other person that an assault had taken place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you knew that Mrs. Barnet meant to take up your wife for an assault? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. But Mrs. Barnet did take out a warrant after that? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when Mr. Swift stated the indignation that Mrs. Barnet was in, he persuaded you to make it up? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you was given to understand, what appears in fact, that warrants were out against you, then at last you thought it time to make it up? - We made it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you at the expence of the prosecution? - I know nothing at all about the expence. I am bound over to prosecute, that is all I know of expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard who is to be at the expence of this prosecution? Are you to be at the expence? - It is out of my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I ask you if any other person, and who? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you to attend? - I was sent for from the solicitor's office; I had a note.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember which of the constables told you that all your expences would be paid you? - None of the constables told me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person tell you it should? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - The Solicitor's office told me I believe it was them that we should be paid for our trouble, if she would leave it to them. I never see any constable that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the assurance go a little further in telling you that you should be well paid? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you should be rewarded for the loss of time if you could convict this man, nor you did not say so to Mr. Knowlys? - No, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though this person did not come at ten o'clock, he came at eleven, and told you that you might safely leave it to him. Did you; in fact, arrive at any trouble after that? - She had the warrant out the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him the next day attending as usual, what appeared to be his vocation? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you have stated that the two shillings and sixpence you gave him was because he would not serve the warrant. Perhaps you know that the most reputable sheriffs office in London takes small fees? - I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you gave this two shillings and sixpence, was there any liquor or entertainment called for at this public house? - Yes, we had two pints of beer; I paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for this two shillings and sixpence he was once negociating this business<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160258"/> with Mrs. Barnet and two days attending you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. So they made Grizzlegog pay for all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You make a heavy sigh, as many a man does at the lawyer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the prosecution and how it is carried on? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are bound over by the alderman, and the solicitor of the City has carried it on.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are you at present in this regiment of loyal louth volunteers? - Yes, I have been in the recruiting service; I came now from Watford.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been from this recruiting house? - I went away the Wednesday after he went away from the house; I come up again on this trial.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen Cooke? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you conversed on this trial? - He has not conversed with me on this trial; I was sent for last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told what to say? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were not a witness on Cooke's trial? - I was not, because I was sent off to my regiment that I then belonged to, in Dublin barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. But not being at the last trial, did not you understand what you were to prove to day? - Yes, to prove that I knew the man when he was at the Star and Garter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that? - I have heard different people talk of it, not one in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not Mr. Cooke tell you so, that you were to come to prove that you remembered this man at the Star and Garter? - Certainly he did, he told me that I was subpoenaed to be an evidence for him, that I was there at the time, and so I was; I am speaking no more than what is true.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you came here on Friday last, that is a week ago exactly; where have you been living since you have been in town? - I have attended here almost every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Cooke been attending with you? - He has not been attending with me, he has been attending in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been at dinner together? - No, I went home to dinner.</p>

               <p>Q. You went home to this recruiting shop? - Yes, I went home, that is where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. You went home to the rest of your regiment? - Yes, but Cooke was not with me, never particularly, no more than any body else; I have had no conversation with him at all, the other men and me have talked together, but not sergeant Cooke.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still in the regiment? - Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that when you was subpoenaed, it was asked what you could prove, and what you knew of this business? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Another thing, you had no other place to live at but this recruiting house? - No, that is my place, I have no right to be any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have talked about this matter among your friends? - Yes, I have</p>
               <p>Q. It is not a very common thing for one of your comrades to be indicted for felony? - No, I should be very sorry if it was.</p>

             morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever go out of your house during that time? - Yes, he went out once to be attested, on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out any other time? - Yes, on Monday evening, he was brought in by a watchman, Thomas Bradley; I see him brought in at the door; Bradley asked sergeant Cooke whether that man belonged to him, and he answered that he did, and then they went into the parlour, and I saw no more of them for a little while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in the tap room? - I carried tea to him myself in the tap room, he sat behind the door; he was in more than once to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you see him twice? - I only speak as to belief that I see him twice, but I am certain once, because I carried tea to him, and two slices of bread and butter, either on Sunday or Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he at liberty, or was he locked up? - Neither him nor no man was ever locked up in my house, nor would I suffer any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you solemnly swear that he never was locked up in any room in your house? - He was not; I set two rooms to them, one room to sleep in and another to sit in, and I would wish them to be there as much as I can, but they are all over my house. That is the man, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. By what name did he go at your house? - By the name of

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are the landlord of this house, of course every thing is conducted in this house as it ought to be? - It might be so.</p>

               <p>Q. You give them free liberty to run all over the house? They are not confined to one room? - They have four rooms, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And they had full liberty to go about every part of your house? - Yes, every part except the wine cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that as to once that you are sure that you gave him tea in the tap room, but as to any more, being on your oath, you do not choose to swear, either one way or the other? - No more! will not swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has your's been a recruiting house? - Since the 17th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many recruits in your house at different times? - A great many more than sleep there, at different times.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see him? - On the 27th of April, to the best of my knowledge on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a walter at the Star and Garter? - Yes. When I first see him he was brought in by one Brown from Chelsea, and was taken into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour? - I cannot say, I am not particular, he came as a recruit; he was taken into a little parlour on the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. In what other parts did you see him? - On Sunday, and on Monday I see him in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you see him both these days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing in the tap room? - I really cannot tell, what he was doing. he might be drinking with the rest of the recruits.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the recruits in general the liberty of coming into the tap room when they pleased? - Yes, at times, they drink in all parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observation of that man, did he appear to be much restrained, or more confined than the rest of the recruits? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him complain when he was in the house, of being robbed or I treated? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time the watchman gave any account of any man? - Yes, and that was the same man; that was on Monday, about twenty minutes after ten in the evening; Bradley brought him in and asked for Mr. Cooke the sergeant, and asked if he did not belong to him, he supposed he was going to desert.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cooke claim him? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say at that time? - I did not hear him make any defence at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not go to the justice? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you are a waiter at this rendezvous? - Yes, almost a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you continued in the employ at present by the last witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that he was in the tap room two days? - He was in different times on both days.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always said so? - Yes, I said so before to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. That was very recent after the transaction took place that you was examined before, when sergeant Cooke was tied? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was more likely to say your recollection of the thing what had happened, then you are now? - I can recollect as well now as then.</p>
               <p>Q. So you are sure that you said at the last trial, that he was on Sunday and Monday at different times in the tap room. I will put the question that was put to you the last time, "Did you ever see him in the tap room at all" your answer was,"On Monday he was, in the forenoon, to the best of my knowledge."</p>
               <p>"Q. What was he doing there?</p>
               <p>"A. He might be drinking or sitting with the rest of the men.</p>
               <p>"Q. What part of the house on Sunday?</p>
               <p>"A. He was in different parts." On Sunday now you are sure he was in the room, how came you not to say so to the other jury? Stand down.</p>

He is than taken before the magistrate, the magistrate asks him several questions, such as, if he was sober when he enlitted? if he had received his beanty? The magistrate then orders me to administer the oaths to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, are these forms invariably ovserved of the attestation of recruits at your office? - I believe there is not a recruit attested in our office but what these observation are made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there before this time any trials that induced you to be more cautious? -</p>
               <p>Court. You were particularly cautious and more so in the month of May last - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You, on these occasions, administer an oath to the recruit? - Yes, two oaths; one to be true to his Majesty, and the other in the attestation.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that those oaths were administered to the person that appeared by the name of 
               <persName id="t17950916-100-person1043">

               <p>Q. Was there any other William Harris brought by Sergeant Cooke? - There was not. I cannot recollect his person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I was not inclined at all to dispute the regularity of your office; nor was I disposed to question too propriety of your couduct at all, nor am I now. You do not mean to say that the prisoner at the bar was William Harris? - Nor can I say so.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you say that William Harris was brought by Sergeant Cooke you say so because it is wrote down so in your book? - From my book and the attestation</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he bring him from? - Out of a passage close djaning to the house. That is the man that he brought, he was dressed in the same clothes as he was brought to me on Saturday, his own clothes. He went up stairs and changed them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Of course every thing that the present prisoner swore on the former trial must be false? - The greatest part of it.</p>

               <p>Q. If I took you right, the half guinea was to be deducted from ten guineas, and you was to have it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You make your agreement with the recruit, and the recruit has the money before the magistrate, before he is attested?(The attestation read.)</p>
