                  </hi>. I am a cork-cutter, and live in Fenchurch-street, in the perish of St. Catherine Coleman. On the morning of the 8th of October, about a quarter before six o'clock, I went down-stairs to open the door to Bull, who came to work—when I came down-stairs to open the door I saw a man in the cork shavings, under the bench of the workshop—he appeared to be asleep—it was the prisoner—before I awoke him the constable came in—I had sent for him—we awoke the prisoner—one of the officers was at the door at the time Bull rang to be let in, and Bull and the officer shook the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house—he appeared to be asleep all the way almost—we looked about, and found a great many things missing, particularly from the dining-room—my family consists of myself and my housekeeper, and I had a friend at my house—the housekeeper went to bed last the night before—I had not been awake long before I came down—it was not very dark when I got up—it was a little after six o'clock—I saw Bull when he came in—it was light enough to see his features—I was the first person up in the morning—I did not know any thing was stolen at that time, but they sent for me to come to the watch-house, to see the prisoner—the officer searched his pockets, and found a silver snuff-box and some other little trifles.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for the prosecutor. On the 8th of October I went to the house and rang the bell at a quarter before six o'clock—Mr. Hum let me in—it was neither day-light nor candle—light, but between both—we could not seeabout the shop without a candle—not with the door shut—when the door was open, it was light enough to see the features of a per<lb/>son standing in the passage—I went into the yard, got a light, and brought it into the front workshop, the street door being then shut—I wanted an old pair of shoes from the front workshop, and in reaching them I found the prisoner under the work-board, huddled up—I drew back, opened the street door, and said tp Mr. Hum, "Sir, there is a man lying under that board, do you know any thing about it?" Mr. Hum took the candle and saw him himself—I stopped at the street door to look for an officer, and</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutor was at my stable on the day in question, about ten o'clock in the morning—I was standing very near the stable door, just inside the stable—the prisoner came into the stable, and placed himself or stood very near to me, by my side—Mr. Hughes was in the stable, conversing with my brother, at a few yards' distance—the prisoner said. "Mr. Hughes, you have done me an injury"—Mr. Hughes replied, that he had not done him an injury, and what injury had been done, he had brought on himself by his own misconduct—Hughes had scarcely</p>

I was called in, at ten o'clock on the 12th of October, to the stable-yard, and the prisoner was pointed out as being the man who had attempted to shoot Mr. Hughes—I took him into custody, and the pistol was handed over to me by Mr. Meredith—I have it here—I examined it, and found some shot and pow<lb/>der in it—I drew the charge—the pistol has a swivel ramrod—I found powder and shot in the pistol, which I produce—it is common small shot, usually used for pigeon-shooting—there were two pieces of paper instead of wadding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Scotch Fusileer guards. On Monday afternoon, the 5th of October, I was opposite the New Post-office, at about a quarter before five o'clock—the male prisoner came up to me, and said something about the Queen of Spain's service—we had a few words together—I cannot say what—his wife came up, and said, "Never mind, come on, let us go and have a pot of beer together"—we went into the King William, in Noble-street—the man was in a black frock coat, all in rags—he called for a pint of four-penny ale—he drank a glass, and gave me a glass—I took it out of his hand, but I felt quite sick, and did not drink it—I sat down on the seat, and felt quite sick—I then came on my side, and then on my back—I was not intoxicated, but I had had no dinner—I laid down, and this handkerchief was in my cap—the woman took it and placed it over my face, and I being a married man, thought it was my own wife, as I was laid down, and got stupified with laying—she unbuttoned my waistcoat partly up, so with that I went off into a sleep—when I awoke, I missed my watch, and have never seen it since—I had it when I went into the public-house—I felt it in my fob, and the ribbon was outside—the guard was round my neck, which was cut: this is it—this part was down to the watch, and it was cut by a shoemaker's knife—there was a ribbon and key attached to my watch, and a silver penny of George III.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 19th of September, it was my duty to open two of the export dock gates, at six o'clock, one on the north side, and the other on the south—I opened the south gate, came across the flosting bridge to the north, and on looking down the dock, saw the prisoner coming from towards the dock, intending to go out, which excited my suspicion, and I observed his hat was rather heavy, and rolling on his head—I went across to him and met him, and asked what he had got in his hat—he said, "Nothing"—You have, and I must see"—he then took off his hat and took out a bladder—I was then about taking hold of it—he sprang two paces, threw it down, and jumped on it—he stooped down, as I thought, to tie his garter, but he took from under his garter this syphon—he took the two up together, and flung them towards the dock, but they did not reach the water—he broke the bladder and spilt the contents—what appeared to me to be a light pale liquid came from the bladder—I have no hesitation in saying it was wine—I smelt it, and tasted it with my tongue—I believed it to be sherry—he ran back again towards the lock where he came from—I then called for assistance, and I and one of the dock servants secured him—I took him over to the dock office, secured him there, and then returned to make further search for the things which he threw away—the syphon and bladder were picked up and handed to me—the blader would hold about six or seven quarts—I found the officer of Customs had got into a light craft, the <hi rend="italic">Caroline,</hi> and he had got out the twenty-fourth bladder when I came up from between the limber boards of the lighter—twenty-four bladders were found in the craft <hi rend="italic">Caroline,</hi> concealed in the limber board, full of the same sort of wine—it appeared the same in colour and taste—here is a sample, from one of the bladders, and there is another sample in Court, from the butt—as far as I could taste and see, it was the same kind of wine as was in the bladder the prisoner had—I licked the bladder and smelt it, and as he held it up it seemed a pale liquid—it was spilt on stone, but there was a puddle of water close by it, and it sunk into that—as I walhed to the dock-office, the prisoner said, "You can't hurt me for it; it is beer"—after he broke the bladder he said he was a poor fellow, and he hoped I would not hurt him—the bladders contained fifteen gallons—the one I took from him was of a middling size—not so large as some of the others.</p>

                  </hi> the younger. I am the son of Thomas Silverwood, of Oxford-street. About ten o'clock on the 30th of September, I received information which induced me to go into Portman-street, Portman-square—I saw the prisoner there with this merino under his arm—it was covered with this paper—I had never seen him before—I took it from him—it is my father's—I came out of the shop and followed George Bateman—I went up Green-street, into Norfolk-street, into a mews—the prisoner was running—we came up to him, and walked between us down into North Audley-street—I then returned home—the policeman then took the prisoner to the station-house—I said nothing to him.</p>

On Tuesday Captain Stevens (I believe that is his name) left a watch to have the gold key mended, and the seconds hand put to it—it was to be re<lb/>paired by Friday—on Friday morning the prisoner came, and said, "I have come for my watch that I left to be repaired"—I asked him his name—he said, "My name is Stevens" or "Stivens"—I said, "Did you come with Mr. Miller, the taior, of King-street, on Tuesday?"—he said, "I did"—I re<lb/>ferred to my book to see if it was correct—I went to my glass case for the watch, and brought it down, and said, "Is this watch?"—he said, "It is"—I opened it, and showed him the seconds hand, and said, "Does this hand please you?"—he said, "Yes; is the key fast?"—I asid, "Yes, I have not only rivetted it, but soldered it?"—he said, "What does it come to?"—I said, "7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he said, "Mr. Harris, I will send my lad over with a chronometer to repair, then I will pay you together"—I asked what ship he belonged too—he said the <hi rend="italic">John</hi>—I asked where it laid—he said in the London docks—I called him back and said, "Do you say it is the <hi rend="italic">John</hi>?"—he said, "Yes, in the London docks"—he did not come back or send a chronometer.</p>

On Tuesday, the 6th of Octo<lb/>ber, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 8, Husband-street—I asked her if she had bought any linen of any kind that day or the night before, and described some shirts with small frills to them, and marked: also some stockings and shifts—she said she had not bought any thing that day—she had not her shop open the whole day, and had bought and sold nothing, nor the night before—I asked her over and over again—she said no, she had not—I told her Mrs. Massey had been robbed of some linen, and she had information that she was the person who had bought it—she denied it very strongly—she showed Mrs. Massey three or four boxes in the room—there was nothing in them she could identify—she asked if she was satisfied—she said she was not, and gave her in charge—I then commenced searching the place, and under the bed, on the sacking, I found one shirt—Mrs. Massey directly said, "That is one of the shirts"—I then looked underneath another bed, between the sacking and bed, and there I found five pairs of stockings, two petticoats, and a shift—in a corner of the room I found a pair of drawers—in the shop I found an<lb/>other shirt—we then took her to the station-house—she said nothing to me, nor in my presence, but strongly denied buying these things—that was all she said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Cross-street, Hatton-garden in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. The prisoner was my journeyman. On Sunday, the 27th of September, I left the house at seven o'clock in the evening, and returned at eleven o'clock—I had left the prisoner and my two sons in the house, but nobody else—when I returned, the prisoner was gone—he todged with me, but did not come home after<lb/>wards he absconded—I had left my purse, with ten sovereigns and four<lb/>teen half-crowns in it, and a small key; in a bottom drawer of a chest of drawers, in my bed-room—the room door was not locked—I had seen the property safe at four o'clock in the afternoon—when I came home I found him gone—I examined, and missed the purse and money—I was at home from four to seven o'clock—nobody had been in the house except a woman, who was not out of my sight.</p>

Q.</hi> Is it in your department to superintend the mode of sorting or stamping the letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was in consequence of a complaint made to me by Walton, that I sent for the prisoner—his com<lb/>plaint was, that he suspected he kept letters irregularly, for the purpose of getting the postage, not to steal the contents, and it was in consequence of that complaint that I put the questions to him about the letters in Lisle-street and Golden-square—one was directed to Mr. Gibson, of Lisle-street—I did not see that letter—I am not certain whether Walton stated what the postage on Gibson's letter was—there was no complaint at the Post-office that those two letters were not delivered—this letter is marked 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that means the postage; a double letter would not be marked so—the other is marked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are many places in Ireland for which single postage would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but there is no place in England where it would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are some parts in Scotland—he did not pull the letters out of his pocket hastily, but looked them over hastily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the inland-office at the Post-office. These two letters came to the Post-office on the 18th of Septem<lb/>ber last—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) I know that by their both bearing the stamp of that morning—it was the prisoner's duty to stamp these two letters, he being second stamper at the E table—I have no doubt that these letters were stamped by the second stamper—the prisoner was at the E table in the inland-office that morning—there is the Bawtry penny post-stamp on this letter, directed to Mrs. Rotherham—that would be one penny in addition to the single postage—the word "Bewtry" is not very legible, but I know the letter came from Tickell—I know it must be the Bawtry stamp, as it came from Bawtry, but on looking at the stamp at the back, I know it came from one of forty post towns, of which Bawtry is one—that is the London stamp, which was put on by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But from any stamp on it, when it first came to the prisoner's hands, could he tell where it came from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not—it has been stamped in a solvently, careless manner—after the prisoner had stamped the letters he should have taken them to the sorting table, which was within a few yards of his table—there was no necessity for him to put them into his pocket—he had no business to take them into the letter-carrier's office—his duty was to take them from the E table to the sorting table, in the same room, and within a few yards of him.</p>

               <p>morning in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every morning; it is performed with great despatch—he stamps the letters as fast as he can—his attention is not draws to the marks, whether they are plain or not—not the post-marks—his duty is simply to stamp them—one person sits directly opposite to him—there are two stampers on one side of the table and three on the other—there were three persons opposite to him nearly the whole time—it is impossi<lb/>ble to say for a minute—I see nothing in this eleven-penny letter to in<lb/>dicate that it was more than single—the stampers would not have an oppor<lb/>tunity of examining a letter to find the country mark as I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the prisoner's stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day of the month, and a private mark, "E 18 Sept. 1835," that was all the stamp he made—here is "Bawtry Penny-post" on it—that is charged for conveying the letter from Tickell to Bawtry, the postage from which is only 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that was marked at Tickell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If his attention was called to the Bawtry mark, he would at once know it was a single letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—a practical inland-officer could not be deceived into a belief that this was a double letter, but other persons in the post-office might, as there are many double letters which bear the tax of eleven-pence—the letters are separated on the table, paid and unpaid, and franks also, but not at the stampers' table; one pile is put on the stampers' table at a time—the stamper takes them himself from the other table—a clerk examines them, and stands them by the side of a small ridge—by accident paid letter might get mixed with the unpaid—it was the prisoner's duty only to carry the unpaid letters to the sor<lb/>ters' table—if paid letters were accidentally carried with the unpaid, they would be sent back; but I can scarcely see how it was possible for him to do that—it would be discovered by the examining clerk before it got to the prisoner's hands; and if he did carry them to the sorter's table, that sorter would carry it to the paid sorter—it has occasionally occurred in error, that a stamper, who should stamp unpaid letters, has stamped paid ones—they go from the sorters' table to other sorters to be re-sorted, and he told up—that is done in the inland-office.</p>

ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any circumstance about these letters to make a man mistake them for unpaid letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the slightest—nothing whatever—as often as there is a pile, it is handed over from one side of the table to the other—the same man who stamps unpaid letters would take them to the sorter, but paid letters and franks are taken away by other persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Camden's Head, Church-lane, Lime-house. On Tuesday, the 6th of October, the prisoner came to my house with three others, at about eleven o'clock, and continued there until about three o'clock, sometimes in-doors, and sometimes out in the yard—they called for some beer, and Mrs. Rogers served them—I had occasion to go to my bed-room before they left, and when I entered the room, I saw two large bundles on the bed—bed one was tied in a yellow silk handkerchief, and the other in a blue handkerchief—I do not know how they came there—when I first entered the room, I thought my wife might have tied them up—I was cleaning myself in the room to go to the West End, and thought I heard footsteps in the lobby up stairs—I turned round, and saw the pri<lb/>soner at the bed-room door, with his shoes in his hand—I said, "What do you want here?"—he said, "I have made a mistake, and have come the wrong road"—he turned round, and ran down stairs immediately—I fol<lb/>lowed him down as fast as I could, and saw him enter a small passage forthy or fifty yards from the house—I followed him enter a small passage, across the next street, and down another street—when I got pretty near him, he dropped a black silk handkerchief—he was stopped by some people in the street, and I brought him home to my parlour—he was very desire<lb/>ous of having his shoes; but as he had run without his shoes, I thought he should return without them—I put him down on one of the seats in the parlour close to the fire-place—he tried to get up two or three times to go to the other side of the parlour after his shoes; and I shook him, and a mahogany box, with money-scales, fell from his clothes—I said, "That is my box, you rascal, you have been into the bed-room before;" as that had been in the drawer of my dressing-table—I put my hand down to his trowsers, and felt something in his pocket, in which I found a knife with my name engraved upon it, and another knife belonging to my wife—he was taken to the station-house by a policeman, searched there, and part of a gold seal was found in a handkerchief tied round his leg under his trow<lb/>sers—they belong to me—when I returned, I went to the cellar, and found another bundle just against the trap—that contained a silk plaid dress, a silk shawl, and a camel-hair shawl—the bundles were taken to the office, with what was found up stairs—an inventory was taken by the policeman—I cannot say the prisoner had any thing to do with the bundle—he must have been in the room before I saw him there, as he had arti<lb/>cles on him which had been taken from there—all the articles in the dif<lb/>ferent bundles had been in that room—the value of all the property is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. James Mudford, a woollen-draper, in Kingsland-road. On the 8th of September the prisoner came to the shop in company with another man, and asked me for some straps for the bottoms of trowsers—I told tim I had got none—he asked me for some buttons—I showed him some, and served him with a dozen, which came to two-pence, and which he paid me for—his companion had his back to me, and, while I was serving the buttons, the companion took this cloth off the counter—they had both come in together—I had seen them toge<lb/>ther two minutes before—the other man did not ask for any thing—I had seen them pass the door together two minutes before, but only once—they came in together, as if in company—while the two-pence laid on the counter, the other man ran off with the cloth, and the prisoner ran with him, close at his heels—I gave an alarm—they were then running together—I followed them to the bottom of Edward-street, which is six or eight houses from our shop—they turned the corner together—when they passed the door together they passed slowly, and had to return to enter the shop—the cloth measured twelve yards, and is worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a yard—I saw the pri<lb/>soner in Charles-square, a fortnight after, and followed him into Wilson-street, and gave him in charge of the constable—he said I must be mis<lb/>taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Brentford. I was in the employ of Mr. James Montgomery, of Old Brentford, a timber-merchant—it was my business to accompany the driver of a timber-carriage—the waggon was loaded with deals to take to Eaton, about three weeks before the prisoner was apprehended, the waggon was sent out about five o'clock, as near as I can tell—there were two sacks of chaff, and corn, and beans, and two trusses of hay—it was Bolton's business to put up the corn and chaff—he was the carter—that was my master's corn and chaff, which he serves out to the horses—it was not usual to take out so large a quantity—we are allowed when we go out with six horses half a bushel of beans, one bushel of oats, and the sack filled with chaff—we went to the White Bear, at Hounslow, and had some beer there—the carter went in and I followed him—as we were com<lb/>ing out, he said he should like to have a pipe of tobacco—we had one apiece—Bolton then called Tyler out, and said he wanted to speak to him—he went out, what they talked about, I so not know—I followed to look after the horses, and saw Tyler take the sack off the carriage, and carry it into the yard—when it was full, the sack contains four bushels, but it was not</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers. I have been in the Post-office forty years—if a letter-carrier of one division finds a letter directed to another division, if he discovers the error of its being. mis-sorted while he is in the Post-office, he should transfer the latter to the proper carrier to deliver it—it is passed regularly through the different books—it is not delivered to the letter-carrier immediately by the person finding the error, but through a charger—if he discovers a letter missorted to him after he leaves the office, it is his duty, after delivering all his own letters, to deliver the letter, so missorted, wherever it is addressed—I am supposing the letter being missorted, is charged to him in the lump—he should pay the postage to the Receiver general—it would make no differ<lb/>ence in his amount.</p>

                  </hi> I am a hosier and batter, and live in Graechurch-street, in the parish of Allhalows, I am Lambard-street. On Thursday evening, the 1st of October, I was out with Mr. Reynolds, and returned home at eight o'clock in the evening—I had left a servant in the house—I had seen the shop window five or six hours before eight o'clock—it was then per<lb/>fect—there was no broken pane—it was dark at eight o'clock, except from the street lamps, and the light from the window—when I came near my shop I observed two lads at the window, looking many ways—I thought they were after no good, and made up to them as fast as possible, and was just in time to endeavour to secure one of them, which was the prisoner, when the glass fell nearly on my feet, close by me—I ran after him, after having scuffled with him, and knocked him hat off in the scuffle, and in Leadenhall-market, in one of the turnings, I missed him—he was brought back afterwards by an officer—I did not look at the window, when the glass fell at my feet, nor see whether any thing was taken out at that time—I lost sight of the prisoner—I went about fifty yards from my shop in pursuit, then returned back to the shop directly, and immediately after the officer returned with him—I charged him with breaking my window, and taking goods from it—as, when I returned to the shop, I found there had been a piece of silk handkerchiefs taken from the window—I had made inquiry when I returned, and was told the silk handkerchiefs were taken from the window—a person found it outside, who I believe is not here—it was produced to me by my young man—he is not here—I did not see what the lads were doing at the window—I could not tell what they were in the act of do<lb/>ing—I could not see, because they were close together.</p>

On the night in question, I was in company with Mr. Ritchie, and saw two lads at the window—suspecting they were after no good, seeing them look up and down the street, I made across the road, and just as I came up the glass came out of the window—the prisoner ran up the street, followed by Mr. Ritchie—the other ran down Lombard-street, and I followed him calling, "Stop thief"—a policeman stopped him just by George-yard—I could not see what they were doing at the window, because I was behind them—when I came up they ran away—I returned to the shop afterwards, and saw the glass was broken—I did not see any thing on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Devonshire. In 1826 I was in Lon<lb/>don—the prisoner came to my house, and about three weeks after, he left this country—I followed him to Sweden—he had married my daughter in 1826, and then went to the Brazils—I followed him to Sweden, and bought a farm there for their use, and left them there for nearly two years and a half—I went over to Sweden again in August and assisted them with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I went over again a third time, as I heard he was desirous of selling the property—I found he had attempted to make a sale of two small por<lb/>tions of it—they had at that time two children—he was not in circumstances</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Downer's-cottage, Kingsland-road. On Wednesday, the 14th of October, I met two girls in St. Giles's—the pri<lb/>soner Rosetta is one of them—I accompained them to a house in St. Giles's, up stairs—it was three o'clock in the morning—I had been out to dinner—I went up stairs with both of them—one of them instantly left the room with my watch, leaving Rosetta in the room—they had been both together—the girls and I entered the room together—I was tipsy—Rosetta went on one side of the room, towards the bed—I was standing between the two girls—the other girl was on my left—I pulled off my cost and waist-coat, and placed my watch with them, on a table by the window—the other girl stood by the table, she took my watch, and went off immediately—I ex<lb/>pected she would return, and remained in the house—I went to bed with Ro<lb/>setta—I remained there, and in about an hour Charlotte came into the room with another women—I mentioned about my watch being taken, and I gave Charlotte half-a-crown, and the other woman a shilling, to go out in search of my watch—they returned in an hour, or an hour and a half, and told me it was useless to look for the watch—they were both very much intoxicated—I remained there till about eight o'clock in the morning—at that time the two prisoners were in the room—Rosetta was in bed—Char<lb/>lotte brought me my clothes, and told me to put them under my head, and be careful that I was not robbed—Rosetta then got up, and both left the room—my clothes laid on the pillow, where Charlotte had put them—not under the pillow—in a quarter of an hour I got up to dress, and found my handkerchief and an umberlla, and velvet waistcoat, and card-case were gone—my pockets were emptied—I lost two half-sovereigns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in a small bag—this waistcoat, card-case, and umbrella, are mine.</p>

In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's premises, in Glass-house-yard, in the liberty of Glass-house, near the end of Aldersgate-street—I knocked at the door, it was opened by Martha Hartill—my brother officer Isbester was with me, and I had a warrant—I asked if Mr. Hartill was at home, she said, he was not—I told her I had a warrant to search the house for King's stores—she said, she knew nothing of them—the door of the house opens into a passage, there is a door to go into a coach-house, or van-house, on the left hand side, going in, under the same roof—I searched below, while Isbester went up stairs—in the coach-house I found a hamper with a quan<lb/>tity of straw on the top—I found in the hamper 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. weight of copper bolts, a quantity of copper nails, mixed metal, and nails, and copper sheath<lb/>ing—I have not cast up the weight—I have been a police-officer nearly 24 years—I know the King's mark, the broad arrow was on these stores—I showed the woman part of the copper—I asked her if she knew where it came from—she said she did not know, but a carter had left it there about nine days age, and what it contained, she did not know—I asked her who the carter was, she said she could not tell—she said her husband had been out of town nearly three weeks—this was on Thursday, the 17th of Sep<lb/>tember—I traced her husband through Kent into Surrey, and on Saturday I found him at Mitcham—he had a van, and was driving from London—going through Mitcham—I told him, I wanted him for some King's stores, that I had searched his house in Glass-house-yard, and there found a quantity of King's stores, and he must go to town with me—he said he would not, he knew nothing of any King's stores—he afterwards said he would go with us any where, and I brought him to town—the name of John Hartill was on the van—on the way to town, he asked me to let his wife know where he was—I sent him on board the police-ship, and went to his wife, to the house which I had searched—I told her where her husband was, and she went to him on board the ship—I saw the van in the same coach-house, where I had found the copper—in coming along the road, I said to the man, "If it is not in your possession, it must be in your wife's." and he said. "Rather than my wife should suffer, I will take it upon my self"—I have had this property in my possession ever since—this is part of the stores—the King's mark is plainly on them.</p>

On the 17th of October, Ovens pawned this watch, about nine o'clock in the evening—I advanced 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I con<lb/>sider it worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I stopped 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the ticket—a private individual might set more value on it, but it is not worth more to sell in the shop—there are three seals to it, which were pawned with it—they are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—they are old-fashioned gold, but a very bad quality—there is some doubt whether the watch is silver or not—I should consider it well sold at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., seals and all—if it is silver it is not worth more.</p>

I watched him in consequence of suspicion, and stationed my<lb/>self at the end of a court in the Minories about fifty yards from the house—I saw him go to the house in the morning, and ring the bell, then go in, and open the shop, and shortly after, I saw his sister come out of the shop with a bundle—I pursued, and took her with the bundle containing the articles named in the indictment—I took her into a public-house—sent for an officer, and took her into the shop—I have every reason to believe the prisoner was in the shop, when his sister came out—I had not seen him come out—I had seen him in the shop a minute before—I took the sister twenty or thirty yards off—the bundle contained the property of my master and had his mark on them—they were kept in the shop where the sister came from—no other person would be in the shop besides the prisoner—minutes before seven o'clock, and had been taking the shutters down—I could not see into the shop—I had a view of the door, and saw the sister come out of the door of the shop—when I returned the prisoner was just outside, cleaning the window—the sister was in the habit of calling on him every morning, I believe, and she occasionally brought his breakfast—she is about eleven years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale druggist, and live in Thames-street. John Foster was my porter for about twelve months—about eight months in my individual service, and four months previously, in the service of myself and another—I came to town to the warehouse, on Monday morning, the 19th of October, and Foster made a communication to me—I found there was an appearance of violence to the window, and some parts of my warehouse—a chest of manna had been broken in one room, and a chest of saffron was broken, and I missed a parcel of isinglass—from sixty to seventy pounds of manna had been taken; the chest was quite empty—it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—I got the assistance of Josiah Evans, the officer, and I pointed out to him the marks of violence which my premises presented—in a subsequent part of the day I gave Foster to Maclean—l had him taken, from something said by the officer—Foster then made a statement voluntarily, without any promise on my part; and in conse<lb/>quence of what he said, I went to the prisoner's house, in Hackney-road, with Roe and Maclean—he carries on the business of a confectioner—Roe went in first, I followed him momentarily—Maclean entered at the same time with Foster—Cohen was at home, in the front shop—Roe called him backwards into his house, there being persons in the shop—they went into his back parlour, and we followed immediately—nothing was asked in the front shop—when we got into the back parlour, Roe had put questions to which he was apparently giving an answer—I did not hear what he said distinctly—the first question I heard Roe put, was, "Where are the goods you received this morning?"—he replied, "I will show you, "and attempted to go out of the back door, near which he was then standing—Roe refused to allow him to leave the room, and insisted upon his stating where they were—he made several attempts to induce Roe to allow him to show where they were; and finding he would not, he said, "My wife shall show you"—his wife came in almost immediately, I suppose two minutes after we entered the house; and when she came in, she said, "What are these gentlemen wanting?"—the prisoner said, "They are come about the bag that came this morning; show them where it is"—she look Roe into the yard, and he brought from a building in the yard, a bag containing manna, and a paper bag containing isinglass—I examined the bag containing manna, and have since seen it weighed—it is rather more than sixty pounds—I have no doubt but that it is of the same kind and quality as that lost from my warehouse—I had seen the same bag in my warehouse the Fri<lb/>day previous—whilst there, there was a man who appeared to be an ac<lb/>quaintance of Cohen—he asked him, "From whom did you receive those goods?" pointing to the two bags—Cohen's reply was, "That is the man"—pointing to Foster, who was in a corner of the room—it is utterly impossible to recognise the isinglass, but the bag I had seen on the Tues<lb/>day preceding.</p>

I was called to the prosecutor's premises on the morning of the 19th, and was shown certain appearances as of breaking into the premises—they certainly did not appear as if caused by persons from without the premises—after you enter, you go along the pas<lb/>sage, then there is a window which had been pushed out—I looked at the window-sill, and saw the dust was there, and no person had gone over it—I looked over the place, and the result was that no person had come from outside—I told Mr. Buchanan so, and then Foster was taken—he made a statement to Mr. Buchanan—I then went with them to Cohen's, in Hack<lb/>ney-road, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—I went and saw Cohen in the shop, and another person talking to him—I beckoned him to come to me in the back-room—I pointed to Foster, who was then standing in the shop with Maclean and Mr. Buchanan—I asked Cohen if he knew him—he said, "No"—I asked him if he had purchased any goods of him—he said, "No"—I said, "Where are the bags of goods brought by the porter this morn<lb/>ing?" he said, "Let me fetch my wife, and she shall get them"—I said, "No"—he then asked me again—I said, "No"—at that moment the wife came in—he asked her to get the bag that was brought there by the porter that morning—she then took me to a back wash-house, and gave me the bag of manna, which was shown to Mr. Buchanan, and identified—I also found some isinglass in a bag, it was standing by the side of the manna—I then searched the place, but found nothing else.</p>

Buchanan and Meg<lb/>geson—he said he knew some of their men very well, and asked whether I could get any things so that my master should not know—if I could get it to his house, he could get it away directly; so that no one should know about it—after this I had dealings with him often, and I received money from him a great many times—he walked with me several mornings, and asked if my master did not deal in saffron and different things—he saw me often enough to know me—on the Saturday in question some saffron, gam<lb/>booge, tamarinds, and isinglass was taken from my master's warehouse, and on the Monday morning some manna was taken from the middle floor there—it was in a box—I stole it—I took, I suppose, about 50lbs.—I put it into a cloth bag, and took it to the public-house at the corner of Fish-street-hill, and asked if I could leave it there—I did not know Thomas King at that time—I saw him standing outside the public-house—I asked him if he knew Hackney-road—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he knew Mr. Cohen—he said, "No"—I gave King the bag to take to Mr. Cohen—when I asked him if he knew him, he said he did not know him, but he dare say he should find it—I told him to take it to Mr. Cohen, a little beyond the church, on the left-hand side—he then took the bag—it was about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—that was about two hours and a quarter after I had brought it from the warehouse—I brought it out at about five minutes to nine—I had had some conversation with Cohen that morning about the manna—I saw him at his house at about eight o'clock—I asked him whether he could come and take the manna—he said, no; he could not carry so much for twenty guineas—I told him there was about a cwt.—that was what I guessed it at—I had not taken it out of the chest—one shilling a pound was to be given for it—Cohen stated that—I remember Mr. Bu<lb/>chanan coming to the warehouse that day—I told him of a robbery at the place—I had caused the window and rails to present that appearance, which I pointed out to Mr. Buchanan—what I told him about it was false—the officer was sent for—I was afterwards taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier, and live in York-row, Kingsland-road. On Tuesday evening, I was opposite Mr. Little's empty house, and saw a man standing, with a white jacket on, in front of the house—I saw him come to the pavement—he looked up and down the oad, and went back to the area—he was about half-way to the area when I first saw him—I saw him stoop down, and appear to be taking some<lb/>thing from the area—he left it on the parapet wall, came again to the pavement, returned to the area, and appeared to be taking something up, as he was before, and he came away—the policeman came to me at that time whom I had sent for—the prisoner Hutchins was the man in the white jacket—I made a communication to the policeman, and went across the road with him to the men—I told him these were the men who had been in Mr. Little's house, or doing something to Mr. Little's house, and he was to bring them back—they had gut about fifty yards when the po<lb/>liceman stopped them—they said they had not been into any place, but</p>

               <p>had come straight down the road—I said, "Bring them back to the house;" and I then lost sight of them, as I turned my back to go to the house—when we got to the house, I found the grate of the wall of the area—I said, "This is what they have been taking from the house, and I shall take it to the station-house"—I told the policeman to take the pri<lb/>soners there—when I got to the station-house, my hands were black with touching the grate; and I said, if the prisoners had touched the grate, their hands must also be black; and both their hands were black—Barker said he had been in to make water against the bricks—after I came from Worship-street, I went back and examined the bricks, and they were quite dry.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday night Mercy applied to me, and I saw the two prisoners on the opposite side of the road—he said, in the hearing of the prisoners, "Take these two men into custody, they have done something at a house"—I said, "What house?"—he said, "Mr. Little's house; bring them back"—and on my way back I asked the prisoners what brought them to that house—they both said they had</p>

               <p>not been there at all, but had come down the road, and that they had come from work, and were going home—I brought them back to the area and immediately Mercy stooped down and took up a stove, which was lying on the parapet of the area, and in the presence of the prisoners he said, "This is what they have been stealing from Mr. Little's house"—he said, "You take the prisoners to the station-house, and I will take the stove"—I brought them to the Station-house, and there, in answer to as question, Hutchins's said, he went into the piece of ground, in front of the house, to make water—I cannot say whether the question was put by me or the inspector—the inspector wrote down the charge—he said he had gone inside the ground, not into the area—I then looked at the prisoners' hands—I found Hutchins's hands black, and Barker's also very black—it appeared to me to be soot, something similar to what was on the store<lb/>I then went to Mr. Little's house, and examined it, and found two stoves had been recently taken down, one in the front room, and one in the back, on the first floor—I traced a quantity of lime and black stuff down stairs—I went into the kitchen, and found the window forced open—I then pro<lb/>ceeded to the ground in front of the house, and found a second stove on the parapet of the area, close to where the one was found—I brought it in and matched it with the fire-place—exactly fitted—I made a strict search round the house, but could find nothing else—I brought the stoves to the station-house—Mr. Little had come there by this time, and identified the stoves.</p>

I remember a pack<lb/>age being there, containing rags, directed to Mr. Venables—it had been there, I suppose, about two months before I made any observation on it—I then observed that the wrapper was rotten underneath, through lying on the ground—there were sacks in it—nothing else but the bag—I saw the name of "S. Kidd" on the sacks, but no direction—I told the last witness of it—those sacks appeared in very good condition, fit to be used for flour—I saw Mr. Cohen and Mr. Kidd at the wharf—this lot of sacks were then before them</p>

I am employed to collect the different sacks from the different bakers and millers supplied with flour—I was at Trigg's wharf in September last, when Mr. Kidd and Mr. Cohen were there—I noticed some bales and bags there, the outside wrappers of which were rotten—the bales were opened in the presence of Mr. Cohen—I cannot say positively whether Mr. Kidd was present—on the 7th of September I found one sack, and on the 8th twenty-two sacks of Mr. Kidd's—Hopkins was with me—seventy of Mr. Kidd's sacks were found altogether—I was not present when more than the thirteen were found—I saw them on the wharf in netting—the rest were up stairs at Trigg's wharf—the whole seventy were there when Mr. Cohen and Mr. Kidd were there—they were in good condition—some of them have never been used but</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Maddington-street, Lisson-grove. In the beginning of last week, I wrote a letter to Mr. Farrar, of Great Russell-street, Covent-garden—I enclosed two half-sovereigns in a bit of brown paper, and put them into the letter with a bill of sixteen shillings, for two dresses, which I had bought of Mr. Farrar, which the two half-sovereigns were to pay—I sealed it up, and put it into my pocket on Friday night, and on Saturday morning I wrote another letter, and enclosed the former one in that, so that the money was in two enclosures—U sealed it with my initials—the prisoner came to my house on Saturday, with a friend of hers—I had made dresses for her—I said I had a letter to send; and as I was confined for time, would she post it for me down the road—she said she would—I told her there was money in it—this is the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Feltham, On the 15th of October, I left home to go to Kingston, about nine o'clock in the morning—I had these notes and cash in a bag, in my pocket, and got into a cart, which the prisoner Newman was driving—we got to Coxen's beer shop—I saw Hatch there, and Mr. Coxen, and Newman—I sat down to drink till about three o'clock in the afternoon, with the prisoners—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for drink, out of my bag, and put the bag into my left-hand breeches pocket again—I was sitting on the settle—I stopped there till about three o'clock, as Coxen owed me a sovereign—there were several sitting on the same set<lb/>tle, and it was thrown over for the purpose, as I suppose, of taking my money—Newman was on the settle—Coxen and Hatch stood behind—I got up again—I kept my hand in my pocket all the time, and my money</p>

               <p>was safe—directly I could recover myself, I went out to the privacy—I had had a little beer, but I knew what I was doing—when I bad been out fire or ten minutes, Newman and Hatche followed me—Hatch came close to me, hustled me, and took the money out of my pocket—I asked him what he had got out—Newman directly said to me, "Have you got the blunt all right, old boy?" I said, "No, you have got it"—Hatch was there—as soon as Newman spoke, Hatch went in at the back door, to Mr. Coken's—New<lb/>man and I went in at the front—I told them in the room that they had taken my money—it was pretty full—I said Newman and Hatch had they were all searched in the room, and no money found—they could not have got away, for Coxen stood at one door, and Thomas Benn at another—this was a little after three o'clock—I have known Newman ten or twelve years, and Hatch, I believe, worked for Mr. Coxen.</p>

The prisoner Easton, was in my employ as a journeyman, for two years, and worked for me once before—I did not know of this loss—I found some lead at the station-house—one of the picecs I can identify as mine, from its peculiar shape and the manner of its being cut—Easton had no right to sell lead—it was</p>

               <p>new lead—a piece had been cut out of it for a particular purpose—on the evening before his apprehension, he was directed to cut out some pieces of lead which were going into the country, and I believe this to be the remnant of a sheet which he had cut.</p>

On Satuday, the 26th of September, I was on duty in Southwark-bridge-road, and saw the pri<lb/>soner Easton carrying a roll of lead on his shoulder—he passed me, coming in a direction from his master's house; after passing me some distance, he turned into Red-Cross-Street, and there I lost sight of him—it was at seven o'clock in morining—I did not see him any more till I came to the pri<lb/>soner Anderson's shop, which is a marine-store-shop, in Red-cross-street—I there saw Anderson handing the roll of lead out of a scale, to a boy who was carrying it into his back permises—it appeared the same roll that Easton had been carrying—the boy carried it into a back shed at Anderson's—I could not tell whether he spoke to the boy, for Easton was turning road to come out of the shop—I did not see any lead in Anderson's front shop—I asked Easton, Just against the door, what he had done with the lead—he said it was all right, he had only left it there—he had come out without any nails, and was going back to fetch them—I asked who he worked for—he said, for Mr. Howe, of Southwark-bridge-road—Anderson was on the other side of the counter—I said, "Anderson, bring that lead forward"—he said, "I know nothing about it, it was only left here"—I took themn both to the station-house—I asked Anderson how it came in the seale—he said that Easton put it in by accident, when he brought it into the shop—I did not then notice whether there were any weights in the scale—I took them both to the station-house, and returned—the lead was weighed at the sta<lb/>tion-house,</p>

I was at tea on the afternoon in question, and saw the prisoner—I had seen him frequently before that—on the 15th of September, about a quar<lb/>ter to five o'clock, I saw him knock at the prosecutor's door, and wait four or five minutes, then open the door himself, and go in—he opened it with the handle or latch; nobody let him in—it was the surgery door—the street door is always open—the surgery door is on the left of the street door—I watched, and saw the door open leading from the surgery into ano<lb/>ther room, but could not see that he opened that himself—he came out in seven or eight minutes; and when he got outside the gate, he put his hand to his trowsers pocket, and pulled it up again, as if he was looking at something in his hand—he put it in again, and walked a short distance, and called at a shop to know if they wanted any baskets, which he had, selling—he then walked briskly away, and then ran—I sent a message over to Mr. Gill by my sister—I must have seen if any other person went into the surgery while he was there—I could see into it from my window—the door between the surgery and the other room was closed before he went in; and I saw it open while he was in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On the 19th of September I went to New-street, New-cut, Lambeth<lb/>Duke, Hall, and Ashton were with me—I arrived a little before four o'clock in the afternoon, and observed a female knocking at the door of No. 1—the door was opened by Carman—I rushed into the passage and was collared by Carman, who screamed out violently—Duke followed me in immediately—I released myself from Carman and went up staris, and in going up I had occasion to pass by the back parlour door—I observed the prisoner Jenkins called Thomas Field in the back parlour in his shirt sleeves, and at the top of the staris was Sophia Jenkins, who had nothing on but her shift—she said, "My God, what is the matter?"—she went into the bacje room first floor, on to a bed which was lying on the floor, and wrapped a blanket round her—I went into the front room, first floor, and seeing no one there, I ran down stairs, hearing a noise in the back yard—I met Ashton as I was com<lb/>ing down the stairs, and we both ran into the yard together—I found Car<lb/>man in the yard then, and nobody else—I saw two crown pieces lying on the stones in the yard, and two in the water-tub—I requested Ashton to pick them up, which he did, and in a small drain, near the water-butt, having a little clear water in it, I observed through the water a crown-pieco—I put my arm down the drain and took it up—this is it—I then went into the back parlour, and found Hall and Duke and the two male prisoners, (Field and the boy Jenkins)—on a chair in the room, I found a small file containing white metal in the teeth, also a paper band with a small portion of plaster of Paris on it—Duke in my presence proceeded to search the room, and while he was doing so, the boy F.T. Jenkins was very violent, screaming out "Murder!" dreadfully—Field was standing in one cor<lb/>ner of the room with his hancuffs on him—while Duke was searching the female prisoner, Sophia Jenkins put her hand in through the window, which was open, and seized hold of something which Duke had laid down on the chair—Duke laid hold of her hand and endeavoured to get it from her, but did not succeed—at that moment Field sprang from the corner at which he was standing, and seized at Duke with the handcuffs on—that prevented Duke from getting hold of what Sophia Jenkins had—I laid hold of Field by his hand and pulled him back, and afterwards took away Field and the boy Jenkins in a coach which I had waiting.</p>

I went on the 19th of September, in company with Duke, Hall, and Reynolds, to No.1, New Cut, Lambeth—I arrived there about a quarter to four o'clock—I saw the door of the house opened—Reynolds went in first—Duke and I pushed in together and Reynolds was in the passage with Carman—I pushed by him, and saw a man, with his coat off, endevouring to get over the wall in the yard—that was Field—I heard something like money falling—there was nobody else in the yard—Duke and I prevented his getting over the wall I—afterwards looked about the yard, and found two crown-pieces lying on the pavement in the yard, and these two crown-pieces were in the water-butt, close to where Field was endeavouring to get over the wall—I saw Reynolds take a crown-piece out of the drain—I afterwards looked over the wall, being certain there was more money, I got over the wall, and found this bag with coin it it, and some coins spread about the yard—I collected them all into the bag—there were 49 shillings, 10 hals-crowns and 2 crown-pieces, one of them unfinished—as I was taking the money up, I heard a great noise next door, and was desired to come and I ran round the adjoining house into No. 1, to assist the officers—I went into the back parlour, and Field was given into my custody—Hall and I took him in a coach—Hall brought the boy Jenkins to the coach, and we took them both to Clerkenwell station-house—a man named Cooper went into the passage of No.1 with us—he staid there for a short time—when we were in the coach with Field the boy was crying and Field said, "Be a good boy and be quiet"—I said, "Is he your boy?"—he said "I shall answer no questions"—I said he need not without h e liked—about a minute after<lb/>wards, without saying amy more, he said, "No, it is not my boy' I dare say you know that, from where you got your information"—I observed Field's left hand was very black in the coach as if he had been working at the fire, and he kept rubbing it on his trowsers—I said "You are taking a great deal of pains to get that stuff off your hands"—he said "What stuff? I don't know what you mean."</p>

"They have sent me from Redcross-street (where Messrs. Taylor's other firm is,) for two bags of glue, which I am to take to Redcross-street, and then I will return, and take your goods out "—he went and took the two bags of glue, and took them away in Messrs. Taylor's cart—I saw him put them in, and put up the tail-board and drive away—when the prisoner was taken, he said it was true he took the glue, that he drove his cart under the arch of South<lb/>wark-bridge, while he went to get a pint of porter, and when he came back the tail-board was down, and the glye was gone; but who took it, or where it went, he did not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the medical profession, and live at No.8, Grosvenor-street, Camberwell. On Saturday, the 15th of August, I came up from Dudley, beyond Birmingham, by the "Tally Ho" Birmingham coach—I arrived soon after seven o'clock in the evening—we stopped at the Bull and Mouth; but I lost my property in Manor-place, Walworth, at No. 10—I called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the Bull and Mouth, to go there—I was lodging there—at the time I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> I had a carpet bag, a travelling cloak, and a large paper parcel, and my cash-box—my cash was in my box, locked, and covered with paper, with my own name on it—they were put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not take particular notice of the driver, it was getting rather dusk—I believe the prisoner was the man—I drove to No. 10, Manor-place—I there got out—I believe the prisoner handed me some of my parcels out, and I partly took them out myself—when every thing was out, I paid him, and he drove away immediately—he flogged his horse and went off very quickly—there was no space of time, scarcely, between the time I paid him and the time he drove off—I missed the box immediately—it contained the property stated—I mentioned to the landlady that I had left the box, and must go after it, and see about it—I went, but he was too far gone, I went to the Elephant and Castle, and took a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and pursued to the stand which I took him from—I knew the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> before I went after it—I found the same <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> but not the same driver; he was gone—the box contained the property, besides some loose papers of no value—I cannot tell when the prisoner was taken, but he was taken in Westminster, by the police—I have never seen a shilling of the property.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, the 10th of October, I took out a basket, containing some tea and other goods—I called at a beer-shop in the Walworth-road, and left my basket at the door while I went in to drink—when I came out the prisoner was pointed out—he had this pound of tea which had been in my basket—I can swear to it, an it has the bill and recipt of all the goods tucked under the string.</p>
