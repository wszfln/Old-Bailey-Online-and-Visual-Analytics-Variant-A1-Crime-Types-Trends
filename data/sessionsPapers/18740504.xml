I was in Cheapside about 7.45 on the 27th February—I was called to King Street by the first witness—I saw a barrow in Lawrence Lane tipped up—I saw a man at the back of the truck and the woman was assisting him in lifting it up—I said to the woman "I shall take you into custody for stealing those books"—the first witness said the books belonged to his employer and I sent for Mr. Baggs and he came and charged them—at the station the woman said that George Young the prisoner who was tried last session was her husband—he said he was not she then said she had nothing to do with it whatever.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She came to me on the 22nd January—Mr. Tanner took the rooms, and he stayed there with her, on and off, while she was there—I did not see any one there named Bradbury—I could not say exactly how shortly before the 18th February Tanner had been there, a week or ten days perhaps, or more—I don't think she had a letter that morning—we have no post at night.</p>

               <p>about noon, I was called to Mr. Lawrie's place of business, at 10, Charles Street—I found Stone waiting there, and from what he said I gave him this envelope, let him go, and followed him—he went to the Pall Mall Res<lb/>taurant—I waited for a short time, and the female prisoner came in, and Stone walked to her and gave her the envelope—I went to her and show<lb/>ing her the cheque, I asked her if she had sent it down to Mr. Lawrie's—she said "Yes"—I asked her where she got it from—she said that Colonel Eveleigh gave it to her—I said "Why it is not a man's handwriting"—she said "No, I wrote the body of the cheque and Colonel Eveleigh signed it"—I asked her where he signed it and she said "At Victoria Street"—that being the address of Colonel Eveleigh—I took her there—she had described Colonel Eveleigh as a tall man with black whiskers and moustache—I took her to 109, Victoria Street, and when she saw Colonel Eveleigh she said as not the gentleman who gave her the cheque—I asked her about the cheque for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said it appeared to be in the same handwriting—she said "Oh, I had that money, and cashed the notes at the Bank of England "—she said she had been to Paris with a friend, and had spent the money—she gave me an address at 101, Camberwell Road—she told me she met a gentleman who said he was Colonel Eveleigh at Piccadilly Circus, and he took her to 109, Victoria Street, and she pointed out the room where he had taken her and signed the cheque—the room she pointed out was opposite Colonel Eveleigh's office—she did not say how long she remained with him—when the charge was taken, she said she was a single woman.</p>

I am a fishmonger, at 5, Ship Tavern Passage, in the City—the prisoner has been my foreman about ten years, and he was about twenty years in the service of my father—I trusted him with buying and selling fish—if he received money it was his duty to put it on the desk and account for it when I came down at 6 o'clock in the evening—I am in very bad health—I generally attend to business from 9 o'clock till 1, and from 5 o'clock till about 7 in the evening—the prisoner bought the fish in the morning and I paid him for it afterwards—he had lent me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some<lb/>time before—I had paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I owe him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—before the 10th of April I consulted Mr. Crook, my solicitor, and on that day I left the shop from 5 to 6 o'clock—I left the prisoner 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a drawer for change—if he sold fish while I was away, it was his duty to put the money on the desk and to account to me for the fish that had been sold—I knew that the clerks and the police officer were about to buy fish at my shop—I returned to the shop at 6 o'clock, and there was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the desk—4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for fish sold in the morning, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was also on the desk—Mr. Crook came about 7.45 as the prisoner was about to leave, and Mr. Crook asked him to come upstairs—I can't recollect what was said, of course Mr. Crook made allusions to the fish that was sold, but I can't say for certain what he said—the prisoner asked me to have mercy on him, and that he was guilty—he said that in the presence of Mr. Crook—the prisoner said that was all the fish he had sold to the value of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was on the desk—I don't think he said anything about the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have no recollection of it.</p>

               <p>for most of the fish that was in the shop for sale that day—we ought to do a good business in the evening, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I had been in the shop myself up to about 1 o'clock that day—I left about 1.30 for dinner, and I came back about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and I stopped about half an hour—I knew pretty well what fish was in the shop—the soles were on the slab for sale when I went away—I did not go round to see Mr. Crook when I left that afternoon—my wife did—I had made an arrangement about marking the money with Mr. Crook, and it was in consequence of that arrangement that the two clerks and the superannuated policeman went and bought fish—the prisoner was left by himself, between 5 and 6 o'clock, and that is very often the time when people come and get fish who are going away by the train—it was my suggestion that Mr. Crook should call the prisoner up.</p>

I was consulted by Mr. Bateman about this supposed embezzlement, and it was by instructions that my clerks went and bought fish, and from information I received I afterwards went to Mr. Bateman's shop, and as the prisoner was about leaving I requested him to go upstairs into a private room—Mr. Bateman came too—I asked the prisoner what money he had taken for fish sold between 3 and 6 o'clock—he replied that he had taken 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in ready money, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a parcel of fish sold in the morning—I then told him he must have made some mistake and that he had taken more money—he replied that he had not done so—I then said "Did you not receive 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for 2 lbs. of salmon"—after some little hesi<lb/>tation he said he had—he denied having received anything else and said he must by some mistake have put the money into his own pocket—I told him we knew he had sold other fish, and he said he had not—I said that we must call in a police-constable and give him into custody—he said "I beg you won't do so on account of my wife and family"—I said the fish had been bought and paid for with marked money—he replied he was sure it could not have been so, that he had received no more money than he had stated, and he had offered to turn out the money in his pocket—he did so, and Mrs. Bateman, who was then present pointed out the two half-crowns and two shilling piece as being marked money—a constable was fetched and he was given into custody and money was given to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am tune-keeper to Messrs. Siemens Brothers, tele<lb/>graph engineers, of Charlton, employing 3,000 men—the prisoner was an assistant time-keeper in my office—it was his duty to assist me in booking the workmen's time in or out—when a man is engaged he is furnished with a brass ticket with a number on it, and when he comes to work, his duty is to deposit that ticket in a box kept at the gate—6 o'clock is the usual time for the men to come to work, and these brass tickets are collected at a little after 6 o'clock and hung on hooks corresponding with their numbers, after depositing them on a table and booking them—the men take away the tickets when they go to their meals, and when they go home at night—the same course exactly is repeated when they return from meals—when a man leaves the employment his duty is to deliver his brass ticket into my office—if lost, it is paid for—when given up it would serve for another man who subsequently came into the employment—ticket No. 549 belonged to a man named Daniels, who left the factory on 31st January, 1874—I am looking at the memorandum in the writing of Foster, my assistant, who is here; this other book is in my writing, and they were both kept under my inspection—the name of "Kennington" appears first on 11th February, 1874, and it is in the prisoner's writing—ticket 579 belonged to Marshall, who was discharged on 25th February, and it is entered to "Thomas" on the same day in the prisoner's writing—ticket 589 belonged to Etherington who left on 12th December, 1873, and the name of "Bailey" is entered by the prisoner on 19th February—I am looking at my time book which is kept by me—Hunt, who held ticket 2,227. was to have been transferred from the wire to the cable department, but he was not transferred—he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187405040030"/>
               <p>supposed to have been transferred on 18th February, and the writing is the boy Butcher's, but the time is put in by the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paper upon which his name was originally entered, it is in one of the clerk's writing—ticket 2,300 is first entered on 18th February, 1874, that belonged to no one; it is in the prisoner's writing, and the name of Arm<lb/>strong is entered—ticket 2,397 belonged to a man named Crew, who was placed on the sick list on 21st February, and yet his name continues on till the week ending 4th March—this book is kept under my inspection; my night relieving man sees that it is right—I mark them and fill in the time, and leave the book there at night—I do not keep the book entirely but I and my assistants do—I correct it, and my night assistant gives me. a list in the morning, if there is any error—ticket 285 belonged to a man named Pointer, who was discharged on 3rd February, and on 6th February it is entered by the prisoner to a man named Wright—ticket 2,060 belonged to a man named Owen, who was discharged on 28th January, and the name of Johnson appears to that number in the prisoner's writing on 4th Febru<lb/>ary—all those numbers appear carried on with time and rate attached up to the week ending 11th March—after they are once entered they are carried on by the boy—when once the brass ticket appears upon the book, anyone can enter it except the boy—I don't allow him to do it—the pre<lb/>sence of the brass ticket indicates its owner's absence—I hare made enquiries for Kennington, Thomas, Bailey, Johnson, and Wright, but none of them have appeared—the prisoner as assistant time-keeper had access to those brass tickets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been in the employment probably six months—I always believed his parents to be respectable, or he would not have been in our employ—when a man left he would give his ticket up to me or to one of my three assistants, who are not boys—Mr. Claverhouse and Mr. Cook are two of them—one workmen could not work two tickets because there must be another name entered in the book—I am respon<lb/>sible for the book—this is it, and this is a copy giving the explanation of every mark—this is a short way of booking the time—this straight mark means from 6 to 8 o'clock, this "0" means not present, this means "after breakfast," this "after dinner," and this "<hi rend="italic">left</hi> his ticket at home"—the pay-tickets are made up from my book and the men are paid by paper, tickets—if an engine driver cannot <hi rend="italic">get</hi> away, he is allowed to send another person for him—this figuring against the name of Wright, No. "285" on 2nd March is in Mr. Claverhouse's writing on Monday and Tuesday, but it is not his marking—the figures correspond with the marks—these figures against Wright's name on 6th March are mine—on March 12th the lines are put down by the prisoner, but there is no time to them as that was the day he was taken—from the time-keeper's rough diary the names and dates are entered into another book, which is kept by me or my assistant—this "285 Wright" on this page is in Beales' writing—that is copied from my rough book which I am answerable for—this pay-ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) "285 Wright" is in the prisoner's writing, but the date I believe is Butcher's—the figures in the prisoner's writing are copied from my writing in the rough book—I am the person responsible chiefly for the time being pro<lb/>perly kept—the first entry of Crew's name after he was placed in the sick-list is in Butcher's writing, but the time is not—the first two days time is in my figures—the prisoner may have been in the employ a little longer than six months, but he came the last <hi rend="italic">time</hi> the day after Christmas Day—</p>

               <p>these brass-tickets are left in the office where my assistants can get them—I do not always check the pay-tickets with the books as we have been so busy—we had about 1,500 hands at the time the prisoner was there, and 1,300 in my particular office—the time-keepers office is open at all hours of the day and night—a night relief takes my place at night—they work day and night—I do not know of persons from the gutta percha side coming to my office and helping to book the men—not even on Sunday evenings—I will undertake to swear that it has not occurred on Sunday evening—there are three time-keepers on the premises and their assistants—I have some<lb/>times found men in the office with Claverhouse, and spoken about it in the morning—ticket 2,227 was got ready for Hunt, but it was not transferred to him—the entry is in Butcher's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The foundation of the system is the working of the brass-tickets, and if a ticket is being honestly or dishonestly worked the same entry would be made by me or any assistants, and the hieroglyphics in the time-sheet would go on on the assumption of the ticket being used belonging honestly to somebody—Claverhouse would not work with the prisoner—he said that people passed by him and said that he was a thief—it is the foreman's duty to fix the rate of a workman's wages when he enters the service, that ought to be reported to me as 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or whatever it was per hour—the rate per hour of the fictitious workmen is in the prisoner's writing—if they were real workmen the rate per hour ought to have been reported to me or to my assistant—this is the book in which he would enter and rate the workmen—this signature "H. W. W. Beale," is the prisoner's writing.</p>

A little before 1 o'clock on the morning in question, I was going along Green Street, and saw Davis stand<lb/>ing at the door of No. 2, as I passed by he drew back into the room—two or three doors further on I saw Gray and Connolly together at the door of another house—as I passed Gray-spoke to me, and said "It is a fine night"—I said "Yes, a very fine night"—at that instant he said to Connolly I shall go in—at that time two constables came along, Connolly went in and shut the door, Davis did the same—in consequence of something the con<lb/>stables said 129 M came round the corner with Earl—they saw Gray standing in the doorway and went over to him—Earl said "That is one of the men"—I said "If that is one I think I know where the other two are"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 194, Blackfriars Road—I was called in to attend the deceased, at 40, Hatfield Street, on 8th August, virtually it was on the 7th, it was half-an-hour after midnight—he was in bed, partly unconscious, very restless, scarcely able to answer any questions—I concluded that he was suffering from inflammation of the brain, we treated him for that—I saw him again next day in company with Dr. Payne,. a physician—he was then very much worse—he died on Thursday, the 9th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were no marks of external injury—the whole of the organs of the body were perfectly healthy, he did not die from any disease of the organs—on removing the scalp, we found a large quantity of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> effused between the membranes of the brain, and the brain itself, quite sufficient to account for the death—a severe fall on a hard substance would produce the indications I saw—there was no injury to the, skull itself—it was the shock and the inflammation it excited—there was no depression of the bone, no fracture of the skull, merely a violent inflammation set up in the membranes covering the brain—a blow would cause some depression at the moment, and that would cause the inflammation.</p>

I believe he has, robbed a man up in York Street"—the prisoner said nothing to that—we took him back to the prosecutor who identified him and charged him with stealing his money—we took him to the station—he was searched, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found upon him—I afterwards went over the ground at 4 o'clock in the morning in company of two other constables, and I found this purse there in the condition in which it is now—this part of it I found first lying about thirty yards from the London Road, on the right hand side of the street, in the gutter—the other part of it was very near the place where I first got hold of him, in London Street.</p>

I keep the Spread Eagle, Pratt Street, Lambeth—on; the night of 20th April, about 10.30, Newton came in for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco and tendered a bad shilling in payment—I tried to break it at once—he asked me not to break it as he had just taken it, and he would get it changed if I did not break it—I gave it him back and he gave back the tobacco and left—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same shilling—I saw him; at the police-station the same night a little after 11 o'clock.</p>

On the night of 20th April, just before 11 o'clock, I was in the Westminster Road—a woman called my attention to the prisoners, who were together on the opposite side of the road—it was about a quarter of a mile from the Spread Eagle—I saw New<lb/>ton and Lloyd looking into the Dover Castle public-house, and Mead crossed on towards the opposite side of the way and halted in the middle of the road—he then went towards the Crown and Cushion and waited for a second, the others crossed the road and joined him, and they all three went into the Crown and Cushion—I called two other constables, and we went in and took them all in custody—I found on Newton a good sixpence and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper;—he said, he wished he had not met the others.</p>
