I turned round, and struck a man's arm on my watch - the watch dropped, the chain broke, I snatched at the watch to get it off the ground - the prisoner and the others snatched at it also. I can swear he was one of them - he snatched it off the ground. I immediately caught hold of him, and called out for help - he was too strong for me, got off before any one came, and ran up a narrow street, down Sycamore-street, into Old-street, across Goswell-street, into Wilderness-row, where he was stopped. I never lost sight of him from the time he got from me till he was taken by Fisher. Next morning, about five o'clock, I went to the Charterhouse-gardens, with Hone and Fisher, and found the watch in the gardens, the Wilderness-row side. I had seen the prisoner opposite that place.

On Friday morning, the 16th of June, I was with Izard, at Hornsey - I heard somebody coming, got behind a tree, and saw two men, one had a bag, and the other was walking about two yards before him. I came from the tree, and got in front of them - I saw the prisoner rather wished to make his escape, and laid hold of him. I asked them two or three times what they had got there, and both said</p>
               <p>"Nothing." I called to Izard to be sure and hold the other, but he threw the bag away and we could not catch him. I searched the prisoner, and found two knives in his pocket, which I produce; one of them was all over fat and blood. I found a small whetstone on him, and a bag under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the bag which the man left behind - A. A sheep. I asked the prisoner about the sheep, he said he found it lying by the road-side, about three hundred yards from where we took him. I took him to the cage with the sheep; when we got there I saw his hat was greasy, I took it off, and found about four pounds of fat inside it - a handkerchief was between it and his head - it appeared to be the fat of a sheep. He said his name was

            . I am a patrol. I was with Davenport, we met the prisoner and another man, who threw down the sheep, and ran away; I pursued, but lost him. I returned, and took the carcase of the sheep to Mr. Booth's, which is about fifty or a hundred yards from where we stopped them. I afterwards found the skin and head of the sheep in Mr. Booth's ground, about three hundred yards from where we stopped the prisoner. It was very warm, as if it had just been killed - in fact it smoked when we took it to Mr. Booth's. The skin was marked with a B. The entrails laid close by it, the fat had been taken from them - they were both very warm. I produce the skin. I believe it was a wether sheep.</p>

On this morning I went into the shop about a quarter after six o'clock, the prisoner was then standing by the side of the prosecutrix's box; he appeared flurried, and went out directly. I asked him where he was going - he said into the yard, but I heard him go out at the street-door; he did not return.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had quarrelled about not coming sooner to work, and went this morning at half-past six o'clock. I told them I was working for 1 s. less than others, and should suit myself as soon as I could. I was rather poorly that day, and went to take a walk. I bought some oranges, and have been selling them about Spitalfields ever since. The lady said she had been robbed, that she did not know it was me, but she would take me up for my d - d impudence, and would have me hung or transported.</p>

I cannot say when I put them there - I had not seen them for a fortnight - the drawer was always locked - I found it still locked. The notes were in a canvas bag - four were still left; they were all marked with a B in the corner, and a cross in the middle of the front. The prisoner lived in my house at the time. I let her a bed at 1 s. a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How old are you - A. Seventy-four; the prisoner lived three times at my house; she is a distant relation of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not often visit her at her brother's house, at Hackney - A. No; I went after my money; I never went there to have any kind of intimacy with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How well you understand me; did you not go to see her, and request her to come back to your house - A. No; I never took liberties with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you she was going to leave you, and you gathered some gooseberries for her to take with her - A. Yes. When she was taken before the Magistrate the first time he discharged her; I did not tell him there was but 18 l. in the bag. I will not say I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to her,</p>
               <p>"There is only you and me in the house, you may as well make one bed as two" - A. Yes, I did say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Jeffries speak to you about taking liberties with the girl in her presence - A. She did not. She was first taken up on Saturday, and again on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate on Saturday that you had found one of the notes at Mrs. Mardon's, which was one of those the prisoner stole - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not afterwards tell the Magistrate that it was not one of the notes - A. It was dark then, and they would not let me take it to the light; it was daylight, but not light enough in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not swear before the Magistrate, that you believed it was not one of the notes - A. I might have said so.</p>

On the 26th of May, about four four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and presented<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280007"/>a petition for relief, I said I could give her nothing, and desired her to go. She stopped a few minutes, and then walked towards the door. She had come 12 or 14 yards into the warehouse - some pieces of Aberdeen dowlas were standing on their ends in the warehouse; they generally run about sixty yards; the lowest price we can buy them for is 3 l. a piece. She passed them as she came in and as she went out. I saw her stoop - (the dowlas is twenty-seven inches high) - I then followed her to the door. I saw her come from the cloth, which was between the two doors. I will not swear it, but I have every reason to believe it was not there when she came in - it-was not the proper place for it. She then sat herself down on the step of the outer door, before the piece of cloth. She stopped a minute or two, then looked round, took up the cloth, threw her handkerchief or apron over it, and then walked down the street with it; I followed and brought her back with it under her arm. I knew it to be my masters' property - it has a private mark on it in my own hand-writing; it cost above 3 l. I sent for a constable, who took her in charge. She appeared quite sober, and told me she had had nothing to eat or drink.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Saviour's. On the 7th of June I was with Dean in the middle of High-street, Borough, and saw a cart coming towards St. Margaret's-hill, it stopped near Union-street - Purkis was walking on the other side, nearly facing Union-street; he was dressed in a coarse frock and apron. When the cart stopped he went and put in a bag and a bundle which he had under his left arm. He got into the cart, and Small, who was the driver, drove on. They covered the bag over with straw. They stopped at a gin-shop near St. Thomas's Hospital, Small got out and went in there, Purkis remained in the cart. We kept sight of the cart - it went over London Bridge, and stopped by the church at the corner of Lower Thames-street, City; Purkis then got out, and immediately went down Lower Thames-street, towards the prosecutors'; Small drove the cart along Upper Thames-street, and to very nearly opposite Cripplegate Church. He stopped by a ruinous place, and left the cart there for about a quarter of an hour; he went to Ship-yard, then returned, let down the tail-board of the cart, took the straw off the bag, and took the bag out. I followed him to Ship-yard again, and entered the yard with him. He went into a house on the left-hand side. I went into the passage, and asked him what he had got? I saw him move his arm as if he threw something away, and heard it fall on the ground. A person ran up stairs, I followed, leaving Small in charge. I found it was a woman who ran up, I found nothing on her. I heard Dean and Small scuffling together and went down; he said Dean should not hold him, I secured him. I saw Dean take the bag from under the table, it contained a loaf of sugar and a bundle of currants, which the prosecutors claimed. I put him in the cart, and drove him to Giltspur-street Compter. I drove the cart over to a Mr. Story's, whose name was on it, and then went to a house in a yard in High-street, Borough, where I understood he lodged. In a cupboard on the first-floor landing-place I found a handkerchief with several pieces of loaf sugar in it, also a pair of small scales, which had currants sticking to them. I then went and took Purkis at his masters', and asked him if he was not the man who went over London Bridge as I drove the cart back? he said No, he had not been away from the premises. I took him to the Compter, and found a bag under his frock, which had currants sticking to the inside of it, and raw sugar at the bottom, as if it had contained some. On pulling up his frock I found a cord fastened round his waist, also a cord under his breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I believe he was ruptured, and so you found the cord round his waist - A. I do not know.</p>

When he ran up after the woman Small attempted to pass me, I said he should not till I knew whether things were right or not.

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. I know the sugar to belong to them. Purkis was not in the habit of buying sugar - I know nothing of Small. I sleep in the house. Purkis was not sent out with anything that day, and had no business out. He ought to be at the warehouse at six o'clock. I saw the bag found on him, it had both raw sugar and currants in it. The handkerchief found in a yard in the Borough I am certain is Purkis's - he used to bring his victuals in it.</p>
               <p>PURKIS'S Defence. I was not out of the premises except to fetch a newspaper from Cornhill - the handkerchief is not mine. I had the things given to me in the Borough; the man told me to take them to Ship-yard.</p>
               <p>SMALL'S Defence. I met this man, who told me a person had given him the things to take to Ship-yard, and the person would be there to pay. He told me to leave them there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of May I searched the prisoner's house, No. 14, Barrett's-court, Wigmore-street - she came in while we were there; I asked her if the premises were her's? she said Yes. Before she came home I had searched the first floor, and found twenty-eight pair of sheets with the hospital mark on them, three pair of blankets, a piece of sheeting, a quantity of towelling, and a great many other things - I found in all as much as a small cart would hold. I attended her examination, she said part of the things were given to her by a sister in the hospital, who was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was her declaration made as to part or all the property - A. To that which was marked. She meant a sister of the hospital. I found a great many things with the marks cut out.</p>

               <p>Q. While she was there, had you reason to complain to her of losing property - A. Yes, principally sheeting; she said the patients must have taken them away. The property produced belongs to the hospital; some of it has been marked within the last two years. We never sell old linen, it is used for bandages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. May not linen get out of the hospital by patients not restoring it - A. I never knew it. We never allow it to servants as perquisites.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Sams. The money was missed on Wednesday. I did not observe the desk till Thursday evening, when Mr. Sams was out. I locked the desk, and lifted up the flap afterwards. I found the asp had been wrenched from the flap, and stuck in again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Sometime ago I broke a window - my master said if I broke another I should be turned away. I had the misfortune to break another; the woman who cleans the shop said I had better take care of my clothes, as the last boy was turned away without clothes or wages. Thinking I should be turned out destitute, I determined to take what I thought due to me, which I thought was two 1 l. notes, but as I could not read I took two 10 l. notes. When they were missed, and I found they were 10 l. notes, I was afraid to acknowledge it. My former master, Colonel 
               <persName id="t18200628-16-person204">Nicholls</persName>
            , questioned me about it, and I told him the truth. According to the ideas in which I had been brought up I thought I might take a compensation for my services, but I now know that I have done wrong. I humbly trust that when a British Jury considers that I have not had a Christian education, they will recommend me to the mercy of my King, for whom my fathers have often fought against the American States.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMS re-examined. When he came to me I clothed him, but if he had asked for money I should have given him some. I believe a woman in my service may have misled him.</p>

            . I am housekeeper to Draper. He went up the yard between nine and ten o'clock; I was in the wash-house, turned my head, and saw a man reaching the watch from the mantle-piece - it was the prisoner I am certain - I had seen him before, he had come into the shop and asked the price of charcoal. On seeing him take the watch I called out,</p>
               <p>"Thomas, the man is taking your watch!" He turned round, looked me in the face, and then walked out and turned to the left. I saw him lift the watch off the shelf.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH O'BRIEN. I am a hair-dresser, my house is nearly opposite Draper's, about four doors lower down. On the 28th of May I was in my parlour between nine and ten o'clock, my wife said</p>
               <p>"There is somebody in the shop!" I went in and there saw the prisoner, I drew a chair for him, thinking he wanted something in my way. He sat down, then jumped up, asked me if I had got any paper, and said he wanted to go backwards. I gave him some paper, he went towards the front door instead of going backwards; I told him that was not the way, and shewed him the way backwards. He said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind now." He went out, and ran up the street past the prosecutor's house again. I thought he seemed confused, which made me go to the door to see which way he went; he turned the corner of Little Smith-street - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not Waller accuse another man of it - A. She did accuse a person of it on Sunday, and said he was the man who took the watch - he was dressed like the prisoner. I said he was not the man who came into my shop.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH O'BRIEN re-examined. I did not see her when she first stopped the man; the people said she had accused him, but I heard her say nothing. When she was at Queen-square, she said,</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Saturday, the 28th of May, I received information of this robbery; Draper and O'Brien described the prisoner, but I could not find him. On the Monday I found him at a house in Milbank-street, at Mrs. Trotter's, up one pair of stairs, dressing himself. Under the pillow of the bed on which he lay I found a dark lanthorn and a picklock key - his wife was in the room. I found eleven skeleton keys in her pocket, which he afterwards admitted that he gave her. On the chimney-piece I found a phosphorus-box and matches; he said he knew nothing about the watch. Next day I found another skeleton key in the pocket of a black coat in his room, which I had not searched before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not out of the house that day, and as to the keys I took a shed for my business, and when I cleaned it out I found them - they were not in my wife's pocket.</p>

I returned a little before twelve, and found the front door locked and the back door shut, as I had left them; I missed a sheet off the clothes-horse, opened the back door, went into the yard, and found a trunk there which I had left up stairs at the head of the bed - it was broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment, except the shirt, taken out - it was emptied; a shawl, two cloaks, a shift, and a piece of cotton, were quite gone, the rest were left on the ledge of the wall; a red cloth shawl was also taken off a basket by the back door. In less than an hour I found some of them at the pawnbroker's. No door or window was left open. I suppose they must have got over the wall, and opened the back door, which I am certain was latched.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of May I was on duty between one and two o'clock in the morning, sitting by the side of my box, in White Lion-street, a watchman nearly opposite called to me, and said he heard a noise; I went over and saw a person going down the street, and heard a rumbling noise inside the prosecutor's door, which was ajar - I went in, and by the light of my lanthorn found two bundles in the passage. I immediately sprung my rattle, and gave the bundles to the watchman; seeing the prisoner run up stairs, I ran up after him, and just within the door of the first floor I found him, and took him to the watch-house - the other watchman followed with the bundle. I gave him in charge of Furzeman. I saw several articles found on him. He appeared sober.</p>

On the 1st of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came to my shop for some salt and cheese - Glare asked for it - Rosier stood leaning against the counter opposite to where the till was, and Glare stood before him; I was on the other side of the counter, nobody else was there. I turned my back to go to the salt bin - they had the things, and Glare paid for them - it was less than sixpence. A few minutes after they were gone I missed a 5 l. note from the till - nobody had been in after them, and I only had the notes a few minutes before they came in - a person might reach over and open the till, it was exactly opposite to where they stood. I had given change for the note not five minutes before. I had it from Mrs. Barnham's servant. Next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I had both the prisoners taken up; I knew them both before, and saw the note in the possession of Squibb.</p>

I came out about a quarter before six o'clock, the women followed me out, and hustled me in the passage; when I got about five steps from the door my pocket-book was taken - Brown took it out of my pocket. I caught hold of her, a number of men came round and kicked me - I almost got my brains knocked out. Crispin was in the passage; when I came out he caught hold of me and said,</p>
               <p>"Let the woman go, or I will knock your eye out!" - I was obliged to let her go. Crispin kept holding me to stop me from pursuing her.</p>

I left him between two and three o'clock, and as I returned I went into this shop, which I thought was a public-house - I had been with no women. Some women spoke to me in Webb-square, I do not know whether they were the prisoners or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had lost a 20 l. note - A. No. The coffee-shop man stood at the door when I was robbed, and would not assist me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Were you in company with two girls in Wentworth-street - A. No, on my oath I was not. I was perfectly sober. I went to no house in George-yard. I called for a watchman, but could get none.</p>

On the 23d of June, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw a black man on the leads of our skylight, which is just under one of Mr. Jones's windows - there was daylight enough to distinguish him. I saw him take from Mr. Jones's window a coat, a hat, an umbrella, and take them towards Messrs. Blackenhaghens' house - I did not see him go into the house. I made no alarm at the time, but told my master when I came down. The window was open when I saw him take them. I knew the prisoner lived at Messrs.

She asked me for money for gin, I gave her 6 d. and a few halfpence. Immediately she left I missed my money from breeches-pocket. I followed and asked her for my money, she said she had none - the watchman then came up, I gave her in charge, and described the money before they searched her. She said she had no crown piece - she pulled a crown piece from her pocket, and then said it was a bad one.</p>

I sleep in the shop - I got up immediately and called Pim up; when I came down the prisoner asked if Pim was getting up? I was absent about three minutes - I said he was not out of bed yet. He immediately went to the end of the shop where the bombazeen was - I was putting my bed away. I then went to the end of the shop to open it - he asked me how that piece of bombazeen was left out from the rest? this very piece of bombazeen then laid on the counter. I said I could not tell. When he was apprehended I told Pim of it, the bombazeen was then measured, and eight yards and a half were gone.</p>

I am positive he is the man. He laid hold of my watch-ribbon, and immediately drew my watch from me - I felt it go - both my arms were engaged in supporting my brother officer, who was intoxicated. I left him, and seized the prisoner, whom I never lost sight of. He was secured, but the watch was not found on him. I was quite sober.</p>

On the 7th of August, 1818, I was washing in my own room, and saw the prisoner come down the yard - he appeared as if he wished to enter my room - a carriage stood near the door - there is no thoroughfare in the yard; he said,</p>
               <p>"Am I to go through the carriage?" I told him to go round it. In about two minutes I went out, drew some water, about three yards from the door, and on my return I saw him standing at the back of the carriage, covering something over with his coarse apron, which he had taken off. I said nothing to him. He went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280016"/>up the yard, and in a few minutes the landlady of the public-house called to me - I then missed my time-piece off the chimney-piece of the room I was in - it stood there when I went for the water. I went out and met Brumwell.</p>

            . On the 7th of August, 1818, I saw the prisoner outside the Coach and Horses, public-house door, with a little boy; he said to the boy,</p>
               <p>"Stand there, and I will do it myself." He went right through the public-house, and in about three minutes he came through all in a bustle, with the time-piece in his hand; I saw the best part of it, and knew it was a time-piece, the feet were either brass or gold, and it appeared to be a mahogany case. The public-house leads into the yard where the prosecutrix's house is - her door rather faces the public-house back-door; he was wrapping the timepiece up in an old coarse apron. He came very near to me, ran as hard as he could, and turned up White Lion-street. Soon after that I went into the Coach and Horses, the landlady sent and alarmed Mrs. May, who missed her time-piece. He was not apprehended then - I knew him before. I and the constable went three days and three nights after him, but never could take him - we heard of him several times, and described him, but we did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you not apprehend me when you saw me before - A. I was with a man who was going to pay me some money, he had given me the slip twice, and I did not like to leave him. I told several people which way he went, but they took the wrong road. On the 24th of May I saw him at my door in Grosvenor-row - he came to ask the price of a pair of shoes. I told a man in my shop to keep an eye upon him while I fetched May, but immediately as I left the door he walked away.</p>

I told him I was not inclined that way.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go in - A. I went in, but by the appearance of the two men I was alarmed - I had been drinking; he then asked me to send for half a pint of gin - I refused, and said I should go. I got up to go, he came across the room, and gave me a shove into the cellar, the cellar-door was open, but I had not observed it; it was six or seven feet deep, and goes down a ladder - a light appeared at the top. I immediately looked up, and saw the prisoner coming down, I begged of him, for God's sake, to let me out of the place; the light was then taken away, and he came down, put his hands down me, and took 12 s. or 15 s. out of my left-hand pocket. I do not exactly know what I had, but I know there was 12 s., and it was chiefly in half-crowns - he took it as soon as he could come down. I crawled up the ladder, and got out of the house as fast as I could, leaving him in the cellar - the other man sat there, but took no part in it. I do not know who brought the light to the cellar-door. I did not know him before, but am quite positive to him - I was quite sensible. As soon as I got out I went into Gray's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280017"/>Inn-lane, told the watchman, and went back - the prisoner and the other man were still there. I pointed him out as the man who robbed me, and the watchman took him. I did not hear him say anything to it. It was not more than ten minutes after that I took the watchman there. In taking him to the watch-house he made his escape.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The last witness applied to me about twelve o'clock on the night of the robbery; I went with him to a common bawdy house - I knew it to be so. I found the woman who keeps it, a man that cohabits with her, and the prisoner, there. The prosecutor said the prisoner was the man - he said he knew nothing about it. As I took him out, he said he could go without holding - I said I must hold him. On going up Holborn he kept shuffling, and when he got to Hand-court I had a desperate struggle with him - he got from me, ran across Holborn, through Turnstile, into Whetston's-park, and there I took him again. Six half-crowns were found on him.</p>

I went and examined the cellar, I never was in such a place in my life - any man might be murdered there, and nobody know it - it is very dark, and full seven feet deep; there is a ladder in it, with some of the steps broken. A sort of cupboard leads to it.</p>

I continued to pass on, and as I approached, the prisoner, who was nearest to the houses, got on the step between me and the houses, which placed him rather above me. This circumstance drew my attention towards him, and enables me to recollect his person. There was sufficient light from the lamps, I could distinctly see his person and dress. I put my hand on my seals to conceal them, and at that moment he made a rush at me, caught hold of my watch-chain, which was between my watch and my hand, and with great force tore my chain from my watch - at that instant I was violently pushed or knocked down by his companions behind. The the force that was used threw me on the pavement. I let go my seals and fell on the pavement with great force. The seals and chain had been separated from my watch just before, and on my letting go they fell on the pavement. My small-clothes were torn from my fob about six or eight inches down with the violence, and my watch lifted about four inches from my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the chain was separated from your watch, had you the seals in your hand - A. I had. As I fell I drew part of the chain out of the prisoner's hand, and let go myself at the same time - I instantly got up and picked them up. I saw one of his companions, and immediately called Watch! they came round me and threatened me, but I continued to call. The watchman came up, and I told him to take the man I first saw on rising. I turned round to the others, recognized the prisoner, and charged him with being the person who seized my chain - he immediately ran away, but was stopped.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is no proof that the prisoner ever had complete possession of the chain or seals. It is only an attempt to rob, though it is very near being a highway robbery.</p>

            . On the 2d of June, I was residing in Basinghall-street. About four o'clock in the morning I met the prisoners in Covent-garden, and went with Hayes to a house in <placeName id="t18200628-44-crimeloc244">Vine-street, Chandos-street</placeName>

I gave Hayes some silver, and paid one of the others 18 d. for the room. they left the room to get something to drink. I went to bed, and about half past five o'clock the two prisoners and the other woman came in. I am sure they are the women - it was daylight. Hoby and the other took my coat and trowsers, and all went away together with them. I came down stairs as I was, and left the house shortly after. I met Hayes; she had nothing with her, and I did not stop her. I was not perfectly sober, but I knew what I was about. When I returned, I found the rest of my things gone. My coat and trowsers were worth 8 l.</p>

            . On the 1st of June I lived with Mr. Brewer, in Chandos-street. I saw the prisoners with another woman, about five o'clock in the morning, at the corner of Bedfordbury. Hoby had a blue great coat in her apron; they went through May's-buildings. Hayes turned back. I afterwards saw the prosecutor in Vine-street, and told him; he went after them. I saw Hoby after this at the corner of New-street; she still had the bundle in her apron; she saw us and ran away - we lost her; it was a blue coat with a velvet collar.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors. The prisoner was in their employ in February. He supplied the place of his brother, who was ill. He made out sales and bills, and, occasionly, received money. The counting-house is in Mincing-lane. On the 20th of May I applied to Mr. Banks for money, and Millner showed me the bill with the receipt and initials to it; they are the prisoner's hand-writing - it was dated the 14th of February, 1820.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. I believe his parents are very respectable - A. I believe so. He has a twin brother, who is extremely like him. His brother attended in the counting-house, but did not go out, being ill. I have mistaken one for the other myself. The writing is his, and not his brother's.</p>

             re-examined. It was the prisoner's duty to bring the money to me the day he received it. He never brought this sum to me as that sum. The day after it was received, he brought me 3 l. 11 s. 6 d. as received from Mr. Fenwick. On the evening of the 20th of May I went to his lodgings - he came to me outside the door. I told him something unpleasant had occurred, that a sum or sums of money had been received, and they did not appear to be accounted for; and I meant to be candid with him, provided he was candid with me. He immediately said he received one sum only, and that was 3 l. 2 s. 1 d. from Mr. Bankes, and had applied that sum to replace 3 l. 11 s. 6 d. which he had from Fenwick, and lost out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain it was him that said so - A. Yes, it was not his brother. He said he paid me the very money he received from Bankes.</p>

On the 14th of June, at half-past two o'clock, this money was in a till in the bar - I saw it safe a minute before it was missed. The prisoner was a stranger to me, I saw him in the taproom about one o'clock as a customer - the bar fronts the taproom-door - the bar-door is left open in the daytime. While I was walking towards the kitchen I saw the prisoner in the bar - I had left nobody there. I saw him draw the till out, returned, and caught him at the bar-door. I seized his hand, and took two 1 l. notes, a shilling, and three sixpences - I charged him with taking it out of the till. He had left it half open; I had closed it and turned the key. He said nothing. I put him in the taproom and sent for an officer. I examined the till, and found just that sum deficient.</p>

I was walking along Cheapside, out of work, and having a large family, I met a labourer. who took me to the house to set a stove - the prosecutor said he had the mortar and every thing ready. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280021"/>into the kitchen, after having three or four pots of beer, which rather affected me.

               <p>"Why don't you take off your hat?" I told him if he had asked me civilly I would have taken it off. I had my hand on my pocket-book - a person jostled my hat, I released my hand from my pocket-book to put my hat right, and on returning it I missed my pocket-book; the prisoner was then running away, I pursued and caught him. A person came up, struck me with an umbrella, and said the prisoner was not the person, but that my pocket-book was picked up on the spot I had gone from. It was returned to me before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 16th of June I was on duty in the passage of the pit; the prisoner came there just as the crowd were going in. I had seen him once or twice before when the people were going in. I saw him come out, wiping his face with his handkerchief, and walking gently away - he was going out at the entrance from Covent-garden - I stopped him, and said I believed he came there for no good purpose. On searching him I found the watch in his fob, with the ribbon tucked over inside his waistband. I asked him how he came by it? he said he bought it that morning of a young man in Cloth-fair, but he did not know who the young man was. I asked him if he knew the maker's name or the number? he said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he say he said that in order to keep it and get the reward - A. No; at the second examination he said he found it in the pit.</p>

            . I was introduced to the prisoners on the 25th of April; I was employed by the Solicitors of the Bank, and was introduced to the prisoners at the Sun, public-house, at the corner of Brownlow-street, Drury-lane. I saw Marsden there - a person was there whom I knew; he spoke to Marsden after I had been there about ten minutes - that person and Marsden both went out into the passage; I was afterwards called into the passage and saw them there. The person asked me in the hearing of Marsden to lend him 6 s., I did so, he gave it to Marsden, and Marsden gave him a piece of paper folded up, which he gave to me; I put it in my fob, and said to Marsden that I should like to have one myself. I said nothing else, but went out of the passage into the taproom, and was called into the passage about five minutes after by Marsden - I gave Marsden 6 s., and he gave me a 1 l. forged note. I put it into my fob with the other, and then said I should like to have something in a larger way; he said I could have them at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express what you meant by something in a larger way - A. I said I should like to have a 5 l. note, he said I should have one next day, at three o'clock. I asked what price it would be? he said 24 s. I then went away, took the two notes to the Crown tavern, Clerkenwell, and gave them to Foy, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Marsden again - A. On the 27th, at four o'clock in the afternoon, in the taproom of the Sun, public-house, Drury-lane - he said he expected to have seen me in the morning; that he had got a five for me, but he had put it away as I did not come, and asked if I would have it now? I said No, I had not the money to pay for it. He asked me how many ones I would have, and if I would have three? I said I had not money enough, but I would have two. He said,</p>
               <p>"Stay till it is dark and you shall have them?" I staid there till nine o'clock; he went out, and soon afterwards returned - he called me out, we went down Charles-street and Drury-lane, into a back room of the Coach and Horses, public-house - nobody but ourselves were in the room. He asked me if I was ready? I said Yes, and gave him three half-crowns and a crown piece; he gave me two 1 l. notes, desired me to look at them, and asked if they were not fine ones? I said nothing, but doubled them up and put them into my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give him 12 s. 6 d. - A. He had not a 6 d. to give me change, and returned me a half-crown. I went to the bar, got change, and returned him 2 s. I took the notes to the Crown, marked them, and gave them to Foy - (looks at two) - these are them. On Saturday the 29th, I saw him again in the tap-room at the Sun, at seven o'clock in the evening; he had sent a person for me. On my going there, he said he had got a five for me, and said he had sent a person for me. He asked if I would have it; I said, Yes - what price is it: he said 26 s. I told him, he said before I should have them for 24 s.; he said he would see if he could get one at that price, and, if not, how many one's would I have, as I might have as many as I pleased. I said I would have three or four, but I I would rather have a five. He went out, returned in about twenty minutes, and said he had sent a person for a five, and it would not be long before it was there. He said he had sent to Skinner-street, Snowhill, for it. In about ten minutes the prisoner, Smith, came in, he whispered to Marsden, then Marsden turned to me, and said the only five they had was gone, and asked me how many one's I would have; I at first said I would have three, but afterwards said I would take four. Marsden turned to Smith, and whispered to him - Smith then went out; while he was gone a person, who was sitting in our company, asked Marsden what the old man's (Smith's) name was? Marsden said he was called

            , and that he was nearly seventy years of age. Marsden then said to me,</p>

               <p>"You would hardly suppose that he has been transported for fourteen years, and I myself have been cast for death twice, and once transported?" I said,</p>
               <p>"The Devil you have!" He said he had, but he had only served sixteen months of his time at the Bay, but the old man had served his time duly and truly. Smith came back, and whispered to Marsden; Marsden went out, and beckoned me out, took me down the cellar stairs of the public-house; when we got to the bottom, he said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a place where we shall not be seen." There was light there. He undid a small roll of paper, and gave me four 1 l. Bank notes, one at a time - they were all the roll contained. I had only ordered four. He told me to look at them - I did so, folded them up, and put them into my fob. I paid him 24 s. for them. We returned to the taproom, had something to drink, and came away. I went to the Crown tavern, marked each note on the face, and delivered them to Foy, in the presence of Mr. Christmas, a Bank inspector - (looks at them) - these are them, they have</p>
               <p>"J. Marsden, 29 - 4 - 20, F. F." on them. I saw Marsden again on the 3d of May, at two o'clock, at the Blue Lion, public-house, Gray's Inn-lane - we met there by his appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280023"/>Q. Why was the house of meeting changed - A. He said he would rather deal with me by myself somewhere else. I had met him always before at the Sun, in company with another person. On my going there, he said the old man would be there shortly, and we were to wait till he came. Smith came in in about three-quarters of an hour, and whispered to Marsden; Marsden said, he (meaning Smith), has got but two, will you have them? I agreed to take them. He desired me to go down the ground, and he would follow - there is a pleasure ground there. He followed me, and gave me two 1 l. notes, and I gave him 12 s. for them. We returned to the taproom, Smith was sitting there, he said to Marsden,</p>
               <p>"Has he got them?" Marsden said Yes. He then said,</p>
               <p>"Has he paid for them?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is all right." Marsden asked me to come the next day at twelve o'clock and I should have half a score. I agreed to go; I took the notes to the Crown tavern, marked them on the face, and delivered them to Foy - (looks at two) - these are them. I marked them</p>
               <p>"J. Marsden, 3 - 5 - 20. F. F." I went there again on the 4th of May and waited there. Marsden came about half past twelve o'clock; said we must wait till the old man came, and he would bring them; we waited there till near three o'clock; he did not come, and Marsden appointed to meet me at one o'clock next day. I accordingly went there to the same house, and waited for him in the street; he came in about ten minutes; we went into the house and waited there about half an hour for the old man; I said I could wait no longer; we agreed to meet again at two o'clock; I went away, and saw Foy and Christmas, who were waiting for me; I went again at two o'clock; Marsden was not there; I waited in the street till he came; we then walked up and down the street waiting for the old man, and in about a quarter of an hour Smith came; he joined us in Guildford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you command a view of him before he approached you? - A. Yes; before he came up, he took his hat off and waved it as a signal that he was coming; he might be a dozen yards from us then. We all three went into the taproom of the Blue Lion - none but ourselves were in the room. Marsden asked Smith if he had got the things; Smith said Yes, and pulled out a parcel and offered it to me - it was not open - I told Marsden to take it while I got the money out of my pocket; I asked how many notes there were; Smith said ten - he handed them to Marsden, who undid the roll a little; I said I could only take eight; Marsden undid the roll again a little, and Smith took two of the notes out; then Marsden gave me the parcel, containing eight; I gave him a 1 l. Bank note and 28 s. in silver, and asked if I could rely on it that there were eight; he said Yes, I might rely there were - Smith also said there were eight. Marsden gave Smith the money, and Smith asked if it was all good; I said Yes, and Marsden said, he would be bound it was all good; Marsden asked if I was going into the country; I said I was, I had previously told him so; he said, you cannot justly say when you shall want any more then? I said I could not tell; he said when you do want any more, write to me at the Sun, the day before you want them, and I will meet you. Smith was present all this time; he must have heard it, we were all in company. After a short time, we went to the door, shook hands, and separated. I went to the Crown, marked each note on the face, and gave them to Foy, in the presence of Christmas - (looks at them) - these are them; they are marked</p>
               <p>"J. Marsden, 5th of May - 20 - F. F." I saw Marsden again by appointment on the 10th of May (I had sent him a letter), at the Blue Lion at twelve o'clock; he had nothing then; he said he would meet me again at three o'clock; I told him I wanted some notes - nothing passed at three - we met again at six, and I gave him a 1 l. Bank note and 10 s. to bring me five ones the next day; we were to meet at the Union, public house, Spafields, and did so; this was on the 11th, at twelve o'clock; he met me at the Union door, and asked me to go down the road with him, which leads by Bagnigge Wells; I went with him into a field past Bagnigge Wells; he said Smith was there, and would not come up, and I had better go down to him. When we got into the field, Smith was there waiting for us - I asked him if he had got them - he pulled out a brown paper parcel, tied round with a bit of thread, gave it to Marsden, and he gave it to me. I asked Marsden how many there were, Smith replied fifteen; I asked what sort they were, if there was a 5 l. note; Smith said they were all ones; I broke the string they were tied with; they said I had no occasion to count them, they were all right; I said I could only take ten; I took ten away, and returned the five to Marsden - he returned them to Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. You had paid him 1 l. 10 s. the night before? - A. Yes, and I gave Marsden 1 l. 10 s. more then, which was 3 l.; he asked when I should want any more? I said I could not say for a day or two; he said when you want more write as before, and you shall have them; I asked them to drink, but they refused and we parted. I took them to the Crown, marked them, and gave them to Foy, in the presence of Christmas. - (looks at 10) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. During these transactions had you been furnished with money by Christmas, and did you communicate from time to time the whole transaction - A. I did the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MARSDEN. Q. Who introduced you to me - A. A man named Bumpus.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street office. On the 25th of April I received two notes from Freeman, at the Crown, Clerkenwell-green. On the 27th of April he gave me two, and on the 29th of April four. He gave me them all at the Crown. I had frequently communicated with him relative to this subject, and it was arranged that he should bring me the notes he might purchase of the prisoner. On Wednesday, the 3d of May, I saw Christmas give him some money, I do not know how much, it was to pay the prisoners for forged notes; and on Thursday I and Christmas went in a coach opposite the Blue Lion, Gray's Inn-lane. We got there about two o'clock, or rather earlier; I saw Freeman shortly after, he went into the Blue Lion. I saw Marsden coming towards there from Guildford-street way; it is at the corner of the passage leading to Bagnigge-wells. Marsden appeared to see Freeman going in, for he ran after him and got in nearly at the same time. We remained in the coach, and in about a quarter of an hour Freeman and Marsden came out together; they spoke together and separated. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280024"/>then drove to the Crown. Freeman came up almost immediately, and returned Christmas the money he had given him. Freeman went to meet Marsden again about four o'clock. I saw Christmas return him the money. Wales was directed to go before us into the Blue Lion, and watch what passed between Freeman, or any one else who might be there. Freeman followed Wales in - I and Christmas followed them in a coach. We went nearly opposite the Blue Lion - got there about a quarter or half an hour after four o'clock; Freeman staid at the door, watching. He was shortly afterwards joined by Marsden, and both went into the house together. We waited till after five o'clock, and as neither of them came out, we returned to the Crown; and about half-past six o'clock Wales and Freeman came there - Freeman delivered me two notes. On Friday, the 5th of May, I saw Christmas give him some money for the same purpose. Wales and Jefferies were directed to go to the Blue Lion, to observe what passed. Christmas and I went in a coach, saw Freeman standing at the door, and very soon after I saw Marsden on the opposite side of the way - he beckoned to Freeman, who went over to him. They spoke together and then crossed over into the house, remained there about half an hour, then came out and separated - that was at twelve o'clock. We went again a little before two o'clock; on getting to the house, Freeman was standing at the door, and was soon after joined by Marsden. They walked up and down the street together, and went frequently opposite to the end of Guildford-street. Marsden appeared to be looking for some one in Guildford-street; after doing this three or four times, I saw him cross quickly over into Guildford-street; Freeman followed him, and in an instant they came in sight again, accompanied by Smith; they walked together, Freeman being before the prisoners, and went into the Blue Lion. After remaining there nearly half an hour, all three came out, had a short conversation in the street, shook hands with Freeman, and separated. The prisoners went away together, and Freeman went towards Battle-bridge. We returned to the Crown, Freeman came to us shortly after and delivered me eight notes, which I marked. On Thursday, the 11th of May, I saw Christmas give Freeman some money for the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information you received from Freeman, were Wales and Jefferies directed to the Union public-house, Spafields? - A. They were, I and Christmas also went there about half-past eleven in a coach. When we got there, I saw Freeman standing at the door, and saw Marsden come up to him, they walked down the road together out of our sight. We went to the Crown about twelve o'clock, and at half-past twelve Freeman came, and delivered me ten notes. On the 25th of May, I I apprehended Smith in Wellington-street, Strand; which leads to Waterloo bridge; Plank was with me, I saw him in the street, and took him; I asked him if he had any thing about him, he said No; I said I should secure him, and proceeded to do so, he struggled a little; I found 4 s. 6 d. in his breeches pockets, and in his breast coat pocket, a brown paper parcel; I asked what it contained, he said he did not know. I asked him where he got it from, he hesitated a little, and said he had picked it up just before as he came over the bridge, in the road; the parcel was perfectly clean and dry, it was a rainy day, and the streets were very dirty; on opening it, it contained 50 1 l. notes in three distinct parcels, two of 20, and one of 10; we tied them with packthread, and marked them before I parted with them. - (The witness examined, and identified the several notes as he mentioned them.</p>
               <p>MARSDEN. Q. Did you at any time see Freeman give me any money, or receive any from me? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>SMITH. Q. The road I found them on was gravelled. A. It is rather a dry road, but the gravel was wet, there was no appearance of its having been on the ground.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank-notes, Freeman was employed under my direction, I supplied him with money from time to time, he reported his proceedings to me, and the appointments he made, I was in company with Foy, when he at different times brought forged Bank-notes to the Crown. On the 3d of May, I was with Foy in a hackney coach, near the Blue Lion, and saw Freeman there; he was afterwards joined by Marsden, it was about two o'clock. At five we were there again, and saw the two prisoners and Freeman, they went into the Blue Lion, we came away, and went to the Crown. On the 4th of May, we went to the same place, and saw Marsden and Freeman in the street, they went into the Blue Lion. Next day at twelve o'clock, we went there, and saw Marsden meet Freeman in the street; I think they did not go into the house that time, but I am not certain; we left in about half an hour, and went again at two, and saw Freeman waiting in the road. Marsden came up to him, they walked backward and forward sometime, then crossed together, went into Guildford-street, and returned back with Smith, Freeman was before them; they walked towards the Blue Lion, all three stopped at the door about three minutes, and talked together, then all went into the house, and were there sometime; they came out together, and shook hands at the door - the prisoners went up Gray's Inn-lane and Freeman towards Battle-bridge. I saw Marsden on the 11th at the door of the Union, in Spafields, Freeman was waiting there for him; they went away together towards Bagnigge Wells.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 3d of May I went in disguise to the Blue Lion about four o'clock in the afternoon. I sat in a box in the taproom nearly opposite to where Marsden and Freeman sat - I think I got in before them, but it was nearly about the same time - they sat in a box together, and another person with them, for upwards of three-quarters of an hour. They had some ale together, and were in conversation. Marsden went out, and returned almost immediately with Smith, and both sat down with Freeman four or five minutes, then Freeman and Marsden went out of the taproom, leaving Smith behind. They all three appeared in conversation. Freeman and Marsden presently returned to the same box, remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then went away. On the 4th of May Mr. Christmas gave Freeman some half-crowns and shillings. I went again to the Blue Lion with Jefferies about twelve o'clock - we were disguised. Marsden and Freeman came in, and remained till about three - they both went out and in during the time I believe. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280025"/>5th of May I went there again into the parlour, which looks directly into the street. In a short time I observed Marsden and Freeman in conversation on the other side of the street, near Guildford-street, for near ten minutes. They parted soon after - one went one way, and the other another - this was soon after twelve o'clock. The same day, at two o'clock, I and Jefferies went there again, and while waiting in the front parlour I observed the two prisoners and Freeman together under the parlour window, just by where we were sitting - they parted, and went away. On the 25th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Plank, Jefferies, and I went to the Sun, in Drury-lane, and found Marsden there, standing between the fireplace and the tap-room, and apprehended him. I found nothing material on him, he only had 1 s.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 4th of May I went with Wales to the Blue Lion, and saw Marsden and Freeman together in the taproom - they continued together from about half-past twelve o'clock till near three, and had some ale, bread and cheese and raddishes together. I was on one side by the window, and Wales on the opposite side. I saw Freeman go away, leaving Marsden there. On the 5th I went to the same house again with Wales about twelve o'clock, and soon after saw Marsden beckon to Freeman, who was outside, they joined company together. We went away, came again at two o'clock, and saw Marsden and Freeman outside the house, Smith joined them soon after. I believe, they went into the taproom, but cannot say, as I was in the parlour - they appeared to be acquainted - they came out in about a quarter of an hour and parted. On the 11th of May, about twelve o'clock, Wales and I went to the Union, in Spafields, and saw Freeman there - Marsden joined him about a quarter past twelve - they went down the road together towards Bagnigge Wells.

            . I am clerk to the Magistrates at Marlborough-street. The prisoners were examined there - I took down what they said, it was quite voluntary; it was read over to them, and they signed it - these are the papers they signed; they have Mr. Farrant's signature to them - (read.) -</p>
               <p>"The prisoner, Marsden, says, I am entirely innocent, have no acquaintance with Smith, and was never in company with him and Freeman in my life. I never was in the Blue Lion or the fields by Bagnigge Wells, in company with him. I have been seven or eight times in company with Freeman, but not with Smith. I never had any money transactions with Freeman, or received or paid him any money.</p>
               <p>"The prisoner, Smith, said,</p>
               <p>"I never saw Freeman till I saw him at this office. I never was in company with him and the prisoner, Marsden, together in my life. I have no acquaintance with Marsden - I never paid or received any money from Freeman, and never received any note from Marsden."</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER. I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so upwards of twenty-six years - (looks at the notes uttered on the 5th of May) - they are forged in every respect.

            . I am a signing-clerk at the Bank, there is no other of my name. The signature to the note is not my writing. Another has my name, but it is not my writing.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>MARSDEN'S Defence. I believe, in the first place, Freeman says he was only in my company ten minutes, and after that he asked me to give him a bad note, to which I agreed. Now, is it consistent with reason that I should sell him a bad note after ten minutes acquaintance? Admitting that I was a dealer, is it consistent that I should risk my life for that. I do not know who his friend is - it is easy to bring his friend forward. I deny ever having had any connexion with him. I believe he says I sold him notes three times at the Sun, and once that I took him into the cellar. Now, as he acknowledges being employed by the Bank, is it not reasonable to suppose he would have marked money in his possession? He had an opportunity to have me taken, and by finding the marked money on me it would have convicted me. He had every opportunity to have me taken, but there is no person to prove he was seen to give me a note or receive any from me. He says I sold him notes at the Sun, and afterwards he said it was at the Coach and Horses, in Charles-street. He afterwards said he met me at the Blue Lion, and if so he could have had me taken. If I had sold him notes at that house it is evident the officers would have taken me with the marked money, which would have convicted me at once, but we never had any dealings. But those that adopted the plan had more judgment in them than I should have had to escape. He says he objected to take the notes from Smith in the field, and would have them of me - now, if so, would not any one suppose it was to get the person into trouble who sold them?</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I know nothing about it.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Broad Arrow-court, Grubb-street. I have known the prisoner four or five years - my wife had his child to nurse. On Sunday, the 14th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, he called, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here, Nance, go and get change for this note, and bring an ounce of tobacco and a quartern of gin." He put a note into her hand, she gave it me, and told me to go. I took a bottle, and went over to Mr. Bee's, the chandler's-shop, his wife gave me the change, and sold me the tobacco, which came to 4 1/2 d. I told her the note belonged to Mr. Myers, and she marked it in my presence. I bought a quartern of gin out of the change, returned, and gave the rest to the prisoner - he counted it, and put it into his pocket. Next day he came again, gave her another note to get some trifling articles from the chandler's-shop, she went out, returned with tea and sugar, and gave him the change - he counted it, and put it into his pocket. On the Tuesday following he came again, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and gave her another note to get changed; she went out, returned, and I saw her give him the change, he counted it, and put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he owe you any money - A. He owed my wife some, he gave her 2 s. 6 d., she wanted 4 s., he said he could not afford to give her more. She had lived with him as a servant, eighteen or twenty months, when he kept a house in Bridgewater-square - he has a wife and two children. I understand he has money in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not proposed to go over to Ireland to avoid coming here - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Was any proposal made to you to go to Ireland - A. Yes; some of his family proposed it to me since he was apprehended.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I had the prisoner's child to nurse. On the 18th of May he came to my room, and gave me a 1 l. note to get changed, and buy some tobacco and gin. I gave it to my husband, he took it out, and brought the change back to him; next day he gave me a 1 l. note to change, and to fetch some tea and sugar. I got it changed at Mrs. Bee's - the things came to 2 s. 2 d. I returned, and gave him the change - he stopped two or three hours with his child, and then went away. Next day he called again, gave me a note, and told me to bring in a quartern loaf and some butter. I changed it at Bee's, and gave him the change. I told her both times whose notes they were, and she marked them; he staid an hour, or an hour and a half. I saw him again the day following, he requested me to get him change for a 1 l. note, and get a bit of bread and ham, which I did - they came to 11 d., and I brought him 19 s. 1 d. change. He called again on the Saturday following, and asked for his child - I told him the mother had taken it home. He left, came again on Sunday at one o'clock, stopped a minute or two, and went away; he came back again at three o'clock, asked me to get change for a note, and bring in a small complement of green ham and a bit of bread. I got it from Bee's, gave her his name on that note, and gave 19 s. 1 d. change; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay out any other notes for him besides what you took to Bee's - A. Never. When I was his servant he paid every thing himself. The most I spent for him at one time was 1 s. 3 d.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence Not ever having had to address a Court, I trust no misconstruction will be put on what I have to say. It is my life for which I am pleading, and also my character. When a man's reputation is once lost, then farewell to future prospects; and I would as soon lose my life as my character, which I have proved, by throwing myself into your hands, instead of accepting the lenity which is allowed in these cases. Knowing myself not guilty, why should I plead guilty? But, knowing my innocence, I place myself under your protection, hoping to show my innocence. I do not wish to say any thing against the proceedings of the Bank; but I must say, there are some, at times, who state themselves to be innocent, and yet plead guilty to the minor offence, being afraid of being convicted of the capital offence; but this is not my case. I throw myself on your hands, and trust to you for an impartial hearing; and to you, Gentlemen, for an impartial verdict. You may be assured I would sooner die than live, should your verdict be against me. Mr. Bee knew nothing of me, but by seeing me pass his shop. Murray lived servant with me for two years, and had many notes in that time to pass. I left Bridgewater-square in consequence of losses, and was afterwards arrested, and was four months in Whitecross-street prison; since that I have lived on my dividend of 26 l. a quarter,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280027"/>and can it be supposed I should so far traduce myself as to become an utterer of forged notes, when I have a comfortable living without labour. On the 8th of April, I received my dividend, and 20 l. of it was in 1 l. notes, all dated the 9th March; I had a child at nurse at Murray's, and it was only natural that I should go there, she was always in want of something, and very seldom without going for a glass of gin. I have given her notes at different times, it appears she and her husband were taken up for passing bad notes, and she said they had them of me. The notes I gave her I had from the Bank, I had no others whatever, I paid no others. Were I an utterer of forged notes, was it reasonable I should go to those who so well knew me. Murray has said, if I would give him 30 l. ready money, he would go out of the way, and not be seen in this country for eighteen months? Why should he who has nothing to fear, wish to compound with one who has every thing to fear? I could have got this money, a friend offered me 40 l.; but no, I would sooner trust myself to a British Jury, than compromise when I know myself innocent, and wait with firmness your verdict; but let it be what it may, I shall not repine, for innocence knows no shame.</p>
               <p>JOS. SWEATMAN. I am a horse-boiler, and live in Grub-street. Just before they were going to file the bill against the prisoner, I saw Mrs. Bee at her shop; some party or other had mentioned, that it was desirous not to hurt the prisoner, provided she could have things settled. When I heard it, I went over to her, and mentioned it, she said that things might have been put to rights, if they had not gone so far. I told her, if she had wished to have done my brother-in-law any kindness, as respected me, she might have told me, and not had him dragged off by the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner any relation of yours? - A. He married my sister.</p>
               <p>MR. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Q. You went to know on what terms this could be made up, did you take any letter from the prisoner to Mrs. Bee - A. Yes; she looked at it, and said she should show it to some friend, she did not read it, the letter was directed to me, I took it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire her to say she mixed up these notes with those, that she could not distinguish one from the other - A. I do not recollect it, I did not on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. You positively swear it - A. To the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it, was it a fortnight, more or less - A. I cannot say. You are getting me to such points, I cannot answer you. The prisoner requested me to go and see how things could be settled; Mrs. Bee observed to me, that if things could be settled, she did not wish to come up here at all. Something was said about 145 l. that was 120 l. for the bail, if the Sheriff should seize, and 25 l. for expences.</p>

Duncan put his hand on him, but he passed him, and kept close to him; he called stop thief himself, as many people got about him; I said No, that is the thief; he had not run twenty yards before he was stopped.

In the act of searching him I felt the watch in a hand - it was as close to him as possible, and might have been his hand, but I cannot say, there was such confusion. I got fast hold of it, and on going to the watch-house a neighbour, Mr. Haynes, said, he had got the seals.</p>

            . I live in Round-court. I heard the cry of Stop thief! went up and saw the prisoner running, and laid hold of one of them - I cannot say it was the prisoner, it was like him. A number of persons came round and laid hold of him. As soon as their arms were extended to lay hold of him, I put my arm under theirs, and saw the seals hanging down his left thigh - I seized them, and endeavoured to draw them, he made a bob, the ribbon broke, and I got the seals.</p>

            . I belong to the Grenadier Guards. I was sitting at a door in New Round-court, where I am quartered, and saw the prisoner run up the court - I am certain it was him; he was pursued by some men. One made a catch at him; he cried out Stop thief! and he let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280028"/>him go. The prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is the thief!" I caught him, and saw the seals hanging from his trowsers; some one snatched at them and they came off. I held him till he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

I walked up to him, and asked what he was going to do with it? he said some strange man, with a knot on his head, sent him for it. I ordered him to take it up and put it where he found it. He put it on a chair in the counting-house, where I had seen it before - I then gave him in charge.</p>

Nelson said to Roberts,</p>

I jumped over the counter, went out, saw him walking towards the Park, and brought him back. In the meantime, Roberts went out. I found the cambric under Nelson's jacket.

On the 16th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house, in company with two girls of the town; he said he wanted something to drink, and unless I could give him change for a 1 l. note he could not have it. I said I would see if I could give change. He then asked for two glasses of rum, and one of gin, which came to 6 3/4 d., and offered me a 1 l. Bank note in payment. I then asked his address - he said,</p>
               <p>"If you will give me a pen and ink I will put my address on it." He then wrote the address on it. I perceived the note to be a bad one, and asked him if that was his address - he said it was. I then asked him whom he took the note of - he said he had it of his father. I asked him if his father lived at No. 3, Shepherd-street, Bond-street, which he had written on it - he said Yes. I told him the note was a bad one, and I should detain him. I had him taken into a back parlour, and sent for an officer immediately. Before the officer came the prisoner attempted several times to go away, pushed against me, and said no person should stop him. I said,</p>
               <p>"I will stop you." He shoved against me a number of times to pass me, but I insisted that he should not go. Edwards, the officer, came in about a quarter of an hour; the prisoner refused to let him search him. We were obliged to send for Edwards's son, another officer, when he came he was searched - but not until after he had put his hand into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put his hand into his pocket - A. Yes; into his right hand breeches-pocket, and afterwards take it out, I then saw 1 s. 6 d. in silver, and 2 1/2 d. in copper, in his hand. He was taken to the watch-house. I marked the note - (looks at one) - this is it - it is marked</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was sent for on Tuesday, the 16th of May, to Poore's, and found the prisoner in the parlour; Poore handed me a note, I asked the prisoner where he got that note, but he would not give me any account. I asked him where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280030"/>lodged - he said at No. 3, Shepherd-street, Bond-street. I said I must detain him, and search to see what he had about him; he said he would be d - d if he would be searched by any one man until he was before a magistrate. I said there was no magistrate sitting, and if there was, I should search him before he went out of the house. I endeavoured so to do, he was very resolute resisted, and said I nor any one man should search him. I sent to the office for my son, he came - I then searched his left hand side, and my son the right. I saw his hand in his right hand breeches-pocket, and told my son of it - he seized his hand and took 1 s. 6 d. in silver, and 2 1/2 d. out. We got two or three more to assist, and took him to the watch-house, as he had made resistance on being searched, and said if I had not been an old man he would have knocked me down. He made no resistance in going along, but kept looking behind him, and there were two or three men behind him. I told one of them to take hold of his coat, two more, besides my son and I, went with him. Next day I went to No. 3, Sheppard-street, Bond-street, and made strict enquiry for Stapleton, but could find no such name. I told him he did not live there, and he said he would not tell me where he lived at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I attempt to conceal the money - A. He put his hand into his pocket when it was found, and said it was all he had about him.</p>
               <p>Q. I could have concealed it while you went for your son - A. I did not go for my son.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I stand here, entirely resting on my own innocence. I have refused to plead guilty to the minor charge knowing myself to be innocent. My friends and relations are in France. I left Paris three days prior to this circumstance. The night previous to my being apprehended I slept at a house in Shepherd-street. Having met a woman at Drury-lane Theatre, I told her I had no money, nor anything but a watch, which cost me thirty francs, and which I meant to dispose of, as I intended to return to Paris. I accompanied her and another female to sell it - they took me to a house in Drury-lane, and I received this note of a man there for the watch, of course I cannot produce the villain who paid me the note. I wanted change, to defray the expences of the night, and put my right name and address (Shepherd-street) on it, as, in all probability I should have accompanied her there again that night. Sometimes I come to London, and sometimes my brother - we are under our father.</p>

            . I am a constable of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoner in Covent-garden market on the 10th of June; I took him to a public-house and searched him - it was with great difficulty that I got this key and a handkerchief from him; he particularly resisted about the key, which was fastened to his braces in his breast - he said he lived in Clare-market; I asked where in Clare-market? he said that made no odds to me, he should stop till he got before the Magistrate. He told the Magistrate that he lived at No. 18, Haughton-street - I went, and found he did live there - it is in the neighbourhood of Clare-market, but whether it leads into it or not I cannot say. I found a letter in his pocket, directed to him at a stand in Clare-market, but could find no stand of his there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The letter has a post-mark on it -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280031"/>A. Yes; it is a summons to the Court of Requests. I have no doubt but Haughton-street leads into Clare-market.</p>

            . On Monday, the 22d of May, my servant informed me the cattle were stolen. They were unfit for market, they wanted about six weeks in the early part of the season - when they come from grass there is a difference in the flesh easily ascertained. I went to Newgate-market on Wednesday, and saw two aitch-bones of beef at Mr. Lee's - they looked as I expected mine would. I immediately went to the prisoner's house in Church-street, Bethnal-green, and asked him where he got the heifers, the bodies of which were at Mr. Lee's? he said from Epping, from the same person he had others from before. He afterwards said the man's name was Crawley. I said I knew several persons at Epping, but none of that name, and begged him to say what size he was; he said he was about my size, and lived on Thorney Common, below Epping, and was a farmer. I expressed surprise that he should send them to him instead of the wholesale market. He said he became acquainted with Crawley when he attended Epping market, and he thought he could do better for him than a stranger. I said he could have no difficulty in finding him - he hesitated, and said he did not know, and that Crawley was going into Kent - that he gave him 12 l. on account, and was to settle the rest afterwards. He said the person who drove them brought a note from Crawley, and he gave him 12 l. instead of Crawley. He was asked for the note, and he went out saying he would fetch it - he returned, saying he could not find it, and he supposed the children had destroyed it. I gave him in charge. I afterwards went to Salloway's, a tanner, at Bermondsey, and saw two hides, which I am certain are the hides of my two heifers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the prisoner at home - A. Yes; he mentioned no name but Crawley. He did not describe the man who drove them. Another man, named Lye, was brought before the Magistrate, he was discharged on promising to appear next day, but did not appear - he was apprehended on the information of the prisoner's wife - it was not through the prisoner's instrumentality that we found the hides.</p>

             re-examined. The hides are the hides of my cattle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About four years ago I lived in Wilson-street, Finsbury-square, and was burnt out, I lost every thing but some meat, which I took to Romford market, and from there to Epping; I there became acquainted with Crawley, we did a great deal of business together - he agreed to send me his cattle to sell in London. One Lee, a drover, who had heard this conversation, brought three cows to me, and said he came from Crawley - I gave him 12 l. on account - he brought them between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and I asked Crow to slaughter them for me. Next morning I sold the bodies of beef to Mr. Lee. I put him in possession of all the information, and offered to do all in my power to bring the guilty person to justice, and told him where the fat and tripe were taken to. I sent to my wife to get Lee apprehended, which was done with difficulty - he was then liberated to appear next day, but never did. I have a witness to prove that I was at home all Sunday night.</p>

On the 20th of June, about twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from Quebec-street, I was a little intoxicated, and met the prisoner and another woman in Barbican; I refused to go with them, they took me to a public-house, and we had a quartern of gin; I stood away from the counter, and removed my watch from my fob into my coat-pocket, they both came out with me, and in less than five minutes I missed my watch; I charged the prisoner with taking it, she said No, and laughed. I said I would give her a pound note to return it; she said she would, if I gave her a note. They walked home with me to Chapel-street, close by and waited. I went home, and brought out seven one pound notes rolled together; the prisoner rubbed me down, and said,</p>
               <p>"No have got your watch," she put her fingers in my waistcoat-pocket, and took the notes out, I seized her, she reached her hand over to the other woman, who went away; I gave charge of the prisoner, she then said she did not think I had lost a watch, but said so to get the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give information to have the other woman taken - A. She took the watchman out, and brought in a woman, I cannot say whether she was, or was not the woman.</p>

On Monday morning, the 12th of June, about half past seven o'clock, the prisoner was exposing this gelding for sale in the market, it had been rode very hard, and Monday not being horse market day. I was with Taunton, we went to the prisoner and asked the price, he asked 9 l.; I asked where he brought it from, he said from Daventry, that he bought it three months ago, of one Clift, a jobber. I questioned him about it, he afterwards said he bought it of Clift in Smidfield-market, Birmingham, a month ago; I took him before a magistrate, and locked the horse up. A bill came into my hands, describing the gelding, and I found out the prosecutor. I took the gelding to the Bear and and Ragged-staff yard.</p>

A gentleman said I had better get an officer to get the pony again, I went and got an officer, they took me to a public-house, and wanted me to drink, and tore all my tickets to pieces. I bought it of Clift. The magistrate wrote to Birmingham. I have lived there twenty-three years.</p>

            . I live in Stingo-lane, Marylebone. I am an ivory turner, I have known the prisoner twenty-four, or twenty-five years, and always knew him to be a deranged man at the change of the moon; he has been confined by his father several times, and has been in prison many times for his mad tricks, but I never knew him confined for theft. I have not seen him for five years, I have known him afflicted with insanity eight or nine years. I married his sister, he is well known all over Brimingham as a madman; if he gets a pint of ale, he roves about and foames at the mouth like a madman.</p>
               <p>- ARMFIELD. I am the prisoner's sister, he has been deranged ever since he was fourteen years old; where he was apprenticed to a baker, his master gave him a blow on the head with a peel, since that time he has been deranged.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutor's. On the 8th of June, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise below stairs, I immediately ran down, and saw a young man at the bottom of the stairs; he said there had been thieves in the house, and begged I would pursue after them; I did so, and ran into Aldermanbury, through Church-court, and when I got by the side of the Axe-coffee-house, there was a piece of cloth laying down in the court, which I had seen in the warehouse the night before. When I went up to breakfast at eight o'clock, I shut the door, but two servants had been to the door afterwards, and might have left it open; persons might get into the warehouse without making a noise; the young man ran to the end of the court with the cloth, the prisoner had been stopped, and they were bringing him back; the cloth measures nineteen yards and a quarter, and cost 16 s. per yard. It is worth above 10 l.</p>
               <p>JOB JESSOP. I am porter to Mr. Smith, who lives next door to the prosecutors', the house is in the parish of St. Michael Bassishaw. On the 8th of June, the prisoner came in, and asked me for a person named Fell, in the bombazeen way, I said no such person lived there, and I knew no such person, I did not like his appearance, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280034"/>watched him; he went into the prosecutors', I stopped, and saw him come out with a piece of cloth on his shoulder. I immediately locked my door, went into the prosecutors', and alarmed Mr. Hill, and told him to follow with me, the prisoner was out of sight then, I caught sight of him in Three Nunn-court, Aldermanbury, with the cloth on his shoulder, and called out stop him; I immediately saw him drop the cloth and run. I picked it up, and went to the end of the court, and saw him brought back two or three minutes after. I am sure he is the person.</p>

On the 25th of March, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I observed that the lock was perfectly secure; I had heard chambers attempted before, which made me particular in examining the lock. I went out, came home about six o'clock, and left my chambers about a quarter past six, I had left my outer door open, any person could get at the lock of it. On shutting it, I observed the screws had been moved, I immediately sent a porter for a locksmith to repair it. I returned in about five minutes; the stair-case is a spiral one. My chambers are on the second floor; I remained outside the door about a minute, then heard footsteps coming up stairs, it turned out to be the prisoners, when they faced my door they appeared confused at seeing me, and made a pause; I asked who they were, and what they came for, they told me their real names; and said they were coming to Mr. Johnson, Hare-court-buildings, which my chambers join - no such person lived there. I asked them who sent them, they said they were standing at their father's door in the Strand, and a gentleman going by, told them to go to Mr. Johnson, Hare-court-buildings, and see if he was at home; this rose my suspicion. I fetched Hitchin to search them, leaving them in custody of Mr. Bohen's clerk and Hebden. I saw a large hammer found on George, also a pair of pincers, and a piece of paper, he said he found the paper in Temple-lane as he came down; I asked him how his own name came written on it? he paused some time, and then said he would tell the truth, he wrote it himself. The outer door had been open the greater part of the day. The nuts of the lock were found at the bottom of the stairs three or four days after.</p>

On the 1st of June, between one and two o'clock, I saw a woman come to the door, and sent my daughter to answer her - she saw nobody and shut the door, which was open before. In about a quarter of an hour a person was heard above. My daughter came down and missed the things - some of them were a good deal worn.</p>

Somebody must have come down the area to take them. There were six table-cloths, I was to have paid 30 guineas for them if they had not been found - they cannot be worth less than 5 l.</p>

            . I am a porter, and lodge near Baker-street. A little after ten o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Baker-street, and saw the prisoner and two more; he and one of the others went down the area of No. 27, I saw them go inside the house, and in about five minutes the person down the area whistled, the other stood opposite the area gate in the street, with a stick. I stopped to watch them, and saw the prisoner come out with all this linen under his arm into the street, with the one that went down with him, but he had nothing. A gentleman told me to halloo out stop thief, I did so, and they all three ran; I ran after the prisoner, and never lost sight of him, a coachman laid hold of him, he threw the linen down about two minutes before he was laid hold of, and ran down Blandford-mews. I never lost sight of him. Mrs. Fisher picked up the linen, it was five small and one large table cloth.</p>

I did not see her till she was leaving the shop, I did not miss anything; no shawls were on the counter, but some were in the window within reach of a person who might come into the shop, they could not be taken from the outside; I heard footsteps at the door, looked round and saw the prisoner going out, I ran to the door, looked at the window, and missed a shawl off a board, where it had been put by itself. It rained hard, I stopped to get my hat, and pursued after her into Oxford-street, turned round, and saw her standing at the entrance of the Union public-house, seven or eight doors off. I went up to her, she had her apron up, I asked what she had in it? She said something, I do not recollect what. I pulled her apron down, and found a gown in it, and under the gown was this shawl, which I know to be my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280036"/>master's.

On the 6th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming through Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoner and another man run up another street into Rosemary-lane - an elderly man came up, and a scuffle ensued between him and the prisoner, his companion was with him - the prisoner did not appear to be sober, but the elderly man was. He knocked the prisoner over a woman's barrow; several people stopped and laughed, and I joined in the laugh. The elderly man was then taken from the prisoner, and the prisoner asked me what cause I had to laugh? I had not spoken to him, I only laughed with other people - I told him to say nothing, the old man was enough for him; I then walked on in the road, leaving him and his companion behind - that was all I said to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to strike him, or hold up your fist at him - A. No, not at that time. I had not walked many yards before the prisoner and his companion came up to me - the prisoner asked me what business I had with the affair that had just happened? I had taken no part in it, I was only a spectator. I told him again that it was nothing to me, the old man was enough for him, and if he had any call with me he would not come off so easy. The prisoner said to his companion twice,</p>
               <p>"Give me the stick!" his companion did not give it to him, but came up to me, took me by the arm, and told me to excuse the prisoner, for he was in liquor. I told him not to lead me, for I did not want to have any thing to do with him or the prisoner. I then left them, and went up Back-church-lane, about a quarter of a mile off, and in less than a quarter of an hour after I left them I went into a wheelwright's yard in Back-lane, and asked the price of some wheels. I turned my head round, and saw the prisoner's companion standing against the gate of the yard; his companion said,</p>
               <p>"Here he is! go on" - I did not see the prisoner at that time. I then came out of the yard, his companion still stood at the gate, and looked me very hard in the face. I came out, passed him, and saw the prisoner a little way forward. I passed the prisoner also - I neither spoke to him, nor made any gestures at him - I took no notice of him. Both of them then followed me very close, so close that I was afraid they were going to trip me up. I crossed over the road, they both crossed after me. I came into the Commercial-road, they still followed me. I had occasion to go through <placeName id="t18200628-75-crimeloc421">Brick-lane, Whitechapel</placeName>

The prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Why, I will rip your bl - dy guts open!" We were then about half a mile from where I parted with them in Rosemary-lane. He immediately made a stab at me with his hand. I had no suspicion at that time that he had any instrument with him. He struck me, I lifted up my hand to strike him - I then saw the knife in his hand, and felt the blood running down me from my left side in the lower part of my body. I cried out,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God! that man has stabbed me!" The prisoner and his companion immediately ran away; they were pursued. I was immediately taken to a surgeon's in Whitechapel, and got my wound dressed, I then went home and went to bed. On the Wednesday following it got so bad I was obliged to go into the hospital - (it happened on a Saturday) - the surgeon who attended me there is dead. I continued in the hospital as an in-patient for a fortnight. I was confined first at my own house for three days. I could walk with great pain, but did not till I went into the hospital. I was confined a week to my bed there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You came up, hearing a running and noise - A. I was going past; I heard no cry of Stop thief! I think the old man had two arms. The prisoner was in liquor, but did not appear very drunk - he could walk and run very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he should not come off so easy with you - A. When he followed and spoke to me I did - I did not wish to fight if they would let me alone. If he had struck me I should have struck him again. I did not say I would bring him to his senses, or any thing of the kind. I do not know that he had a knife in his hand then.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Commercial-road you said if they wanted any thing out of you they had better take it, you meant to fight - A. Yes. I did not put myself in a fighting attitude till after he struck me, I then lifted up my arm to attempt to strike him but did not. I did not tell the Magistrate that I struck him.</p>

            . I have been a labourer in the East India Company's service, and live in Turner-street, Commercial-road - I am out of employ being ill. The prisoner and prosecutor were both strangers to me. I saw the prisoner, his companion, and the prosecutor standing at the top of Back-church-lane talking; I was on the opposite side of the way. I saw the prisoner make a thrust at the prosecutor - I did not see any weapon at the time - the prosecutor doubled up immediately as if he was going to fall. He exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord! he has stabbed me!" I came across the road; he pulled his waistcoat up, and the blood ran profusely from the lower part of his side. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280037"/>saw the prisoner and his companion run away. I stopped with the prosecutor till some people went away with him. I left, and did not see the weapon with which the wound was given.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the office about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of May, he was charged with stabbing a man. I found a very small knife in his pocket, which I produce; it did not appear to be bloody - no other knife was produced. No person appeared with him as his companion. The prosecutor was not able to attend. I saw his wound about an hour after - the doctor said it might have been done with this knife. I know he was confined sometime in the hospital - the doctor who first attended him is not dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not very much in liquor - A. Certainly, he was. I believe he has shown every contrition for it, and appeared very much concerned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never wished to do anybody grievous bodily harm, and never had the intent. I never heard the words. On the 6th of May, about half-past four o'clock, I was coming along very drunk, ran against a public-house window, and broke it - the servant laid hold of me, somebody said,</p>
               <p>"Let him go, I will pay for it" - he let me go and struck me; he had but one arm. Being in liquor I struck him again; some people who knew me took me away. I fell over a wheelbarrow. I walked on, Browning came after me and said to me first,</p>
               <p>"The old man would have beat you well." I did not speak to him, for I was so much in liquor - I did not know which way I was going. A young man told him to take no notice of me, for I was in liquor. I turned up Church-lane; Browning came after me and said,</p>
               <p>"You have broken a window, and ought to pay for it." The young man told him again not to notice me, and shoved me on. Browning said,</p>
               <p>"Lend me that stick, if he is in liquor I will fetch him out." He would not lend him the stick, but took hold of his arm, and pressed him not to notice me. Accordingly Browning came after me - I took my knife out of my pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, if you will let me have half that stick he may take the other half, and see if he can beat me with it." Directly Browning heard this, he flew at me, and struck me on the back of my neck - I went to hit him again, and when I hit him, whether I stuck the knife into him, or he ran against it, I cannot tell. He hit me away from him - I stood, and never moved from the spot. When he was going to hit me again, somebody cried out,</p>
               <p>"He has got a knife, or some sharp instrument, in his hand!" I walked away, and as I was going away, he said,</p>
               <p>"He has stabbed me!" I was taken afterwards, but being in liquor I could not stand, and was sick in the lock-up place. On Sunday I sent to the prosecutor's - he said he was stabbed, but not much hurt; and as I was in liquor he would take no notice of it. I said I would give him 2 l. Next day I sent, and he said 5 l. would pay his expences, and he would take that, and have nothing to do with it. Since that he has sent his landlord to say, that if my friends would rise 5 l. now, and 5 l. more in a fortnight, he would give it up. I could have no malice towards him, and did not want to take his life. I did not go up to him like a thief. I did not think I had the knife in my hand when I struck him.</p>

            . I live in Brown Bear-alley, East Smithfield - I am married and am a silk-weaver. The prisoner is a stranger to me. I was going to Bow to meet my mother and help her home from work. I left home at five o'clock, went up Back Church-lane, and saw the prisoner cross and Browning after him. Browning was behind the prisoner, and took hold of him and shook him. I saw nobody with the prisoner, but I did not take notice. Several people were round him, so that I could not see whether he had a companion or not. That is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see any wound - A. No: my business called me to meet my mother at such a time, and I went on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this to strike your attention - A. Why, I will tell you. I came back again, saw the mob there and this young man, and gave him my direction. I had then met my mother by the hospital, about a quarter of an hour's walk from where I saw him strike the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother came to the spot with you - A. No, not the spot, because I met her, and then returned back. The crowd was then at Lambeth-street office - I went into the lock-up place and told the young man what I had seen. I did not know what had happened then. I went in from curiosity, and heard he had stabbed a man.</p>
               <p>BROWNING re-examined. The prisoner did same frequently, in kindness, to enquire after my health.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character for mildness and evenness of temper.</p>

He made a snatch at my watch; I had my hand on my fob, and kept my watch - the swivel broke, and he got off with the chain - the swivel broke while I was laying hold of the watch. He ran off, I followed him, his companion, followed me. I pursued the prisoner down a dark lane, and when he got into the street he turned about and met me. He unbuttoned his waistcoat, and told me to search him; he then said if I would let go he would go where I pleased. I let go; he started off, and I followed him - he got out of my sight a few minutes. A mob gathered round; he came up, and I laid hold of him - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a book agent, and occasionally deal in paper; I live in Hudson's-court, Strand. About the 6th of June the prisoner offered me some paper for sale - he brought me some patterns, and mentioned the quantity he had of each article and the price - it was marble paper. I told him the price was too high, and if he would leave his direction I would call. I called on him afterwards at No. 9, Barrett's-court, Wigmore-street, at his own lodgings. He said he had not got the paper there, but had moved it No. 3, Bateman's-buildings, Soho-square I went there next morning, it was Mrs. Andrews's house. I knocked at the door, he opened it; I went up stairs, and he shewed me a quantity of marble paper, about sixteen reams. I said it did not suit me; he asked more for it than I could buy it for at the manufacturer's. On looking at it I suspected it to be Mr. Poole's. He asked 2 l. for it. I said it was not worth more than 25 s. a ream. I went away and informed the prosecutor.</p>

            . I live in Bateman's-buildings. O'Donnel took a lodging at my house in the name of Daniels, at the latter end of May - my servant let it to him, he and the prisoner were together - they both came frequently to the house together and both frequently brought a great many parcels together - they appeared to be parcels of paper. I do not know that the prisoner ever came alone. I remember Mr. Poole and Player giving me information about the prisoner. He came next day with a stick, and asked if Daniels was at home? I said he was not, but that he had sent to me to desire I would give up all his property to two porters - that he had sent a note by a little boy, who I believe was his (the prisoner's) boy. He said</p>
               <p>"No, I have not the honour to be his father." I said I had told the boy I would not give up the property to any person but those it belonged to, and perhaps he was come for it. He said</p>
               <p>"No, I am not, for I am lame, and cannot carry it." He went away. I was not able to find any one to stop him. I beckoned him back, coaxed him into the house, and said I hoped he would not behave ill to me, but I should detain him as an accomplice, for bringing stolen goods into my house. The property was in the bed-room which they hired. He said he would not be detained, and began to cry. I said,</p>
               <p>"You shall be detained," and my son being in the room said so too. A great scuffle ensued between me, my son, and him in attempting to detain him. He flew to the window, and attempted to break it to push the frame out; then he got to the street-door, and hurt me very much with his stick - he at last burst through the window and ran away. I called Stop thief! and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you present when the room was let - A. No. I came home and saw O'Donnell, and acknowledged him as a lodger. The prisoner was present when they were let, and recommended O'Donnel to me - he said he lived in town, and that O'Donnell came from the country.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in James-street, Manchester-square. I met the prisoner in Oxford-street, and went to a public-house with him - it is a month ago to-morrow. A man came in, said he had bought some paper, and asked him to dispose of it for him. The prisoner said he did not like the job, that he did not understand it, and asked him where he got it from? the man said that was no odds to him. He gave the prisoner 2 s., and said he would settle with him when he saw him again. He gave him some sheets rolled up in other paper, and wrote down the price.</p>

In 1817, I knew the prisoner as a broker, he was recommended to me, and bought stock for me; two or three times before this transaction. In July 1816, I had 950 l. in the Navy 5 per cents. On the 1st of February, 1817, I saw him in the Rotunda, at that time I had 1,000 l. stock - we had some conversation respecting the price of the stocks, or what they were likely to be, and he advised me to sell out my 1,000 l. in the Navy 5 per cents; and buy in 1,000 l. in Exchequer-bills, as it would be advantageous.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day did this transaction take place - A. Yes; he gave me this memorandum of the sale, (read) and paid me 36 l. in money. I had a letter from him on the 1st of June, 1817, which is destroyed; the purport of it was to recommend me to come to town before the 4th of June, saying, the 4th would be a proper time for me to replace the 1,000 l. in the Navy 5 per cents, with the Exchequer-bills he knew I was in possession of. I came to town on the 3d, and saw him in the Rotunda, and asked him to replace this 1,000 l. in the Navy 5 per cents; he said, if I would come again in an hour and a half, it should be done - he asked if I had got the bills, I showed them to him, and said I would give him them when the stock was bought. I returned in an hour or two, and found him in the Rotunda - he immediately told me it was all ready, by which I understood the stock was bought - he again held his hand out for the bills, and said, let us go and do the business. He went with me into the 5 per cents. office, and when I got up to the counter, I thought I was justified in giving him the bills, and did so; it was a 500 l. and four 100 l. bills, and were the very same he had purchased for me before - be took them in his hand, and said, if you will stop here a moment or two, I will return. He was absent about ten minutes, and on his return, he wrote on a piece of paper and gave me, calculating the amount of the bills, and making me a debtor of 92 l. 6 s. 6 d.; then adding his commission, which was 25 s. for buying the 1000 l., and 9 s. for selling the Exchequer-bills. I gave him this draft for 94 l. (looks at it) - it has been paid by my bankers; as he was going out of the office, I said, I beg your pardon Mr. Simpson, but this is not the sort of receipt I have been used to have when I have purchased stock - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is all right Mr. Offin, you must be here on the 22d of July, when you will sign the transfer, and receive your dividend" - He turned to the counter, and wrote</p>
               <p>"22d of July," and said you will be sure not to forget to be here on that day. I never saw him again till I saw him at the Mansion House. I have never been able to get a dividend.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by. MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had he done much business for you - A. He has sold 1,400 l. for me in the 3 per cents.; he never made but one transfer except this. I was introduced to him by Mr. Harvey, of Brentwood; I have blamed Mr. Harvey for introducing him to me - and showed him the paper on the day after the transaction, and said, I was afraid I should lose my money. Mr. Harvey said, if it was 100,000 l. it would be as safe as the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you trusted entirely to Simpson to lay out your money, and you was without a remedy - A. No; I merely asked if he thought it was safe, I never said I employed him to speculate with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the first transaction you had with him a purchase for the day, or time - A. For the present day, he did not tell me this was a purchase for the opening. I believe the 22d, was opening day.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You sent a letter for him to come up on the 3d, and purchase Exchequer-bills - A. Yes; I never knew anything of buying for time.</p>

One man took my watch, and at the same time I received a violent blow on my ear. I cannot say whether it was before or after the watch was taken - they separated and ran away - it was a dark night. The prisoner resembles the man, from his size and appearance - I have every reason to believe he is one of them. I pursued the man who I thought had the watch - he crossed the way and turned towards Poland-street - I pursued and stopped him. I do not think I lost sight of him, if I did, it was only for a moment. The prisoner was the man - nobody was near me but the four men. I stopped him about thirty or forty yards down Poland-street, called</p>
               <p>"Watch," and he came up in three or four minutes and took him. He was running when I stopped him; and I am almost positive that I saw the watch in his possession - I have not seen seen it since.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Oxford-street, opposite Well-street. I heard the cry of</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" from the top Poland-street. I observed the parties before that and had my eye on them. I saw the prosecutor with a young man on the Well-street side of the road; and just as they got to the corner of Well-street, I saw four men meet them; he was hustled by them, and immediately afterwards they all ran down Poland-street, and he after them crying</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" I sprung my rattle and pursued as fast as I could, and did not see him lay hold of the prisoner. I saw the watch on the ground, about thirty yards down Poland-street; and as I stooped to pick it up, one of the party hit me a blow - he picked it up and put it in his right-hand pocket. I pursued, he got from me by a coach passing. There was no others near, but the four who surrounded the prosecutor. His friend did not push me. About half an hour after, two of his companions came to look for the watch, I said I would take them, and they ran off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was playing the violoncello at a gentleman's house and was out very late. I was coming down Oxford-road, a little in liquor, saw a disturbance on the opposite side and crossed over. The prosecutor was running after a man - he came and took me.</p>

I took it from his hands myself and placed it in a basket with other parcels to go to London - the basket was in the office by where I sit. He brought it about an hour before the mail started.

             puts the parcels in the seat of the coach and locks the seat up. The key is kept hung up in the office - another key is kept at Bath, one at Marlborough, one at the Gloucester Coffee-house, Piccadilly, and another at Lad-lane. On the 4th of January I booked four inside passengers, and have the book here. On Monday morning, at half-past ten o'clock, a gentleman came and asked if he could go to London on Wednesday night - I said he could. I have seen him since in London, but lost him. He booked two inside places for London, in the name of Johnson. While he was paying the money, in came another person, who I believe to be the prisoner, but will not swear to him. He paid me for a place to London in the same mail, in the name of Wheeler. In the course of an hour a gentleman in black came, and asked if there was room for another person in the mail for London - I said there was, and he took a place in the name of Franklin. Another gentleman applied afterwards for a place in the name of Hensall - he could not have it, and took one outside.</p>

               <p>Q. When the mail started, were all the persons in and on the coach - A. Yes; they all four got in, in a moment. Mr. Hensall was on the roof. On Thursday morning I was informed of several parcels having been opened and their contents taken out. I went to the Mansion House in about a month, saw the prisoner in custody, and was satisfied in my own mind that he was one of the party who took the places. He was not pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The seat is a common place for putting in all small parcels - A. It is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280042"/>I believe another person was charged with this offence before the prisoner; he has been transported for another offence, and this charge was reserved against him, in case he should have been acquitted. I took particular notice of them all; for finding so many applications for London in the course of an hour, I thought there must be some law-suit going on. I believe he had a black hat, white handkerchief, and black coat. The proprietors, at the places I have mentioned, keep the keys of the seats. The coach stops at Marlborough fifteen minutes to sup.

            . I am porter at the Bush coach-office, Bristol. On the 4th of January I put all the parcels in the seats of the mail - both seats had parcels in them - I locked them, and hung the key up under the desk of the office. I remember putting a brown paper-parcel for Mr. Kelly into the seat - I had marked No. 9 on it. The mail started at four o'clock. There were four passengers inside - they had no luggage, except a very small brown valice. Two came first and two afterwards, about three minutes apart from each other - one gentleman was outside - they all started with the coach at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Parcels, which the proprietors have a premium for, are put in so the seat with others - A. They are. I am sure I locked the seat - nobody could have had possession of the key after I locked it before the coach set off.</p>

            . I am porter at the Swan with Two Necks. The Bristol mail came in on the morning of the 5th of January, a little after nine o'clock. I unlocked both seats myself - the parcels appeared just the same as on another morning. A small parcel was entered in the weigh-bill for Mr. Kelly - I chequed it off as having arrived. The parcels were delivered to different porters - Crouch was one of them. About two o'clock I heard of some parcels having been opened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you more than one key - A. No: it opens both seats. I opened the seats the moment the mail arrived. It was bad weather, and I believe frosty.</p>

Nobody went into the counting-house till he came down, except a young lad, who is here.

I had a boy with me - he has been turned away, I do not know what for. He was not in the cart till after I took this parcel out to deliver it.

The seals of both were broken, and the seals of the letters were also broken. The order mentioned that there was 13 l. enclosed, but no notes were in it then.</p>

             - I shook hands with him. I well know the prisoner to be one of them, I knew him before, he was at Bristol last September, and went by the name of Wellington; they all five came in, called for breakfast at Merchant's, and conversed together as companions. When Freeman shook hands with me he asked me if I had heard his old woman was dead. I returned between two and three o'clock, and saw the same five men sitting together in the parlour, and I am sure the prisoner was one of them; they called for dinner, and while it was getting ready they asked if they could have beds - they were asked how many they should want - they said two. Freeman said he lived in Bristol, and should not sleep there. In the course of the evening they said they should go to the Play. I came to the house as an assistant to Merchant. Two went out first, and the other two followed - Freeman had left them then. They all four returned and slept there. I saw the prisoner with them. Next morning they sent for breakfast, after that they went out, returned, and dined together there - Freeman dined with them. While they were at dinner I heard them say they were going to take places in the mail for London. I know Freeman did not go in the mail, for I saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go out of the house to go to the mail - A. I saw them go out between half-past three and a quarter before four o'clock, and as they were going, they said,</p>
               <p>"If we do not look sharp we shall be too late for the mail." They went up stairs, fetched down their great coats, and I believe there was a little portmanteau. They went up Small-street, in a direction to the Bush.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that were you brought to London - A. About a month after, and was taken to the Mansion House, I there fixed on the prisoner as being one of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280043"/>men, he was not pointed out to me. I saw him in the middle of a crowd, and knew him directly. I am sure and positive he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you been married twice - A. Yes, I married my first husband in Wales. I do not sleep at Merchant's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you first inform of this dinner party - A. I went to live servant at the Bank tavern, John-street, and one day I was reading the newspaper; the first thing I saw was the robbery of the mail, and a description of the parties. I said directly to the landlady</p>
               <p>"I am confident they are the same men that slept at Merchant's last Monday." A person afterwards told the book-keeper, I was sent to town, and identified the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JAMES MERCHANT. I keep the St. John's porter house, at Bristol. On Tuesday, the 3d of January, four persons lunched and dined at my house - my daughter waited on them. They slept there, breakfasted and dined the next day. On the second day a fifth person dined with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen either of them since - A. I thought I saw one of them during the trial of the conspirators. I have not seen him since. I am certain the prisoner is one of them - I knew him before, for he was at my house last September fair several times. I have no doubt of his person. I went to see him at the Mansion House, and saw him with four or five others, and pointed him out myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was the prisoner ironed when you saw him - A. I think not. Morris came occasionally to my house to get a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she not a loose woman about Bristol - A. Not that I know. I did not see her in the room where the men were - she might assist in washing a few things, but she did it voluntarily. I had a few more persons at my house that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any other dinner party - A. No.</p>

            . I am a corn-dealer. On the 4th of January I was at Bristol, and came from there that afternoon outside the mail, as I could not get an inside place - we supped at Marlborough. I went into the same room with the inside passengers. I have no doubt of the prisoner being one of them - we supped at the same table - the coach stopped twenty minutes. I took notice of them from their particular demeanor.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that - A. The prisoner went out of the room while we were at supper, without having paid his full fare, which is usual to do there. When the man came in for the fare, the three men then in the room, appeared to be perfect strangers by their conduct to each other - and did not appear to know the prisoner when he came in - he paid the porter the full fare, and the guard who leaves at Marlborough came in for his compliment - they were then silent, not appearing to know each other; but the moment the guard retired, they appeared very familiar, calling each other by their Christian names, and answering together as acquaintances. I had pulled off my coat, and expressed an intention of stopping at Marlborough, and ordered a bed in their hearing; but I came on with the mail, finding I could not get to town in time if I stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after you expressed your intention of stoping, that they conversed with each other by their Christian names - A. It was; till that time they appeared distant to each other. They did not leave the coach anywhere except at Marlborough - two of them got out at Kingston Church, the prisoner I believe was one of them; the other two got out at the end of Sloane-street. I came on to the end of Lad-lane. Nobody else had got inside the coach till I left, except the guard, who got in at the Gloucester coffee-house. I afterwards saw the prisoner at Giltspur-street Compter, and at the Mansion House. I never had any doubt of the prisoner. I am quite positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is your sight good - A. Very good. I never saw anybody like the prisoner - he wore a black coat and waistcoat, and blue trowsers - he had a handkerchief tied round his head. I did not see the guard take any parcels out at the Gloucester coffee-house. I dare say he was in the coach about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I keep the Rose and Crown, in Goswell-street. I have known the prisoner sometime; I remember seeing him at my house on the 4th of January, on Tuesday - he first came about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and I saw him again about half-past two. He called for a glass of ale, and a young man named Collard, who was in the taproom, drank it from him; he called for a second glass, which my wife served him with, and Collard drank that too - they appeared to be acquainted. I went into the cellar, my beer being off, and and while I was there the prisoner called for a third glass, I heard him. Collard tried to play the same trick, and when I had been in the cellar a few minutes I heard some words between them, and a carpenter, who was repairing the cellar stairs, said,</p>
               <p>"Landlord, you had better go up, the men are quarrelling." I went into the taproom, found them fighting, and tried to part them. Collard had got the prisoner under the table, I pulled him away; he came with violence against me, and struck me - he hit me twice because I would not let him fight, and nearly knocked one of my teeth out. The prisoner got a terrible black eye, and his coat was torn in the fight - the flap was torn nearly off - a gentleman assisted me to part them. The prisoner then came into the parlour, and one Allen, who came in, lent him his coat, while his own was sent to Sherwood's, the tailor, to be mended.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the 4th of January - A. Because on the 3d I went to my brewers to pay half a year's rent, said the cellar stairs wanted repairing, and next day the carpenter came to do them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. About a year. He might call at my house about once a month. He went by the nick-name of Lord Wellington. The man who fought with him lived somewhere in Spitalfields. I had a sore mouth from the blow he gave me for above a week. We settled it between us - he treated me with a glass of brandy to wash my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear of the prisoner being taken up on this charge - A. I cannot say. I did not go to the Mansion House. I was subpoened here the Sessions before last - I mentioned it to no one; they mentioned it to me when they brought the subpoena, I then remembered it. I cannot say when the prisoner was at my house before - he did not come often.</p>
               <p>Q. He never came to tell you how bad his eye was - A. Yes, he did the next night - the man he fought with and the tailor were there on that night, to the best of my recollection. My wife is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak of his being at your house at any other time - A. No.</p>

On the 4th of January I was sent to repair the cellar stairs at the Rose and Crown, it was on Tuesday. While I was there there was a skirmish between the prisoner and another man, who is not here; the prisoner got a black eye. The landlord was there and parted them - he got a blow himself. I remained there till six o'clock; the prisoner had his coat torn. I called the landlord out of the cellar to part them. The coat was sent to Sherwood's, the tailor.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where do you live - A. In Joiner-street, Commercial-road. I know it was on the 4th of January, because I keep an account of my work. I never saw the prisoner before - I only saw him then for a moment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the longest time that you think you saw the prisoner - A. Ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you have-got from a moment to ten minutes! - A. I heard a skirmish, went up, and saw them parted.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first spoken to about coming here - A. In February. I did not go to the Mansion House. I should not know the man he fought with again, but I took more notice of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They were both equally strangers to you - A. Both. His coat was torn before I got up. I noticed the prisoner because of his black eye - I did not notice the other.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been sworn that in the April and May Sessions he was here, did you see him to know him - A.No; I was here with the witnesses.</p>

            . I live at No. 93, Leather-lane; the prisoner lodged with me; he came a fortnight before Christmas, and left the latter end of January, when he was apprehended. He might have slept out for one night - I never recollect his sleeping out two nights together; he occasionally had the key. It is my belief he was not absent two nights together.</p>
               <p>MR. HONE. Q. What is your husband - A. A printer, at the Sun newspaper office. I will not swear he was not absent two nights together.</p>

On the night of the 29th of May my barn was broken open, and about eight sacks of wheat stolen, which were loose on the floor. I saw it the morning before, and guessed the quantity to be about six quarters. Some wheat was dropped from where they had carried it on their backs to about two hundred yards off, where I suppose they loaded it. There is a mark as if the whole quantity had been pitched there. I traced the tracks of a horse and cart from there back again into the road. Best lived with me two years ago - Bolton keeps a horse and cart.</p>

            . On the 5th of June I was sitting on Mr. Broadwood's steps, and saw the prisoner going down the area; he came up again, and said to two men who were waiting for him, that the lady would not give so much for the things. The two men sat on the steps, and held me, to prevent my giving any alarm, and told me not to ring the bell. The prisoner went down, lifted up the sash a little, and then flew back to the area steps; he then went into the pantry, put the trowsers into his basket, which had shavings in it, and put the handkerchief into his pocket. He lifted the window up higher, jumped out, ran up, and threw the basket over the rails of the square. The cook and I followed the prisoner, the others ran down Cadogan-place. The prisoner was stopped, and the cook took the handkerchief out of his pocket. I got the basket over the rails.</p>

I was with her an hour or two at the Jolly Sailors, till twelve or one o'clock; it being then late, I went to her lodgings, and was there till between two and three. I locked the door, put the key into my pocket, and took my notes out in her presence, to satisfy myself that they were safe. I only took my coat off and put it under the pillow. I was awoke in about half an hour by the door opening; I then found my coat at the bottom of the bed, and my notes gone, but the pocket-book remained - the prisoner had then got outside the door. I called for a light, they said they would bring me a knife if I did not immediately leave the house - there were ten or twelve persons in the house. I was struck with a shovel in the house, and terribly ill-used. Immediately as I said I would give her into custody, the prisoner made a blow at my head, I warded it off.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Watch about 20 minutes past two o'clock, and found West at the door in a terrible bustle. I asked for a light, one was brought, he said he had been robbed of three 1 l. notes. I found the prisoner standing at the foot of the bed - she wished to be searched - I found nothing on her. Four or five men and different women were in the house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking with my child, and met him with Jones, and they took me into a house, we eat and drank there, he was very tipsy. I took my child home and returned to him, he followed me home - and when I asked him for a compliment, he charged me with robbing him of his watch - he found that safe, and then charged me with stealing the notes - he struck me with the handle of the brush.

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. On Thursday, the 8th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I found the prisoners, and two others in company, coming up Bagnigge Wells-road, and coming across the fields. I followed them - Kirkman had the jacket with the trowels under his arm; and the one who ran away had another bundle under his arm. Griffiths was in company with Kirkman. When I came up to the Small-pox Hospital, I stopped Kirkman, and asked what he had there - he said they were his brother's tools which he had brought from the building. I asked where his brother worked - he said he would show me; when he turned round to go, he said, No, they were not his brother's, but that Dunn gave them him to carry. I said I should take him into custody. Griffiths walked away - I made no charge against him as I knew where he lived - I took him at his mother's door.</p>

             together on Thursday evening, a little before eight o'clock. He asked if I wanted to buy any plasterer's tools - said he had found some in a field, but he thought they had been stolen, and he took and hid them again. They asked if I would come and see them. Kirkman was standing by when I met them, and he asked if he should come and see them - they went and fetched them, and brought them to us. They told us to wait at the end of the field by Bagnigge-Wells, and they would fetch them. They showed them to us in that field, which is about a quarter of a mile from Harrison-street. When I saw them, I said they did not suit me, that my master found me in tools, and that I did not want to buy them. I have known Kirkman eight or nine years, and know Griffiths also - they live in the same neighbourhood. Kirkman carried the tools, and they asked me to carry the brushes for them, which I did, and gave them to Griffiths again, when we came into Weston-street, where he lived. I do not know what has become of them. I gave them to him before he came to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280049"/>mother's door.

I found my booth was cut open. I heard my bed and blankets were found at Hyde's - he keeps a drinking booth - I went and found twenty or thirty persons there. I found Martin there, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jackson, what are you come here for?" - I said I had lost something. I set two men to watch the booth, and fetched a constable. Moss called me, and I found Martin in his custody - a pelisse, the stockings, cap, and bonnet, were found on him. I found the rest of the property in Hyde's booth and secured him.</p>

            . I am a servant to Jackson. About three o'clock in the morning I went into Hyde's booth, Martin came in and said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose that **** has come to look after the bed and blankets, knock his head off his shoulders." I made no reply, but came out; and in about ten minutes I saw him come out with a bonnet and bundle - he dropped the bundle. I pursued him and took him with the bonnet in his hand. I picked up the bundle and knew the property. I afterwards went to the booth, and found the other things in the morning.

I refused, she instantly put her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took 5 d. out; she would not return it, but said she would spend it - we went to a public-house, and had two glasses of gin with it - when we came out, it struck me, that as she took my halfpence, she might take my watch - and I put my chain down into my fob, on the notes - she walked on, and insisted on my going further with her. I said I would not, she instantly put her hand into my fob, and got the watch and notes out. I caught the watch in her hand as she pulled it out - I took it from her, and put it in again. I then felt and missed the notes, she ran down a passage, and was taken about two hours after - as the publican knew her, and gave information. She went by the name of Modest Mary. I was with them when she was taken, about twenty yards from where I was robbed. I positively swear she was the woman.</p>

I followed him in the middle of the street, and hardly lost sight of him two seconds before I found him in custody, and am certain he is the person who stood close to me. I found a link of my chain broken, and the ring left, and the rest was gone with the key. He denied it at first, but when he found I was determined to give him in charge, he asked me to go back, and I should find the chain, but I did not. Nobody but him could have taken it.</p>

The witness, Foort, had been six or seven weeks in my service - Stiff hired him, and caused him to be discharged. Foort charged Stiff with stealing hay. I said then I was satisfied it was not true, and was ready to give him every assistance to punish the boy for so false a charge. About two days after Stiff took a warrant out against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. The charge for stealing hay was made by Foort, after Stiff took him before a Magistrate for an assault - A. No: he informed me of it two days before.</p>

            . I was stable-boy in Mr. Alston's service. The first week I went into his service, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw a cart drawn up to the loft-door, and hay pushed into it - I did not see Lucy with the cart then, but have seen him three times with it before, at the same place. Stiff put three or four trusses of hay into it, apparently - nobody but him had an opportunity of doing it - the loft communicates with his bedroom. When the cart drove away, some hay was scattered over the ground, and Stiff swept it up to the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you come from before you lived with Mr. Alston - A. I came from Ruslip parish, but had only been in town a short time. I told Mr. Alston I had lately come from the country.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard you was to be discharged, did you not use violent language to Stiff - A. No: I only d - d him, and said I would talk to his master, and then I should be sure to do him. I made no charge against him before, because I thought he had got me the place.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was standing nearly at the top of Swan-yard, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner come hastily through the posts, from Swan-yard, into White Hart-yard. I heard the cry of Stop thief immediately, and supposing him to be the thief, I ran across to take him, but he passed me. The road being up from one end to the other, he stumbled, and I secured him. Mr. Kipling immediately came up and said he was the man. Nobody was between him and the prosecutor.</p>

On the 13th of June the prisoner came and took a bed for the night - he slept in the same room with me and went to bed first. When I went to bed I had 17 s. 6 d. in my pocket, and a new pair of breeches laid on the table. A soldier, who slept with the prisoner, awoke me about five o'clock, and asked me if I knew when the man went away? I said No, and immediately missed my money and the breeches. A few days afterwards I saw him in custody; he offered me a silver watch and other things if I would let him go - I refused.</p>

            . My husband is a broker. On the 26th of January, at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house in Nottingham-court, Holborn - I immediately sent for Mr. Shew, as I knew him to be the man who stole the first two chairs; I also sent for an officer, and detained him with assistance. He struck me, and threatened to send my head through the wall if I did not loose him. He had at this time brought two chairs up the court to my house, and wanted 5 s. each for them. I gave one of them into my lodger's hands - the prisoner immediately took the other, and was going to run off with it, but I secured him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 6th of June I was in the Strand, and saw the prisoner in company with two others; I suspected and watched them, as they followed the prosecutor - one of them took the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into the prisoner's hand; I siezed him, took it out of his hand, and called to the prosecutor, who claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in South Audley-street, saw the prisoners, and watched them for near half an hour. I saw them go up to Smith; Jones leant his left hand against his right arm, and with his right hand took the watch out, and gave it to Bunn. I stepped over and told Smith his watch was gone, and to follow me. I ran and seized Bunn, he had his left hand in his breeches pocket. I pulled it out, seized it with the watch in it, and took it from him - several desperate characters tried to rescue him - we kept him at the risk of our lives, and at last got him to the watch-house. Smith assisted in securing Jones; one of them struck me over the head, and said nobody should take him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in South Audley-street, and observed the prisoner there and Mr. Demole - a carriage was coming by Mr. Alderman Wood's house - the prosecutor was in the thickest of the crowd - as the carriage passed I saw a boy go behind him, and make a motion. I thought he cut his seals off. I jumped over and laid hold of the prisoner, who was before the prosecutor; the boy got away. I saw the seal fall in the road, it appeared to fall from the prisoner. I secured him, and he denied it.</p>

            . I work at the house. I left a little after six o'clock - all was then safe. I returned at half-past nine o'clock, and stopped there an hour, in consequence of suspicion. I heard some person coming down stairs. The prisoner came into the room where I was concealed with a bag on his back. He looked out of window to see if any one was watching him, as the watch-house is opposite, and then turned and walked down stairs. I went to the window, and told the watchman, who was coming by, to stop him - he brought a light, and I unlocked the door. He came in and found the prisoner concealed under a work-bench. The bag was behind the street-door with 60 lbs. of lead in it, which was afterwards fitted to the roof and tallied with it.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old. I live in Cow-yard, Hampstead, and work for Miss Colebrook. About eleven o'clock in the morning of Friday, the 16th of June, I saw the prisoners in her field, where some linen was hanging to dry - there is a high gate with spikes to it. I saw them take these things off the lines, and go across the fields with them. I went into the kitchen and told the servants - they were taken on the Tuesday following. The linen has not been found. I am sure they are the boys; Preston took the things, and Jones stood by him.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BAILEY. I live at the London-tavern. On Sunday evening the 4th of June, about nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18200628-163-crimeloc890">Chiswell-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200628-163-crimeloc890" type="placeName" value="Chiswell-street"/>

                        targets="t18200628-163-off888 t18200628-163-crimeloc890"/> with some friends - I observed two persons close behind me. I suspected them, and kept my eye on them. I put my hand to my pocket, and found my handkerchief was safe, in a few minutes I saw them again close behind me - I walked on, and in a few seconds I put my hand to my pocket and missed it; nobody was near me but them. I observed the prisoner and the other then across the road. I watched till the prisoner got to the corner of Lamb's passage, I immediately ran across the road and saw him with the other, who was not above twelve years old, with the handkerchief, looking at it by the gas, both were examining it. I seized the boy being the the nearest - they both had it in their hands. The moment I seized the boy, I lost sight of it, and the prisoner ran away. I let the boy go and followed him, calling Stop thief! he ran about one hundred and fifty yards, and was stopped without my losing sight of him. I took him into a public-house, he said if I would take him into the street, he would take me to the boy who had the handkerchief. I did so, and when he got five or six yards from the door, he made a terrible noise, crying out for a lad who had found a handkerchief. I thought I would get him back to the public-house, and did so with much difficulty - and at the door he was seized by three or four girls, who wanted to rescue him, but the watchman took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Some gentlemen said if I went out I should find it. I know nothing of it.</p>

            . I live at Stoke Newington. On the 15th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was passing through the Shepherd and Sheperdess-fields, Islington; a young man in a sailor's dress got into conversation with me about the weather, till I came to the beginning of the fields, and there four or six boys stood by the post, they followed me very close, the sailor kept in my company, and left me at the foot of the bridge, and when I came to the top of the bridge, a young man ran after me, and said my pocket was picked. I immediately missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw the prisoner, and another of the gang in custody, about fifty yards off. My handkerchief was produced.</p>

            . I am a florist. I was in my garden looking over the fence, and saw the prisoner and three or four boys close behind Mr. Dinn, a sailor was talking to him. I saw one of the four boys take a handkerchief from him. I ran and informed him, and laid hold of the prisoner and another of them, and gave them up to Mr. Dinn, one of the others had thrown the handkerchief over the paling. I got over and returned it to Dinn.</p>

I showed her some - she wished somebody to go with her as far as the Good Samaritan, to show them to her mistress. I took three half-dozen, and went with her. When we got to the house she took them from me, wrapped them in a handkerchief, and said she did not wish the master to see them, as her mistress wanted to replace them unknown to him. She wished me to stop outside, while she went in, to enquire if her master was come home. She went in, the door being half open, returned, and said her master had come home unexpectedly, and asked me to go into the parlour, or I might leave them with her mistress myself. I went in, she shut the door, and directly after returned, saying, she wished me to have something to drink, that her master should not suspect anything. I said I was not in the habit of drinking, and she brought me a glass of beer, which she said her mistress sent me. She went out and shut the door, saying, she was going to her mistress. She had the eighteen spoons, and I saw no more of her. I enquired at the bar, and they knew nothing of her. I went to different pawnbrokers, who had been served the same way. I found her on Saturday week at Goodburn's, a pawnbroker, where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280063"/>she had been stopped. I am positive she is the person. Six spoons were found at Avila's, a pawnbroker, in Mile-end-road - he is not here. Another half-dozen were found at Reynolds's, another pawnbroker. I am certain they are my master's - I have no doubt of it.</p>

He ran up Lamb's-passage, a young man got behind him and pursued him; being lame, I missed him. I am certain of his person - it was just under a gas-light. I informed the officer in about half an hour. I never saw the young man after, and suspect he was one of the gang. I saw the prisoner about three quarters of an hour after, among a famous gang of them, in Chequer-alley, in a coffee-shop. I knew him directly, and pointed him out from above ten others.</p>

He pointed him out the moment he went into the coffee-shop. While I was securing him, some of the party left the shop; and as I brought him down the steps, he struggled to get away, and, with the assistance of the gang, he got away. Several then rushed out of the shop. I secured him within twenty yards of the shop - some seized my arms, and others shook and beat me most horribly.</p>
