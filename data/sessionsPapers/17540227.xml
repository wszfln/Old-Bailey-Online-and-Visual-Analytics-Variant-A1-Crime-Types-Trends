I came to myself, and said, O Lord, I think you have almost killed me. They said, G - d d - n you, if you speak another word we will kill you quite. They took my watch by cutting the glove in two, and left the string, seal, and key, which were found there the next morning. Then one of them gave me a drive on the side of the head, and said if I offered to call after them they would come back and murder me.

I let him have 25 s. and the old watch, but if he came in a fortnight, I was to let him have it again, and take half a crown of him. A night or two after I read in the Advertiser a watch, name Ingraham, describing it to be the same I had received. I went away to the prosecutor's house by the direction of the advertisement. He was not at home, but the next morning he came to me, and I delivered him the watch, [produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor as his watch, which he was robbed of at the time mentioned] I said if I ever saw the man that brought it I would stop him: But it past on till the same month the next year, when this

I then did not recollect him again; Hore said, sir, your servant will not take my money, you should use me well, for I have dealt in your shop before. Then I began to think I had seen him, I looked at him, and said, sir, I believe I sold you a watch once. He said it was something of that kind. Sir, said I, I believe instead of selling you one it was but an exchange. He said that was very right. Then I said, I will buy my own watch of you again if you do not like it. Then he pulled it out of his pocket, and said, with all his heart. Then there came in two men that I used to trade with, I took the case in one hand and box in the other, and got to the door, then said to the two gentlemen, I desire you to assist me, this man is a robber. He said he could produce pe ople enough to his honesty, for he had bought the watch I charged him with in Cheapside of two men, he desired we would not expose him, and he would send for his friends. Soon after we took him before Justice Rickards, and he was committed till next morning, when we took him to the Angel and Crown, where the Justices sit in White-Chapel. At first he said he bought it of two men, but at last he confessed he was guilty of the fact with the two prisoners. Westbrook and Arnold were brought there. Hore looked Westbrook in the face, and cried, and said to the Justices, I am heartily sorry for Westbrook, for I believe he did not then know of our robbing the man, having met with him by chance in the street, and that he had not a farthing of the money, and that Westbrook went from them in fifteen minutes after. He said whoever sold the watch was to have the most part of the booty, and the other old watch he kept himself.</p>

We all four agreed to drink at the Bull's Head in Bull-and-Mouth-street, and after we had been there some time, Summers and Arnold got up and went to the door, and they started the question to Westbrook and me, to go and rob the first man we met. Being in liquor we agreed to go with them, Summers had a stick, and Arnold had a screw barrel pistol. We walked about to where Summers and Arnold took us, which was into Gough Square, Fleet-street, but could find nothing. Summers said, if he could see a servant maid come out with a cup or silver mug, which he had seen people come to the Cheshire Cheese for beer with, he would knock her down and take it. Then Summers proposed to go into Moor-Fields to rob the first man we met. Westbrook agreed as we did, we were all together. Then we met with a gentleman, whom we past by, and then Westbrook and I would have gone home, but the others insisted on our staying. So we did, and came down the middle quarter, and met this Mr. Harper; Arnold went up to him first, and asked him what it was o'clock; he said he believed it had just struck eight; then Arnold asked him for his money; he said he had none; then Summers came up with a pistol in his hand, and run it against the prosecutor's head, and knocked him against the pales; then they insisted upon the watch; they felt about, and I clapped my hand on the man's shoulder, and drawing it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270006"/> down felt something in his waistcoat pocket. I said here is something, I believe it is his watch. Then Arnold pulled a knife out of his pocket, and swore he would cut all the cloths off his back if he would not deliver the watch. Then I went from them; he cut the glove and string of the watch through, and took the watch. I saw him slip it into the waistband of his breeches, but he thought nobody had seen him take it. He gave the fingers of the glove to Summers, and Westbrook asked him what he had got: He said nothing, he thought there had been money in it, but there was none. Then we walked up Houndsditch and into White Chapel, and there we all agreed to go home when we were at the top of the Minories.</p>

I asked Arnold where Summers was; he said he was gone to dispose of the watch, but in about a quarter of an hour Summers came in with the watch, and said he would not go with it any more. Then Arnold and I was asked, but we both refused it. Then it was proposed, whoever disposed of it should have Westbrook's part, as he knew nothing of it. Then I took it, and went to this gentleman's house in the Minories, and there disposed of it for 25 s and a shagreen watch. He gave me an 18 s. piece, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. to Palace. Is this true?</p>
               <p>Palace. It is. I gave him an 18 s. piece, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Evidence continues. I went and told them I had got two guineas for it, and gave Summers the 18 s. piece and 3 s. in silver to be between them, so had 4 s. and the shagreen watch; then I left them together.</p>

               <p>Hore. I went there to buy a pair of pistols for Arnold, and it was a good providenc it was prevented, for we should very likely have done some mischief with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell them you had sold the watch for two guineas, when you had sold it but for 25 s. and an old watch?</p>
               <p>Hore. Summers told me he was offered two guineas for it at Mr. Briscoe's.</p>

I took out half a guinea and three shillings, and gave the man. Then he opened the door and lean'd in and took my watch out of my fob, and said, drive on coachman, I have got his watch. There was another man on the other side the coach; I saw three in all, th ey were on foot; I went the same day and advertised my watch, and offered two guineas reward; and on the Saturday morning, the 2d of Feb. a pawnbroker and another gentleman came in and asked me if I was not robbed of a watch? I said, I had, and the maker's name was Kimbershaw; and there was a ribbon, and a small crystal stone set in silver; the pawnbroker told me, it was brought to him the morning before, at about nine o'clock, I lost it about two. He said it was brought by a man in a plaid waistcoat, a blue-grey coat, and a great coat over them; he did not deliver it, but I bid him keep it, and if any body came for it to secure them. After he was gone, I had some business at justice Fielding's: when I came in, there stood the Prisoner at the bar on his examination for what he had done the night before with one Wilson, who was with him; he answered the description the pawnbroker had given of the man and his dress that pawned my watch, and I told the justice's clerk of it: then I sent for the pawnbroker to come; he did, and brought my watch with him: as soon as he saw the Prisoner, he said, that is the man that brought the watch to me yesterday morning, pointing to him; then he and Wilson were brought in again before the justice and examined about my robbery; there I swore to the watch, and when I was robbed of it; and Davison the pawnbroker, to the Prisoner, as the person that brought it to him, and they were committed, Wilson to Newgate, and Dean to New-Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Can he swear I was the man that robbed him of his watch?</p>
               <p>Parham. I do not pretend to swear to the man, but by his voice I believe he is the man. His is like the voice that said, Drive on coachman, I have got his watch; there was a lamp by us.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Parham. I am the Prosecutor's wife, I am sure the Prisoner is the man that came into the coach and took Mr. Parham's watch out of his pocket. I saw him at New-Prison afterwards; it was overagainst a lamp in Hockley-in-the-Hole, where we were stopped by three fellows; one fired a pistol in the coach, and with a great oath said, Deliver your money, or I will blow your brains out: I cannot tell who said that, but the Prisoner was at the other door; he asked my husband for his money, or said we were dead people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face at that time?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Parham. No, I did not; I said, do not use us ill, you shall have all we have got, and my husband gave him what money he had. The man answered, what do you mean by giving me half-pence, or three halfpence? I said, he has no half-pence in his pocket; then the coach-door was opened, and he lean'd against me, when I had an opportunity of seeing his face by the light of the lamp; it was a dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pistol loaded ?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Parham. I believe it had nothing but powder in it; when I came home I was very bad. When the pawnbroker came and asked if my husband was robbed of a watch, I said, yes; and he described the person that brought it; then I said, that was the man that took the watch from my husband. As soon as I saw him in New-Prison, I said to my husband, that is the man that took your watch. I went and asked the keeper to give the Prisoner leave to drink a glass of wine with us; I said, how came you to rob us last night, and fire a pistol? he took hold of my hand, and said, for God's sake do not appear against me: if he had been amongst a hundred persons, I should have picked him out.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the first of this month the Prisoner at the bar brought this watch (producing one which was deposed to by the Prosecutor) to me; he had on a blue grey coat, a plaid waistcoat, and a great coat over them. I saw him before the justice the next day, he had every thing then on that I had described before.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you lend him on the watch?</p>
               <p>Davison. Thirty-six shillings, he asked me two guineas. He said, he had been at Chatham, and was very well known in Bishopsgate street, if I inquired at such an inn; and said, he was afraid of being pressed, and wanted to pawn his watch to get down another way.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I was six nights locked down under ground, and was not admitted to come between the gates; so the woman could not see me the night they were robbed. I was at supper at Mr. Nicholas's in Old-street, from nine at night 'till three the next morning</p>
               <p>Mr. Richards. I am a farrier in Goswell street, I have known the Prisoner ten years and upwards, he drove a hackney coach; I never heard any ill of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young. I am an undertaker, and live in Old-street; I imploy his master, the Prisoner has drove many times for me, he has as good a character as ever I heard; I never heard any blemish on his character; he would be the last man I should think to be guilty of a highway-robbery.</p>
               <p>Isaac Dimsdel. I keep coaches. The Prisoner has been my servant the two last years, I have known him twelve years; he has bore the character of a very sober honest man, and behaved as faithfully as any man of his profession ever did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rearsby. I am an officer in the Marshal's Court, I have known him fifteen or sixteen years; I took him to be a very honest young man. He had money of his own, and had no occasion to go a-robbing; he was going to buy a coach and horses of his own, and I advised him not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benson. I have known him nine years and upwards, during which time he bore a very good character; I should as soon have suspected my own brother to have been guilty of a robbery as him.</p>

The coach stopped, and he immediately came to the coach-door, and put his pistol to my breast, and ordered me to sit down and behave quietly, for then I was endeavouring to get out at that door; he said, he would use us like gentlemen; I sat down. Then the shutter on my side was let down, and Wilson looked in and presented a small pistol to me, and kept his hand in motion, and held it to me some time, a little distance from my breast: he demanded my watch and money, I gave him a guinea and some silver, I believe about three or four shillings; then he put his hand to my fob, to feel for my watch, but did not find it, although then in my fob. After this they went away. I pulled out my watch then, and found it to be twenty minutes after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in rifling you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270011"/>Jones. They were by the coach about three minutes, I am certain to the two prisoners by their shape, their voices, and every thing that a man's eyes or ears can tell by; and they being so soon after taken I had not lost the idea of them. Wilson had a black patch under his left eye. I had also remarked the horse pistol, which was a very remarkable one, with a brass barrel. Dean had been in the coach, and had rifled Mr. Lane. He leaving the coach door open, as soon as they were gone we both got out. Immediately there was a gentleman came up to us, and asked us if we had been robbed; we said yes; he said he thought so, and that he saw the two men run down a narrow street. We followed them, and they were secured under a lamp by Mr. Welch the high constable and six or seven other constables, in about four minutes after they left us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you called out thieves?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, we had not. I described them to Mr. Welch before I saw them. Then he said he had them in custody; and we saw them afterwards, and they answered our descriptions perfectly. The black patch was in the scuffle fallen off Wilson's face, but found by one of the constables where he was stopped, and it seemed to be fresh knocked off. They were lodged in New Prison that night, and the next day carried before Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lane. I was in the coach along with Mr. Jones on the first of February when he was robbed. I was asleep at the time Dean came to the coach, but was awaked by his opening the coach door. He came into the coach, and held a pistol to my breast, (I observed a long brass barrel pistol in his hand by the light of the moon) he put his hand into my pocket and drew out my watch. I saw a man in a light-coloured coat on the other side of the coach, which I am positively sure was the other prisoner Wilson. I cannot say I heard him demand any thing of Mr. Jones, who was on that side, being entirely taken up with Dean. I could see the two prisoners plainly by the light of the moon, I imagine they were with us about three or four minutes. After they were gone we jumped out of the coach, and there was a little exciseman came to us, and asked if we had been robbed; we said yes; he said he thought so, and that they went down a narrow street. We followed them, and found them in the hands of Mr. Welch the constable. When I saw them again I was very positive to both of them, and I particularly described Dean before I saw him to Mr. Welch.</p>

            . I am a constable, on the first of January Mr. Welch was out with several of us to search bad houses for disorderly people. Going along Puckeridge-street, about half an hour after eleven, in the middle of the street, Mr. Welch being foremost, we met the two prisoners coming along. Mr. Welch asked who they were, they gave no answer, but seemed to be in a hurry; all on a sudden I saw they had pistols, and laid hold of Dean. Mr. Welch said this fellow has got a pistol, (meaning Wilson) I left Dean in the hands of two other constables, and went to Wilson, who was then down on the ground. As soon as I came he put this pistol to my breast [producing a small pocket pistol] and was some time before I could get it out of his hand, and examining it afterwards found it to be loaded with powder and ball, and primed. The other constable that had hold of him on the other side, found another pistol in his pocket, and after we had got him up on his legs, came Mr. Jones with a stick, and Mr. Lane with a sword drawn in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had stopped them?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was about two minutes after; I heard Mr. Jones describe Dean to Mr. Welch and Mr. Lane the other.</p>

I followed him, and saw him slip something into his pocket. Then he crossed the way again, and I still followed him. He stopped in Grocer's Alley, but I desired him to go on, and said I did not care to trust him behind me but he refused so to do, and then I said to him, I believe you have got my handkerchief. He ran as hard as he could; I cried out; stop thief, he was stopped in the Old Jury, and near the place where he was stopped the handkerchief was found. [Produced in court and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrot. I was in the Old Jury on Friday was se'nnight, and heard the cry, stop thief. Mr. Wright who was with me stopped the prisoner at the bar, and assistants that followed laid hold on him. The prosecutor said he had lost a handkerchief, and I observed something like one fly and drop as the prisoner was stopped; upon which I went to the place and took up this handkerchief which the prosecutor has swore to.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the handkerchief dropped from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Barrot. I cannot say that.</p>

I said what is that for? he said he would tell me presently. I ran for some body to assist me, then he called out, stop thief. I was so stunned by the blow I did not know which way I ran, and they stopped me and dragged me about.</p>

I asked her, if I should fetch the gentlewoman's daughter, for her to talk to: I fetched her. The Prisoner said to her, she would work for her as long as she lived, 'till she had worked it out. I left them together. After which the Prisoner said to me, if I would go along with her and no body else, she would go and fetch the two stars. I did not think proper to go along with her.</p>

            . I lost two holland shirts within a fortnight, about a fortnight ago. Upon suspecting the Prisoner, who was servant at Mrs. Grant's, where I live, his box was searched by Mr. Eager and Mr. Ridge. One shirt produced in Court and deposed to: which was one that they brought down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you asked him after these shirts?</p>
               <p>Tavan. I did, and he denied knowing any thing of them. Then I produced the shirt, and told him, it was taken out of his own box; he persisted upon having no knowledge of it. I took him before a magistrate, then he said the washerwoman brought it among his linnen.</p>

I belong to Westminster-school, and board at Mrs. Grant's, the Prisoner was servant there; I went and looked in the Prisoner's box, he being suspected to have taken several things, and at the bottom of it I found this shirt, here produced. It was clean, and folded up. This was not his proper box, in which he used to put his linnen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked?</p>
               <p>Ridge. It was, but we found the key in another box of his.</p>

               <p>Mr. Eager. I was present with Mr. Ridge at the searching the Prisoner's box. He confirmed the account given by Mr. Ridge.</p>

            . I live servant with Mr. Partington, the candlesticks, nozels, china cup and saucer belonged to my master. When I came down stairs on the 5th of February I found the pantry door open, which I had locked before I went to bed, and the sash of the kitchen window half up, which used to be shut over night. The prisoner was <rs id="t17540227-24-deflabel136" type="occupation">cook</rs>

I missed three guineas of my own from out of the pantry, which I had received the night before. My mistress came down, and in looking in the dust hole found two silver candlesticks shoved down therein, and a pair of black breeches put on them, and a snuff-box which I had put my money into the night before was found likewise in the dust hole. We were all to be examined, and our boxes to be searched. In the prisoner's pocket was found a china cup and saucer wrapt up. Then she was charged with taking the other things by my master; which she denied at first. The prisoner had a pantry which belonged to her, of which she had the key, and she said with that key, by giving my pantry door a little shake got it open, took my money, and threw it into the house of office, but said she did not take the candlesticks, or know how they came there. When she found the house of office was to be searched, she said she threw the money, with 22 s. of her own, out at a window. She was examined if any other person was concerned with her; she denied there was for some time, but at last said there was, but did not know who they were.</p>

A chest of drawers of mine was searched, and so was the prisoner; I was present when the two silver candlesticks were taken out of the dust-hole. I heard the prisoner own she took the three guineas, and she said at the same time that she did not take the candlesticks, and also that she had thrown the money, with about 22 s. of her own, down into the vault to avoid a discovery. When the search was proposed she continued in the same story some time, but at last she said she wrapped it up in a piece of paper and threw it into the street out of the window.

            . On the 5th of February I came down as usual, my servant told me the house had been robbed, and he had lost three guineas and two silver candlesticks. I desired to know in what situation he found the window; he shewed me, and that was with the sash half up, and that the pantry door was open, and the prisoner's box open, and her caps and ruffles thrown about. She said she had lost 22 s. but had found half a crown under the table, and her silver thimble in the ashes. I examined her box, but perceived no violence on it, and the same by the pantry door and window; then I suspected it must be done by some body within side. I proposed a general search to all of the servants, and all desired it, and said they could give no account of it. Presently I saw the snuff-box taken out of the dust-box, and William said that was the box his money was in. Then looking into the dust-hole I found the two pair of breeches, and the two silver candlesticks. I said I would begin to search for the money lost, and her money which she said she had lost; she was going to run from me when I went to search her. I found a blue and white china cup in a paper, my property; and searching farther I found some of Mrs. Partington's things in her pocket. Then I sent for a constable, upon which she seemed confused, and said she had thrown the three guineas down the vault. She fell on her knees, and said she should be ruined, and that she would make up the money if I would not hurt her character. I asked if any body was concerned with her. She said there was, but after that said she did not know who it was.</p>

Alexander Layel, my fellow-apprentice, came and called me down stairs, and bid me go into my master's bed-chamber, on a night about eight or nine o'clock, about the beginning of Jan. there my master handed up to me two deal boards which he had in that day, and said to me, Jack, there is a board that stands by the building (which joined to the mad-house at the bottom of my master's garden) I will have it at night. After the board was taken up in the garret where we work, he scratched his head and said, it was a lucky hit, and would have another haul at them. [He looks at a letter.] This is my writing: I sent this to my uncle in Tower-street, who came to me afterwards with the other apprentice's brother and Mr. Blackey; my fellow-apprentice's brother read this letter to my master before my uncle and Mr Blackey; my master said after it was read, that it was a great oversight in him. I said, there is one of the boards marked J. C. above stairs; my master said, gentlemen, if you have a mind to walk up, you may see it.</p>

               <p>This comes to acquaint you, that I could not come to meet you at Islington on Sunday. My master employed me another way, not honestly; he forced me to steal two apple-trees, and a great many flower-roots, and box, for edgings of his garden. Every night he takes something or other out of doctor Battey's garden. Lately he took two deals out of the bricklayer's scaffold, worth two shillings or half a crown, and many other things. I desire you will find some remedy for it, or the consequence may be bad. Pray get some relief for me if you can.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old; I have served four months all but six days to the Prisoner. My master went over the wall and took two deal boards from the bricklayer's scaffold, and handed them over to me, from out of doctor Battey's garden, about eight or nine o'clock at night, I do not know the day. He bade me go up to my fellow-apprentice and send him down to his bed-chamber to take the two boards in at the window, which he did with my help. There was J. C. on one of them. I was in the parlour when this letter was read to him; he told them, they acted like gentlemen of prudence, because they took a step not to injure his character: he owned it was all fact. He went and opened the window and bade them look out, and they might see the trees and things in the garden, and if they would go up stairs, they might see the boards.</p>

            . The evidence Abbot that has been examined is my brother's son, I live in Tower-street. I received this letter from him, and went after that in company with Mr. Blackey and Mr. Layel to the Prisoner's house; there Mr. Layel read this letter to him; he confessed to the trees that we saw growing in his garden, and said, it was a thing that he should not have done, and begged we would not take away the boys; he did not deny taking the boards, and said the boys should go up stairs and shew them to us, but we did not go up to see them.</p>

            . I live in Gracechurch-street, the youngest apprentice is my nephew. I went with the last evidence and Mr. Layel to the Prisoner's house; Mr. Layel read this letter over to him, he confessed the charge in it: we desired to have the boys away; he said he would discharge the boys with all his heart, and that it was a very prudent step in us to come in that manner, and not to expose his character; and said, some of the boards were put upon the summer-house in his garden. We relied upon his promise, and he appointed to meet us in Tower-street, at Mr. Temple's; there he refused to deliver up the boys indentures and bonds, and summoned them to return. We applied to a justice of the peace, and he bound us over to prosecute.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and am building and repairing a mad-house for doctor Battey at Islington. I was sent for to come to justice Fielding's; there I was told, that a deal of things were taken from doctor Battey's grounds; the two boys were sworn; they said the same as now. I dare say doctor Battey would have given the Prisoner a load of trees, if he had asked for them. I heard the doctor say he had given the Prisoner's wife liberty to take the trees and odd bits of wainscot to help to build an arbour. The doctor went into the garden after this, and said in my hearing, all the things were not worth a shilling, had there been as much more, and that he was very welcome to as many more. The boys mentioned two boards before the justice, marked J. C. I mark my scaffolding-boards so. I ordered my man that has the care of the scaffolding to see if any were missing, neither he or I missed any. The boys then said they were two white deals, but mine are all yellow ones.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you miss deals from your scaffolding?</p>

               <p>Chidley. NO, upon my oath I do not. The two boys came to me about a month after the time they said they were taken, and told me of it: I said, why did not you tell me at that time? they said, they had not come then, but it was in order to get away their indentures; they pretended there was a great deal of wainscot taken. I got a search warrant and searched the Prisoner's premises, I found no scaffolding-boards or wainscot. I was asked to prosecute this man at the justice's, I said, would you have me prosecute a man when I find nothing upon him? I went away; after that two constables came and fetched me back by the arms, and I was bound over to prosecute; after that the justice said, Sir, are you content? I said, would you have me tell a lye? I am not content; this was the blind Mr. Fielding; who said, we must prosecute this man, or we shall not get the boys discharged. This is as mere a handle of these people as ever was invented.</p>

               <p>Starkey. No, I cannot, because I could not find it; but I would venture to take my oath this iron (which was the same poker) broke the door open; for when it was put into the marks made in wrenching the door it fitted exactly, and is bent with the strain.</p>

            . The Prisoner came and called under my chamber-window at two o'clock in the morning: he called my husband twice and me once, I was awake at that time, my husband was not. Presently afterwards my neighbours called out, that Saunders was breaking the doors open, and that they heard the hen cry; with that I awaked my husband, and he got up and went down stairs directly; as soon as he came down stairs the Prisoner was gone.</p>

            . I was walking up Fleet-street, about two o'clock in the afternoon, on the 20th of February, a man followed me in a livery, whom I had never seen before; he walked along by my side some way, and asked me if I knew of any young man that wanted a place. I said I did, for I was out of place. I went along with him by his desire to Thomas Harris's house, <placeName id="t17540227-38-crimeloc204">the Black Horse in Boswell Court</placeName>

Before we had this liquor the prisoner and another man came in, and called for some beer, and talked to each other. Then they went to gaming at pricking at a string, the prisoner produced it, and said there was never such a thing in the world as that. The other person that was with him won a shilling of him; then the three men played all at it, and they asked me to play, but I would not, and said I had but a little money. I had not been there above a quarter of an hour before I said I wanted to go, but as the beer was not drank up, they wanted me to stay till it was out. I pulled out my watch to look what o'clock it was, the table being but narrow, the prisoner reached over it, and wrenched the watch out of my hand by force, and put it into his pocket, without saying a word to me. I was uneasy, and wanted it again, but one of the men took me by the arm, collared me, held his hand to my mouth, and hid my face, and the other man stood before me, and the prisoner said if I did not hold my tongue, and keep from making disturbance in the house, it should be the worse for me. Then the prisoner ran away, and as soon as the other two let me loose, I got out of the house, and called, stop thief. and many people ran after him He was presently taken, by the time he had run about 300 yards. I then charged him with stealing my watch, and carried him to Justice Fielding, who was not at home. We then carried him to the sign of the Barley-mow, where he was searched, and my watch found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in bodily fear when your watch was wrenched out of your hand?</p>

            . On the 20th of last month I was at work in the Butcher-row, and saw two men run by. About two or three minutes after there came a gentleman, who asked me if I saw two men run by. I said I had. He said run after them, one of them has robbed a man. I ran, and overtaking the prisoner, took hold of him by the collar in Carey-street. He desired I would let him go, saying, he was running after the thief himself. I held him, and presently came the prosecutor, who said, that man has robbed me of my watch. We took him to Justice Fielding's, and from thence to the Barley-mow, where he was searched, and the watch taken out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at play along with a man with this thing, [ holding a piece of list in his hand ] he came in along with the prosecutor; I will not swear to the man. They had a pint of hot, and I called for a pint of beer. I said I have got a thing in my pocket with which I will play with you who shall pay for both. He said done. I then pulled it out, we played, and I was to pay. Then the prosecutor and I played for six-pence a time, and he won six-pence of me, and after that a shilling more. He then said, what will you play for now? I said for ten guineas if you like it. He said he had not so much money, but I have my watch, which I'll lay against eight guineas. I laid my money down, and he his watch; and at that interim of time the maid came in, who saw the watch lie on the table, but we did not play till she went out again, and then I won the watch. He said it is an unlawful game, I will have it again. I said I will keep it. He said I will call out, stop thief. Then there came an Irishman, who said, if you call stop thief you will have your watch again. I ran away, and he after me.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you game with the prisoner by pricking at the lift?</p>
               <p>Pros. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose your watch at gaming?</p>
               <p>Pros. No, I did not; I did not play at all.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Had you not played with me for six-pence?</p>
               <p>Pros. No, I did not pull a six-pence nor a half-penny out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you play to see who should pay the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Pros. No, I did not, nor for any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. to Buck. When you searched the prisoner did you find any guineas upon him?</p>
               <p>Buck. No, I did not; I found six or seven shillings and six or seven counters upon him, in a purse, the money at one end and the counters at the other.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Harris's at the Black Horse in Boswell-Court, the prisoner, prosecutor, and two other men came in there all together last Tuesday was se'nnight; they had a dinner there of boiled tripe, and all dined together, and they called for a pint of beer and a pint of hot made of ale and gin. When I came in with the beer after dinner there lay a watch on the table, [here the prosecutor desired they might be examined apart, and the other evidences were put out of court] and some money; the prosecutor laid his hand on the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you see?</p>
               <p>Welch. There was some gold, about five or six guineas, but I did not stay above five minutes in the room. I listened to what they were playing at, and the prisoner said here is my gold against your watch. The prosecutor said done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which of them won?</p>
               <p>Welch. No, I did not; I had been out about a quarter of an hour, and was fitting in the back room when they were going away; then the prosecutor said he would have his watch again, and that it was not a fair game. The prisoner said he won it fairly. Then the prosecutor met an Irishman at the door, whom he told the prisoner had won his watch at playing with a garter. The Irishman said cry stop thief, and you will get your watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who dressed the dinner?</p>
               <p>Welch. The woman of the house?</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that house?</p>
               <p>Welch. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they go to dinner?</p>
               <p>Welch. Between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then Thomas Joyner, a soldier, another evidence, was called in, and all that he could say was hearsay from the last evidence; and when asked, he said the maid had lived in that house about a fortnight; and although he lived in the same house, he neither saw nor heard of any dinner the prosecutor and prisoner had dressed there.</p>
               <p>Then Sarah Elice was called in, who deposed, she had known the prisoner about seven years, and she believed him to be an honest man.</p>

               <p>Mary Crook. I was going from Brook-street to Hammersmith on the first of December last, about a quarter before five in the afternoon, on foot. I had in my hand a bundle of linen, tied up in a handkerchief, [mentioning the goods over]

Pray, said I, do not stop me, I have but a trifle in my pocket, and am a poor widow. He said, D - n you, do not tell me you are a poor widow, deliver to me what you have got upon the spot, or you are a dead woman; I will have your money or your life before you wag a step farther. The child ran from me crying, I put my hand into my pocket, and gave him about 3 s. Said he, is this all you have got. I said it was. Then he said, D - n you, what have you got in your bundle? I said nothing but a few things for myself and a child. D - n you, said he, I will have that or you are a dead woman this moment. I am fare that during this time his pistol was at my head and breast six times at least. I gave him my bundle, upon which he ran away as hard as he could, and I ran on to the child, [the bundle produced in court, all but the man's shirt, and deposed to at the property of the persons mentioned in the indictment ] I found my shift in Abbot's lodgings in a box; the other evidences will give an account of the other things.</p>

She coming home, and relating this robbery to me, some time after some of my neighbours supposing it might have been committed by one Price, told me if so, very probably the goods were to be found at a pawnbroker's, one John Clare's, in Duke-street. I got a search-warrant on the 7th of this instant February, and went and searched his apartment; he lives at the house of one Elkins, up one pair of stairs; there I found all the things mentioned in the bundle, except the shirt and shift. On the Monday after a messenger came and told me the two prisoners were in custody, and they were brought before the Justice, and there Abbot denied the robbery. The woman said the things were her property, and that she had had a child that died some time before, to which the child's cloaths belonged, and she acknowledged the pawning of them there. She passed for the prisoner Abbot's wife.</p>

About three in the morning I was going out, and in Duke-street, just by my lodgings, I met a woman with this bundle in her hand. She asked me if I would buy the things in it, and opened them; I looked at them, and asked what she would have for them. She said she was in distress for money, and would sell them for 4 s. and I unfortunately bought them of her for 2 s. 6 d. Abbot and I live together, but I mostly go by my husband's name, which was Brown; I do not say Abbot is my husband.</p>

I saw he belonged to the first regiment of guards, and he had a sword under his arm. I passed him, and he followed me apace towards Powis's wells. I was obliged to walk on the grass, and could hear his footsteps quick after me, so that I perceived he gained ground, and before I reached the stile in the second field he made a spring and got before me, and held the sword over my head in the scabbard, and asked me if I had any money. I said yes. He said give it me directly. I said I would, and desired he would not hurt me. Then he took his sword, and drew it about half out, and said, D - n you, no delay, your watch.

               <p>Pros. This is my watch which was taken from me at that time.</p>
               <p>Thomb. Last Friday in the forenoon I was sent for to the Axe-and-Gate in Downing-street. The prosecutor shewed me the prisoner, and said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270028"/> had robbed him the last night. I took him into custody; in searching his pocket I found this watch (here produced) in his fob; the seal was not on it. I asked him how he came to do such an action? he said, he owed money, and he did it on purpose to pay his debts. We took him before justice Lediard, there the Prosecutor said there was a seal to the watch when he lost it, then the Prisoner confessed he had pawned it for sixpence, to one Burch, in Charles-street, Westminster. I went, and found it accordingly. The pawnbroker said, he had it of a soldier, and described the Prisoner, and had lent him sixpence on it. The Prisoner was asked what he had done with the queen Anne's medal? he said, he had sold that at the Red-Lion, in Gray's-Inn-Lane.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went there, and found the person that had bought it, and paid him half a crown for it, and had it again.</p>

               <p>I never saw the Prosecutor till he came to take me up at the Axe-and-Gate : to be sure the watch was found upon me. I had light of a woman that sells hardware the night before, that uses the Parade in the Park, she told me she had a watch to sell, and desired I would go with her and either pawn or sell it for her; she said, she bought it for thirty-five shillings. I went to pawn it, and the pawnbroker said, he never lent above fifteen shillings on any watch: then I went to carry it back to the woman, and when I came into the house she was just gone; then this gentleman and a fellow-soldier came up to me, and said, he thought it was me that had robbed him of his watch.</p>

He bought in all my goods, served in the shop, and kept my books, and I had very great losses at the time he was my servant, but did not suspect him, till one day, my daughter being at a house in the city, about the 6th of Feb. where was the Prisoner's daughter, who said, she was going to have a new suit of cloaths, of a rich yellow tabby; and that her pappa had had it by him a great while, and it was a whole piece. My daughter told me of it when she came home; and I having lost so many things, that it is impossible to tell my losses; I made diligent search for this piece.

            . I am very sure it was not. Then I sent Mr. Manger to the mantua-maker, who, the daughter said, had it to make, for a piece of the silk, to see if it was the silk I had lost, which he did, and I have all the reason possible to believe it my silk which I missed Then I looked over my books to see when this piece came in, and found it came in in Feb. was twelve-month. Then we went and took the silk and the Prisoner before Mr. Fielding, there he was charged with taking it; he said, he bought it of a Jew, in St. Mary-Axe, for seven shillings and sixpence a yard, and that there was thirty-four yards: [she holds it in her hand.] I do verily believe it is my silk. I never since I was in business had but this one piece of such rich yellow silk, for which I gave the maker 11 s. an ell. I got a search-warrant and searched the Prisoner's house, there I found two silk handkerchiefs, one about the Prisoner's head, and the other about his neck, which I can swear to be my property: [she took them both in her hand, and measured them by one in her pocket : they were uncommon ones for largeness.] These I swear are my property. It was a piece of taffaty, of a bad colour, and I had it printed in eight handkerchiefs for my own use. I believe there is none so large, and such as these are, in London.</p>

               <p>On her cross-examination she said, she discharged the Prisoner, because he lived at a high rate, and she could not think how that could be; that she had no other yellow tabby silk in her shop, except what was in masquerade-dresses; that she strongly suspected the yellow silk to be hers, from an observation that she had before made, that the salvage was not so good as might have been expected to such a silk. That she does not believe there is another piece of yellow tabby so rich as to match it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawrence. I made two particular pieces of yellow silk tabby, one for Mrs. Glass, and the other Mr. Henley in Cheapside had. I delivered Mrs. Glass's on the 27th of Feb. was twelve-month; [he takes the piece produced in his hand.] I know it by the silk and the leasures.

I remember Mrs. Glass's coming to our house in a coach in August, she said in my hearing to him, she did not discharge him for any dislike, but for that the world said they were criminally great.

And getting into the coach to go home, she said, she would be a friend to the family.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of seeing these books before this?</p>
               <p>Graham. On the 20th of Jan. in the morning I was called out of my bed by Joyner, he desired me to open my master's back door and he would bring in a chest. I went to the back door, where was Joyner, Nichols, and Cutts, and the chest. I asked Joyner what he had got there. He said it was stationary ware, and what was that to me. I told them my landlord was not up, and I believed he would not allow the things to be there. I saw four large books in a sack they had with them, they were not opened, but I saw the edges of the paper marbled, and covered with calf; and after that they came and carried them away to the Ship and Blue Ball in Five-foot-Lane, and from thence to the house where they were burnt.</p>

I live in Hickman's Folly, in the parish of Bermondsey, and as I was coming home on the 24th of Jan. between eight and nine at night, my wife standing at the door said, I am glad you are come home, there is a chimney on fire at that empty house: I went to the house, there I found a fire, and having my pole-axe in my hand, desired to be let into the room, or upon refusal I would break open the door.

I got up in order to go to brewing; I traced some marks of blood from the kitchen stairs to the necessary house, and seeing much blood there, I put down my lanthorn and candle, and discovered a child lying. I got a chissel and iron crow, and wrenched up the floor, and by the help of a dung hook I got the child up; then I and my servant maid went and washed it at the pump; it was a female child; I observed it lay partly on its back with the head buried in the soil. We could see no cuts, or scars, or marks of violence on it. I then carried it and laid it on a table in the back kitchen, and then sent for Mr. Fisher, a surgeon, and a midwife, who is here to give evidence; they came, and I desired they'd inspect the child to see if there was any thing to be found from whence they might imagine that the child came by its death; they searched it in my sight, and declared they found no marks of violence upon it; it seemed to me to be very near its full time. I thought I had seen children newly born more perfect, there being very little hair on its head, and the nails on its fingers not so big as on newborn children I have seen; it was a small child. By the position the child lay in it might have come from her as she sat on the vault, for the head was downwards, and seemed to be a good deal buried in the soil. I also observed what follows the child lying near its feet, or betwixt the legs, and the navel-string was found to be broke, not cut, about five or six inches from the child's body; a good deal of blood had gone down the vault, more than I perceived any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it drops of blood you had observed on the floor from the stairs?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was rather smear'd blood that seem'd to be done by a woman's bottom of her petticoats, and I am very well assured it was done by a person returning from the vault, for the blood was daubed against the under part of the stairs, which, had it been done by coming down, would have been on the tops of the stairs; I make no doubt but it was done in the return. I went to Dr. Clark and told him what I had seen, and that I thought it was by somebody belonging to him. The prisoner had complained of a purging on her two or three days before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of the prisoner being big before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I had not. My wife went up stairs to the prisoner, and brought down two or three little things for a child, which she said she had been making at different times when her master was out of the way. Produced in court a shirt, some caps, and other things. I had, after this, some talk with my wife, who said it was possible that the child might insensibly slip from her in her pain as she was on the vault, and it is usual for women to want to go to the close-stool oftener at such a Time than usual. She said such accidents had often happened to women where they have had all the help at hand.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Littlewood. I am a midwife, and was sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270033"/> for upon this occasion on the 16th of January, about six in the morning, I was told how the child was found, and desired to look at it, to see whether it had been thrown in or dropt there accidentally; I observed the navel string to have been broke, I saw no marks of violence on the child; I went up and saw the prisoner, and by examining her found that she had had a child. I asked her if she was married, she said no; my opinion is that the child was at its time. She had a shirt, a cap, and other things for it, which I saw.</p>
               <p>Q Have you heard what Mr. Jones has said as to a conversation with his wife?</p>
               <p>Littlewood. I have, and she is right; such cases often happen to married sober women: a woman who had the same accident sent for me about three months ago. I was satisfied from all I heard or saw, that there was no murder committed in the case.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clark. When this child was found I went and ask'd the prisoner if she had provided any things for it, and she said I should find some in such a drawer; I went, and taking out a bundle found the little things that have been here produced.</p>

The prisoner lives about a mile and half from me; I had heard that he had sold eleven at Acton, and had drove eight to Chelsea, upon which I suspected that he had stole mine. I had a warrant of Justice Beauvais at Hammersmith, and took up him and two of his brothers; he was examined before the justice, and said he bought 36 sheep in Smithfield, some horn'd and some poll'd ones, some large and some less. He said the large ones cost him 15 s. 6 d. each, and the small ones 8 s. 6 d. but he could not tell how many there were of a sort as to horn'd ones or large ones. He owned he sold four of them at Chelsea to a butcher, and that his Brother Natsold the other four, and was concerned in buying and driving them away: but when Nat was examined he declared he knew nothing of the matter.</p>

             told me the prosecutor had lost 19 sheep. They were advertised several days, and I got some bills printed by his desire to give about into the country, and last Saturday was se'nnight one Hill, a skinman, told me he was informed there was a man at a publick house who had killed four sheep in a stable, and had sold them to Mr. Dobney in Fleet Market, and that the man once did keep the clutterhouse in Edgware Road; I then suspected the prisoner, as he had formerly kept that house; the skins were described to be large ones. After this Mr. Hill inform'd me he had heard that the same man had sold some to one Kem, a butcher at Acton; on the Tuesday following I went and told the prosecutor all I had heard; then he, I, Cooper and Weedon went to Acton to see for the skins: we saw one skin in Mr. Chandler's slaughter-house; it was okered in a very odd manner from the head to the tail, and pitched on each side, so that we could not be positive to it; but by the size of the skin and staple of the wool we took it to be one of the skins of the sheep lost, for I think no honest man would smear a skin in such a manner. We then went to a selmonger's yard in the town, and there saw four or five more, which the man said he had from out of Mr. Kem's shop; they were reddled as the other was. We looked them carefully over, and there seemed to be an old oker mark on two of them over the loins, which there was on some of the sheep the prosecutor lost; we got one of them washed, and the mark then appeared more plain. We then got a warrant, and took up the prisoner with four of his brothers; the prisoner was charged with stealing the nineteen sheep, and was asked how he came by those he had sold there, but gave a very bad account; he said he bought 36 at Smithfield, some great some small; for some he gave 15 s. 6 d. and some 8 s. 6 d. He could not tell how many great or little ones there were, or what he gave for the whole, or where he paid for them, he only said it was at a house near the hospital gate. He said he had sold four there, and after that seven; that he killed eight of them at Chelsea, of which last he sold four at 20 d. a stone to Mr. Dobney in the New Market, and that Mr. Dobney had the fat of all the eight at the same price, and that his brother Nathaniel sold the other four at Carnaby Market, but he could not tell to whom; and that Nat was with him when he bought and paid for them, and helped to drive them to his father's ground, where they were a week, and from thence he took them to keeping in turnips at Uxbridge, and from thence to Acton and Chelsea. We took up Nat, and he denied the whole of it.</p>

I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270034"/> took them from among 60, and put them in a field by themselves near Edgware Road.

             was not at home, and my mistress was out crying old cloaths, and no body in the house but my mistress's young child, about a year and half old, the prisoner, and I, the child was asleep on the bed. The prisoner called me down to fetch a pint of beer; I fetched it, and put it on the table in his room; then he took hold on my shoulder, and flung me down on the bed, and put his hand to my mouth, so that I could not speak, or hardly breathe, he pulled up my petticoats, and unbuttoned his breeches, and put what he had in his breeches into me where I make water, and I felt something come from him wet, and it hurt me there sadly. I struggled to get away, and strove to call out but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>A. Barnard. I cannot tell the day of the week, it was about a week after Christmas last, I told no body of it the first time, but I was sore, and grew worse and worse, so that I could hardly walk upright; he served me so again about a week and two or three days after this, when they were all out, I think that time was on a Thursday or Friday. He got me to fetch him a pint of small beer, which I did, and put it on the table, and I was got about half way up stairs, when he pulled me down, and flung me on the bed, and served me as before, only he did not stop my breath, and he did not hurt quite so much; something came from him wet in my body, quite warm, that within me I did not know what it was, but it felt like flesh. He lay on me about a quarter of an hour the first time, and not quite so long the second, and said if I told my mistress or any body else, he would cut my throat.</p>

He also begged of us, if we did get a warrant for him, not to take him up when he was on duty, (he is a soldier) but in the dead of the night. My husband went and acquainted the girl's friends with it, and she was put into the workhouse: After this she told me of the second time he lay with her, and that he said he would stick her with a knife if she told me or any body else of it. I remember the child's shift was yellow, and of an ugly colour. About nine days before I knew what had happened, I asked the girl what was the matter with her, but she made no answer; I thought it had been her petticoats that had cut her side, and so it past off.</p>

The women ran up stairs but dropped my hat in the passage, which I took up, and then ran up after them I told them I wanted my handkerchief, upon which they cursed and swore, and said they knew nothing of it. The prisoner said what will you give me to drink? I said go about your business, I know no reason for that. She said if I would give her something I should have my handkerchief again. I gave her six-pence out of my purse, and they saw my other money; then she said you must stay all night; then the other said, you bitch, he must stay along with me. The other laid hold round my arms, and the prisoner took my purse out of my pocket. Then they ran down stairs, and I followed them, but one of them stopped me on the stairs, and had like to have run me headlong out at a window on the stairs. Stevens stood at the stair foot, and pushed the two women into another room. I went in and demanded my money and things. Then Stevens took and shoved them out of doors, and kept me in the house till they were gone.</p>

             took hold on my hand, and asked me in a loving manner if I had been throwing at cocks, and whether I would give her and the other a glass of wine. I went with them to an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175402270038"/> house in Wine-Office-Court; the other staid below while I went up stairs with Braseel. She called for a pint of wine, sat down, and pulled me on her lap, and asked me if I would go to bed. I said no. The maid brought the wine up, I paid a shilling for it. Braseel gave me a great many fine words, which I can't express now, and wanted to feel my private parts; she then took out twopence halfpenny (which was all the money I had left after paying for the wine) and kept it; she took the wine and bottle and would not let me drink; we went down stairs, and she let me go out into the court. I stood a little while at the door; because I had spent so much money, and lost the rest, I thought it was not right. The two prisoners came to me there, and fell to hugging me and giving me fine words; then Burton took off my hat and gave it to the other, who put it behind her; then one said to the other, The young man is in liquor, let's loosen his stock; upon which they took it off, and I saw it in Burton's hand afterwards. They then took hold of me, one by one hand and the other by the other, and took out my metal sleeve buttons. I then was afraid they would strip me, and seeing my hat under Braseel's apron took it away by force. They then made the best of their way off, but I went after them for my things, and the prisoners were taken in Fleet-street. I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said that the prosecutor met them, that he was in Liquor, and pulled them about; they were, they said, afraid of him, that he struck them, and would not let them go one way or other; upon which they charged the watch with him, as he did with them.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Hoare and co. The prisoner at the bar brought this note [producing one] on the 15th of December in the morning. It is in the form of a common draught on a banker; I seeing there were great variations in it from the usual writing of Mr. Brigstock, whose name it bore, suspected it to be forged, upon which I stopt the prisoner, and we asked him who he was: he said his name was Pickering, that he lived with Mr. Vincent, a gentleman in the Temple, and that he found the note that morning under some shopkeeper's window in Portugal-street; it was a very dirty wet morning, but there was no dirt upon the note. We took him before my Lord Mayor, and he there said he had found it; but the next day, or the day after, he said that he had it of one Goodchild, an acquaintance of his.</p>

I told the prisoner that his saying he found it would gain no credit, and desired him to discover the original author, but he strongly persisted in asserting that he found it. I asked him if it was wrapped in any thing, and he said, no, it was only folded up.

My box stood in the room where I lie, with the things in it mentioned in the indictment, all but the half crown which was in my pocket. I was waked by my fellow servant, who was in bed with me. I heard a noise in the room; there was a man, I asked what he wanted, and he went grumbling out, but about half an hour after I saw him, or another person, come creeping in upon his hands and knees. I screamed out Murder, and the people of the house rising, the prisoner was taken in the stable under the straw, and my box was found opened in the warehouse below stairs; my things were bundled up in a handkerchief near where he was taken. The guinea we never could find.</p>
