I live at 3, Sandon Street, Bedford Row—I am a caretaker—on 23rd May I went into the Tiger public-house at the corner of Devizes Street and Amesbury Street as caretaker—I resided there up to the 26th of May—about twenty minutes past twelve that evening I went out, leaving the house perfectly safe; there was only one door to the house, and I had the key—there was a window in the kitchen at the back which had a broken glass, and the framework was also broken—a box was put against it to keep anyone from getting in—I returned in twenty minutes or half an hour, and saw four men standing at the corner of Devizes Street and Amesbury Street—I do not identify them—one man remained at the corner of Devizes Street—the other three went up the street; they returned and went up Devizes Street—I then heard a breaking of glass, and the three men came down from Devizes Street—I was stand<lb/>ing on a wall at the corner—I could not see inside the house from there—I had left two bottles in the house, one in the bar and one in the tap-room—there were two lights in the bar; I saw them extinguished, and went away to get assistance—I spoke to a constable, and when I got back I missed the two bottles—I afterwards saw them at the station.</p>

Early in the morning of 26th May I was on duty in Amesbury Street, Hoxton—about two o'clock I saw the three prisoners in company with another man not in custody standing inside the bar of the Tiger public-house—I met Dunkley, and sent him for assistance—the gas was burning in the house when I first saw the men but it was afterwards extinguished—I secreted myself in the doorway of a shop, but before assistance arrived the four men came out of the house—I caught Lonsdale and Laurence on the spot; the other two escaped—I saw Driscoll drop a clock on the footway—I took Londsdale and Laurence to the station with assistance—I searched Lonsdale, and found these two bottles in the leg of his trousers; he has lost one leg and walks with a crutch—one bottle was nearly empty; I should say they had contained cordials—on Laurence I found a glass and a piece of candle—I was about fifteen yards off when I first saw the men in the public-house—when I got closer I could not see inside—I saw Driscoll when he dropped the clock; I was close to him then; he was running away—I ought to say he has a brother very much like him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 1, Mitre Court, Temple—I entered into partnership with the prisoner Gosling there on May 1st, through answering an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I contributed £60; I paid £40 for office furniture and goodwill—the money was to be drawn out by cheque, signed by both—no business was carried on, never a penny came in—I was there every day—he said it was a good business—I am a foreigner—after I had been in partnership with him some days, he suggested lending the money which I had paid into the bank, and on May 10th showed me this advertisement in a paper of a person wanting immediately £10 for a week—Hall called next day and presented a card, which was handed to me—I said, "Is your name H. Hall?"—he said, "I could not write to you in my own name, it would affect my credit"—he asked for the money for a fortnight—I said, "You only advertised for a week"—he said, "Well, in a fort<lb/>night I shall be sure to be paid"—he produced eight pawntickets for jewellery—Gosling was there all the time, but nothing was said between him and Hall—Gosling can hear perfectly well; I never had any difficulty in making him hear—Hall said he would give £13 for the loan—Gosling said, "Are these good securities?"—I said "Yes"—they represent about £33—a bill was drawn up for £13 for eleven days, and I drew a cheque for £10, which Gosling and I signed; it was given to Hall and returned paid—the bill was put in the cash-box; I had no key—Gosling and the housekeeper and the clerk had keys of the office—on the evening of the 22nd, Gosling put the cash-box in a drawer, and I left before him—on the 23rd I arrived at the office at 10.45, and Gosling got up to look for the cash-box; he opened the drawer and said, "The cash-box has gone"—he called the clerk, who said he knew nothing about it—I said, "This is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250013"/>
               <p>very awkward, because there are pawn-tickets in it, and I must try to stop the tickets"—he said, "No, I must go and try to find Hall"—he went away and came back in the evening, and said he had found him at a shop with the name over the door, but he was not in—he had left a card saying he would call next morning—next morning Hall came to the office, and we asked him to give us the particulars of the pawntickets—he said he could not—there was no recognition between them—on the 25th he came again, and gave me this list of pawntickets (<hi rend="italic">For a watch, a pin, Albert chain, a gold keyless watch, and a diamond ring</hi>), and said those were all the particulars he could give, and he ex<lb/>pected us to make the loss good, and that the goods represented £60, but he had had a good week, and would pay £13—we said, "No," and he said he would take £10—as soon as Hall got out of the office, Gosling said to me, "We get off cheap now; I expected it would be much more"—I said, "I don't think so; you would take £8 rather than nothing"—I said, "Can you find the money by dinner-time?"—he said, "I can find £3 10s." and when I came back from lunch he said he could find £4, and took it out of his pocket—he did not say who Mr. Leader was—I subsequently, with Sergeant Bryan, found this cheque-book in a drawer in our office—it is in Gosling's writing—I did not notice at the time he brought in the cheque that it was in his own writing—this is another of May 25th—I refused to pay any more, and said I was going away, and as I was in the office, Hall came in and was arrested—this is a pawnticket for a diamond ring for £3—to the best of my belief, it is one of the pawn-tickets left with us.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. OVEREND</hi>. I held myself personally responsible, because they gave me very good references—my share of the business included the goodwill and the furniture—I preferred to have the man in custody before I gave notice to retire—no business at all has been done—we were accountants and general agents—I went into partnership on May 1st, and this occurred on May 11th—between those dates there were four business transactions of the same shady kind—I never heard that a project for decorating the Queen's Theatre was brought into our office—Gos<lb/>ling said he had no money because he had been ill—in one case we received back principal and interest—on 3rd May Gosling took me to Mrs. Richard<lb/>son, of 14, Penton Street, Camberwell—he said she was an old client of his, and she wanted £17 advanced on her furniture—we took an inventory of it, and she was to give a bill of sale, and pay it back in a few days—we lent her £17, and since Gosling had been arrested I have got £15 back—it suited me to take £10—the next piece of business was a particular friend of Gosling's, in fact one of the gang; he wanted £10, and I lent it to him on two share certificates, which are not worth the paper they are written on—the money has not been repaid—Chapple signed an acceptance for £11 for a month—I have not got it; it disappeared with the cash-box—I can<lb/>not find the man anywhere—the prisoners got no portion of that amount—the £60 was put into the bank for the sole benefit of Gosling and my<lb/>self, and the introduction was made by the bank manager—I know that Chapple has banked there thirty years—he was hanging about Gosling's office, and he came to my office and looked round—there was a case of soiling a surgeon's business, but never a penny of profit came in—I never heard of Mr. Dudley in reference to the Queen's Theatre—I do not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250014"/>
               <p>that business negotiations were being carried on during the slight time I was negotiating with Gosling—several people came to the office, but Gosling took them to a public-house—the clerk had the back office—Gosling saw the persons I spoke of who came—I generally wrote the few letters there were—I wrote the letter to Whittaker at his direc<lb/>tion—Hall came in reply to our asking him to call, and Gosling suggested that he should go into the clerk's room while we discussed the matter—the goods were pledged for £23 12s., and Hall said they were worth £60—when I went there the day before the bill was due, the clerk may have been in the back office—we had the housekeeper up, who said that the clerk was the first person to come—every evening after I entered into partnership with Gosling, it was his practice to put the securities he had in the cash-box, which he put into the open drawer of the bookcase, unlocked—he did not tender me the money that he and I had advanced; the person could not find him, and he came on Friday—when the robbery took place there was a conversation between Hall and me about the cash-box—he came on the Thursday—I wanted to go and trace the pawn-tickets, but Gosling said, "Don't be in a hurry, go to the police"—Hall came twice; he did not offer me the amount of the bill, or say that he had brought it and wanted his pawn-tickets—after Hall left I said to Gosling, "Now can you find half the money?"—I altered my mind, because I thought it was a shady transaction made up between them—I took legal advice, and did not see Gosling afterwards—I did not try to cash the cheque—it was on a Newmarket bank—I saw "£4" on it—he did not tell me it was simply filled up to show me, a literary person, how to draw a cheque—I did not put it in my pocket—it was drawn in Gosling's favour—the first time I saw it was not when the detectives searched the office—a summons was taken out first, and it was altered to a warrant, because I saw that they were a very shady lot, and if I did not take criminal proceedings I should get nothing, and the people at the Court said that I must have him arrested—I know that he was arrested when ho simply went to the police office to make inquiries about the missing goods.</p>

I am deputy of a lodging-house, 10, Adelina Grove, Mile End—I have seen the prisoner on several occasions—some time before eleven on the 5th June he came to the lodging-house, and I had to eject him, not forcibly—on going out, he said, "I will put a knife into you before the night is out"—between eleven and half-past he came again—I was standing at the gate—I would not let him come in—I got him up the street and said, "Go home"—he met another man and they had a few words, and he stabbed him in the cheek—he then turned round to me, and said, "You are next to go," and stabbed me in the arm—I could not say whether he was drunk—I don't believe he would have done it if he had been sober—I saw the knife in his hand, and I felt the blow, and after that I know no more—a doctor attended me, and I am under his care now—there was a mob there at this time; they were not attacking him, they were simply looking on—I did not strike him with a poker.</p>

I examined the premises on Sunday morning with Inspector Geer—I found the back area door had been forced open at the bottom by some blunt instrument—a catch had also been forced, and the jamb of the door was broken—it was not unfastened at the top—there was room for a man to get in—the front basement door was open—I suggest that it was opened from the inside; there were no marks on it—it was unlocked, and the key was in the lock—I showed Evans the hat I found in the back yard—I put it on his head, and it fitted him—he had no other hat—a skeleton key was found on him—nothing was found on Corbin—neither of the prisoners were drunk—Corbin pre<lb/>tended to be drunk, but he was quite sober—there was a little blood just inside the hat, and Evans's left hand was bleeding—I examined the place minutely—there was no sign of such a thing as Corbin suggested.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 32, Gracechurch Street—on 29th January this year, the prisoner called at my office with this lease of 169, High Street, Hoxton, in which Benjamin Benje purports to be lessor, and George Andrews the lessee, in consideration of £200 paid by the lessee to the lessor, and there is a receipt acknowledging that 169, High Street, Hoxton, is let for eighty years, from 25th December, 1893, at aground rent of £4—the lease and receipt are attested by a solicitor—a solicitor has no right to attest a lease without going properly into it; I have not personally heard of solicitors doing such things—when I saw the attestation it had some weight, to my mind, as being a genuine lease—I asked the prisoner whether he had paid the £200 premium; he said he had—I asked him what he wanted the £50 for; he said he had let these premises to a butcher on a three years agreement at £38 a year rent—I asked him to produce the agreement; he stated he had not got it with him; he promised to bring it up—I have never seen it—I asked him for it again when we had completed the matter; he said the same again and promised to send it up—I took the lease to my client, Mr. Crump, on the next day, I think, or the</p>

               <p>same afternoon, and in my presence the mortgage produced was executed, and the money was handed over—I heard Crump ask the prisoner whether he had paid the £200 premium; he said he had—Crump asked him about the agreement with the butcher, and the prisoner said he had let it, exactly the same as he had to me—Crump asked him what he wanted the money for—he said he wanted it to put the place in repair for this butcher—the mortgage was for £50—on 22nd February I was just coining out of the City of London Court, when I met the prisoner—he produced another lease—the prisoner afterwards told me and my clerk that he had destroyed that lease—I served him in Holloway Prison with notice to produce it—it has not been produced—on 27th March, the prisoner called; that was after we had found out that Benje and Russell were being prosecuted in a case, where Benje had given Russell a lease for some ground rent, purporting to have received a large sum of money con<lb/>sideration—they were convicted before your lordship last session, (<hi rend="italic">See Sessions Paper, Vol. CXX., p.</hi> 644)—I asked the prisoner on 27th March, "What about that second lease?"—that was the lease of 67, Mortimer Road, from Benje to him—and he replied to the effect that it was no longer in existence—he made a statement to my clerk—the lease he produced, when I met him on 22nd February outside the City of London Court, was between Benje and Andrews; it was a lease of 57, Mortimer Road or Mortimer Street, Kingsland, which was where Benje said he lodged—the prisoner said he wanted £60 for the lease, and suggested that I, being solicitor to Mr. Crump, should get it for him—there was £200 consideration money in that lease also—I asked the prisoner whether he had paid that; the prisoner said he had—I took the lease to Mr. Crump, but the negotiation fell through; Mr. Crump wanted the first lease paid off—I think if the first one had been paid off he would have done the other one—the first was not paid off—a few days afterwards the prisoner called for the second one, and I handed it to him—I had taken down a copy of the material parts—I had that copy at the Mansion House; I have lost it since—anyone would suppose that the first lease on which he obtained £50 was a good lease—the £50 was only a temporary mortgage for a month—civil proceedings were taken—the prisoner informed me that he had arranged a mortgage with Godfrey for £50, and that he only wanted the money pending the completion of the other—I have since seen Godfrey—afterwards criminal proceedings were started; we saw Benje and Russell were at the Mansion House, and I went to see the property, 169, High Street, Hoxton, and found it belonged to Captain Sharpe Sharpe's trustees, and the builders were in possession, doing repairs—I saw a specification after the criminal proceedings had been taken' against Benje and Russell—the prisoner's address is given in the appearance to the civil proceedings as 52, Man<lb/>chester Street, Manchester Square—Russell also used that as his address—I did not go there; the police made inquiries—there is no butcher's shop now at this house at Hoxton, but from inquiries I learnt there was one there last year—the lease is dated 2nd January this year.</p>

               <p>houses on this property—I believe he has taken in some of the acutest intellects in London—I believe Russell had been convicted; he is between fifty and sixty—I had heard of the Mobbs's Estate in Hoxton before this case—I understand property worth about £4,000,000 is waiting for a claimant—I first suggested that the prisoner was crimi<lb/>nally mixed up with Benje and Russell when they were first charged at the Mansion House—I first satisfied my mind that the prisoner was criminally mixed up when he called on 27th March, and said he had destroyed the lease—we did not prosecute him till ht June, because we did not want to prosecute him—he had been sued civilly—Mr. Carnegie, a solicitor, called on me with reference to this matter, and offered to settle this matter out of Court; I did not accept the offer—I referred him to Timbrell and Deighton, the solicitors conducting the civil proceedings—I did not offer to give this lease up to Mr. Carnegie; he, acting for the prisoner, suggested it should he done—the matter was out of my hands from March to June, and in the hands of Timbrell and Deighton—they obtained judgment for £50 on 29th March, 1894, in the civil proceedings—the matter was put into my hands again just before this prosecution was started—Timbrell and Deighton acted until just before the proceedings at the Mansion House—I did not tell them the prisoner had been guilty of a criminal offence—I had no position in the matter when civil proceedings were taken—I cannot tell you why no criminal proceedings were taken from 28th March till 1st June—I believe Mr. Carnegie suggested a settlement of the matter, but it never came to anything—I believe Timbrell and Deighton were not willing to entertain it; I don't know—I believe if Mr. Carnegie had come and tendered money they would have entertained it, and then criminal proceedings would not have been taken—I have no recollection of saying to Mr. Carnegie "The police may force Mr. Crump to prosecute"—I have seen Mr. Carnegie since, and he has told me a good many things about the prisoner—I think I have been Mr. Carnegie twice since the matter left Timbrell and Deighton's hands; he came to see me—I said I had no power of settling the matter; it was out of my hands—I should say that was after judgment was recovered on 28th March—Mr. Crump in<lb/>structed me to prosecute about two days before I laid the case before Mr. Warburton—my managing clerk, Peck, who introduced the prisoner to me, is here—I have known him a good many years; he was managing clerk to my father—he has not been many years continuously in my service—he was in a way in my service when he introduced the prisoner—I used to give him conveyancing work; he had a seat in my room—I believe the prisoner gave him a small commission, I don't know—the prisoner paid my fee on the lease; in the ordinary way the mortgagor pays it; it is deducted out of the mortgage money—I heard Mr. Warburton said he could not get Benje here; we should have had to go to the ex<lb/>pense of a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>—we could have brought him here by going to great expense.</p>

I am a chartered accountant, of 6, Lombard Court—Mr. Ashby Darby brought me the lease "A," and I afterwards saw the prisoner with regard to it on 30th January—he first sent across to know if I was going to let him have the money, and I sent back word that I would see the house before I advanced any money, and if it was all right he could come across to me in the afternoon—I went and saw the house; it was empty—I thought it was well worth the money he wanted to borrow—in the afternoon he came with Mr. Darby, and I said I had seen the house, and I had no objection to advance the money—he told me he had let the house to a butcher for three years at £38 a year, and he wanted this money to do the repairs in order that the butcher might take possession—I believed that statement to be true, and advanced the money; that was one of the principal inducements—I said, "According to the lease you appear to have given £200 for it; is that true?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "That is about what I should have believed the lease was worth"—his story was a great inducement to me—about a week before the money became due Mr. Darby brought me the second lease between Benje and Andrews, and said Mr. Andrews had brought it to him, and asked me to advance £60 on it—I declined to do so—Mr. Darby was acting as my solicitor and agent in the matter—I said he must pay the other off first—the prisoner said he had let the house on a three years' agreement, that he had forgotten to bring it with him, but he would send it up to Mr. Darby.</p>

I am chief ledger-keeper at the Bank of Scotland, 43, Lothbury—I was at the counter where Mr. Brand was standing—he handed me this order, and I looked up and saw the prisoner—all cheque<lb/>books are supplied with a form of this kind, and when the customer is nearly at the end of his cheque-book, he signs this for another by an authorised agent or member of the firm—this firm have been customers longer than my time, which is seventeen years—they generally have 480 cheques at a time—the order being on paper and not on the pink form attracted my attention—I should have passed the signature; but my suspicion being aroused, I consulted Mr. Murray, the chief clerk, and went to the counter and said to the prisoner, "Have you been here before?"—he said, "No; I have not been there long"—I said, "Who signed this order?"—he said, "Mr. Adamson, I suppose"—I went outside the counter—Mr. Dupre, Mr. Murray, and Mr. Williamson were there—Mr. Murray said to Mr. Dupre, "Do you know this gentleman?" (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>)—he said, "No"—the prisoner looked him in the face and said, "You don't?"—Mr. Dupre said, "No; I never saw you before"—Mr. Dupre asked what sort of man Mr. Adamson was—the prisoner said, "He is a medium sort of man"—Mr. Dupre said they would not be likely to send a stranger, as they had plenty of clerks of their own—the prisoner said, "I applied for a situation, and was taken on at once, and sent with this order"—he offered to go there, but we asked him to remain while we sent one of our junior clerks with the order, who brought Mr. Adamson—he held the order in his hand, and said, "This is a forgery"—the prisoner then said, "I am an innocent victim"—Mr. Adamson said, "You are an American," but I did not hear the prisoner answer—he was taken away by the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher at Hornsey—I am the prisoner's brother-in-law—in 1890 I became guarantee for him to the London and County Banking Company for £400 overdraft—in 1893 he became bankrupt—before that, just after Christmas, I removed certain stock from his house, between seven or eight and eleven p.m.—I made about four journeys—he carried the stock out to me, and I took it in my butcher's cart with my name on it—the prisoner was a draper and milliner—an inventory of the stock I took was taken in my place; it came to about £350—I went to the back door to remove the things; there is a right of way there—I took a certain portion of the furniture a short time after the stock was removed; some of that was taken to Mr. Smythe, for him to take care of for me; I had not got room in my place—among it was a mahogany dressing-table, a double marble-topped washhand stand, a towel-horse, an iron bedstead, an oak frame, a striking clock bronze ornaments, and a fire screen—a piano was taken to my son, Frederick Smeeton, as I had not got room for it—all the furniture, that left behind at the prisoner's and that taken away, sold for £50—I valued that which I took away at between £10 and £20—this letter, dated November, 1892, I wrote in January, 1893, just before the removal of the goods: "Dear Sir,—You will remember that some four years ago I lent you £400, on the understanding that you would give me some security on your stock-in-trade; unless you do ho I shall institute proceedings for the recovery of the amount"—I handed that to the prisoner—I dated it November, 1892, because my solicitor, Mr. Salmon, of Finsbury Pavement, instructed me to do so—I lent the prisoner £400; what I really meant was the overdraft at the bank—I deposited my deeds there for his benefit, and in consideration of that the bank allowed him £400—I have not repaid that to the bank; my deeds are still there.</p>

Will you destroy the bill, and there will be no more trouble about it?"—I said, "I don't understand enough about bills to play tricks with them; also I want my rent; where is my rent, or part of it, even a little of it?"—he went away after I refused positively to either destroy the bill or do anything—he told me that Bannerman was a liar, that he had signed the bill in his pre<lb/>sence—I said I did not know Bannerman, and had heard through the agent I had sent that Bannerman had not accepted the bill—I am tolerably well acquainted with the prisoner's writing—I should say the acceptance is not his writing, but that the body of the bill is.</p>

I am a, solicitor,: of 3, Mitre Court, Temple—Miss Pizzey, my client, came to me on 18th May—I wrote to the prisoner, who called on the next day, Saturday, May 19th—he said he had come to take up the cheque; I told him I had not got it, but I would give him a receipt for the money, and an undertaking to get the cheque from my client, and I asked him who would give me my expenses—he laughed at me—rather insulted, I said I thought it was a swindle; there was no such firm as Newman in the Directory, and that the best thing for him would be Bow Street—he made no answer; he showed me no money</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have tried tearing two or three sheets together, and can only match one—I took a specimen of the girl Clarke's writing—all the specimens were written when each writer was present in Mrs. New<lb/>ton's room—I supplied the paper—it is official paper—I did not say to Jane Clarke, "You wrote that, did you not?" pointing out the envelope which had contained the anonymous letter—I had not got the letter—the conversation with Clarke and the others took five or six minutes—I made no note of anything that was said; there was nothing to induce me to do so—I do not think I put any question to Clarke about the letter in the kitchen having been tampered with, but I believe she was present.</p>

On March 24th I visited 10, Stannard Road, in reference to Miss Paine's complaint; I put some questions and left—I went again on April 10th with Rosenhiter—the prisoner opened the door; we went into the dining-room, and I produced a half-sheet of paper, a bill of Miss Paine's, and asked the prisoner if it was her writing—she said, "Yes"—I produced another half-sheet, on which the anonymous letter is written, and compared the edges, and asked her how she accounted for it, and said, "You will have to go with me to the station"—she fell on her knees and said, "Oh, don't! My husband and my two daughters are at the Law Courts, and if I telegraph for him he will lose his case"—I searched the house, and while I was searching the back bedroom upstairs a communication was made to me, and I heard the prisoner say, "Bring up some bread and milk for the child"—I went into the front room, and the girl confessed that she had stolen the things—I went down to the basement, took the girl in custody, and told her the charge; she made no reply—I told the prisoner that these were originally one sheet of notepaper; and there is the same watermark on it, and the indentations fit; it is very common paper—I received the <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Davis letter on April 30th—I took the prisoner in custody on a warrant on May 29th for forging and uttering a post-office order—she said, "It is false; I have two witnesses to prove it"—I took her to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the first occasion I went about six o'clock, and saw Miss Pane in her own room—when I went again the Newtons invited me to search the house—after she said, "I cannot account for it," I said that it was unsatisfactory—she said, "Oh, Jane, do confess," and I ques<lb/>tioned the girl—she said she knew nothing about it, but upstairs the challenge was repeated, and the confession was made to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, of 59, Holborn Viaduct, and have had considerable experience in examining writing for eight or nine years—I have had before me documents "D 1," "D 2," and "D 3," the three specimens of writing obtained from the two Newtons and Jane Clarke; also letters G 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5—I have looked at "D 1," the admitted writing of prisoner, and at "E," which is the account Miss Paine paid, and in my opinion they are in one and the same writing, and, therefore, in the prisoner's writing—in my opinion documents "A 1," the anonymous letter signed "Z. S. A.," and the Tim Davis letter, "H," and the letter produced by Mr. Hobbs also a Tim Davis's letter, are in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250050"/>
               <p>the same writing, and in a natural hand, without any attempt at disguise—the Tim Davis letter and the anonymous letter both appear to be in a disguised writing—I have here the signature to the post-office order, "B," which I have carefully examined, with the Tim Davis letter, the anonymous letter, and the prisoner's admitted writing—the signature to the post-office order has been written over, or the greater part of it, and the capital letter appears to correspond with most of the capital "M's" in the prisoner's writing—it is finished off with a little circle, but if it is examined with a glass it appears that the circle has been added after<lb/>wards; without the circle it corresponds exactly with the capital "M" used by the prisoner in her natural writing—as to the rest of the signa<lb/>ture it was first written "Payne," but it has been gone over again with different ink, spelling it "Paine"—the "P" corresponds almost exactly with the "P" in the letter produced by Mr. Hobbs; it is more like that "P" than any other—it appears to have been written over again the same as on the post-office order—it is impossible to say when writing has been done over, but the "M" in M. Paine on the post-office order is exactly like the prisoner's writing—looking at the specimen writing of Eva Newton, and at the envelope in which the anonymous letter was enclosed, I believe they are both in the same writing—the edges of these two pieces of paper correspond, as far as my sight will guide me, and the paper is from the same mill—I have compared the <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Davis letters, and taken similarities between them and the anonymous letter, and they are the same—I then compared the anonymous letter with the admitted letters, and found similarities; the "e" in "harshness" is very peculiar, something like a Greek "e," showing that it was written very rapidly, and I find that frequently in the proved writing, and there is also an instance of the double "s"—you will find a similar "e" in "bottle"—there is a rough similarity between the "G" in Graham Road and the "Graham Road" in the anonymous letter—there are other similarities which I can men<lb/>tion upon which I base my opinion—in the "M. Paine" I find the original "n" before it was inked over, and I have found a similar "n" in the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Jane Clarke's writing is not very much more marked than the resemblance between Eva Newton's writing—there must be a similarity in the writing of young people who have not a formed hand, but I watch where the writer is accustomed to raise the pen in the same word, and if I find exactly the same pauses it goes a great way with me—the writing of the <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Davis letter and of the anonymous letter is con<lb/>siderably disguised—here is an "e" upon which I rely in the word "rent," and there are about four in that letter—this is not the commonest way in the world for an "e" to be formed by a lady.</p>

The double "s" is in the word "harshness" in the anonymous letter as well as the "e"—the resemblance is very strong—there are not thousands of persons writing double "s" in the same way, I look upon it as a peculiarity—in the anonymous letter it is more finished, only it is smaller.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired captain of the Royal Navy, and manager of the Industrial and Mercantile Investment Corpora<lb/>tion, Limited, 39, Victoria Street, Westminster, which was registered on 17th, 1893—for some time prior to that I had been taking steps to April start the company, and became acquainted with the prisoner in March, 1893—I had known him before, and asked him to come and help me start the company—he agreed to do so, and on April 17th he was appointed by the board secretary of the company at a salary of £200 a year, which was paid monthly, and in June I raised it to £300 a year, he taking the secretaryship of another company, and £100 a year which I personally guaranteed him, making £400—between April 13th and May 1st about £120 was advanced on account of preliminary expenses—with the exception of the <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi> on page 1, of which I am doubtful, the entries are in the prisoners writing—I find on May 2nd £25 on account, and on May 4th £40 in the same writing—the cheques were drawn by the prisoner, and he would place them before the directors—they required the signatures of the two directors—before April 17th certain directors made advances with me—on 8th May there was a board meeting, and the agenda for that day is in the prisoner's writing—I find in it first a confirmation of the £25 and £40, and then, "Cheques wanted,<hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, £13 10s., and Hamilton and Jones," which is scratched out, and "Preliminary expenses, £60," entered—on the same day he was instructed to lay a balance-sheet before the directors by the next meeting, showing liabilities and expenditure—at that meeting a cheque for £60 was authorised to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250055"/>
               <p>drawn; it was drawn in the prisoner's favour, and paid by the bank—this is it—the body of it and the endorsement are the prisoner's writing, and it is signed by two directors—it is, "Preliminary expenses account, T. Newton"—this, "Please pay cash.—T. N.," was not written by me—the next board meeting was May 15th, when the prisoner produced the balance-sheet; it is entirely in his writing—he has taken credit for "Prospectus and distribution expenses in promoting company, £28 16s. 6d.; City Prospectus Company, £8 8s. 3d.; Hamilton and Co., £13 6s. 8d.; and Baylis and Jones, £11 15s. 11d."—I believe that those sums had been duly paid, but I cannot say that I saw the receipts for them, and as he shows that there is then in his hands as secretary on May 15th, £11 19s. 9d.—I had never heard of Hamilton and Co.—as to Hamilton and Baylis, the prisoner said it was for posting certain prospectuses, and he wanted the money he paid himself out of the £60—I believed that all those payments had been made, and that it was a true balance-sheet—he remained in the service till April 23rd—he was absent about three weeks, and stated that he was ill—while he was away I had occasion to go to a black tin box which stood in his room, and which he used for secretarial purposes—it was locked, but the key was in the office, and I unlocked it—Mr. Bourke was with me—a number of books and papers belonging to the Mercantile Investment Corporation were taken out, and put into the safe, and among others the four receipts, one from Hamilton and Co.—in the same box I found a small black memorandum book in the prisoner's writing—the matter was reported to the board, and the prisoner was dismissed from his office—he had not returned, I communicated with him by letter—I consider the whole of this receipt of W. F. Connor is in the prisoner's writing disguised, and the altered figures on this Express Printing Company's receipt appear to be his—the whole of the writing of the rough cash account at the end of what purports to be the prisoner's diary for 1893 is in his writing—that book was not in the tin box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was managing two or three other companies at the same time and place, Fowler's Patent, and the United Inventions Syndicate and Grenville and Ackles, and my own business—the staff I employed did not look after all those four enterprises; they were differently employed—I did not at that time hold out to the prisoner the prospect of being partner with me in any of those enterprises, but I did later on—I had a cashier for both those companies and my own after the middle of May, 1893, Mr. Edmunds—he came into my employ as clerk on April 29th, and helped in distributing the circulars and other work—he directed the wrappers and sent them to the post—it was not part of his duty to deal with the cash—I do not know what has become of him—I last saw him soon after he was discharged, about October, 1893—he robbed me too—he subsequently made a written confession—I prosecuted him—I have made efforts to find him, but have not succeeded—I have discovered that he was passing as Hamilton and Co.—it was originally my intention to charge the Hamilton and Co. £13 16s. 8d. against the prisoner as a forgery—I do not know in whose writing Hamilton and Co. is—I have not found out who wrote "Price Jones, £11 15s. 3d."—I have been in communication with John Joseph Ryan through my solicitor—I do not remember that I found out that John Joseph Ryan wrote the whole of this; the solicitor may have found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250056"/>
               <p>out what evidence he can give—I am given to understand this Exhibit 3 was written by Ryan, but am not sure that my solicitor told me that Ryan wrote it at Edmunds' request—I have not been told that Mr. and Mrs. Edmunds addressed a number of circulars, and then got Ryan to make out the bill for them—I have not found out where Ryan lives—he may live at 50, Bookham Street, Hoxton—I was told that Edmunds lived in Hoxton—I cannot remember the name of the street—I heard that he and Edmunds were near neighbours—to the best of my knowledge and belief, this "8" in the Express Printing Company's receipt is in an inde<lb/>pendent handwriting—the prisoner's "8" is very characteristic, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is his. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing out similar figures in the cash-book.</hi>)—here is the same "8" in the cash statement, "Disbursement account, £282 12s."—I have marked one in the cash<lb/>book as well in pencil—this is the agenda-book—I limit myself to the "8"—I say that the whole of No. 1 City Prospectus Company is in the prisoner's writing, but disguised—his own name is in his writing, to the best of my belief—I see in a bracket here the words Thos. Newton; that is in his writing—the words Thos. Newton in the receipt are written in a disguised hand, but in a flowing hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I say that the "Thos. Newton" in the cheque and the "Thos. Newton" in the exhibits are written by the same person from the general character—the "T" in "Thomas" has had an obvious flourish added to it; the "h" has also been altered; the "s" looks the same; a different form of "n" has been used, and I do not rely on that; the "e" has had an unnecessary flourish added; the "w" is the same, a little turned round—I say that the "w's" are very similar, and the "t" is very similar—the cross of the "t" and the "o" and "n" are very similar—I say that all the letters are so strongly characteristic that I have no doubt they are written by the same man—I have had these documents examined by an expert.</p>

The entries in the cash-book up to June 4th are not evidently made at the same time as the disbursements—the last entry on the disbursement side in the prisoner's writing is on May 18th—those look as if they were made at the same time—the balance-sheet was pro<lb/>duced at the meeting on May 15th—there is no minute that he produced the cash statement on May 15th—what he was ordered to have done was done on May 15th—I see nothing about 4th June in the cash statement—it is not "Fourth issue," that is nonsense—I must have said, "For the issue" before the Magistrate—Mr. Bourke had the key of the box, and he or I at any time could have had a look in to see what there was—on April 24th I wrote this letter to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that information had been laid before the board in consequence of which they had dismissed him.</hi>)—on April 29th I received this letter from the prisoner.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I said that, I was speaking from memory—these offices are taken in my name, and I am responsible for the rent, and employ the staff of clerks, some of whom are common to the companies, who have offices there, and who pay me a certain sum each for offices, clerks, and expenses—I said from the earliest date that I intended to give the prisoner an interest in my business, but no deed was drawn up—I guaranteed £100 a year to him personally—I had shares in the Corpora<lb/>tion, but I was not to get it out of that; I was to get it where I could—that £100 a year was not derived from any particular company, but one £100 was—Sir. Edmunds first came early in April; the prisoner intro<lb/>duced him, and said he was a thoroughly trustworthy man, and he had known him for years—I discharged him in October, 1893, for writing an impudent letter to me, and it was afterwards reported to me that there was a deficiency of £15 in his accounts, and that he had been mixed up in swindling transactions by which he obtained £100—I was desirous of prosecuting, but the prisoner represented that it would be exceedingly inexpedient, and I did not—I do not know of my own knowledge what became of him; it was left in my solicitor's hands—I did not learn that an office was taken in the name of Hamilton and Co.—I think I heard of Mr. McLean in the course of my inquiries; I did not hear that Edmunds was sharing a room with McLean—I read part of the little black book.

               <p>not tell me that somebody was to be tried for forgery, but I knew in<lb/>tuitively that he was the solicitor for the prosecution by the look of the documents—he told me to examine the documents by the admitted writing and give a report, which I gave on May 22nd, and I was at the Police-court on the 24th—I was first asked about the £57 5s. 2d. document one day last week, and about the £103 2s. 6d. to-day—I have had them an hour or two, but not during lunch—in the last document the filling in of the receipt is in the prisoner's natural hand, but the other is a disguised writing—I should not put them on the same footing—the words, "Thos. Newton," on document No. 1 is partly natural writing and partly dis<lb/>guised by an additional movement of the pen—I should say that the "Thos. Newton" on the cheque for £60 is his natural writing; I mean to say that that, and the bill for £8 9s. 2d., are written by the same person; but No. 1 is upright and this is sloping—the upright one is the prisoner's natural writing, and the additions, or flourishes, are disguises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a citizen of the United States—I was formerly a colonel in the United States Army—I am now residing at 26, Denbigh Place, Pimlico, S.W.—prior to 1884 I had been appointed by a power of attorney to act for a Mr. Lawrance, who was making a claim to the Towneley estates in this country—in the fall of 1884 that Mr. Lawrance died, and his son, Dow Hagar Lawrance, succeeded him as claimant to those estates, and funds were raised in America for the purpose of supporting this claim—they were raised by private friends of Mr. Lawrance, by subscription—out of the property that was recovered they were to have the funds they had subscribed returned, with reasonable interest—they would determine the reasonable interest among themselves, perhaps—Mr. Lawrance and his ancestors were ship's carpenters; he himself was a ship's carpenter—he had wealthy friends amongst whom to raise the money—in 1885 I came to this country for the purpose of prosecuting this claim—before that, information had been obtained as to the value of these estates; it was believed to be a very valuable property—I returned to America in the autumn of 1885, leaving my wife here, residing at Woburn Place, Russell Square—I left her authority to draw on my banking account and to act in my absence—I returned to London in the middle of January, 1886—up to that time I had not known the prisoner; I then found that my wife had made his acquaintance—I then saw him and had conversation with him about the work he had been doing, particularly about some payments that my wife had made to him—I repeated to him what my wife had repeated to me in reference to the transactions, and he sanctioned it—I asked him if he had made the inquiries that my wife had informed me of—he said he had, and had obtained a transcript of the marriage of John Lawrance and Mary Towneley—I knew that that was an essential piece of evidence in the case—he said he had got it from Towneley Hall; of a young man of the name of Cade, he told me finally—he first told me he had recovered it through the agency of the young man Cade—he did not tell me his name at first—he said the young man had got the information from a manuscript written in a book by Mary, Towneley's father, that he was at Towneley Hall in the interest of Lord Norreys, who was said to have been in possession of the property, getting up what was known at that time as the Towneley Act, a private Act—I asked him the name of the young man, and asked to see him—he said the young man was very timid, and could not be seen, and that the matter had better be left in his, Mr. Thomas's hands—he declined to give the name—ultimately I found the name had been given, by a cheque my wife had given him for Cade; that was how I found it out—he said that he had seen Cade in the office of a firm of solicitors in London, but if he told me the name of the firm, I did not retain it; I don't remember it—I</p>

               <p>spoke to him about the cheque that my wife had drawn, and called his attention to the fact that my wife had paid him £100—I should think that was not until the second interview I had with him after my return—I called his attention to the purpose, and I questioned him about the paper that he returned purporting to be the transcript of the marriage—he said that the young gentleman, Cade, had obtained that evidence for the £100 which my wife had paid him—he did not say very definitely what he had done with the £100, but I understood him to mean that he had paid it to Mr. Cade, that Cade had obtained the information, and had received £100 for it—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a cheque for £100 in my wife's handwriting, and drawn upon my bankers, Brown, Shipley, and Co., dated 15th December, 1885, payable to T. Cabe and Co., and endorsed by Mr. Thomas and T. Cade, it looks like T. Cabe—that cheque has been through my bankers and been paid, and I have received it back from my bankers in the ordinary course—some time after January, 1886, I retained Mr. Thomas as the solicitor to conduct this action—I supplied him with the materials I then had for the purpose, and in June, 1886, an action was commenced in the name of Dow Hagar Lawrance, claiming the Towneley estates; it was commenced in the Queen's Bench Division—it went on until June, 1887, when it was dismissed by the Divisional Court before the late Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Day—on 1st September, 1886, I received this letter from the defendant, in which he states, "As to the statute, the Crown never seta that up," and he also speaks of retaining one of the Law Officers of the Crown, and that he will require £800 to pay expenses—in the first place, the arrangement with the defendant was that he was to have a certain sum for carrying on this litigation—£1,000 a year, and expenses out of pocket; but afterwards he found that sum would be 100 modest, and he wanted £8,000 in two payments—at that time I did not know the difference between guineas and pounds, I suppose; it may have been guineas instead of pounds—he would require £8,000 to launch the suit—I next received this letter of 3rd September, 1886, in the United States, very soon after the one of September 1st—in this letter he says, "When I was at the Treasury on other business, I asked a friend of mine there, privately, to let me know the cash to the credit of the rent accumulated account alone, and he has since informed me that it is fourteen millions." <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before that, had you any conversation with him about an accumu<lb/>lation of funds in the Treasury to the credit of this estate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was mentioned, there was a rumour that there were large sums of money to the credit of this estate; "in Chancery" sometimes, sometimes it was mentioned" in the Treasury"—I know the defendant's handwriting—these letters (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are written by his clerk; his handwriting is familiar to me, but the signature is Mr. Thomas's, clearly—the next letter I received is dated 21st September, 1886—it is addressed to Mrs. Jaquess; she sent it to me; I was in another part of the United States—it is in the defendant's handwriting; and his signature also, clearly—in this letter he states, "I have shown my writ and pleadings to my friend at the Treasury, and on doing so became on good terms with him. He has since shown me last year's return of the income of this estate paid into the bank, amounting to £19,000 odd"—this letter also states that the largest sum paid in in any one year was £21,700, paid in in 1874—I came back to this</p>

               <p>country about the end of October or beginning of November, 1886, and about 26th November I called at his office and saw him—he told me he had received a very important letter from the solicitor to Her Majesty's Treasury—whether he mentioned the name of the solicitor or not I am not distinct in my recollection; at all events, I do not remember the name—he had a document in his hand; I believe it was a quarto shape—this(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)is about the size of it, I should say—it was a letter, and had writing upon it—he said the Treasury required the payment of back costs in a suit of 1714, amounting to £1,100 odd, and I guess that rather alarmed me, because I paid very little attention to the paper itself, what I was concerned about was what it contained; the amount struck me—he read the letter to me, I think; at all events he gave me the substance of it, and I asked him for a copy—there was a kind of running dialogue, I presume, between us, in which I said some very sharp things about the Solicitor of the Treasury interfering with us—I don't know the exact words that I said, but I thought it was a very tight fit for the Solicitor of the Treasury interfering with us in that way—I com<lb/>plained of it most seriously; it was a good while before I could consent to forgive the Solicitor—I have forgiven him now I am better informed; I have got older, and am not so easily taken in, I hope so at least—he told me that the costs were claimed under the action of Jonathan Lawrance, an ancestor of the present claimant, and that ancestor's name appeared in the pedigree of the Lawrance family, which I brought and delivered to him—I recognised the name of the alleged ancestor—he said these costs were demanded by the Solicitor to the Treasury, and they must be paid, or the suit could not go forward—a day or two after that I received from him this letter, dated November 29th, or a copy of it—this is the identical letter, the original letter—the body of it is in the handwriting familiar to me, by one of his clerks; it is signed by H. Thomas—with this letter I received this enclosure; it is marked" Copy"—that is also in the hand<lb/>writing of a clerk—I read it; whether I received it on the evening of the 29th or the morning of the 30th I am not distinct in my recollection, but I went immediately to his office and made the first payment—the copy letter states, I find, "The claim to these estates is made by a descendant of Jonathan Lawrance, the plaintiff to a suit herein in 1814, which was decided against him with costs still due, and which amount to £1,121 17s. 8d. As you know, these costs must be paid before your action can be heard, I think you had better see me at once as to the pay<lb/>ment thereof.—Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">A. K. STEPHENSON</hi>"—I believed that to be a copy of a letter from the Solicitor to the Treasury, and made payment in con<lb/>sequence of it—on 30th January I paid to the prisoner £500 in Bank of England notes, or a note, which I got by cashing this cheque for £600—I promised I would pay him the balance as soon as I could get the money—he said that would do, and he would hold the Treasury quiet; the £500 would keep them quiet, and I was pleased with the prospect of a little time—I thought the papers in that suit would be very valuable to us—it was understood that, by paying the back costs, we would have the benefit of all that had been done in that case—he gave me a receipt for the £500—this is it, written by Mr. Thomas himself, stating the object for which the money was paid. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Received on account of costs in old suit, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Jonathan Lawrance")—on 8th January I paid him a further sum of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250064"/>
               <p>£600 by this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is endorsed by H. Thomas, in a familiar hand to me, and he gave me this receipt: "Received of Colonel Jaquess £600, balance of costs re Jonathan Lawrance"—after the first action was dismissed, a fresh action was brought, through the advice of my solicitor, Mr. Thomas; that action was commenced in December, 1887, in the Chancery Division, before Mr. Justice Stirling—an applica<lb/>tion was made directly to strike out the statement of claim—Mr. Justice Stirling refused to strike it out, and the defendants carried it to the Court of Appeal, and that Court ordered it to be struck out, and the action was dismissed—by Mr. Thomas's advice we carried the case to the House of Lords—this is the book that was used in the House of Lords—I examined this book carefully at the time—the House of Lords affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal, and ordered the claim to be struck out and the action dismissed—that was on 22nd April, 1890, according to the dates given—between that date and July, 1891, I was not so much corresponding with the prisoner as seeing him occasionally for the purpose of reviewing matters—there was no proposal to review the decision of the House of Lords—there was not any formal proposal to carry on the litiga<lb/>tion—at the last of July or the beginning of August, 1891, I went to the defendant's office especially to learn something more about this Jonathan Lawrance—not the suit of 1814; I have never got satisfactory informa<lb/>tion in reference to that—I had the receipts for the payment of the £110 which I had paid for the costs, given by him to me—I had not seen any voucher from the Treasury, showing that they had received the money—the defendant was not at the office when I arrived that day—I saw the clerk, Hubbard, and had some conversation with him on the subject—I told him what I had called for—I showed him the letter I had received from Mr. Thomas with reference to the Treasury matter, containing the copy of the alleged letter from the solicitor to the Treasury, the letter of the 29th September, and he recognised it—I did not see him write any letter; he promised to do so; I left him instructions—the next thing I heard was a letter dated 10th August, 1891, from the prisoner; I received it while I was in the United States—it began by saying, "I am sorry I was out of town when you called," and it then refers to a loan of £20 which he had lent me, and which at that time had not been paid back, and then he goes on, "After these things I regret to see you have for<lb/>gotten the explanation I gave you respecting this money said to be paid for costs; but really, as you know from information from the officials privately, who, it seems, treated us badly, as they were also bribed by the other side"—I had never given me any such explanation of the matter, or suggested that the £1,200 had not been applied to the payment of costs; he had never suggested that it had been used for my other purpose—the letter goes on: "There was, of course, no receipt; no receipts ever pass from such people"—then the letter goes on: "The other side know more of the case, and certainly of your history, than I did, and amongst other things said that if you or the plaintiff went into the box, you would not leave it, as a prosecution would instantly follow. It appears our counsel were told that your documents were forgeries"—That was the first I ever heard of that; he had never suggested to me that anybody had said that my documents were forgeries—that was the first I ever heard of any of those suggestions—he had never</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter was called for, but not produced</hi>)—this is a copy of it; without reading every word I should say it is a correct copy—I exhibited it as a copy of the letter—it says: "It is quite unintelligible to me, and I indignantly repudiate it," and I proceed to ask him a number of questions, and then I go on to say: "During the last twelve months I have been endeavouring to obtain information from you and also the papers"—I had been doing so, but perhaps I ought to say "in a quiet way"—I did not want to get into trouble with Mr. Thomas; that is, I did not want to make an enemy of him—I had applied repeatedly for the papers and for an account; but I should say not so much for an account, because that was brought about by my friends, but for the papers, I was very anxious to get hold of them—on 21st November, 1891, I received from him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had not intended to cast reflection upon the Colonel or Mrs. Jaquess, and if it was thought he had he withdrew them</hi>)—in March, 1892, I put the matter into the hands of a new solicitor, Mr. Rolt, for the purpose of doing what I had failed to accomplish, bring about a settlement between myself and Mr. Thomas, not with a view of renewing, or commencing again this litigation for the Towneley estates—after the letter of the 21st I saw Mr. Thomas, and tried, as well as I could, to get my papers out of his hands—I was able to get the briefs of Sir H. Davey, Mr. Finlay, and Mr. Upjohn, but I was unable to get the instruc<lb/>tions that were given—in November, 1892, I made an affidavit for the pur<lb/>pose of supporting an application against him, that he should deliver the bill of costs and a cash account—before that I had requested him to show what he had done with the money he had received, but as a simple request—up to that time he had never rendered me any full account—he resisted the application—I attended the proceedings before the Master, Mr. Archibald—they lasted nine days, very long days too—he made every possible objection he could—he said I was not his client, that is, that the relation of client and solicitor did not exist—ultimately the Master made an order, with which I was informed I ought to be satisfied—he applied to the Divisional Court, before two judges, Mr. Justice Mathew and Mr. Justice Collins, and they heard and decided it, confirming the decision of the Master, and ordering him to deliver a bill and a cash account—he then carried the matter to the Court of Appeal, which was heard on the 6th, 7th and 8th of March, 1894—they decided that he must deliver the bill of costs and directed that all the papers should be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions—I believe I spent over £15,000 for the purpose of carrying on this litigation—I can produce his stamped receipts and endorsement on cheques for only £11,425.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKWOOD</hi>). I left the army about 1865, at the close of the American War, not with any pension—I was a colonel of a regiment of 1,000 men when we started; we came home perhaps 10 per cent, of that number—after leaving the army in 1865 I became an agent in the General Post Office in America, in 1866; I remained connected with that, I should think, two years—then I was engaged in commercial business, buying and selling and getting gain; I was dealing in cotton for about eighteen months or two years—I should say during that time I was connected with Freedman's Bureau, a Government organisation to find labour for men who had been in slaver, but who had been freed, and look after their interests—I did that for about two years—then I continued buying and selling cotton (I had a place of business) for about two years, up to about the beginning of 1876—before the war I kept a ladies' school—I lectured on Sundays—I never started a newspaper—I had a little connection with one in Washington from about 1879 to 1881 or 1882—I was brevetted General the same year, or very soon after I was mustered out of the army as Colonel; I have been an honorary General since then—I was brevetted General for meritorious conduct they said, at the close of the war—I am sure I was made an honorary General by the War Department at Wash<lb/>ington; there is a record of it, I presume; I never gave my attention to it—I never called myself General, and was never described as General, because I did not want it; I did not go into the army for honour, but to save my country—I heard I had been nominated as director of a gold mine, but I never heard that I was elected, or anything of that kind; I was never a director of that or any company—I presume this paper, describing me as a General and as a director of a gold mine, refers to me; it was not by my authority; I never saw it—I should say I first became acquainted with the American claimants to the Towneley estates early in 1880; all my active service commenced then—I began to look into it about 1880, that was when first I had any knowledge of or financial connection with it, I think—I had an agreement with Dow Hagar Lawrance, in November, 1886, when he succeeded his father as claimant to these estates. (<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement appointing the witness as Dow Hagar lawrance agent, he having acted as agent to D. H. Lawrance and his predecessors in the matter for upwards of fifteen years.</hi>)—that is not according to my recollection—I think I have heard of that document before; I do not remember it from your description—I had a power of attorney from Dow Hagar lawrance, November, 1886—I have not had a subpoena to produce this document that I know of—I presume all the powers of attorney that I have had in connection with this matter are here—I have the power of attorney given by D. H. Lawrance's prede<lb/>cessor, William T. Lawrance, to myself and Annis in connection with matters relating to the prosecution of this suit; that is dated 18th February, 1876; that was for certain preliminaries, and my name was placed there</p>

               <p>in connection with the prosecution of these claims, but I was not actively engaged till 1880—I knew the persons prosecuting these claims as far back as 1876; I had no official connection with them before that—I was not the originator of this idea of collecting money in America for the purpose of prosecuting these claims—Mr. Lawrance and his friends were, and they requested me finally to assist them, which I did—the money was raised by subscription; that was a matter Lawrance and his friends engineered—I might say I do not know the plans they laid—I think it was not done by holding meetings in various localities—I believe bonds were issued, first in 1880, I think—I am not the holder of any; I was not to be paid in bonds—my expenses were to be paid—the power of attorney in 1876 contemplated the issue of bonds—I did not issue any—Mr. Annis issued some which I had nothing to do with—Annis went in 1877, I think—fifty dollars were paid to him, I understood, and from that time, 6th November, 1877, I held the power of attorney up to the death of William Lawrance—it was then renewed in the name of Dow Hagar Lawrance—between 1876 and 1885, when I came to London, perhaps my expenses amounted to £1,000, and I could not have received more than I expended—I did not receive more than £1,000 on my own account between those dates—money was credited for the benefit of William Towneley Lawrance—I should say between 1876 and 1885 perhaps £1,000 came into my possession; I could not say positively to any particular sum beyond that—my expenses were £1,000, and I received very little beyond my expenses; I do not remember how much—my expenses were fully £1,000 in the nine years; they may have been more—I could not say if they were £1,500; possibly they might have been nearer £2,000—they may have been £2,000; it would depend on what you mean by my expenses—I meant my personal expenses and travelling, and then I had to pay for documents—I should think I received perhaps £1,000 for personal expenses and £1,000 for money sent—I do not think I received altogether £10,000 during those nine years—money was raised, and as it was called for by me for specific purposes it was paid over—£10,000 might have been called for; I think not by me—I presume there is no account showing the moneys I received between 1876 and 1885, because the work did not really commence until the time the prisoner took it over; the expenditure did not commence properly—all of the money raised would not go through me—I presume the greater part came at my suggestion—I could not say positively if £10,000 came to me in those years, about £1,000 a year; it would not seem to me to be an extravagant sum if it was so—perhaps I had as much as £1,000 a year for expenses all told—I accounted to the Ameri<lb/>can, can people, who subscribed the money, every six months—the accounts are in America—I never held mass meetings prior to the prisoner coming into the matter—I have no accounts in this country relating to the period before 1885—I had taken opinions in America, and had to pay for them—I took an opinion of Judge Comstock in February, 1876—this is in Judge Comstock's own writing—my impression was that the estate was in the Court of Chancery, or that it was held by the British Government for the lawful heirs, who had not been found—I continued of that opinion up to a certain time; I don't know just at the moment when; it was a shock to me when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250068"/>
               <p>I discovered it was not so—I first learnt it was not true when I consulted my present solicitor, Mr. Rolt, in March, 1892—I began to have some misgivings about it, but I could not satisfy myself upon it till then—my first action was brought against Lord Norreys; he was said to be in pos<lb/>session—I did not know that he was; I was at Towneley several times—I thought the Government was in possession when I went down, and when I brought an action against Lord Norreys to recover possession, and that Lord Norreys had nominal possession under a lease from the Government—I asked the prisoner to show me a lease from the Government to Lord Norreys—he did not show it to me; he said it would have to be developed, found out in whose possession it might be—when I made the representation to Judge Comstock that I believed this was property for which a lawful heir could not be found, I thought that was the true situation—I remember Judge Comstock giving in his opinion "The marriage of Mary and John Lawrance, and those two wills in her favour, are facts of which no legal evidence has been placed before me." "The points which ought to be more authentically recorded are the marriage of Mary and John Lawrance, the wills above-mentioned in favour of Mary, and the enrolled decrees in Chancery." "It is also stated to me that there is an enrolled decree in the English Court of Chancery in a suit or proceeding, instituted by certain persona claiming to be the American heirs of the estate, which was determined against them because they failed to show that they were the true heirs"—the suit is a tradition in the family, really, and was in the case when it came into my hands—rumour said there had been several suits—I told Judge Comstock it was rumoured a suit was brought—I had not told him there was an enrolled decree in the English Court of Chancery—several branches of the Lawrance family came to be connected with this estate, and they had in their family histories the efforts they had made to recover the estate—I think I learnt from Judge Comstock that there was an enrolled decree in the English Court of Chancery—after that I took the opinion of Mr. Blake, of the firm of Blake, Kerr and Boyd, of Toronto, Canada—I do not know Mr. Blake; he was Minister of Justice at this time—this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is a copy of the opinion, in my writing—I had the original in Mr. Blake's writing; I don't know about it now—the matter was presented to Blake Kerr and Boyd by a retired solicitor in Canada, Sir William H. G. Collis, and I only got a copy of the opinion; the original must be among Sir H. G. Collis's papers, I suppose—I copied it myself—it is dated May, 1876—I had not been able between February and May, 1876, to find the proofs, which Judge Comstock said were necessary, to authenticate the claim—Sir W. Collis laid additional proofs in respect of those matters before Mr. Blake—I don't know where he got them from, but some he got from this side of the ocean—he was employed by Annis, my partner in the first power of attorney, and Annis, like some other parties, retained a good many papers when he went out of the matter—I think Mr. Blake's original opinion was in Sir W. Collis's hands—I tried hard to get it before I came to England—I did not get it, but I had a copy of it—I don't understand that the information has ever been obtained, which enabled Mr. Blake to express the opinion that Mary Towneley married John Lawrance was a matter susceptible of easy proof—I never saw any certificate of marriage between Mary Towneley and John Lawrance in 1693—I don't know how it came that such a certifi<lb/>cate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250069"/>
               <p>is assumed to have been laid before Mr. Blake—I only know of the family records—I do not observe that the point, which the opinion of Judge Comstock points out as being a weak spot, is, in the alleged opinion of Mr. Blake, dealt with as a matter in respect of which a certifi<lb/>cate is produced, and as being susceptible of easy proof—the in<lb/>formation with reference to the Lawrance family was obtained from the records—the opinion was taken for the benefit of William Lawrance to be shown on this side of the ocean in 1876, when the case could be completed; the idea was not specially to show it in America where I was trying to raise money on bonds—Mr. Blake gave his opinion, as I understood it, that on the materials submitted to him all these matters were susceptible of easy proof—I brought everything I had here—I never had a certificate which proved that Mary Towneley married John Law<lb/>rance in 1693—I never saw such a document—I also took the opinion of Mr. Dickinson, of Hillyard, Hyde and Dickinson, in Boston, on the eve of sailing for this country—I was here first in 1880, or late in 1879—I suppose that opinion is among my papers; I cannot account for its not being here—I recognise this as a copy of Hillyard, Hyde and Dickinson's opinion—I think I gave the original of it to the prisoner: I don't know if Mr. Rolt has it—I brought the original to this country—I brought a copy of Mr. Blake's, not the original—Judge Comstock's was brought, too, and all the certificates I had, but no certificate relating to the marriage of Mary Towneley and John Lawrance in 1693—according to the opinion of Hillyard, Hyde and Dickinson, the case was ready for speedy and successful determination; we were all ready to begin on October 4th, 1877—late in 1879 I came to England—I saw the firm of solicitors, Sandy and Creeke, at Burnley, Lancashire, and talked with them about the matter—I did not say a word to them about any concealed fraud on the part of any person in relation to the previous suit—my solicitor in our amended statement of claim alleged concealed fraud—I never knew what the concealed fraud was; if I did know I could settle the case now—the concealed fraud set up to enable us to defeat the Statute of Limita<lb/>tions would be the wrongful possession—the concealed fraud set up in the amended statement of claim to defeat the Statute of Limitations was con<lb/>celling from the proper heir in America the fact that he was entitled to the Townley estates—I said not a word about that to Sandy and Creeke—on 15th May, 1888, I made an affidavit in the second suit, the Chancery suit before Mr. Justice Stirling—I was called to the Bar in America in 1844, but I never practised—there is a good deal of truth in the statement in my affidavit: "I was called to the Bar in America, and have always kept up my legal studies and knowledge"—I love the law, but I do not love lawyers—I consulted several lawyers and law firms in the North of England—I consulted Sandy and Creeke, and also others—I refer in part in my affidavit to Sandy and Creeke, and also to a firm in Liverpool and Manchester—the one firm I refer to would be Sandy and Creeke, if you want it.

Thomas, £1,100"—I presumed I represented by that that although the cheque was to my order I paid the money to Thomas—according to my recollection I should say I paid that to Thomas—I had other funds in London at that time, and I may have paid him more funds—I do not remember if that cheque was paid at my bankers, Brown, Shipley, and Co., and by them to the London and Westmin<lb/>ster Bank, Lothbury—I do not remember receiving in respect of that cheque a £500 note, five notes of £100 each, or twenty £5 notes—I received and paid out a great deal of money—I should say it is correct that I received those notes for the £1,100 cheque—I think that money went to Thomas, or its equivalent—I had other funds—I presume I gave Brown, Shipley and Co., orders on 2nd June, 1888, to cable £1,031 to my wife, Anna Jaquess, in Philadelphia—this is my writing—we had to borrow large sums of money, and pay it back as we could get it—I presume the 5,000 dollars cabled out on 2nd June were the proceeds of the £1,100 cheque on 10th May—I did not put on the counterfoil, "Court expenses paid to H. Thomas," to show to my friends in America—I did not write down what was not true—I may have made a mistake about the cheque; I had other funds—I paid that sum to the prisoner at the date specified—the counterfoil is not a fraud—I had other funds.</p>

               <p>The cheque of 10th May, 1888, I do not regard as a sum for which I have a voucher; it is not included in the £15,000—the vouchers are among my papers—I have not them in my possession; they were with my solicitors—the defendant never went to America that I know of—about 21st June, 1888, I should say I drew a cheque for £900, but I do not remem<lb/>ber distinctly—it was spent by me in defraying the expense of the applica<lb/>tion—the cheque of December 13th, 1889, for £1,000 was for expenses of the prosecution of the case, the case having then been heard in the House of Lords; I do not know just what prosecution—I do not know if you will find on the counterfoil what it was for; I put down on my counterfoils what is true; it was for fees and Court expenses, that is my recollection about it—I have written it down there; the whole of it went as I say, but for different items—the whole of it was included under the words, "Fees and Court expenses"—I presume I cashed that cheque myself—the endorsements on the back of two bank notes for £100 each are mine—it may be that they are two of the notes I got for the £1,000 cheque; I cannot recollect—I had other funds on hand, and I may have paid other funds in one direction; not beyond the fees and Court expenses, including those—I presume I cashed those two £100 notes on 30th January and 1st February at the Bank of England—my personal expenses were in<lb/>cluded in Court expenses, and household expenses and dress—I do not remember whether I paid Thomas Cook three £100 notes for American money; I may have done so, but I do not remember now—I do not remember whether I got for this cheque ten notes of £100 each—I really don't remember where I cashed that cheque—I think it is correct that I did get ten £100 notes—this is my endorsement on the note No. 60308—I do not remember that I paid three £100 notes to Cook and Son for American money—I do not swear I did not; I may have done so, but I have no recollection of it—if I did, it would be included in the expenses in prosecuting the case—after the House of Lords had given judgment against us I had to square up a great many different accounts, not in America, in prosecuting the case here; I might want American money to do that; parties I owed money to wanted American money more than once—I was receiving money all the time—I should say I drew the cheque for £1,000 in the course of the business—I may have sent £200 of it to my wife on 24th December, 1889—that might have come under the head of fees and Court expenses—I suppose the three cheques in question were included in the £15,000 I paid to Thomas—I say I paid Mr. Thomas over £15,000—I do not think that £15,000 included the £1,000.

               <p>paragraph went the round of the American papers; I never could find out where it was supposed to have come from—as I understood it, Mr. Phelps did what he could to warn his countrymen against being duped over this matter; I understood, however, that he retracted that after<lb/>wards, when he found that proceedings had been instituted—I know Messrs. Hill and Shepherd; they issued a circular; I do not remember the exact date—it was not before I came to this country, it was before I saw Mr. Thomas; I got it, I think, from Mr. Thomas. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKWOOD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read the circular, which was a warning against the wittiest and others as having been for years making false statements with reference to the Towneley estates, and was signed, "F Alder Hill, Cincinnati</hi>")—I took steps to contradict that in person—I did not bring any action, because they retracted—I met Mr. Shepherd, and he apologised, and told me he had been deceived by Mr. Hill—he retracted in his own house in writing; I have not got it; it is with my friends in America—Mr. Shepherd acted as a gentleman should do, and I, as a gentleman, was satisfied—Mr. Hill got up a counter agitation on his own part, to get money for the same purpose; he professionally represented a different family to the one I represented—Mr. Shepherd is not alive. (<hi rend="italic">A statement by Mr. Shepherd was read, stating that the necessary documents would be produced at the proper time, to show the false representations which had been made by the witness and others</hi>)—the first date I met Mr. Thomas was about the middle of January, 1886—I then believed that my case was complete, in one sense, in respect of what I brought from America, the pedigrees of the Lawrance family—the marriage of Mary and John was not included in the Lawrance part of the pedigree—I have given you the name of the party that presented the matter to Messrs. Blake, Kerr and Boyd; it was not I that did it; it was Mr. Annis—this name of "Jezrael Lawrance" is my handwriting—I did not prepare that affidavit; a lawyer in America did it for Mr. Jezrael Lawrance—I wrote it out because I thought if it would appear in my handwriting that I would read it more readily—that is the affidavit that was sworn—I preferred to copy it myself; I wanted it in my handwriting, as I had most of the other papers in my handwriting—I wanted it to look plain; lawyers do not usually write very plain. (<hi rend="italic">Portions of this affidavit were read by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LOCKWOOD</hi>)—when I came to this country in 1886 I did not represent to Mr. Thomas that the case was actually complete and perfect in all its proofs, and ready for settlement, by the affidavit of 1878—I represented to him just what I have stated, that the pedigree of the Lawrance branch of the family was complete—I presume I said so—I have always insisted that the pedigree on this side was to be brought out by Mr. Thomas himself—I did not come to England before 1878 with reference to this matter—I came to England, as I have already stated, early in 1880, or the last days of 1879—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a document in my handwriting—I brought it with me when I came to England and saw Mr. Thomas. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed "In re Lawrance and Towneley estate, part</hi> 2," <hi rend="italic">and gave a description of the estate and the family</hi>)—the reference to the bank records was given to me by the representative of a lawyer of a branch of the Lawrance family in America whom we know as the Abbott Lawrance branch of the family—the papers told me of the deposits of money—it is my writing, as Mr. Carver, a lawyer, permitted me to copy it—I was</p>

               <p>not permitted to bring the original—the paper copied was not authenti<lb/>cated—I understood the bank was the Bank of England—I did not go to see the records directly I got to this country—I do not know where the judgment is that Jezrael Lawrance refers to in his affidavit in 1878—I had my solicitor to look after it—I did not ask for a copy of it—I did not act in that direction—I was not successful—I had an American lawyer with me, Judge Wills, of Washington City—I was not permitted to go to the Court of Chancery for it according to your rules and customs—I know what Lawrance said about it before I saw the prisoner—I had not the decision nor the date of it—I never heard about the costs in respect of it—I did not know about the old suit—I knew rumour said so—I did not get the gentleman to swear to it—I copied his affidavit—the "Abstract of decree in Chancery" I got from the papers, as I have explained—I did not prepare the document—Mr. Carver did for, as we call it in America, the Abbott Lawrance branch—it was prepared in America, not in England—I took it to England—I got from the papers, "Amount claimed, many millions"; "Church records of Hague, Holland, marriages, births, and deaths"—"John and Mary's marriage in 1695" had reference to their history, I suppose, but I told Mr. Thomas when I gave it to him I took very little stock in it, and I wanted him to examine to see if there was anything in it—I brought the document to Mr. Thomas as you have it there—I did not assume, if the suit was renewed, the payment of costs; I knew nothing about it—Mr. D. B. Carver wrote the original—he is not alive—I have never searched for it among his papers—I thought it better to get the decree on this side, and instruct Mr. Thomas to search for it—I asked him if he had got it—he told me he could not find anything of the kind—it did not occur to me that the costs referred to yesterday were the costs in the old Chancery suit—the date would not justify it, 1700 something—my memory may be failing me—so long as it was desirable to settle the question as to whether the American claimant had a right or not, he wanted it, and his friends wanted it settled—I did not tell Mr. Thomas about the 26th November that I had myself been making inquiry at the Treasury—I never was in the Treasury—I never brought him a letter which I said had been handed to me at the Treasury—I did not tell him that I had paid Mr. Younger a sum of money—I met Mr. Younger at 33, Chancery Lane—he was making some inquiry; as a solicitor I never retained him really—he never made inquiries for me at the Treasury, so far as I know—he died, I think in 1883; that was some time before I saw Mr. Thomas—I never told Mr. Thomas that I had already paid Younger the costs referred to, and that I had explained that fact to the Treasury; I never made such a statement to Mr. Thomas, or anybody else—I never said that the evidence that was procurable from the Treasury could stand over, as it was not a trial of the case, but only a motion to dismiss the suit, I asked him to send me a copy of that letter of the 26th November—I did not take the original letter to America; I swear that; I took a copy, not the original. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of the witness before the Magistrate being referred to, stated</hi>: "The paper which purported to be a copy of the Treasury solicitor's letter I believe I sent to America, that, or a copy of it; possibly I sent a copy, but I took the original with me")—I say that referred to the copy I received from Mr. Thomas—I last</p>

               <p>saw the original letter on the 26th, when Mr. Thomas first called my attention to it, and when I asked him for a copy—in June, 1887, I was present when the case was being argued before the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Day—the present Attorney-General, then Mr. Rigby, appeared against me—I heard his argument—I do not remember distinctly what he said; he said a good deal—I do not think I then had in my possession a copy of the letter from the Treasury, making a demand for the costs in the old suit—I did not receive the letters from Mr. Thomas till after that—I do not remember the dates about it—I do not think I had shown this letter to my Counsel—I should say I don't remember that I had—Sir Horace Davey, Mr. Finlay, and Mr. Upjohn were our Counsel—I don't know that I told either of those gentlemen that I had such a letter in my possession—I left that to my solicitor, Mr. Thomas—I don't think I attended every consultation—I cannot say that I am aware of any consultation with Counsel at which I was not present; I believe I attended every consultation—I attended every hearing in Court—I did not on any such occasion make any allusion to this document, or a copy of it—I did not think it was my business, it was the business of my solicitor. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you give Mr. Thomas the information of this concealed fraud, which you set up in your amended statement of claim? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Thomas furnished that himself, at the time the statement of claim was made up—I suppose he told me, not me him, that is the way it was.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You remember this, do you not, that not one word being said about this concealed fraud in the statement of claim, it was necessary for you to explain to the Court how it came about that there had been no mention of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think it is so; it was not my business, my solicitor's—I did not realise it—he prepared the affidavit—it may have been pre<lb/>pared and settled in the presence of two of my Counsel—I don't remember, distinctly—I had very likely looked into "Taylor on Evidence" on this point—I think I had consulted the case of Gibbs and Guild about that time—I don't know when or how long ago—I bought the book containing "Gibbs and Guild" in London, at a book store; I don't remember where just now—the book was "Taylor on Evidence," two vols., or, rather, my solicitor called my attention to that, I should think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your affidavit you say it was the perusal of this case that justified you in withholding it from your solicitor, and now you say your attention was called to it by Mr. Thomas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so—we discussed these</p>

               <p>matters pretty freely—the matter was in the hands of my solicitor, and was none of my business really—I could not instruct Counsel, and I did not—I went to Mr. Rolt—he was instructed to make inquiry into the way in which the money that had passed through my hands had been spent—I requested him to do so—I do not know that he had received instructions from others before me—when I went to Mr. Rolt, in 1892, the claimant Lawrance was my principal—I do not know that he was making inquiry as to how this money had been spent—I don't remember the precise time when I met Mr. Rolt first; possibly I was in communi<lb/>cation with him as early as September, 1891—I swear I did not concoct a series of letters which I represented to be copies of letters I had written to the prisoner—I gave Mr. Rolt some letters I had sent to the prisoner; I did not give him copies of some I had not sent; I swear that—I did not see the prisoner on 20th September, 1891—after that I saw him at Brighton, I should think, and at St. Leonards, and at a place near there—we were not staying together—we may have lunched together—I have no recollection of preparing letters to be written by the prisoner, and to be used by me and my wife in America; I depended upon him for instructions—this letter of February 2nd, 1886, to the prisoner is in my writing—I don't remember that I enclosed a paper of proposals in that—I think the suggestions came from the prisoner, and not from me to him—on the same date I received this letter in the prisoner's writing; it is word for word a copy of the document I sent on the 2nd, but my writing is a copy of his—I could not have written what is attributed to me there—"I have made a minute of what I think you can say with propriety of our case, and which will greatly aid Mrs. Jaquess in her contemplated work in America," was a copy I made of the prisoner's letter to me—I had got the original; I wanted the copy for use—I had known the prisoner then a few days—the letter of 5th September, 1889, is in my writing—the work in America was laying the facts before our people and friends, not especially with the object of getting money; we had to report our progress, and get the case complete—I wanted the prisoner to call my attention to the case of Lyell and Kennedy because he had not put it into writing; I wanted it to show or to carry with me—on 7th September the prisoner did what I suggested and wrote, "There has been decided during the last sittings the case of Lyell and Kennedy"—I have no recollection of enclosing this in the pre<lb/>ceeding letter: "I send you herewith a statement, according to your suggestion. If satisfactory you can send it on, otherwise hold it till we meet on Wednesday noon, and we will make alteration, if any should be required"—I think it is my writing, but under the circumstances I don't remember it as you put it; I don't think it is—there was no sug<lb/>gestion of terms of settlement by the defendant's solicitors or counsel; they fought to the death—this letter from me to the prisoner of 15th November, 1886, means that the prisoner informs me with reference to my friends in America—the letter states what I was informed at an interview I had, that we had had a meeting to discuss that he should write to me, that there had been a trial which had been very successful to us, and that the defendant's Counsel had applied to our Counsel for a compromise—that was what he repeated to me in private conversation—I knew the prisoner could write a letter himself—I</p>

               <p>simply embodied in my letters what we had agreed on in private conversation, I suppose—that is my recollection of it—we had not agreed in concocting the fraud—I only knew what he told me—this purported to come from the solicitors to the other side, and I never had a conversation with them; I never met them in private—the House of Lords decision against me was some time in 1890—in 1891 the litigation was under dis<lb/>cussion—Mr. Thomas did not refuse to go on—he did not take me to Parker, Garratt and Parker; I took him—I went to consult them at the request of a party in America—I told Mr. Thomas how it came about—I learnt from him that further litigation was useless unless additional testimony could be produced—I think I consulted Mr. Rolt about Sep<lb/>tember, 1891—I do not remember the exact date when I retained him—after that I was occasionally in communication with Mr. Thomas—I told Mr. Rolt the facts of the case—I did not tell him I was in communication with Mr. Thomas at the time—I think he knew every time I saw Mr. Thomas—I cannot recollect the date I first saw Mr. Thomas—the letter of 10th August I received in America I delayed answering till 19th September, 1891, because I was travelling in America, and had not time and opportunity to attend to it till I returned to England—it was a serious letter, possibly suggesting my hands were not clean, and to which I should think I ought to have indignantly replied—I waited till I got back to America; I was so busy the letter had to be sent out there—I did not see Mr. Thomas before I wrote the letter of 19th September, 1891—it must have been days after—weeks, I should think—two weeks—I saw him usually at his request, according to my recollection—I suppose "Colonel" means me in this telegram of 26th September, 1891: "Start to-morrow noon, Central Station—To Howell Thomas, 45, Grand Parade, Brighton"—I went to Brighton—I remem<lb/>ber seeing him once there; I think that was all—I was trying to get my papers from him—I did not arrange with him as to the terms in which I should write him—I did not discuss with him the terms upon which I did write to him, not according to my recollection—there was no under<lb/>standing that we were to correspond at all—I have no recollection of supplying Mr. Rolt with copies of letter alleged to have been written by me to the prisoner on 1st, 6th, 14th, 20th, 27th October, 28th November, and 23rd December, 1891—I don't know in whose handwrit<lb/>ing these letters are—I received instructions from Mr. Rolt—he may have supplied me with copies of letters I was to write to the prisoner—I carried out his instructions, and wrote to the prisoner when he gave me copies—I never told Mr. Rolt I had written a letter which I had not written—about 9th March, 1892, Mr. Rolt was pressing the prisoner to answer questions, and render accounts to me, and I was still pressing to get the balance of my papers—I don't remember what I meant by writing to the prisoner on 9th March, 1892, that he was likely to be called on by letter to answer some questions respecting the case of Lawrance and Norreys, and that he should answer on the lines recently indicated to him—I do not think I had indicated to him; it might have been the people from America about wanting to see the papers—I was trying to get my papers from Thomas.<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> One way of trying was to suggest he had already given them to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he had—I wrote this letter of 22nd March, 1892.

(<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated from 47, Woburn Place</hi>)—I think I was stopping at the Alexandra Hotel, Hyde Park Corner, during part of 1888—it was expected that the prisoner would ascertain about the previous suit—I received this letter of September 18th, 1886, from him, written from King's Head, Newport—that was the first I heard from him of any previous suit—there were rumours that there had been previous suits, and I swore in my affidavit that there were; it was so understood—I handed over the affidavit to Thomas when I came over, with the request that he should examine into the the matter carefully—this letter, which it is suggested I drafted, the prisoner wrote and signed—the statement in it that proofs of the pedigree are now complete refers to the paper the prisoner brought to my wife for the £100, the Cade matter—I had not brought with me to this country any certificate or document purporting to be a certificate of that marriage—the signature of this letter from the prisoner, of 11th August, 1887, in his writing, saying that the defendant offered to compromise, I received without any intimation from me—we discussed matters of this kind occa<lb/>sionally, and it might have been mentioned, but I think not—I do not know that that letter was written by the prisoner in consequence of an agreement between us before that that he should write it—the letter of 15th August, 1887, is in the prisoner's writing—when he was called on to account, he said, among other things, that he had already accounted to me by a document which was a settled account between us—that was one of the defences he set up in the Court of Appeal, and for that purpose he relied on an account of September, 1890—he exhibited in his affidavit an account showing the expenditure by him of £6,350—I understand he relied on that as the settled account between him and me—that £6,350 is the only money he accounted for of the moneys he had received from me; he claimed that that was all he had received, and all he had ex<lb/>pended—I can produce, and I have produced, his own receipts and his own endorsements on my cheques for £11,000; these are the receipts and cheques—on November 2nd, 1886, I paid him £2,000 by a cheque, and later in November, 1886, £1,000, for which he gave receipts, and on 19th November, 1886, I gave him another cheque for £1,000, and on 30th November, 1886, another £1,000.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I came with him to this country in 1885; he left me here at Woburn Place in October, 1885—before he returned to America in 1885, we met a Mr. David Lewis at Aberavon, Wales—my husband talked to him about the business we were over here upon—after my husband had gone back to America Mr. Lewis brought the prisoner and introduced him to me at 47, Woburn Place—I had never seen or heard of him before—he was simply introduced as Mr. Lewis's solicitor—about two days afterwards the prisoner called alone, and asked if I would permit him to see the Colonel's papers, which I declined—he said he was employed by the Lewis branch of the family as their solicitor in the case—they purported to be a</p>

               <p>Lewis branch of the Towneley family—two or three days after he called again, saying he had investigated but found they had no connection with the Towneley family, and he said he had found the decree of the Court in the case pertaining to the Lewis family—I asked him if he would bring me an epitome of the decree—he called again in a few days, saying that he had found in his investigations some very important knowledge relative to the Towneleys; he had met with a young man (not giving me any name) who knew where to obtain the evidence of the marriage of Mary Towneley and John Lawrance—I asked him whom the young man was—he said he could not make his name known—I said, "What evidence have you that he has any knowledge?"—he said he was employed in making a search of papers in a case of Lord Norreys in Towneley Hall, and there he found the evidence of Mary Towneley's marriage recorded by her father in a book of pedigree—I asked if it was a matter of money—he said, "Of course"—he said he would see the young man and know what he would give me the information for—next day he called and told me £200—I said in the absence of my husband I did not feel I could pay out so large a sum; I was willing to divide the responsibility and pay £100—he left, and returned next day and said the young man was satisfied; he would take £100, and that he would accompany him if their expenses were paid—I paid him £25 in cash to cover his expenses to Burnley, in Lancashire, to visit Towneley Hall—on the 15th December, 1885, he returned and reported his success, and showed me a piece of paper with two or three lines written on it—it was only a copy—he left it with me—it was a written memorandum, "Mary Towneley, born 17th May, 1670, and clandestinely married in March, 1695, at P."—he said he understood by inquiry at Towneley that "P." meant Paris—I asked him why Paris—he said he understood that two of Mary Towneley's sisters were in a convent in Paris, and that she had crossed there, and was clandestinely married while there—I replied that it looked a very small matter to pay so large a sum of money for, but as I agreed to do so I would do it, and I drew a cheque for £100—I asked the prisoner to whom I should draw it—he said himself—I said I could not do that—I preferred drawing it to the party he had employed, as he was a stranger to me, and in my husband's absence I preferred knowing the name—he hesitated a few moments and then replied that I could draw it to S. Cade—I did so—he then gave me this receipt, "Re Towneley Estates. Received of Mrs. Jaquess cheque for £100 for Mr. Cade for private information relating to the above"—on my husband's return I told him what I had done, and handed him the receipt—I knew the action was going on—after my husband's return the prisoner told my husband at 47, Woburn Place, that he had a friend in the Treasury who had given him very valuable infor<lb/>mation, and he had also received a letter from the solicitor of the Treasury, stating that a prior claim had never been settled for, and that this action could not proceed until that was settled—I heard him say that at one time there were £14,000,000 sterling of funds belonging to this estate—when he told my husband about the £14,000,000 and the Treasury letter no one else was there but myself.</p>

Hare and Son, who acted as agents for the Treasury at that time, and they said they knew nothing of it—while those inquiries were going on I received this letter of 10th August from 40, Chancery Lane—on receiving that letter I made no further inquiry; I marked the paper "Nil," and treated the matter as a mistake, and sent the letters to be put on the Treasury file—I did not think it necessary to communicate with Sir Augustus Stephenson, because he would open the letters and distribute them to the gentlemen in the department who had to deal with them—I did not think it necessary to carry it any further.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor practising at 40, Chancery Lane; I bought the business of Mr. Thomas, in May, 1890—that was just after the litigation in Lawrance against Lord Norrey was over—I had nothing whatever to do with that—I kept his name in the business, but he had nothing to do with it—he came to the office from time to time—about 1st August, 1891, I remember Colonel Jaquess seeing me at 40, Chancery Lane, with reference to the alleged claim being made to the Treasury—as the result of that interview I wrote the letter of 1st August, 1891, to the Treasury; my clerk wrote it, and I signed it—at that time the name of Thomas had not been abandoned; I was carrying on bus<lb/>iness in the name of Thomas and Metcalfe, but he was entirely out of the business—I think he had began to take steps to go to the bar at that time, or shortly afterwards—I think I was away on 10th August, when Mr. Thomas came to the office—I think Colonel Jaquess had left the office, when the letter to the Treasury was written; it was written on his instructions—I don't think I communicated the fact of that letter being written to Mr. Thomas personally; I think my clerk did—I had some conversation with him afterwards, and he said, I ought not to have written such a letter without instructions—I know of his writing a letter to the Treasury, saying that the matter was a mistake; that might have been about three weeks after the letter had been written, or about a fortnight after the 10th August.</p>

I live at 118, Titchfield Street—I am landlord of 20, Pitt Street—the woman who lives in the parlour let a room to the prisoner—he or his wife paid the rent—I used to collect it every Monday night or Thursday—the woman in charge of the parlour lets the rooms, I only collect the rents—tenants should give notice when they are going to leave, but I am sorry to say they never did—Brail was a weekly tenant—I never got any notice of his intention to give up his room—as far as my knowledge goes no notice was given, and when I went round there on the Monday evening I found he was gone—the room was empty, and three weeks' rent was due, which has never been paid—no statement was made to me as to where he had gone, or where I could find him.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Thomas Wood, of 30, Jubilee Place, King's Road, Chelsea—on February 24th the prisoner came to lodge in our house—in the first instance, a woman came and took the rooms, giving the name of Mrs. Ravine, and afterwards the prisoner came and gave his name as Mr. Ravine—they took the kitchen and top floor front—they stopped with me ten weeks—they had a good many visitors, principally foreigners—a man stopped with them a portion of the time, who Mr. Brail said was a Dutchman—I do not know what his name was—I remember some loud talking downstairs, but did not go down; I stood on the stairs and asked them to be quiet and shut the door and make a little less noise, and next morning he gave me notice—I believe the Dutchman slept in the kitchen, and the prisoner said he was going back to Holland.</p>

I live at 8, Little Smith Street—in February last I was working for Mr. Vitz, a cabinet-maker—about the month of February the prisoner came there to work as a cabinet-maker—I knew him by the name of Fritz when he came first—I became acquainted with him by being a fellow workman—after he had been there some little time, and I had been working with him, he asked if he could have letters addressed to the shop—I said, "No," he could leave them at the corner—I knew he was living at this time at Jubilee Place, to the best of my knowledge—he said he did not think he should remain there long; he was not satisfied, and he talked about removing; something to that effect—he asked if he could have some letters addressed to me—I said, "Yes"—I gave him my name and address in writing—he said, "Can I have some letters addressed to you?"—I said, "Why?"—he said, "There is nothing in it, no more than I am not going to stay long where I am. Leave it on a piece of paper," and I gave it to him—he said they were foreign letters in the ordinary way—after that letters were delivered at my house, No. 8, Little Smith Street, and a few papers came and a post-card or two—they were mostly letters from the Continent—he afterwards gave me the name of Ravine and afterwards Brail—I could not say exactly whether he gave me the name of Brail before the letters came or when they were coming—how was it he gave me the name of Brail? I do not know—he wrote it on the table, and I said, "Then Fritz was your Christian name?"—he said, "Yes"—afterwards he said, "That is my proper name, Brall"—I helped him to remove his goods from Jubilee Place to Park Walk in a builder's van—two other friends helped him to move; they were not foreigners—there was a little fellow that worked in the shop—I do not know in what name the house at 54, Park Walk, was taken—I did not give permission for it to be taken in my name—I was in the house, 54, Park Walk, on the 31st of May, when the officers came—I was engaged in doing some work there to a chiffonnier for the prisoner—I do not know if it was one of the things removed from Park Walk—I had not been at Park Walk long, perhaps not half an hour, when the officers came—the officers showed me at Park Walk on that day an agreement bearing a name very similar to mine; the Christian name was not the same, and the other name was not quite the same; there was an "o" instead of an "a."</p>

               <p>in a cellar loose, I believe—they were taken in a basket or small box in the van—I believe that a young rabbit died in the cellar—when helping to move the furniture to Park Walk, I did not notice anything broken—there was nothing unusual about the prisoner—I cannot say I ever heard him advocate violent measures—I worked in the same room with the prisoner at Vitz's—I had a good many opportunities of speaking to him—before he asked me to take letters for him he asked the number of Vitz's shop—there was no number to it; it is only a loft over a stable—I understood that he did not intend to have letters addressed there as there was no number—when the prisoner removed to Park Walk there was no attempt at concealment; it was a middle-sized builder's open van with no cover—it was five o'clock, I think, when we started; they went to get the van at out three, but there were no horses in—it was light; everything could be seen—I had merely started to unscrew the piece of furniture when the police came—there was polish there, methylated spirits, and varnish—at Vitz's brasswork on cabinets is generally sent to the brass finisher to be regilded, and if it is inlaid we rub it down with pumice and oil—the van came back a second time for the rest of the goods—we filled the four-wheeled van twice out of the two rooms.</p>

Are you looking for some more dynamite?"—a little time after, while changing his clothes, he remarked, "I wish I had nothing to do with these fellows"—I then took him in a cab to 54, Park Walk—he was there when the officers searched the house—I found this pocket-book on a table.</p>

He was with me about twelve months ago, he was studying chemistry. He lives somewhere in the Whitechapel Road, I believe, I don't know the name," but subsequently he gave the name and Inspector Melville wrote it down—I do not know what the name was; I did not take any notice of it—I then went into the back parlour and made a further search there; that was used as a bedroom—it was the only bedroom in the house—under the bed I found this port<lb/>manteau, and in it I found sixteen plaster of Paris moulds, apparently for making counterfeit coin; fifteen of them were for making five franc pieces, and the sixteenth for an English half-crown; they were packed exactly as they are now—I took three of them out of the portmanteau and took them up to the prisoner—I said, "How do you account for these things we found under your bed?"—he said, "Oh, they don't belong to me; they belong to a Frenchman named Fritz, who was in my house when I lived in Jubilee Place"—I said, "Where does Fritz live?"—he said, "In Charlotte Street or Cleveland Street, I don't know which n—he said, "The box is downstairs"—I said, "What box?"—he said, "The</p>

What is the hole for?"—he said, "That is where I keep rabbits"—I said, "It is a funny place to keep rabbits, about three feet under the ground"—he said, "It might be so, but that is what it is for"—a great many foreign newspapers were found in the prisoner's sitting-room, news<lb/>papers of a revolutionary character—the prisoner was shortly afterwards taken into custody, and he was searched, and in his possession were found five cards of membership of the United Socialist Society of London—I found no rabbits, or any trace of rabbits having been there—I looked particularly—I asked him where they were, and he said they had died—I produce a photograph of the man Francois—that man arrived in England on the 27th June, 1892—I made inquiry for him at 20, Pitt Street, subsequently to October, 1893—I arrested Francois in Hinde Street, Poplar, on October 13th, 1892—he was passing in the name of Brall—he had papers of Brail about him—in November, 1893, I saw the prisoner—he said, "You have made a great fuss about the running about you have had after Francois; if you had come to my house you could have found him easily. You could have had him without any trouble," or words to that effect—I was present on 16th February at the search of the Autonomie Club, Windmill Street—immediately afterwards the houses further down, within two hundred yards of Tottenham Court Road, were searched the same night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lecturer on chemistry, Fellow of the Royal Society, and Chemical Adviser to the Explosives Department of the Home Office—on the 1st of June I received from Inspector Sweeney a box con<lb/>taining a number of articles—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is not the box, but these are the contents—I found a number of bottles, some solids, and a number of pieces of glass apparatus, electric batteries, and some wires, two Florence oil flasks, such as are often used in chemical experiments, a spirit lamp, a bottle containing three and a half ounces of sulphuric acid; that is a strong acid, this is a pound bottle—in another bottle there is a very small quantity of nitric acid; that is a pint bottle—there were two bottles which were empty, but which smelled of methylated spirits; they are not here now; they were submitted to me by Inspector Sweeney—methylated spirits is alcohol mixed with methyline and naphtha—there was another bottle which did contain methylated spirit; it is not here now—I made an analysis of the contents of that bottle—the strength of the ordinary methylated spirit is 63 over proof—I have since found that you can get that same strength at ordinary oil shops; there was one and three-quarter ounces in the bottle—the bottle was large enough to contain about a pint and a half—another bottle was submitted to me containing 72 grains of mercury; that bottle was large enough to have held 900 grains—this 23-ounce bottle contained 210 grains of fulminate of mercury; the bottle, when I saw it, was more or less coated with it—that led me to conclude that it had con<lb/>tained more, and that it had been emptied—fulminate of mercury is a very high explosive—in causing legitimate explosions it is never used by itself, it is too dangerous to handle—it is the chief material in starting so-called high explosives; in fact many of them can only be fairly started by means of it, dynamite and gun-cotton, for instance, you cannot fairly explode without the fulminate as a detonator—it greatly increases the force—it is made of mercury dissolved in nitric acid, and then spirit is added to it—it is not boiled, simply heated, and sometimes it need not be heated—methylated spirit, such as I found an ounce and a half of,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250100"/>
               <p>would be perfectly adapted for making fulminate of mercury; I made some of it with that identical spirit—the nitric acid I found is also of the quality for making fulminate—it was not from the materials I found in the various bottles that I made fulminate of mercury; there was not enough nitric acid; I only used some of the spirit—in that other box I found an electric battery—I should think it was in working order; it would require the addition of the necessary acids—it is now broken, but the mechanical part of it was in good order—I also found a quantity of electric wires of two kinds, one covered with indiarubber and an ordinary electric wire covered with cotton, like ordinary electric bell wire—it would be possible to start an explosive, such as fulminate of mercury, by the use of batteries and wires, and to explode it—the action of the battery would generate heat at the end of the wire—heat generated by such a battery as I found, when properly charged, would be sufficient to explode fulminate of mercury—the wire must be ended by a fine wire, which is put in the fulminate; the fine wire gets red hot, and sets fire to the fulminate—it is a very general way of doing it—it depends on the length of the wire whether it is safer to the operator—the length of the wire does not deteriorate the heat; that would be generated at its end—I had also shown to me a number of glass tubes, no retort, a Florence flask, and a sent glass—nitro-glycerine is made of nitric acid, and sulphuric acid with glycerine, in proper ascertained proportions, and it is a very high explosive—it is the very high explosive that is practically used—the small quantities of nitric and sulphuric acids are at present rather weak, but I have no doubt they were much stronger; nitric acid gets weaker in time—taking out the stopper would not weaken it, it is the light on it, but it is strong enough to make nitro-glycerine now—when nitro<lb/>glycerine is absorbed by cotton, or something, it becomes dynamite—I had a translation handed to me of a number of recipes for manufacturing explosives, Nos. 2 and 3 for fulminate of mercury, 5, 6, 7 and 8, for making gun-cotton; No. 9 for making nitro-glycerine; No. 9A is for making dynamite; Nos. 1 and 12 are two recipes for making an explosive which requires sulphuric acid to explode it; that is called here "Explosive Vaillant"—that would be a very powerful explosive—I have had shown to me a quantity of cartridges, some with bullets, and some without; they are loaded with gunpowder—blank cartridges have been used for causing explosions—they have been used in such a way as to start a detonator; scarcely in place of a detonator, but for starting one—I have knowledge of the book containing directions and recipes, from which it would be possible for a person following that to manufacture the explosives which are named in the book, including fulminate of mercury, very nearly—it is some years since I read the book, but this apparatus given to me by Sweeney is perfectly well adapted for use in following out such recipes and directions as are found in this book; for nitro glycerine it might be used—the passage in the book headed "Appendix" gives a practical recipe and direction for making fulminate of mercury in this apparatus there is retort, but it might be made quite easily to manufacture fulminate of mercury, with the flask and condenser—a retort has advantages—there is no cork provided for this—if a cork were provided, one of these Florence flasks would be the retort.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">identified the articles in the box as those which he found upstairs</hi>)—ferro-cyanide of potassium may be used for an unlawful purpose, and is referred to in Most's book—in the other box was hydrochloric acid and another solution, also sal<lb/>ammoniac and mother-of-pearl, and pumice stone; that may be used for lawful or unlawful purposes—also nitric acid and oxide of mercury—there was some quicklime—oxide of mercury may be used for fulminate—mercuric-oxide is used with ointment and some<lb/>times for experiments by students, but not in making oxygen—it is too expensive, and you get so little oxygen out of it; but it was the means by which oxygen was discovered—I can give you authority on the use of oxide of mercury, but I rely on myself—I am not aware that the inventor, Howard, suggested it should not be used for fulminate—the cartridges could be used for starting explosions in infernal machines—not all of them, but they could be used to start a detonator—as I told the Magistrate the blank cartridges are used for other purposes than starting an explosion—they would be useless without other appliances—the battery I examined (<hi rend="italic">I looked at two others</hi>) was in good working order—there was nothing more to interfere with its action than you could set right in a few minutes—I have not seen one like it before—it is a carbon and zinc battery—any battery might be used for causing an explosion, but I have had no experience of one like this—it was incomplete for causing explosion—there was no switch or communicator—it is disconnected—there was twenty-seven to thirty feet of wire, allowing the man fifteen feet distance to start an explosion—I did not know it was alleged to be used for explosive purposes—it could be used for a telephone, or many lawful purposes, or an electric bell, or electro gilding—I would not deny that it was used in the prisoner's business—it had been used very little—the carbon shows signs of some use—the zinc rod has to be amalgamated—the process is, the zinc rod is dropped into the acid, a small amount of mercury is put on, and the mercury amalgamates with the zinc, and as long as the battery is not closed, the zinc is not acted on—all batteries are now amalgamated—mercury is used to amalgamate the zinc in a battery of that kind in a lawful way—I find no trace of its having been charged as a Bunsen; my opinion is, it has been charged as a bichromate battery—if it were charged as a Bunsen it would require nitric acid and sulphuric acid—hydrochloric, orany acid would do for amalgamating—sulphuric acid is generally used—with the other appliances there would be sufficient force in that single cell to ignite the fuse—the wire used is finer than hair; a very small battery would do it—I have seen an electric fuse used with a battery you could put in your waistcoat pocket and causing ignition—I am not an expert in electricity, but I have examined many hundred electric fuses—not one ingredient of the "Explosive Vaillant" recipe was found—for the gun cotton there was nitric acid, but it was rather weak, not at present of the strength recommended in the recipe—there was no glycerine, and</p>

               <p>no ingredients for blasting gelatine except nitric acid and sulphuric acid—there were no ingredients for dynamite—salicyliate of soda is a common drug used against rheumatism, and quite incapable of being used in causing explosions—I never heard of its being so used—Most's book would give sufficient information for preparing nitro-glycerine—we have experience that perfectly uneducated men have done it—Whitehead was indicted for manufacturing it in Birmingham; a large quantity, and he was unedu<lb/>cated—he made it from this prescription, and with the possession of Most's book it could be done quite easily—in regard to 10<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, blasting gelatine, and No. 4, nitro-gelatine, Most's book gives no directions how to do it—you might use the glass tubes found for innocent purposes—I do not think I said at the Police-court they could be used for making explosives—I must have misunderstood the question; certainly the tubes would not be necessary—a rod might be used for stiring; there is no virtue in the rod—a spirit lamp might have been used for making the fulminating mercury—sometimes it boils of itself—the application of heat is recommended in Most's book, not in the recipe—it depends on the strength of the acids whether it would be required—Florence flasks are very useful for making fulminate of mercury—two were given to me—the neck of one is broken and the other is bent over—<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a flask it is intended to make a kind of retort of—a chemist might have it—the other is a flask of commerce—many chemists would buy an ordinary flask and bend the neck over, or it might have been bought at a chemical apparatus shop—it would hold ten or eleven ounces—in one of them was ferro-cyanide of potassium—that is commonly used for making <hi rend="italic">amorces</hi>—it would not be used for making any explosive on that list—methylated spirit is used by cabinet-makers, and in the spirit lamp—1 3/4; ounces of spirit were found, none was left—I thought at first it was something else, and that made me use it up—I thought, in favour of the prisoner, I ought to examine it and make sure it was not something else—I found an error in division had been made by my assistant of two per cent, as to its strength, and I at once informed your chemist—I gave the evidence at the Police-court, not my assistant; everything was done under my supervision—you cannot swear always to every division being right; it is very unfortunate, and I am very sorry about it—the present strength is exactly the strength for making fulminate of mercury—the error was small, and the figures are practically identical—the spirit I bought at the time I was at the Police-court was always 60 or 61 over proof, and when I found this out I got samples from different oil shops, and found it was stronger commercially than I thought it was; it has got stronger lately.</p>

               <p>to me—to an ordinary observer the bottle would appear to be empty—I did not weigh nor measure the acid; the one-eighth of an ounce was a rough guess—I only tested that it was nitric acid—there are sixty grains in one-eighth of an ounce—I only used a few grains in my test; I sup<lb/>pose the rest of it is still in the bottle—part of it was used by Dr. Teed; some of it is here still—I determined the strength in conjunction with Dr. Teed, when he called to analyse it under the order of the Court—its strength was 64 per cent.—I had not determined the strength previously; the appearance of the bottle was quite sufficient—a specific gravity of about 1.4, or perhaps a little less, corresponds with 64 per cent.; the gravity corresponding to that strength is stated in my book to be 1.42—that is a common gravity for nitric acid—nitric acid of that gravity is not referred to in any of these recipes—in making the formula there is a gravity given, and that happens to be almost exactly the strength to be used—the gravity of the nitric acid given in the recipes is 1.48 to 1.5—there are not the constituent elements of gun-cotton or nitro<lb/>glycerine here—it might he that the thistle funnel, the Florence flask, spirit lamp, glass tubes, and other apparatus and chemicals suggest that whoever used them knew how to buy chemical apparatus and chemicals—I don't know what acid he bought; nitric acid gets weaker by keeping—the present gravity of the nitric acid found in the prisoner's possession is a little less than 1.42—I stated at the Police-court that this acid was suited for the composition of all these different substances given in the recipes, because the appearance of the bottle showed it was a strong acid—I judged by the appearance—I have made nitro-glycerine with acid of that strength—nitric acid would be necessary for making a Bunsen battery, and it is used for staining wood—it is almost exactly the strength for making fulminate of mercury—the fifty-four grains left in the bottle would make about four grains of fulminate—it would require about four grains or one-fifth less of mercury to make four grains of fulminate; 100 of mercury would make about 120 of fulminate—mercury is necessary for amalgamating the zinc for the battery—there is no evidence that any of the mercury had been used for amalgamating zinc—the zinc rod of the battery was amalgamated—mercury had been used for that—three and three-quarter ounces of sulphuric acid were given to me—its strength was 1.82, the common strong commercial acid—I suppose any<lb/>one could buy it—it is of the exact strength given in the recipe—it may be used in the battery, and in amalgamating the zinc—I believe it is used for cleaning some metal work; not for brass, so far as I know—I don't know if it is used for staining wood; I have no experience of that—it blackens wood, but destroys it at the same time—the bottle containing fulminate of mercury is a twenty-three ounce bottle—it con<lb/>tained two and one-tenth grains—I used about half a grain for my analysis—the bottle was not sealed when I got it—Inspector Sweeney handed it to me—an ordinary person might have called the bottle empty; I do not—I suppose about one and a quarter or, one and a half grain was still in it when Dr. Teed called—that quantity is still in it, and it is ten times more than is necessary to test it—I took out about a quarter of the two and one-tenth grains to test—I did not know at all what it was when I started, but I am quite certain now—I did not say at the Police-court I took out two and one<lb/>tenth grains to test—I said the whole quantity was two and one-tenth grains—I</p>

               <p>took it all out and weighed it, and put it back again—some is now at the bottom and some at the side, because I wanted to illustrate how it was when I found it—there is a passage in the depositions, "The whole interior was more or less coated with a grey powder, some of which I have taken out to analyse. I got out two and one-tenth grains for analysis"—I did swear I got out two and one-tenth grains, but I did not use it all for analysis—this recipe found in the prisoner's possession for making fulminate of mercury is a workable one—I am acquainted with Liebig's process—Recipe No. 3 is an exact copy of Liebig's process—it is based on Liebig's evidently; the quantity of alcohol is slightly different, the proportions of mercury and acid are the same, three parts of mercury, thirty-six of acid, and twice seventeen of alcohol—I understand Trail's hydrometer referred to by Liebig—as far as I remember he gives 90 per cent., and he might mean either weight or volume; it is not stated—he gives it by specific gravity, it is neither weight nor volume—Trail's hydrometer gives the percentage by volume—Liebig refers to that—the 90 per cent, in the recipe does not say weight or volume—the range is so wide that it may be weight or volume; it does not matter—by weight is a much more convenient method than by volume—I took 62 over proof, Liebig says from 90 to 92—the recipe gives 90—57 8 over proof would correspond to 90 per cent, by volume—I took it by weight—Trail's hydrometer is not mentioned here at all—I don't know whether Trail's is the ordinary Continental method; it is in very general use, but it is not in use here—the spirit and the nitric acid are slightly different from those given in the recipe—the nitric acid is almost exactly the same—the gravity of the small quantity that represents the whole is 136—the percentage of nitric acid corresponding to 1 36 is a little less than 55—that is 9 per cent, different from that which I give—I cannot just now give an authority who recommends 90 per cent, by weight—the powder in the bottle was in crystals, exactly the same as those of fulminate of mercury—I dissolved a small quantity of it in hydrochloric acid; it gave a taste which has the effect of another acid, and has a peculiar effect on the throat—then I put a drop on a piece of gold and touched it with iron and it gave a spot of mercury—I also exploded it—I did all that with half a grain; I could do it all with one-tenth of a grain—I know of no other substance which would have answered the tests I have enumerated and which led me to think it was fulminate of mercury—I stake my pro<lb/>fessional reputation on that—have often used a Florence flask for pre<lb/>paring fulminate of mercury—this one could be used for it—the vacant air space in the vessel used for making the fulminate ought to be about twenty times the volume of the acid—Liebig gives very large space; I don't remember exactly his figures—I think you could use one ounce of the mixture of alcohol, nitric acid, and mercury in this flask at each charging—about one twenty-fourth of an ounce would be the pro<lb/>portion of mercury in that, and you would get one-fifth more than one twenty-fourth of an ounce, or about twenty grains of fulminate of mercury—it is never kept in the dry state; always mixed with water—this bottle holds twenty-three ounces of water, not twenty<lb/>three ounces of fulminate of mercury—I should say it would take quite 1,500 operations with this Florence flask to fill this bottle with fulminate"—each operation would take about a quarter of an hour, which would be</p>

               <p>365 hours for all the 1,500 operations—I washed the fulminate out of this bottle with water—I never get bottles sealed in these cases; I get them personally handed over, which is quite sufficient—this bottle was not sealed—two other compounds of mercury have the same percentage com<lb/>position as the fulminate, but they do not explode—Watt's "Dictionary of Chemistry" is an authority to some extent, not much—I dispute the statement in the second volume of that work, "The only fulminate of which a satisfactory analysis has been made is the silver salt," and I can give a very good authority for disagreeing with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of science of the London University, and public analyst to Islington and Camberwell—under an order of the Court I attended Dr. Dupre's laboratory last Thursday and analysed certain substances submitted to me—I wished to examine the spirit, but there was none left; I then said I should like to ascertain the strength of the nitric acid—I asked the doctor if he had the strength—he replied in the negative—I suggested we might do it together—we ascertained the strength to be slightly under 64 per cent.—63.9 was my actual figure—that, as Dr. Dupre says, is a gravity of 1.42—I examined the sulphuric acid, and came to the conclusion that it was an ordinary commercial sample, and not chemically pure, but a common acid—we looked at the mercury, but got nothing out of that—seeing the small quantity of fulminate of mercury present I said I would not take the responsibility of examining that on myself—I found a number of chemical apparatus, which, in my judgment, were quite innocent—they are very much the list Dr. Dupre has given—the opinion I formed was that it was a sort of rubbish swept from an amateur chemist's labora<lb/>tory, a sort of residuum—mercury oxide might be used for making ful<lb/>minate as well as any mercurial compound, but the inventor Howard, in 1800, recommended it should not be used—he was the discoverer ninety<lb/>four years ago—in the first instance he actually made it from that sub<lb/>stance, but in the same paper in which he gives the results he states that metallic mercury is much better—it might be used for making oxygen, as Dr. Dupre has told you, and in medicine as ointment—it is one of the ointments in the British Pharmacopoeia—chemists use it in the elementary part of their studies, as an experimental method of making oxygen—oxygen was discovered first by heating this compound—it is described in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250107"/>
               <p>every elementary text-book—I agree with Dr. Dupre that the cartridges might be used for starting a detonator, but probably not for causing an explosion directly, and for starting a detonator there would necessarily be other apparatus associated with them—by them<lb/>selves they are practically harmless—no such other apparatus was shown to me—I was shown a single-cell battery which might be charged as a Leclanche or a Bunsen—if charged as a Leclanche, it would require di-oxide of manganese, and as a Bunsen it would require nitric acid and sulphuric acid—I have never known such a single-cell battery used for causing explosions—I agree with Dr. Dupre on the length of wire, thirty feet—I think that is not sufficient; you could only get fifteen feet away from the explosion—I should consider that distance dangerous—I was shown no switch, fuses, or other apparatus for causing explosions, electrical or otherwise—it was a peculiar-shaped battery; I cannot say I have ever seen one exactly like it before, but it might be used for electric silvering, gilding, or ringing bells, or almost any of the purposes for which batteries are used—I agree with Dr. Dupre it has been used, but not recently, for several hours or a day or two—the zinc has been amalgamated, and, as Dr. Dupre told you, you can see minute globules of mercury on it—the dustiness and corrosion of the brass work at the top, and the corroded condition of the wire, suggest to me it has not been used for about a year or more, but it is difficult to tell—the elements of it, as Dr. Dupre told you, are frequently used, carbon on one side and zinc on the other, with a porous pot between, but the carbon is usually a large rod inside, and the zinc is outride, but here the zinc is inside, and the carbon in many rods outside—to cause amalgamation I agree with Dr. Dupre hydro-chloric acid or diluted sulphuric acid is more frequently used; you dip the zinc rod in the weak sulphuric acid, and then put it into the mercury, and it absorbs the mercury and becomes like a mirror—supposing there was sufficient apparatus with that cell I should not think it was strong enough to ignite a fuse, but I am not an expert in electricity—looking at the recipe, "Explosive Vaillant," I agree with Dr. Dupre none of those materials were found, certainly not shown to me—there were none of the constituents of gun-cotton—I think Dr. Dupre agrees with me that acid of the strength mentioned in those prescriptions is not present in that bottle, for the preparation of gun-cotton, or glycerine, or for fulminate—there are three varieties of nitric acid used in commerce: 1.5 acid is recommended here for gun<lb/>cotton and nitro-glycerine; 1.42 acid, which is present in that bottle; and 1.36 acid, which is recommended for fulminate, which requires 1.36; the other explosives require 1.5—absolutely no ingredients for dynamite were found—I think the directions are not sufficient for the fabrication of an explosive by a man uneducated in chemistry—if I recollect rightly it was the fulminating mercury that Dr. Dupre agreed there was sufficient instruction as to—I vary from him by Haying what he subsequently told us, that there is no reference to how far it is safe to fill your flask, and that an unskilled man might fill it to such a heigth that the whole of the liquid might boil all over the place, and you would have your explosive compound all over your table, and so on—in nitro-glycerine (No. 4) there are absolutely no directions; as to gun<lb/>cotton, I should think not sufficient, but I would not insist on that; No. 9</p>

               <p>not sufficient; blasting gelatine, insufficient; there is a general deficiency of instructions—Liebig, writing for his original paper published in 1855, gave far fuller directions, although writing for chemists, than are given here for men who presumably are not chemists—I think that paper, if in<lb/>tended to be used, must have been for a highly skilled man—I look on it rather as memoranda—I agree with Dr. Dupre that none of the glass tubes could have been used for making explosives—the spirit lamp is not mentioned in any of the directions—it is not necessary, and I do not see how you could use it—the two Florence flasks are slightly different; the neck is wanting from this one, but from its general appearance I should say it had been used for oil; this other is a different shape, and clear glass—I do not think it has been used for oil, but for chemical experi<lb/>ments—as Dr. Dupre suggested the glass has been turned out, but I should not think by an amateur, because the piece of tube shown to me was evi<lb/>dently turned out by an amateur, and the style of workmanship was different—<hi rend="italic">this</hi> is a piece of lead glass, and the operator has evidently not known that it was lead glass, and he has not known how to use it, and was not able to turn it out neatly; one is an unskilled, the other a skilled piece of work, which could be procured at any dealers in chemical apparatus, of which there are many in town known to Dr. Dupre—they are sold openly—<hi rend="italic">this</hi> one is a ten-ounce flask; I measured it in the presence of Dr. Dupre—there are slight traces of ferro-cyanide of potas<lb/>sium in this flask, the only trace in the whole collection, and it shows that the flask could not last have been used for making fulminate, for if so, and it had not been very thoroughly washed, you might have a trace of acid left—I do not think there is any evidence on that point; I under<lb/>stood from Dr. Dupre this flask was clean, that is, that nothing was alleged to be in it—Dr. Dupre said ferro-cyanide could be used for making an explosive; I was not aware of it until to-day—methylated spirit is used for furniture polish in the cabinet trade and in the spirit lamp—taking Dr. Dupre's figure, it is not the strength required by these prescript<lb/>tions for making fulminate in the ordinary sense of 90 percent, of alcohol; the degrees over proof are not mentioned; on the Continent they use Trail's hydrometer graduated, so that the degree of the hydrometer gives percentage by volume of the alcohol, and that strength, as Dr. Dupre said, would be 57.8; I make it 57.76, but practically I agree with him, a little under 57.8, and the strength of that found on the proof scale is fifty-three, a difference of rather over five degrees between the spirit I found, and the spirit recommended—looking through the literature on the subject I did not come across a single example of spirit of 90 per cent by weight being mentioned; there are several instances of 90 per cent by volume being translated into 76 or 77 by weight, and there are other instances in Thorpe's "Dictionary of Applied Chemistry" where 90 and 92 volumes per cent are mentioned; most of these directions are simply copies of Liebig's directions which you have had before you this morning—we drained this bottle, and got under ten grains of nitric acid—we turned the bottle up, and weighed it, and we agree as to its strength—as I understood I do not think anything has been removed since—there are, perhaps, two or three grains left now: it is difficult to estimate such small quantities by the eye—the nitric acid was not that recommended in any of the recipes—nitric acid is used for staining wood—sulphuric</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250109"/>
               <p>acid is used for almost everything; it is one of the commonest chemicals used—I believe it is used in cleaning metal work—I don't know if it is used for staining wood—I know it darkens wood—I should think it is dangerous to conclude so decisively as to the fulminate from such a small quantity; for that reason I declined to test—you could prepare a very small quantity of fulminate in a Florence flask—I should not recommend a Florence flask for manufacturing it, you would want a far larger vessel, but it would do very well for experiments in a legitimate way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never been called or given evidence before with regard to explosives—I am an analyst—in certain cases if an inspector of weights and measures took some butter which he was a little suspicious of it would come before me; Dr. Dupre is a public analyst also—I have made no special study of explosives; only as a student—I went on behalf of the prisoner to test the accuracy of Dr. Dupre's analysis, which was challenged—I did not make any attempt to test the fulminate because I was acquainted with a mixture which will give most of the reactions of fulminate of mercury; that was my reason—the least quantity of fulminate of mercury with which you can get an explosion is the least quantity you can see—you can see a grain of it with the naked eye—I don't doubt Dr. Dupre's word as to the tests he applied to half a grain; but I read his depositions and I understood he had used two and one-tenth grains for analysis—when I called at his laboratory he offered what he estimated was one grain—I did not assume I was twice as clever at Dr. Dupre, and therefore I did not presume to do with one grain what he had used two and one-tenth grains to do—I did not ask him how much he had used, I thought it was so obvious—that, coupled with the fact that certain other substances give the same results, to a great extent was my reason for not testing what was left in the bottle—I cannot remember any substance to which those four tests Dr. Dupre gave this morning yield the same results; but I did not know what tests the doctor applied at that stage—the nitric acid is not strong enough to make nitro-glycerine according to the recipes—I know of no authority for it; I feel inclined to deny it—I heard that with the spirit of the strength that I and Dr. Dupre agree about fulminate of mercury was actually made—I was not surprised to hear that, because you can make it from any strength of spirit—I have seen a few of the residua from amateur chemists' laboratories—this is not rather the residuum of a student of the explosive part of chemistry, except the fulminate—the two chief ingredients of nitro-glycerine were not there, the nitric acid is not of the right strength—I do not agree that nitric acid becomes weakened to that extent by unstopping it and exposing it to light—slight weakness might occur—I heard Dr. Dupre say that from Thursday to Monday the deterioration was from 92 to 85—I did not hear the conditions under which the experi<lb/>ment was performed, but I heard the fact that it had deteriorated on ex<lb/>posure to light—I have not come across a battery like this before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, of 3, Whitecross Street—I have been in London about three years—I have known the prisoner about five years; I know him from Holland—I always knew him there as a good fellow, a hard-working man, a cabinet-maker; he was all right—he was the secretary of the Cabinet-makers' Society over there—I saw him the first time I came over here—he kept my box, and my brother's; some boxes of mine he kept for about three weeks—he was visited many times by fellow-workmen, a lot of them came over—he was in the habit of taking care of a lot of boxes for them—I knew about five whose boxes he kept—I was at his house in Jubilee Place, Chelsea, about three months ago; he was not in—I only saw the <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> and the little Fritz, his children—I stopped there half an hour, and said to the <hi rend="italic">missis</hi>, "I want to go away; I have no time"—I live so far away from there, and some man knocked at the door and inquired for the prisoner and brought a box about this length and this height into the house—I took only a little notice of it—I saw the same one before; the bottom part was bigger than the top; it was joined in the middle, and it was locked up—the <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> said, "Where do you come from"—he said, "That is no matter; I know Mr. Brail, and if you take the box a few weeks I think it is all right"—he took it in, and it was taken downstairs, and I left at the same time—I never saw the box again—I did not help to take it in—I think this is the same box—I did not notice any inscription on it—I took a bit of notice of it because I never saw a box like it before—a man took it downstairs, and Mrs. Brall helped him—I think the man's name was Renaud, or Recordi—I think he was a Frenchman; he spoke with a French accent—he was tall; taller than I am, with a black moustache and a little beard, a Napoleon beard; that is all I know of him—Mr. Brail kept rabbits in Jubilee Place; I saw them—I am from Arnheim—I gave the clerk a sketch of the rabbits I kept myself in Holland (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—one is at the top of the ground, the other is down under the ground—you have no room for it here—this shows the rabbits under the ground, and it is boarded all round; it is always right for the rabbits—if you put in four you get fourteen or so—you make a little hole round the boards, and the rabbits make the hole bigger—they eat the wood; they eat everything—it is boarded at the bottom as well—if you do not put the boards on it they go down every day—it would take about two feet to keep three rabbits, and three feet to keep half a dozen—you leave a little opening, or bore a hole—the rabbit makes the hole himself to go always to the same place, and he won't go to another hole—they come back</p>

               <p>glasses, and the bottles; I remember it all very well—he said to my husband, "Will you keep that so long for me when I go to Paris, and if you can sell it for thirty shillings you can sell it, and after I come back we will speak of that"—I have seen that man since; I saw him in January—Mr. Jered and Mr. Van Vincent were present when he brought these things in a portmanteau—I have sought to find the man, but cannot; I do not think he is in London now—besides the chemicals, there was a book where you put letters in, a pocket-book, and he put a little book in there and two letters, and said, "Take this away for me," and he had a small box of cartridges—I put some things in the pocket-book, and put it in a drawer, and afterwards I put some letters and tickets in—the police took everything out that was in them—I think this is the book—no, that is not the book—I put the things in a cupboard, where there were things for my children to play with, and my children's clothes; anyone could see them, I did not lock the door—I took these chemical things from Pitt Street to Jubilee Place—these are the articles—I remember a man bringing the box to Jubilee Place; my husband was not at home—Mr. Bosnian was there at the time—this is the box, "Absinthe "was printed on it—the man knocked at the door, and said, "Is Fritz at home?"—I said, "No, he is not at home, perhaps he comes in"—he said, "Can I leave the box here?"—I said, "I do not know if it is right for you to leave the box here"—he said, "Yes, I want to go for two or three weeks, and after I come back I will fetch it away," and I said, "Yes, you can lay it here"—he took it downstairs—he said, "I know your husband"—I think it is all right, and I take it in—I was accustomed to people asking my husband to take care of boxes, many times—the police often called at our house—I think altogether six times—the first time he said he was a doctor, at Pitt Street—he said he came looking for the cholera—I don't remember their names—I think one was Mr. Flood—I do not know if one was Inspector Melville, I think it was, he was a very tall, big man—I never saw him before—he came at dinner-time, one o'clock—first in the morning came two detectives, and at dinner-time came Mr. Melville—I do not know who it was—then two detectives came—my husband was not at home, and they asked me for a man's address, and as I never spoke to the man I did not know the address—they came three times for that—all these calls were in Pitt Street; and they called in Jubilee Place—they came to see a man, and my husband went out, and he came back with two detectives and brought them in—then I had gone out of the room, and afterwards my husband came—and they said, "No, that is not the man who went; we want a tall man, and that is a very little man"—the box was in the house at that time—we had the chemical things in Pitt Street; they were there when they came and asked for the address—I remember when the police came to the house in Park Walk—they came in like thieves—two or three came in the back, and three or four at the front—I had gone into the yard, and Mr. Sweeney said, "Come in the house, you have got lodgers!" and he went up—I was upstairs, and Melville said, "No, no, Mrs. Brall, you cannot come downstairs, you must stop up here"—I remember when the box was moved from Jubilee Place to Park Walk; Sterken, a friend of mine, was there—the box fell down and then it broke—I never saw these plaster casts before the morning—the bottom of the box was broken, and I was</p>

               <p>afraid it might come wet, and I put the things in a dirty apron, and put it in another portmanteau—my husband never made use of the things—he used to work after hours; he was always working after he came home, and the last time he made a wardrobe—he had many bottles, and used chemicals; sometimes he would do it with gloves, and sometimes with other things—he always said he must use leather for that—I never attempted to hide them; every bottle was in the place where my husband was working, in the back kitchen—he bought rabbits for the children in Jubilee Place, and kept them in a coal-cellar—we removed them to Park Walk.</p>

               <p>it was the Director of the Post Office, and we thought it better to take another name that might do better than Ravine or Brall—we thought Colon would be a good name, and we took the house in that way—I don't know of Colan knowing anything of that—the people my husband was in the habit of corresponding with were his mother and my mother and my sister; that is all—my sister lives in London, my mother in Amsterdam, and my sisters and brothers in Germany; they wrote lots of times, many letters—I wrote to say they were to send letters in the name of Colon and Ravine—I went with the things when they were removed from Jubilee Place to 54, Park Walk, and I helped to put things straight there, and to put the things on and in the cupboard upstairs—I took some of those things out of the box and afterwards I took the box into the area—those things had been in the front room second floor in Jubilee Place—that was a bedroom—at Pitt Street they were in the room where I lived—I put the box containing the moulds in the area at Park Place—when the officers came on 31st May, before my husband was brought there, I went round the house with them—I went with them into the upstairs room, where all these things were—they asked what they were, and now I became possessed of them—I said, "I have got them from a man; he has gone to Paris; he has gone away"—Mr. Melville said, "What is this?"—I said, "That is a bottle"—he said, "Yes, I see; who brought you the bottle?"—I said, "A man brought them"—he said, "Where is that man?"—I said, "He has gone away"—then he said, "Take Mr. Brall"—I did not tell Melville that I knew nothing about them—Melville called me down to the cellar, and said, "What is this hole?"—I said, "I don't know"—it was for the rabbits—I said I did not know Because I was very cross; night detectives came in like thieves, and my husband had not come in, And I was at home with the children, and you do not know what you must think when so many people come in a house—they asked me so many things that I was cross, and I would not answer everything they asked me—the only name of the Dutch Jew who asked me to take the things from Pitt Street was Leoni—that is the same name as the Dutch<lb/>man who used to live with us—he is not a member of the Autonomie Club; he only came here looking for work, and he found no work and went back—I do not think he ever told me he was a member of the Autonomie Club—Shapirer was the name of the man who brought the portmanteau a year ago—I saw him three or four times before at my house—I think he was a friend of my husband—when he brought the things he said, "Fritz, I go away to Paris, can I leave these lying here?"—he lived in Whitechapel, he said in some street off the Commercial Road—I saw him last January at my house at Pitt Street—I only saw him once in January for five minutes—he said he had come back from Paris and wanted to look here for work—my husband did not go out with him—he did not know he was coming; he never got a letter from him—neither I nor my husband said anything to him about the things that had been lying at Pitt Street for eight or nine months—my husband thought he would come back.</p>

               <p>Shapirer about two years ago—I met him at the docks—I have seen him a dozen or half dozen times in my life—I have seen him in the presence of a lot of people—I am called Fritz—the last time I saw Shapirer was in January this year at Pitt Street, when I came from my work—I moved these instruments from Pitt Street to Jubilee Street because I had to take care of them—they were no good to me; I did not know where the man was, but he was a friend of mine, and I knew he was studying chemistry—I never had a chance to sell them—I never noticed that the name of the chemist where the acids had been got had been rubbed off—one bottle of nitric acid was open, and I used that—I moved them because I would not leave a man's private property in another house—I knew, having read in the newspaper, that some violent Anarchists were making explosives and committing outrages—that did not make me curious as to what these things were, because the bottles were all empty; not even after the police visit to the Autonomie Club, because I was living then in Chelsea—I was not in possession of the things after Francois' arrest—when the policeman came to me when the house was searched I said to him, "What is up now? Are you looking for more dynamite?"—I said it out of fun, because I heard the last time they had found dynamite, and I thought I was on a friendly footing with the detectives—I did not think of explosives; I have never propagated outrages in my life—when I said I wished I had nothing to do with those fellows, I meant the members of the Autonomie Club, because I expect that was the only reason I had so many visits from the officers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William McLean, and live with him at The Laurels, North Cheam; I had been living at Bristol for some time—on 13th December I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>: "Would any lady or gentleman advance £100 for six months? Would have board and lodging for the same, large house, carriage, etc.—<hi rend="smallCaps">ADVANCE</hi>, London Street, Kingston-on-Thames"—in consequence of that advertise<lb/>ment, I communicated with the prisoner—after some correspondence I went to see him at The Laurels, North Cheam—acting on my solicitor's advice, I refused to advance the money unless he gave me a bill of sale, which he declined to do—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of a letter that I received rom the prisoner after this interview—the letters were thrown away,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189406250125"/>
               <p>and I picked up this; I did not know it was of any service, but I kept it—the letters were torn up in London among other things; my solicitor tore them up—it is a letter written by the prisoner to me; I kept this half, the other half is lost—on the first half is, "Dear Madam,—I do not care for a bill of sale; I can borrow money on a bill of sale at any time; that is what I wished to avoid, or I should not have advertised n—then it is torn—I have not been able to discover the other half of the letter—I was not present when Mr. Tilston tore the letter; this part was found in the waste-paper basket, the other part was not there—I can't remember what it contained—after receiving that letter I communicated with Mr. Tilston, who advised me not to have anything to do with the sale, and the matter fell through—Mr. Tilston was then acting for me; I subsequently went to Mr. Marsh—in January the prisoner wrote to me again, asking me to purchase the place—I have not got the letter; I suppose it was destroyed; I have looked for it—in it he said he had not succeeded in borrowing the money, and asking me to buy the contents of the house—I again communicated with Mr. Tilston, and on his advice I came to London on January 13th, and he went with me to The Laurels and saw the furniture and effects—I then saw the mare, dog-cart and harness, among outdoor effects—prisoner offered the things for sale for so much—Mr. Tilston told him to prepare a schedule of the things he offered for £100, and two days later I received a letter from him enclosing the inventory—this is the letter; it is the defendant's hand<lb/>writing, and this is the inventory—it includes the mare, cart and harness on January 31st, and this was signed by the defendant—at the bottom of the inventory are the words, "Received of Mrs. McLean £100 for the purchase of the whole property and effects in the inventory.—<hi rend="smallCaps">J. FRYER</hi>"—that was signed by Mr. McLean and myself—I gave a cheque for the £100 on the 31st—we took possession before the money was paid, and I drove the mare in the dog-cart on many occasions, and my husband rode the mare—I have a side saddle, which I purchased, to ride it—for the first part of the time the mare was kept in the stable attached to the house—the prisoner continued to reside in the house—after a time the mare was removed to an iron stable to make room for a pair of horses, which the prisoner had from London for approval or trial—afterwards on Easter Sunday I told him I was going to use the mare to go to Richmond—he looked very much surprised and confused—during February and March the mare was at times continued to be used by myself and my husband, but on Easter Sunday the prisoner said he had sold the mare, the dog-cart, and harness—I was very much surprised, but before I could ask him any question she went out of the, room—I at once communicated with my solicitor in London, and told him what had happened, and he wrote to the prisoner, and these pro<lb/>ceedings were taken in April—I was twice before the Magistrate at Epsom—I had given no authority for the sale at Aldridge's.</p>
