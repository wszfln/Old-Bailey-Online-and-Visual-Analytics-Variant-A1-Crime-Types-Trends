                  </hi>, clerk in the secretary's department, General Post Office. In consequence of complaints of missing letters I made inquiries, suspected prisoner, and on January 9 made up a test packet, addressed to "Birkenshaw, c/o Selby and Sons, 180, King's Street, Hammersmith," containing purse with two half-crowns, one florin, two shillings, and 2 1/2 d. in bronze, all bearing my private mark. The next day I saw prisoner in the private room at Hammer<lb/>smith Sorting Office, informed him that the packet had not been delivered, and asked him if he had any explanation to make. He said, "I do not remember anything about it." I asked him if he had any objection to turning out his pockets; he said, "No." Police<lb/>constable Sharman made a search; in his belt were found two half<lb/>crowns, one florin, two shillings; and one penny, marked coins, which I had put in the packet. I asked him if he had anything belonging to the post office at his lodgings; he said he had not. I asked him if he had any objection to his lodgings being searched, and he said, "No." Sharman then went to his lodgings and brought back the purse, the covering of the packet, and portions of the cardboard box contained in the test packet, and told prisoner, "I found them in your room at your lodgings."Prisoner then said, "I took the packet home and I was tempted to open it." He was then given into custody.</p>

               <p>the letters for prisoner's "walk." It was his duty to examine the letters and if one was not on his walk to put that into the proper walk. I saw prisoner put the letter out as an ordinary mis-sort packet, and then afterwards as he left the office he placed it in his bag. It was his duty if in possession of a letter out of his walk to post it at the nearest pillar box or if too large to go into the box to post it at the Hammersmith Broadway Post Office, where there is a large aperture, or bring it back to the office the next morning. Prisoner lives at 26, Queen's Street, close to Hammersmith Broadway Post Office, which is open till 11 p.m.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner's walk includes a portion of King's Street from No. 232 upwards; the test letter was addressed to 180, King's Street, which is out of his walk.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been eight years in the Army. I went to South Africa in 1901 and remained there till the close of the war, was in India for five years and took my discharge owing to deafness impeding my advancement, arriving in England in January, 1909. I put my name down for service in the Post Office and was employed in November, 1910. I have a pension of 3s. 6d. a week, which terminates in December, 1912. I could not say how I became possessed of the test letter. After I had done my delivery I found it in my bag. I could not get it into a pillar box, and took it home. I became curious and opened it, thinking it was a joke which was being played on me. I found a purse, the money, and a letter. I left the purse, letter, wrapper, etc., on the table at my lodgings and put the money in my belt for safety, intending to return it at the office the next morning. Being a little late, I forgot to bring the packet with me. I told Mr. Stratford that part of the money was mine, because there was 2s. or 3s. of my own money. I said that I had taken it with the intention of taking it to the office the next morning, but that it had escaped my memory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I live at 26, Queen's Street, Hammersmith, and close to the Broadway Post Office. I tried to repost the packet into a letter-box in King Street, but found it would not go in. I did not deliver it at Hammersmith Broadway because I thought that office would be closed.</p>

There are the following further convictions against him: One month on June 18, 1896, for stealing; two months on August 15, 1896, for loitering; nine months on April 21, 1897, for stealing; 18 months on December 5, 1899, for stealing; and three months on June 25, 1909, for loitering.

I told him that I could not do that as I did not know him and they said they would pay cash. The other man went and had a cup of tea while prisoner selected about £77 worth of goods. He then produced a cheque book" and on my saying I could not accept that he became indignant and said that his cheque was more than good for the amount. I asked him to give me the names of any firms he had bad dealings with and he said he was afraid that the principals would be gone, as it was then about 5.30 I suggested he should leave the cheque and, on my finding it was all right in the morning, I would forward the goods, but he said he would come with the cash next morning. I said I did not expect him to return and he need not try to play that game on me. He asked me whether I thought he was a thief and I said I did. I followed him out and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>, manager to Herbert Stanley Judson, 224, Clapham Road. About 8 p.m. on December 2 I left this cheque book in the safe and on arriving at the office the following morning I found the safe had been carried off. Prisoner has no right to the cheque book. There were 165 cheques left in it when I saw it last, but the bottom lot of cheques have now been torn off and 124 are missing. All the counterfoils to the missing cheques are blank, with the exception of one, which is in a strange handwriting.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate." I had no intention of defrauding the prosecutor of any goods. If I had taken the goods I could have met the cheque the next morning. The cheque book I found the day before."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). My name is William Owen Thomas. It was impossible for me to have stolen this cheque book because on the date it was stolen I was in Wakefield Prison and I was not discharged until January 13.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I found it the day before I was arrested. On the night before I was arrested a man named "Floyd," whom I had never seen before, lent it to me to buy some goods with; I was to sign my name. I saw him next morning as he arranged, and in the evening I went to the prosecutor's shop to get this jewellery. I had no banking account, but I could have gone in the morning and paid him the money before he presented the cheque. I had a man in the country who had ordered the goods; I do not wish to give his name.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS NICHOLLS</hi>. On January 13, about 10.30 a.m., I went with other officers to 13, Prebend Street, St. Pancras. In the first floor back room I saw prisoners sitting on either side of the fire. I told them we were police officers and were making inquiries respecting persons suspected of making counterfeit coin. They made no reply. I then opened the oven door and found there traces of plaster of paris. I then searched prisoner Hector and found nothing upon him. I then searched prisoner Ernest and found in his coat pocket these two moulds, which were still warm. They are both for making the same coin. Ernest said, when I had found the moulds, pointing to his</p>

               <p>brother, "He knows nothing about it." Hector said, "This is being out of work. I only came here to live because my landlady would not keep me." I then searched the room and found this pot and this metal beside the fire. They were exposed to view. I found also a quantity of tin and antimony, and a file in a tin box under a sort of table, which was hidden by a curtain. Prisoners were conveyed to Platt Street Station and charged. In reply to the charge they said "Yes."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The only object exposed to view of the articles I found was the saucepan. The stove was a range. I think the room was used as a living room. There are no convictions against Hector. I understand he bears a good character.</p>

                  </hi>, 49, Myddelton Square, N. On January 16, about 7.30 p.m., I was going home from John Street. At the corner of Chadwell Street and Myddelton Square prisoner was standing. He grabbed my chain, which broke at the swivel, and the bar. My waist<lb/>coat was torn open from top to bottom. I ran after him, crying "Stop, thief!" I was running on the pavement of the inner circle of the square and as I just got to the corner he doubled back. A policeman was in the passage there and prisoner found he could not get through. I ran after him. The policeman was quicker than I was. By the time I got to the other side of the square prisoner was in the arms of the policeman. Between the man and myself the pave<lb/>ment was clear. There is no question about who it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I do not know if you had an overcoat on; it was in the dark hour of the night. You ran towards the passage</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop, thief!" coming from the direction of Chadwell Street. I went towards the square and saw prisoner running towards me. Directly he saw me he ran back. I followed and caught him before he got out of the square. He was then walking. He had stopped running. When prosecutor came up he said prisoner had stolen his chain and I took prisoner to the station. The chain was found by me in the gardens of the square.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I came away from home at a quarter to six on January 16. I was going to Sadler's Wells Theatre, the first performance. When I got there it was about 20 past 7, and being rather late for the performance, I altered my mind and was going to see the proprietor of the "Vernon Arms." I then went to the top of the turning, where Sadler's Wells Theatre is, and went to the right of the square to make my way to Pentonville Road. About three yards from the corner a man rushed by me with an overcoat and cap on. I took no notice. Ten to 15 yards from the corner I heard someone behind me. I turned and saw the constable. He said, "You are the man that is running." I told him I had not been running and that he had made a mistake. He said, "Wait a minute." I waited about two minutes. The prosecutor came up and then the con<lb/>stable took me to the station. When they charged me prosecutor said he did not see my face; he only saw my cap; he said the man stole his chain. Surely he ought to recognise him by some more means. I am entirely innocent of the charge.</p>

I was having some whelks at a barrow; prisoner came and looked at me and just afterwards, when I had finished my whelks and was going off, some<lb/>body caught me from behind and emptied my pockets. He put his arm round my neck and held my head up; another hand was digging at my waistcoat pocket here and I felt also a number of them at my trousers pocket. I struggled and when I got loose I found two pockets sticking out, empty. I lost about 15s.</p>

I know you are not the man that went down my trousers pocket. For the defence two witnesses were called, who did not answer.</p>

Towards the end of August the two prisoners met me outside my factory. Rose said he had seen the upper floor at 11, Stroud Green Road, and that he thought it would suit him as a Solicitor's office. They came into the office and Boyd offered me a card, "F. Meredith Day, solicitor." and an address in Hornsey Road. He agreed to take the office and said he was going away, and his clerk (Ferdinando) would attend to it. I asked for a reference, which was given, and which I found satisfactory. A few days later Ferdinando called; I said I would accept Mr. Day as a tenant, and produced agreement for three years at a weekly rental of 14s. Ferdinando proposed to take the agreement away to be signed; I objected to that. I wanted to see it signed by Mr. Day. On September 10 Rose signed the agree<lb/>ment in the name of Frank Meredith Day, the signature being attested "F. E. Ferdinando" by the other prisoner in my presence. I should</p>

                  </hi>, 110, Fonthill Road, Hornsey. I am 15 years of age, and in 1910 was employed by the Eatwell Griffin Hygienic Laun<lb/>dry Company as a vanboy at 5s. a week. On July 20, 1910, I fell from the loft, broke my collar bone, and was taken to the hospital. Shortly afterwards Rose called at my home, gave me a card, and said he was Meredith Day, and that he had come about the money which I was to receive from the laundry for the accident. He had seen my uncle. We went to see Mr. Rathbone, the manager at the laun<lb/>dry, who paid Rose 30s. Rose afterwards paid my mother 25s. Rose said he would get £2 further compensation. I have called several times for it. I saw Day, he said he was going down to get it. When I went for it he said he was waiting to see whether my mother wanted it. I told him she did. I afterwards went to 11, Stroud Green Road, about six times and saw both the defendants. Rose showed me receipt (produced) which he said was to be signed. I have never signed any receipt and have no further money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The 30s. was for the first six weeks' wages. My mother did not think £2 was sufficient. She never refused to take the £2.</p>

After inquiries I called at Day's office in Hornsey Road, was directed to 11, Stroud Green Road, and saw Rose. He said, "I am very glad you have called over this small matter—I have had a lot of trouble with it. I have been down to see your policyholder, and the manager was rather rude." I agreed to pay £2 compensation and 10s. 6d. solicitor's costs. The next day I forwarded cheque (produced) for £2 10s. 6d. to Day at 11, Stroud Green Road. The cheque has been honoured, and is endorsed "F. M. Day—Joseph Rose." I believed Rose was a solicitor and named Meredith Day or I should not have paid solicitor's costs.</p>

I said, "I cannot be the means of a man shutting himself up, but you can go into Court and inform the magistrate." He went into Court and sat there for some time, but before Betts was brought</p>

               <p>in the left. Mr. Meredith Day's managing clerk was called for, and Betts was put back. At about 2 p.m the same day Rose asked to see the prisoner Betts. I handed him form produced, which he filled in and signed "F. Meredith Day, certificated solicitor," and he went with a counsel and saw Betts.</p>

                  </hi>, 347, Seven Sisters Road, shop assistant. On October 25, 1910, I with my father and my two brothers were arrested for conspiracy, brought up at North London Police Court, and re<lb/>manded—I was on bail but my father remained in custody. On November 3 Rose called at our shop, saw my mother andmyself, and said, "I have come down from Mr. Cressey" (my father) "from Brixton Prison," and showed me paper signed by my father retaining Day as solicitor. He produced a card and said, "I am F. Meredith Day, a solicitor." We discussed the case; he agreed to appear for us and said, "My fee is £2 2s.," which I paid him and he gave me receipt produced signed "F. Meredith Day." The following day I attended at the Police Court, a barrister appeared on our behalf and Rose was present. We were again remanded. On November 10 Rose again called at our shop, asked for a further fee, and was paid £2 2s. and 2s. 6d. for bail fee. We again attended at the Court on Novem<lb/>ber 10 and were remanded to the 17th. On that day Ferdinando, whom I had not seen before, called and said, "I have called on behalf of Mr. Meredith Day and I want £2 2s." He produced receipt and Day's card. He said that Mr. Day was away on another case at Peter<lb/>borough. I refused to pay him and saw him again in Court. He asked me again for the £2 2s. We were represented by counsel instructed by Ferdinando; we were again remanded and I then paid Ferdinando £1 18s., for which he gave me receipt produced, signed "F. Meredith Day." That evening Ferdinando called and I paid him 4s., the balance of the fee. Before our next appearance at Court Ferdinando called at our shop with another solicitor named Edgar Searle; he said there had been trouble up at the office and so he had brought Mr. Searle instead of Day, as he did not want to see us left without anybody. I paid Mr. Searle 25s. We were committed for trial at Newington Sessions. No one appeared to defend us. I was convicted and bound over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On the three occasions when I paid the two guineas counsel appeared for me at the Police Court.</p>

                  </hi>, 63, Claverton Street, Pimlico. I have been a solicitor for 23 years and am now practising at 86, Brixton Road. From 1894 to 1907 I did not take out my certificate, the annual payment for which is £9. In April, 1910, I was introduced to the two prisoners in an Ærated Bread shop in Holborn. Ferdinando was manager of the Legal Aid Society. He retained me as solicitor at a salary of £1 a week. In May, 1910, I took an office at 296, Hornsey Road, which was furnished by Ferdinando. I engaged him as manag<lb/>ing clerk at a salary of £3 a week. About June Rose entered my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070025"/>
               <p>employment as assistant clerk at a salary of £2 a week. I had a brass plate put upon the dor of 296, Hornsey Road (produced), with my name, "F. Meredith Day, Solicitor, Commissioner for Oaths." In July I terminated by letter Ferdinando's services to me—I continued as solicitor to the Legal Aid Society. I addressed my letter to Ferdi<lb/>nando at 312 or 314, Hornsey Road, and posted it myself. I produce copy of the letter. I had no answer, but in the course of the week he told me he had received it. Rose then became my managing clerk until September 16, when I gave up my offices at 296, Hornsey Road, by giving a week's notice to the landlord. I told Rose I was shutting up my offices and I should not requite him any more—that was about a fortnight before September 16. I removed the few papers that were there; there was no business pending as far as I knew; Rose told me that the cases had been finished. During August I called at 296, Hornsey Road, once or twice a week and saw anybody who was sent by the Legal Aid Society. I told Ferdinando I was not going to have anything more to do with the society—I cannot give a date for this, but it was after I had written dismissing Ferdinando. I told the landlord at 296 to take my plate down and keep it in his shop until I called for it. The rent, which was 14s. a week, was paid out of the business. I only kept a letter book there. I know nothing of the taking of 11, Stroud Green Road; the agreement is not signed by me, it is signed in my name by Rose, and attested by Ferdinando. I gave no one authority to put my plate up or my name up on the windows at 11, Stroud Green Road. On October 25 I heard something and went to 11, Stroud Green Road. The office boy said, "Mr. Day is out." I said, "I rather fancy Mr. Day is here." I went into the officeand wrote letter, of which I produce copy, "63, Claverton Street, October 25, '10. Sir,—May I inquire who authorised you to open this office in my name, receive money in my name, and generally act as if you were me? I presume you are aware that there is a penalty for acting without being qualified. I shall be at home to<lb/>morrow at 10.30 if you have any explanation to give.—Yours truly, F. Meredith Day. To Mr. William Rose." The next morning I got letter from Rose produced, "I regret that not having received your letter in sufficient time, I was unable to keep the appointment you made. I shall be pleased to see you and will be at the 'Rainbow,' Fleet Street, to<lb/>morrow morning at 11." It is written on notepaper headed with my name—I gave no authority for it. I did not go to the "Rainbow," and the next day complained to the Incorporated Law Society. I had no knowledge of Barber's claim and received no money in connection with the case. I had no knowledge of any claim by Brown for any damages from the Builders' Accident Insur<lb/>ance Company and never received £3 3s. costs. The cheques produced are endorsed by Rose in my name without my authority. I had no knowledge that he had a banking account in the name of Joseph Rose. I knew nothing of Cressey and gave no authority to the prisoners to engage counsel or to act in my name. Letters relating to those cases were written without my knowledge or authority. I authorised Ferdinando to take the office at 296, Hornsey Road, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070026"/>
               <p>became the tenant under the arrangement made by him with the landlord.</p>
               <p>(Friday, January 10.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. O'Connor. When the 296, Hornsey Road office was opened I had no clients in that district, but anticipated business introduced by Ferdinando. There is nothing illegal in a solicitor opening an office and appointing a clerk to transact the busi<lb/>ness on the solicitor's behalf provided he acts under the solicitor's supervision. I did not leave the conduct of business to Ferdinando—I called at the office two or three times a week, had a report of what took place, and approved of it generally. I looked at the letter book. I did not see letter of June 24 referring to Barber's matter or the letter referring to Brown's claim in the letter book. I looked at the letter book in June and July. I only authorised Rose and Ferdinando to sign my name "per pro."; all the letters in the book are signed "F. Meredith Day" by Rose or Ferdinando. I repeatedly com<lb/>plained to them and told them they ought to sign "per pro." I gave up the office because there was not sufficient business. I said at the Police Court that I had authorised Ferdinando to sign the agreement taking 296, Hornsey Road. The 14s. a week was paid out of the business for about four months. I may be mistaken—the rent of 296, Hornsey Road, may have been 8s. 6d. a week. I know nothing about the taking of the offices at 11, Stroud Green Road, and when I spoke of the rent being 14s. I did not know that that was the rent of 11, Stroud Green Road. I had a letter from Davis, the landlord of 296, Hornsey Road, in reply to my notice, I think from 296, Kentish Town Road. I cannot produce it. I wrote to him from 86, Brixton Hill. I keep a letter book; it contains no copy of the notice. The Legal Aid Society's office was at 312, Hornsey Road—Ferdinando lived there. I never said I lived at 314, Hornsey Road. I have never lived in the north of London. I paid £2 10s. for the brass plate; it was paid for out of the business. Receipt (produced) for 15s. is apparently the sum paid by Ferdinando for putting the plate up. I gave up practising as a solicitor because I became managing clerk for four years to Kingsbury and Turner, of Brixton Hill—1896 to 1900. I was afterwards managing clerk to Bird and Eldridge for about three and a half years, and for a year to Mr. Morrell, solicitor, Great Western Road. I then took my certificate out in the summer of 1907. I was not in the Law List of 1908. I had my certificate up to Decem<lb/>ber, 1909—I took it out in April, 1910. I was not entitled to practice between January 1 and April 26, 1910, when I succeeded in borrowing some money to take out my certificate. The agreement with Ferdinando was to pay me £1 a week as solicitor to the Legal Aid Society. It was not £52 a year. I have not the retainer which Ferdinando gave me—I had borrowed some money temporarily from Ferdinando and gave him the retainer as security. I did not give him an I.O.U. because I preferred to do it in that way. A copy of the retainer, dated April 11, 1910, stating, "Referring to our interview, I hereby retain you to act as my solicitor, and in consideration of your advising me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070027"/>
               <p>on all legal matters I agree to pay you the retainer of £52 a year, the same to be paid weekly, and this retainer not to be determined under three months' notice in writing.—Yours truly, F. E. Ferdi<lb/>nando," was put to me at the Police Court. I said it was apparently a copy of the retainer. In July Ferdinando had a judgment debt on which the sheriff recovered £11 11s., which was paid to me on August 12, as Ferdinando's solicitor, while he was away on his holi<lb/>days. I have not accounted to him for it—it was due to me as costs. Ferdinando was paid his £3 a week out of the profits of the business. If there had been no profit I should have had money to pay him. In May or June I had a judgment against me and a committal order. I have not paid it yet. I have never seen Darter or Brien. I did not see them at 11, Stroud Green Road; I have never been there except on the day I left the letter to Rose there. I was responsible for the office and business up to September 16. Rose then verbally reported to me that there was nothing pending.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. McDonald. Ferdinando always had his £3 a week out of the business. I received the balance after expenses had been paid—it was very little—about on the average 10s. a week. wrote a letter on July 18 terminating Ferdinando's services. I have no copy of it.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK PAGE</hi>, Y Division. I received certain instructions and kept observation on 11, Stroud Green Road, from October 23 until November 19. I never saw Day there. The name F. Meredith Day was up on the plate and across the two windows. On November 19 I had a warrant for the arrest of Rose, and saw him and Ferdinando in Stroud Green Road. Inspector Neale was with me and we all went to the office at No. 11. Ferdinando was sitting near the window close to a table on which were a number of papers. I saw him take certain papers from the table and put them in his overcoat pocket. I said, "Give me those papers, you must not touch anything." He said, "What papers?" I said, "Those papers you have just put in your pocket." He said, "I have not any." I then took the papers (produced) from his pocket; there are two re<lb/>ceipts in reference to the Barber case. I said, "I shall have to make some inquiry about this." He denied that I had taken them from his pocket. I found a number of letters (produced) in relation to the cases of Barber and others.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES GOODCHILD</hi>, Y Division. On November 25 at 6.30 p.m. I saw Ferdinando at 314, Hornsey Road, and arrested him on a warrant charging him with conspiring with William Rose, in custody, in obtaining 10s. 6d. by false pretences. He said, "I wrote the letters at the instigation of Rose. I have conducted his correspondence for him. I have never touched any money. I did not know there had been a settlement in the Barber case." At the police station I read the warrant to him. He said, "I know abso<lb/>lutely nothing about it." When the charge was read over he said, "I deny most positively that I have ever seen the money of any letters in connection with the settlement." On November 19 I was with Page when he arrested Rose. I saw Ferdinando take some papers</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070028"/>
               <p>from a basket on the table and put them in his pocket; Page took them away from him. They are three documents (produced).</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been 20 years a solici<lb/>tor's clerk. In March, 1910, I was introduced to Day by a friend of his, named Oliver. In March, 1910, Ferdinando was running a Legal Aid Society for which a solicitor named Riches was acting, with whom Ferdinando was not satisfied; he asked me to introduce another solicitor, and I introduced Day to Ferdinando. Day said he had not money enough to take out his certificate. Ferdinando and I went to Somerset House, and he paid £9 for Day's certificate. Day then asked Ferdinando for another sovereign, saying it would be necessary to pay a registration fee to the Law Society. Ferdinando gave him the sovereign. I went to the Law Society and found Day had not paid the fee, and that there was no such fee payable. I afterwards found Day in Short's wine shop; he had not paid the sovereign; he wanted me to take 5s. out of it. Later on in March Day came to 312, Hornsey Road, and arranged to take Ferdinando as managing clerk. At his request I drew up a letter which Day signed, appointed Ferdinando as managing clerk with full authority to sign his name. It was arranged that Ferdinando should open a banking account in Day's name. Day said he had not a banking account because he was afraid it might be garnisheed for various judg<lb/>ment debts against him. I drafted a retainer, of which copy has been put in and Ferdinando signed it. I was appointed as assistant clerk at £2 a week. I never got my £2 a week. Day came every Friday and received his £1 a week from Ferdinando. This went on until August 10, when Ferdinando went away for his holidays—on August 11 or 12 Day received a cheque from Newton, the sheriff's officer, for £11 11s. He told me he meant keeping it. It was in pay<lb/>ment of a debt which Ferdinando had purchased. No law costs were due to Day. He came to 296, Hornsey Road and told me he had paid two or three week's rent at 8s. 6d. a week, he gave me 10s. and told me he had left 5s. at a coffee house for my benefit and a further 5s. at the "Plough Hotel" for me in case I was thirsty and wanted a drink. Up to August 25 Day was almost daily at the office. After that date, when Ferdinando returned from his holidays, Day never came to the office in the day time; he used to telephone appointments for me to meet him at various public-houses. About September 1 he suggested we should take better offices, and asked me to go and see No. 11, Stroud Green Road. I told Day they were suitable, and he said, "You had better take them on an agreement for three years." On September 3, with Ferdinando I called on de Meza, told him I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070029"/>
               <p>was Day's clerk, handed him Day's card, and said that I wished to take the offices on Day's behalf on a three years' agreement. He promised to send me the agreement by post, which he did—I showed it to Day. He said, "You may as well sign it because if the business does not pay I can get out of it much better." I signed it in de Meza's presence as Day. De Meza knew quite well that I was Rose. A few days aferwards Ferdinando removed the furniture to 11, Stroud Green Road. De Meza never had a reference from me—I showed him the rent book. Day came to 11, Stroud Green Road twice a week, generally in the evening; he had a latch-key. He was afraid to go in the day time for fear of encountering Ferdinando. In August Day gave me a letter appointing me as managing clerk—it is amongst the papers seized by the police. I had written to the Assistant Commmissioner of Police asking for my papers, but have not been able to get them. At Day's suggestion I opened a banking account in the name of Joseph Rose—it was simply for the purpose of passing crossed cheques through. Day had accounts rendered to him showing all monies received. Day knew of the £3 3s. paid for costs on Sep<lb/>tember 20 in Brown's matter, also the £2 10s. 6d. paid for Barber. I endorsed the cheques with his authority, paid them into Farrow's Bank; £2 7s. was drawn to pay Mr. Kent, a counsel.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath) recalled. Further examined. On September 6 there were several actions pending with regard to which letters signed by Ferdinando and myself appear in the letter book, which was regularly seen by Day. I never received the letter said to have been left at Stroud Green Road by Day on October 26. On that day I received a letter asking me to meet Day at the "Mitre Tavern," Chancery Lane, and bring him £2, and I wrote letter (pro<lb/>duced) apologising for not keeping the appointment, and stating I would be at the "Rainbow" at 12 the next day. I went there, but did not see him. I' subsequently met Day at the "Three Nuns," Aldgate, by accident. He said he was terribly pressed for money and I must get him £5. I said it was impossible, and then he said he would come down and shut the show up. He said, "I shall also expect you to be prepared to pay the £9 for my certificate in Novem<lb/>ber." On November 29 I heard from the office boy that Day had been to the office and found he had taken away the press copy letter book and another book containing entries of moneys received and paid. With regard to the Cressey matter, I saw the elder Cressey at Brixton Prison and he gave me retainer to act for him, and said he would like me to defend his three sons who were charged with him. I told him he must have counsel and it would cost three guineas. He said he could not pay three guineas, but he could pay two guineas, and directed me to go to his wife, which I did, and she paid me the two guineas; I briefed Mr. Weller Kent, paying him £2 4s. 6d., and he appeared for the Cressey family. They were remanded on three occasions, and I received three sums of two guineas from the wife,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070030"/>
               <p>paying in each case £2 4s. 6d. to counsel and losing 10s. At the trial they pleaded guilty and were not defended by counsel. Brown's and Barber's cases as well as 10 or 12 other matters were pending when we moved to 11, Stroud Green Road. Day was aware of them and received the monies which were paid as costs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. De Meza knew I was Rose—his evidence is false. The agreement was not signed in his presence. I did not see Ferdi<lb/>nando put papers into his pocket—I was in the next room. I acknow<lb/>ledged receipt of the sum of £2 10s. 6d. by a postcard, which was not copied in the letter book. The receipt for £3 3s. is signed by me as "F. Meredith Day," and is not copied into the letter book. I offered Mrs. Barber the £2 and she refuesd to take it—she said she wanted £40. She could have had the £2 at any time. Sergeant Baker is very vindictively disposed to me. He knew I was Day's clerk and admitted me to see the prisoner Betts. When I was arrested and put in the cell he said, "I have got you here at last, and I am going to make it as hot as I possibly can for you." I had had a quarrel with Jiim six months before, and had threatened to report him. After I had written the form Baker took it to the clerk, brought it back, and said, "Is he a certificated solicitor?" I said, "Yes"; then he said, "Write it down," which I did. I then saw the prisoner Betts with Mr. Broxholme, counsel. Cressey was not present when I received the £2 2s. from his mother—his evidence is absolute invention. I never said Day was at Peterborough.</p>

I found that Mr. Broxholme could go and he and I met Rose at the Police Court. Rose asked Mr. Broxholme if he would see the prisoner. The jailor handed Rose a form to sign, which he did. The jailor then took it to the clerks' office, returned, and said, "Is he a certified solicitor?" Rose said "Yes," and wrote something on the form.

I saw Day about it on four occasions at 11, Stroud Green Road, during October. I went to Day in consequence of seeing the advertisement of the North London Legal Aid Society.</p>

               <p>Mr. Robert Simpson prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY GARRARD</hi>, G Division. At 9.30 p.m. on January 6 I was keeping observation on 20, Sidney Street, E.C. I saw Whit<lb/>tingbam go in and come out again with a letter in his hand. He went over to Butters and said, "All right, I have got it: here it is." Butters was opening it when he saw me, and said, "Look out. We are foxed." Whittingham put the letter in his pocket and walked away towards City Road. Butters walked in the opposite direction towards Goswell Road. I stopped Butters and told him observation had been kept on him and that I should take him into custody and charge him with being concerned with Cox in the unlawful possession of a letter. He replied, "All right." I took him to Shepherdess Walk Police Station. There was another man with Butters and I asked him to accompany me to the police station. Whittingham turned round and said, "Neither of these men knows anything about it." The letter was from Mr. Pugh and said, "One pound enclosed; acknowledge and repay promptly.—W. Pugh, January, 1911." He had also in his possession a false reference from a man called Henry Farwell, addressed to Mr. Maynard, 20, Sidney Street. Whittingham said, "The memorandum is a fraud and I am not going to give you any assistance." They also had a postal order for £1. There was also enclosed a letter, signed by Maynard, addressed to Mr. Pugh, saying his tools were in pledge and asking for the money to get them out, as he had got some work. Maynard has three young children and he is a single man. I made inquiries at President Street, St. Lukes, and found there a quantity of memorandum forms. Whit<lb/>tingham admitted writing to the Bishop of London and said that he should plead guilty to that charge. He said Butters had nothing to do with it. Whittingham had communicated with the Bishop of London in the name of Morton and had received a cheque for £1 to pay his fare to Bolton, where, he said, he had work. I produce a book con<lb/>taining 29 addresses where letters were received for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Whittingham. I admit that you gave me Mr. Pugh's address. I found a postal order when you were searched, value of 2s. 6d. The letter which you received at Sidney Street had not left your hand when you were arrested.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Butters. I was near enough to you to hear you say, "We are foxed."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK BIGGS</hi> gave evidence as to keeping observation on 20, Sidney Street, and arresting Whittingham.</p>
               <p>To Whittingham. When I arrested you I said, "Where is the letter you had from the shop?" You had opened it at the time I arrested you.</p>

I wrote in reply, sending £1 to to a Mr. Mortan 28, Rodwell Terrace, to pay his fare to Bolton, thinking it was a genuine case of distress.</p>
               <p>To Whittingham. I do not remember what was in the letter except that Morton said he had known the Bishop in the East End.</p>

                  </hi>. On December 7 I acted as personation agent at the West Ward polling station, Rutland Street; I had acted in a similar capacity at the previous general election. About 4 in the afternoon prisoner came into the polling station; I knew him by sight, but did not know his name. He asked the polling clerk for a ballot paper in the name of Edward James Massett, number 15 on the register; he was given a paper, which he filled up and put in the box in the usual way, and then went out. About an hour after he came back again; he went to the table and gave a name and number to the Conservative agent; I did not hear what it was. I said to prisoner, "You have voted before"; he said, "I have never voted; if you don't believe it I will go and fetch my polling card." He went out and I</p>

               <p>followed him; I spoke to the constable on duty outside and he stopped prisoner as he was crossing the road. At that time Mr. Groves, the Liberal agent, came along. He looked at prisoner and said, "Oh, it's you, Hodder, is it?" On the second occasion prisoner did not vote or ask for a ballot paper.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. In the sworn information upon which the summons in this case was granted I said you gave a name and number to the Conservative agent; I did not say you applied for a ballot paper on the second occasion. I have not seen you since January, 1910. I saw you then at the same polling station. I did not see you in June.</p>

                  </hi>, 77, Dempster Street, Stepney. I am an honorary Liberal agent. I remember the election on December 7. I was at Rutland Street between five and six. I saw Oliver coming from the polling station. I spoke to him and he pointed to prisoner, who was in front of him, and said that prisoner had tried to vote twice. I went up to prisoner and tapped him on the shoulder and said, "Hodder, my boy, I have caught you this time"; he said, "What do you mean? I have not voted." A police officer on duty at the polling station came up and I said to the witness Oliver, "Tell me all about this." Oliver told me that prisoner had been to the polling station an hour before and voted in the name of Edward James Massett and he had just come in and tried to vote again. Prisoner repeated that he had not voted. I said to the policeman, "I shall have to have this man arrested; do not let him go away; I will go in and fetch the presiding officer." I went in and spoke to the presiding officer; on our coming out, prisoner had left.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I have taken a prominent part in local political work and know you as doing the same. I am certain that I told the con<lb/>stable not to let you go.</p>

                  </hi>. On December 7 I was polling clerk at the Rutland Street polling station. Prisoner came there about three o'clock; I asked him his name and address; he gave me the name of Massett, No. 15. I gave him a paper; he voted and put it in the ballot box and went out. He came in again at half-past six; he went to the other end of the table where the Conservative agent was. I did not hear what was said. Oliver jumped up and said, "You have voted, and if you do not go out I will have you locked up"; prisoner said he had not voted. This second time he came in limping, as if he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>To the prisoner. Up to five o'clock about 400 people had voted. I recognised you because Oliver pointed you out to me. I am sure you are the man who came in on the two occasions.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Conservative agent for the Stepney division at the last election. On December 7 I was at the Conservative committee rooms in Rutland Street, almost opposite the polling station. We kept in the rooms a wall sheet showing the names of voters in the ward, and as the polling proceeded we ticked off on this sheet those reported to us as having voted. I saw prisoner in the rooms about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I remember, in connection with the County Council election last year your telling me that you had seen Woolf Oliver and that he was going to turn Conservative. I believe you frequently called upon him in June and July.</p>

He left and I went away. I left home at 2.40 to see my wife in Bartholomew Hospital: I stayed at the hospital some time and got to Rutland Street at 20 to five.

                  </hi>, 34, Walker Street, Limehouse. Prisoner and I are labourers in a white-lead factory. On Monday, January 9, I left home about a quater to a.m. and had got 20 yard from my door when I saw prisoner waiting for me. He said, "Give me a dollar"; I told him I had not one to spare for myself, let alone him; he then said, "Give me 2s." I said I had not got it to give him. He said, "Well, something is going to happen, you are going through it"; he rushed at me and knocked me on my back in the road. As I fell he kicked me in the face. I caught hold of his ankle, but had to let it go. I was not exactly unconscious, but half dazed; I shouted for help and he ran away. I went home and bathed my face and then reported the matter to the police and went to the hospital. I had previously lent prisoner small sums in friendship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. It is not true that on the previous Friday I had promised to give you 5s. on this Monday. About 14 months ago you wanted me to fight you and I refused and you gave me a black eye. I did not say to you on this Monday that I was going to give you two black eyes for the one you had given me. You did not say, "Will you give me that 5s.?" Your words were, "Give me a dollar"; it was demanding, not begging—as if you meant to get it by fair means or foul. I was, in fact, put in fear of you.</p>

                  </hi>, Divisional Surgeon. I saw prosecutor about 10 a.m. on February 9. He had a very nasty wound below the right eye, down to the bone, caused, I should think, by the blow of a boot; it could not have been caused by the fist; there were other marks of violence on the face.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN HAYMAN</hi>, K Division. I saw prisoner outside his lodgings in Blackthorn Street, Bow, at 12.15 a.m. on January 11. I told him I should take him into custody for demanding 5s. from Parkins at Walker Street, Limehouse, on January 9, and causing him grievous bodily harm by kicking him in the face. Prisoner replied, "I am glad I am caught; it is for the best; but I deny kicking him." He made no reply to the formal charge.</p>

On the Monday I saw him and said, "Will you give that dollar now, Harry, as I could do with it?" He refused and said, "Remember the black eye you gave me 14 months ago;</p>

I point out that this was before six o'clock, and prosecutor did not see the doctor till 10; a great deal might have happened to him in that four hours.</p>

                  </hi>, newsvendor, Church Street, Stoke Newing<lb/>ton. About midday on October 29 prisoner, whom I knew as a frequenter of Hackney, asked me if I would treat him, as I was about to board a tramcar in Dalston Lane. We had two or three drinks at the "Crown and Castle" and other public-houses. I went up Sylvester Road into a public convenience, and he followed me in. He struck me a violent blow on the mouth, pinned me against the partition with one hand, and with the other took £4 11s. out of my trousers pocket, which was the whole of the money I had with the exception of 6d. The blow dazed me for the time being. I went out into Mare Street and complained to a constable; this was about two minutes after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070040"/>
               <p>the blow. Prisoner ran up Sylvester Road, took the first turning on the right at the side of the mansions there. I next saw him when I charged him at the police station on January 14. Between Octo<lb/>ber 29 and that day I did not see him in the neighbourhood of Hack<lb/>ney at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You did not say when you met me, "What? Are you on the 'booze' again?" I did not meet you by arrangement at the "Crown and Castle." I had about £4 13s. on me when I met you first. I do not remember the name of the house we went into after the "Crown and Castle," but it was in Queen's Road; we were not refused drink there. I did not hold your arm after leaving; if I said so at the police court it was so. I deny falling unconscious in a urinal in Queen's Road. It is true I sug<lb/>gested having another drink at the "Queen Elizabeth," but I deny betting you that we would not get served. I have known you about two years and you have gone and fetched papers for me sometimes but you have never sold papers for me. The blow caused my teeth to cut through my lip, and there is still a very slight scar.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. My mouth was bleeding after the blow. Before this I had treated prisoner, but it was more through fear.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WALTER YAKES</hi>, 60 JR. On the afternoon of October 29 I was on duty at Mare Street, Hackney, when the prose<lb/>cutor came up to me. His face was covered with blood and his mouth was bleeding from a cut. He had been drinking but was per<lb/>fectly rational. We went in search of prisoner, and we then went together to the station; I did not have to take hold of him at all. I knew prisoner as being about Hackney almost daily. After that day I did not see him until January 14. (To the Court.) I had seen them together about 10 minutes before this; they turned into Sylves<lb/>ter Road, about 25 yards from the urinal in which prosecutor said he had been struck.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I did not walk the prosecutor about until he was sober before I took him to the station.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM FAUKS</hi>, J Division. About 6.40 on January 13 in consequence of a complaint I had received I went to 3b, Ballspond Road, where I found prisoner. I told him I should take him into custody for robbery and assault at Hackney, and he said, "Haven't you made a b—mistake? "I said, "Nol" He said, "When was this?" I said, "I cannot give you the date—I will tell you at the station. The man whom it is alleged you assaulted and robbed sells papers at the corner of Morning Lane and Mare Street." He said, "I have not been down to Hackney for over two months." I took him to Dalston Police Station, where he was charged with assaulting and robbing Walter Wells. I said, "Oh! It is him is it?" When the charge was read over to him he said, "I am innocent of it."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I met prosecutor on the night before this and we went to a public-house, but he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070041"/>
               <p>so drunk that they would not serve us. I arranged to meet him on the following morning, which I did. We went into the "Crown and Castle," and were served with beer, but when the barman saw his condition it was taken away. We went from there to "The Grange," where we were again refused drink on account of his condition. We then went to the "Queen Elizabeth." I am leaving out about his holding my arm and falling down in the urinal. I left him in the urinal, went into Sylvester Road and into Graham Road, where I caught the tram to Dalston Lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prosecutor was drunk when I met him but not incap<lb/>ably drunk. He held my arm from the "Grange" to the "Queen Elizabeth." I cannot say whether he fell or was tripped up in the urinal, but when I picked him up he was practically insensible, pro<lb/>bably through the drink and the fall; this was between going to "The Grange" and the "Queen Elizabeth." I could have robbed him easily then if I had wanted to. The fall sobered him somewhat. I did not rob him in the second urinal. I had not been in Hackney for three weeks before this occurred.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant to Richard Williams, dairyman, Euston Street. About 6 p.m. on January 12 prisoner came in and asked for some butter and a penny packet of tea. He tendered a shilling, which I told him was bad. He said he did not think so, and that he had got it in the "Orange Tree" in change for a sove<lb/>reign. I marked it on both sides and gave it him back. I asked him if he was a customer at the "Orange Tree," and he said he was there every day. He took out some money from his pocket, from which he gave me a good sixpence. I noticed that some of the silver was a bit dull—the same colour as the shilling he had given me. He left saying that he was going back to the "Orange Tree" with it. After about 10 minutes he came back and said that they would not change it there. I said that that was very funny, and asked him whether he had any more on him. He said he did not think so. I then called Mr. Williams into the shop and he asked prisoner whether he had any more bad money, and he brought from his pocket a lot of money and put it on the counter. We found six bad shillings, in<lb/>cluding the one I had marked. He asked Mr. Williams to wrap them in paper for him, which he did. He then said he was going to take them back to the "Orange Tree," and he left the shop. Mr. Williams followed him.</p>

                  </hi>. About 6 p.m. on January 12 I was called into the shop by Miss Edwards, when I saw prisoner place a bad shilling on the counter. She marked it. He paid a good sixpence. He went out and after 10 minutes he returned. He said that he had changed half a sovereign at the "Orange Tree" and had received some bad money. He brought out a lot of money and put it on the counter, and I found it contained five bad shillings. I asked him if he had any more, and he went through his pockets and brought out everything which he had. I heard some money jingle in his overcoat pocket and I said, "I believe you have some more there." He brought out 2s. in bronze and one bad shilling. He had about 13s. in good and bad money. He asked me if I would go to the" Orange Tree" with him. On his first visit he said that he had received it in change for a sovereign, but on the second he said half a sovereign. I said it was no use my going with him, as they did not know me and I did not know him, and told him the best thing he could do was to go into the "Orange Tree" with the policeman who was on point duty there, or he might get himself into trouble. He went out saying that he would do so. I followed him and went to the corner by the "Orange Tree," where I saw a constable. I spoke to him and pointed to him prisoner, who was on the same side of the road as the "Orange Tree," coming in that direction. When he reached the corner he stopped and looked round. Then he came across the road towards the con<lb/>stable, who went up and spoke to him. We had been standing on the opposite side of the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He made straight for the side of the road where the policeman was.</p>

I did not see him at all on January 12. No customer complained that day of having received bad money. I generally make up my till about 4.30 p.m. and I did so on this day. I locked it up and retained the keys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There are six men assistants. They are not here to-day.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES THRUSSEL</hi>, 610 S. Between 6 and 7 p.m. on January 12 I was on duty in Euston Road when Williams came and spoke to me. Prisoner was standing on the opposite side of the road and came towards our side of the road. I stopped him and asked him if he had any counterfeit coins in his possession. He said, "Yes, I have some here." I said, "Let me have them," and he produced six bad shillings. I asked him where he had got them from and he said, "From the 'Orange Tree' public-house in change for a half sovereign." He made no attempt to go in there. On searching him I found five sixpences, two shillings, and 2s. 6 1/2 d. in bronze, good</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070043"/>
               <p>money. I took him to the station. When charged he said, "I know nothing about it."He was the worse for drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The only thing that Williams told me was that prisoner had been to his shop with bad money, and he pointed prisoner out as being the man, who was the worse for drink. I could see 50 yards away that that was so.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE WALLACE</hi>, S Division: I saw prisoner in the station at 7.30 p.m. on January 12 and asked him where he lived. He said, "I occupy two rooms on the ground floor at 12, Little Drum<lb/>mond Street." I went there with Hexamer and found he occupied the back room only. Prisoner's wife was there and I told her what I had come for. In a wooden chest I found this box, containing three moulds, one for making florins and two for making shillings, three coin holders, one pair of pliers, a polishing pad, four strips of solder, some copper wire, a file, a coin carrier, two bottles containing fluid, and a piece of cardboard with some marks of burns on it. I returned to the station and showed prisoner what I had found. He said, "They do not belong to me. I do not know anything at all about them." When charged with uttering counterfeit coin and possessing moulds, he said, "I do not know anything at all about it." When searching him he said, "I have got nothing, but the stuff in these bottles would kill all of you." He was under the influence of drink.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said nothing at all about Green when I arrested and searched him. I think prisoner's wife asked me at the police court one day whether a man named Pearce was there and I said "No." I might have said that I could not make him attend here. It is true I could do so if necessary. He told me later that Pearce refused to come and give evidence, but that did not seem to me suspicious.</p>
               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HEXAMER</hi>, X Division. On the evening of January 12 I went with Wallace to 12, Little Drummond Street. In the back room I found loose in the chest two counterfeit shillings dated 1910. In the cupboard on the right hand side of the fireplace I found this packet of plaster of paris, this spoon and this saucer with plaster of paris in it. On the top were these two bottles of liquid. In the cupboard on the left-hand side of the fireplace, on a bracket in the recess, were this small tin and a box containing anti<lb/>mony. There was this box containing sal ammoniac amongst other things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner's wife was present when I examined the room. She, her husband, and two children occupied this one room. She said at first that the bigger box contained her trinkets, but it did not; they were in the smaller box which was in the cupboard on the left-hand side of the fireplace, and which contained the sal<lb/>ammoniac.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I always went in there once a week to take the linen, and I went two or three times a week besides. They used to keep the door open often to let the children play in the hall. I have never gone there and found the door locked. Prisoner's sister's husband and his sister used to visit them.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a dealer in second-hand furniture and interpreter. I was born in England, but am of French descent. I have acted as interpreter in Belgium and in the West End. About a week before Christmas, George Pearce (I think his right name is Stamper), who had been introduced to me at Holloway two years ago by my landlady when I was living there, introduced me to George Green. I had only seen Pearce twice during the two years. Two or three days after this Green came to me with a parcel in brown paper and asked me to mind it for him. He said, amongst other things, it contained two bottles, which he told me to take out because the stuff was sure to run out, and that I was to be careful not to let the children get at them as they contained poison. I pulled the bottles out and left the parcel just as it was inside the box, standing the bottles in another corner. He said he was in a bit of trouble. I had no suspicion whatever as to what the parcel contained because he told me that he was a silversmith, and from what I could see of the contents they seemed to be tools. Just after Christmas he came to see me, but I was out. The following day he called again, and we had a drink at the "Royal George."I asked him if he had come for his parcel. He said, "No, you mind it for me. Some detectives have been up to my house and searched it, but I managed to get away over a wall." I said, "Is that the trouble you mean?" He said, "I don't know whether it is for one thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070045"/>
               <p>or for another, but I can easily do them. I will go to work again." I did not know what he meant. I told him that the parcel would not be in my way. After that I met him in the street and he said that he wanted to try and open a little shop, and that he would come for his parcel then. He called on me once or twice, and I asked him if he had come for his parcel, and he said that he must wait till he had got his little shop before he took it away because he did not want to take it home. About 12 a.m. on January 12 I went to this chest to get a collar out when I saw a lot of white powder over the things. My wife did not know what it was, and I concluded that it had come out of the parcel. I put the powder in the cupboard on the right-hand side of the fireplace. Taking it out I saw a sealed enve<lb/>lope which I lifted up, and then I saw some shillings between the envelope and the tin box. I looked at them, and I thought to myself that it was funny. I left two of them which were bent up in the box, and decided to take the other six and see if I could find Green to ask him what it meant. I went round to the "Angel," but I could not find him. From there I went to St. John's Wood to see a Mr. Verchel, who had asked me to get some second-hand furniture to furnish a room for him. We had some drinks together and I came over giddy, I had too much. I remember going in to buy the butter and tea. I said to Edwards that I had got a bad shilling in change at the "Orange Tree," but I did not know what I was saying. I must have put this bad money 'along with the good money, although when I first went out I took care to put it into a separate pocket. I asked Williams to wrap them up for me in paper and also to come with me to the "Orange Tree," but this he could not do. When I left the shop the first time I went back there and had another drink; a thin tall man with a waxed moustache served me. I then returned to the shop to apologise. I heard that when Green heard I was locked up he left his address, 13, Sherringham Road, Barnsbury. Our door was nearly always open and the landlady used to come in frequently. I did not make any of the bad money and I had no idea that there were counterfeit coins in the parcel until January 12. I did not pay the bad shilling for the butter with the idea of passing bad money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. About a fortnight before I met Green, Pearce told me that he, Pearce, had been in penal servitude. I only saw him about once after that; I did not want to see him any more. I called Green as a witness at the Police Court, but he denied bringing this parcel to me. When I left the house on January 12 I had about ten shillings in good money on me, but not in gold. I was drunk when I told Williams and Edwards that I had got the bad money in change and in the "Orange Tree." I did not know what I was saying.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have only seen Pearce four times in my life. (To the Court.) When I told Edwards where I had got the bad money I had, in fact, been in the "Orange Tree." I did not know for certain that these coins were bad: I was dubious about them. The trunk where I put the box was used for my wife's, my children's, and my things, and I went to it perhaps once or twice a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been married to prisoner four years and have two children, one three and the other two years old. We have occupied the back parlour at 12, Little Drummond Street since last September. I remember about Christmas time a man named George Green, whom I had never seen before, brought a box, some bottles, and a piece of cardboard, and asked my landlord to mind them; he brought the bottles from his pocket and said that I and the children were not to touch them, as they contained poison. The things were placed in the wooden chest, where we keep everything. Some three weeks afterwards my husband opened the parcel, but I do not know what he took out; I know he went to the chest for a handkerchief. He told me that Pearce introduced him to Green; before that hap<lb/>pened I have only seen Pearce about three times. I have tried to get him to come, but he said he was afraid to do so, as he might get him<lb/>self into trouble. I told Inspector Wallace that Pearce is not here. Our door during the day is always open. I stay at home to look after the children; my husband has never made any false coin; I should know if he had. This box contains borax, not sal ammoniac. It also contains buttons, an iron holder, and a shaving brush.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is true I told the police that the larger box, and not the smaller, contained trinkets of my own, but I did that because I thought, as Green had told us that he had got into trouble and asked us to mind it for him, I thought it might get us into trouble.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of February 1 I was in Pentonville Road at about 12.30. I had a bag in each hand, one containing pro<lb/>visions, the other was a hand-bag which contained my purse. It had in it £2 10s. in gold. I was going up the hill when a man stood in front of me on my right. I went towards the kerb to avoid him. He went past me to the right and I felt my bag being wrenched out of my hand. One man was at my side and the other was pulling my bag. I screamed and they disappeared. I saw my bag at the station; no money was missing; the handle was wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I said at the station that to the best of my belief you were the men.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ERNEST FRY</hi>, 102 G. At 12.45 a.m. on February 1 I heard cries of "Police" and "Stop thief." I saw prisoners running away in a dark turning. I caught Ward. He said, "All right, governor, I have not got the bag." Up to that moment I had said nothing about a bag. I did not then know what the charge was. I brought him back to prosecutrix, who said, "That is one of them." Prisoner Ward made no remark when that was said. I saw the bag for the first time at the station. It was brought there by the witness Murphy.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM SMITH</hi>, 488 G. I heard shouts at 12.45 a.m. on February 1. I was with last witness in a narrow street, and ran towards the direction of the shouts, and saw Hillier running to<lb/>wards me. I stopped him and took him back to the prosecutrix, who identified him as one of the men who snatched the bag. When he saw me running towards him he almost stopped. He said, "This time you have got the wrong bloke." He gave no explanation as to why he was running.</p>

I saw prisoners arrested, going along the street with the con<lb/>stables. As I was shutting the door to go to bed I saw a dark object on the pavement and picked it up; it was a bag. This is it. I dressed and took it to the police-station.</p>

I asked this man had he sold out; he said yes. I had been out for one bag of taters and savoys. He said, "I am going to my brothers." I said, "Come a little way with me to Swinton Street to see if I can get a bag." When I got there the door was closed. I went to Clerkenwell Road and had two</p>

Breaking into Pentonville I crossed the road into the turning when the two constables come running behind us and said, "We want you," and this lady come round the corner and said, "That is one, a big one and a little one."

                  </hi>, 1, Blackstock Road, Walthamstow. I have known Honeybun about 18 months by seeing him selling fruit in the street. On January 17 at 4 p.m. he came to my door and asked to rent the coach-house at the back of my house for some stock he had. He wanted it for a week or a fortnight. I said the coach-house and stable is up to let and if anyone took it the stock would have to be removed. He paid 3s. for a week's rent. Shortly after that a van and pair of horses loaded came up the drive to the coach-house. I did not pay attention to who came with the van, but there were two or three there. Stiles was there; I saw him from the bedroom.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ISRAEL BEDFORD</hi>, N Division. I saw Honeybun at 219, Blackhorse Road, on January 18, at 10.30 a.m. I told him I was a police officer making inquiries about a horse and van and a load of fruit stolen at Hammersmith yesterday. I said, "I have received information that you have the property in the stable at the rear of No. 1, Blackhorse Road. You will have to go there with me." He said nothing then. About five minutes later he said, "I will tell you the truth; a man came up to me yesterday outside the 'Standard' public-house, Blackhorse Road, and asked me if I would buy some dates. I got them off him and gave him £7 5s. for the lot; I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070049"/>
               <p>now his name, but I have seen him up Thames Street." We then went to the stable and there found the stolen fruit. I told prisoner he would have to go to the station. He said nothing. At the station I told him he would be detained and charged with stealing this pro<lb/>perty. He made no reply. At 8.30 on the 19th I saw Stiles at his address, Victoria Road, Edmonton. I was with another officer. I said, "We have a man in custody named Honeybun and he has made a statement implicating you as being concerned in stealing a horse and van and a load of fruit at Hammersmith. You will have to go to the station with me" He said, "Very good, sir; Honey bun has given me away, has he?" I took him to Edmonton Police Station and he there said he wished to make a statement; that statement I reduced to writing and he signed it.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS HALL</hi>, T Division. I saw Honeybun at Waltham<lb/>stow Police Station on January 19. I told him who I was and that he would be charged concerned with two others in stealing and receiv<lb/>ing 56 cases of fruit. He made no reply. On the way to the station he said, "I have made a mistake through not getting a receipt" On the same day I saw Stiles at Edmonton Police Station. I told him he would be charged with Honeybun and Hart. He said, "Honey<lb/>bun asked me to buy the stuff; he told me he had got it 'bent.'" "Bent" means otherwise than straight." I helped him in with it in the stable. The carman was there." When Hart was brought in the charge room Stiles said, "That is the man who brought the fruit to Walthamstow and helped to carry it in the stable."</p>
               <p>Mr. Cassels submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury as against Stiles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Purcell submitted with regard to Honeybun that the possession was not criminal possession, and that it had to be shown that he rented the stable for the purpose of unlawfully storing in it stolen property which he had in his possession.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul. The case had better go on.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a greengrocer carrying on business at 131, Victoria Road, Lower Edmonton. I have had dealings with Mr. Landan. I have bought £20 or £30 worth of stuff of him a week. I know Honeybun as a dealer in the market. He told me he had some fruit he could sell me, which he has told me before. This was on the Monday. Next day I met him by appoint<lb/>ment. We went to a coffee shop. He told me he would see me in five or 10 minutes' time. He went out and came back again, and then he drank up his tea. As we went out of the coffee shop together we saw the van with the load of stuff outside the "Standard." Honeybun and I went to the stable and the vanload of fruit drawed along. Hart drove the van. I, Honeybun, the carman, and the other chap what was with the carman helped to unload the stuff. Honeybun asked me to buy some oranges. I said, "I don't think this has come straight; I do not like the looks of that fellow." That was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070050"/>
               <p>the fellow with the carman. He tried to press me to buy the oranges but I did not. I walked out of the stable, saying, "I am going home." I went straight home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Purcell. I had not seen Hart before I saw the fruit outside the "Standard" I had not been near him at all, I know three Bentleys. I believe one of them was outside the "Standard" that day. I did not ask him to let me put my stuff in his stable. I did not ask Honey bun if he knew the stable. I did not give Hart 2s. and tell him to go to Islington and lose his van, get into the train, and go to Hammersmith, and then go into a coffee shop and say, "I have lost my van." I did not buy the stuff and know nothing about it. I did not buy it because I did not want it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anderson. When I was arrested I said, "All right, sir, Honeybun has given me away, has he?" I thought there was some trouble about the stuff. I did not mean he had given me away to get me into trouble. I did not want to be brought into the concern if it come to be stolen. I had seen Hart about a fort<lb/>night before. I did not give him any money over this transaction. I did not say to Sergeant Hall that Honeybun told me he had got it bent. He came in the station after I had been arrested. I made this statement. He had no book and never put anything down. There were other officers there. I told an officer when he came in. I said it was Tich's stuff because Mr. Landan said he had lost some fruit. I see him every day in market.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am 25 years of age. I live at 219, Blackhorse Road, Walthamstow, and have had a green-grocer's stall in High Street for the last 12 years. I have known Stiles 18 months. On January 17, at 4 p.m., I saw him in Forest Road. He asked me to have a cup of tea. We went to a coffee-shop in Blackhorse Road. He asked me where Bentley, who I live with, was. I said he was over at the house, and he asked me to fetch him. Stiles asked Bentley if he could put a load of fruit in his stable. Bentley said he had just given up the stable. Stiles then asked him if "Bunny" (me) knew the place, and if I could hire the stable for him. I agreed; he gave me 3s. for the deposit; I saw Mrs. Dilly; she let me the stable and gave me the key. As I came away Stiles was coming along the street and I gave him the key. He said, "Here comes the load of stuff." I saw a pair-horse van coming along driven by Hart. Hart pulled into the stable yard and we three unloaded it. Stiles gave Hartsome money, whispered to him, and Hart went away with the van. Stiles locked up the stable. He said, "If anybody asks you anything about this stuff say that you gave £17 5s. for it." I said "All right." The next day I saw Stiles at Spitalfields Market. He said, "Keep your mouth shut about that stuff or else you look like getting dragged into it." I said, "If I had known it was like that I would have had nothing to do with it." The next evening, at 10.30 p.m., Inspector</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070051"/>
               <p>Bedford came to my house, and I told him I had given £17 5s. for the fruit, that I bought it off a dark man that came from Thames Street outside the "Standard" public-house. He asked me if I should know the man again. I said, "Yes, I always see him at Thames Street." I was afterwards charged. Stiles did not speak to me about the fruit on Monday—I never saw him on Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cassels. I told my solicitor what Stiles had said to me at Spitalfields Market. It was news to me that it was stolen stuff. I told Bedford I had given £17 5s. for it, not knowing I was doing wrong—Stiles had told me he did not want the stall-keepers at Edmonton to know what stuff he had coming in—that is why I thought he wanted me to say that. Stiles never said, "That is Tich's stuff, and you had better give it back to him." Stiles once bought 50 lb. of Brazils off me. Bentley is here, and will tell you that Stiles asked him to put the stuff in his stable. Mrs. Dilly is wrong in saying that the van came along with three men on it; Hart was alone. Hart's statement is untrue.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anderson. I have been in the fruit trade 12 years. I have never known an honest transaction like this. Stiles's business is at Edmonton, three or four miles from Blackhorse Road. He told me he wanted to put the stuff in there so that people at Edmonton should not know what goods he had. I said to Sergeant Hall, "I see I made a mistake through not getting a receipt." It was a strange transaction to buy £26 worth of fruit from a man in the street.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have never had any dealings in or been concerned with stolen property or been in the hands of the police for any crime.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ISRAEL BEDFORD</hi>. When I went with Honey bun to Dilly's stable no one had the key, and we looked at the fruit thrugh the parti<lb/>tion of the adjoining stable. The stable was afterwards broken open by another officer.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner), examined by Mr. Purcell. I live at 52, Long Street, Hackney Road, and have been carman to Emanuel, Spitalfields Market, for the last five months. I previously worked in the market as a porter. I have never previously been charged with dishonesty, and before this offence, to which I have pleaded guilty, have borne a good character and been in respectable employment. On January 17 I was sent by prosecutor from his shop in Lamb Street, Spitalfields, to kew with a load of fruit As I was leaving, a man whom I had seen with Stiles about three times, spoke to me. I went-with him to a public-house in Brushfield Street and had some drink. We then went to Bishopsgate and had some more drink. In cones<lb/>quence of what he said I then went to the "Standard" public-house at Walthamstow with him. He got off the van and met Stiles, whom I had known eight or nine months. Stiles beckoned to me to come into the stable yard, the fruit was unloaded by Stiles, Honeybun and my<lb/>self. I then came back to the "Standard," when Stiles gave me 2s., telling me to lose the van somewhere—to leave the van unattended in Seven Sisters Road or Islington, and then to go to Hammersmith or Kew Market and report the van lost. I left the van unattended, went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070052"/>
               <p>to King Street, Hammersmith, stated to the police that I had gone into a coffee shop and when I came out the van was gone. The police told me to go and get the van at Islington, where they said it had been found. I was afraid to go there and went home. Stiles said, "I will see how I get on with this stuff. I will meet you at eleven o'clock at the "Unicorn" public-house at the corner of Commercial Street." I went there as I was going home, but did not meet him there. I saw him next on Wednesday in the market, and on Thursday; on both occasions he would not speak to me. On Thursday night I was arrested, charged, and made a statement, which I altered on Friday at the police-court. I knew Stiles by taking fruit to his place. Emanuel keeps a book in which he enters goods delivered, where delivered, and the name of the carman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cassels. I have told several stories about this business. The first statement I made to the police about having the van stolen outside a coffee shop was entirely untrue. I asked to have it altered at the Police Court before I signed it. What I have now said is the truth.</p>

               <p>Mr. Purcell recalled Detective-sergeant Hall and proposed to ask as to the. conversation with Bentley in the absence of Stiles. On the objection of Mr. Cassels the evidence was not pressed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Purcell asked to recall the prisoner Stiles for further cross-examination; after objection by Mr. Caessels, Judge Rentoul ruled that Mr. Purcell had a right further to cross-examine a prisoner who had given evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cassels then said that he should advise his client Stiles to refuse to return to the box or to answer any further questions. He submitted that the prisoner was a competent but not a compellable witness. Counsel explained the position to the Judge in his private room, after which the evidence was not pressed.</p>

He also received nine months at Middle<lb/>sex Sessions on April 7, 1894, for housebreaking. Ten summary con<lb/>victions for assault and drunkenness were proved. It was stated that Stiles was released by the Home Secretary on the conviction of nine months at the end of six weeks; that after his release from prison on January 13, 1909, he had carried on a respectable business as a fruiterer.</p>

I was partly unconscious for the moment and the next thing I remember was seeing prisoner struggling in the arms of three or four men. I was taken to the hospital. I lost a great deal of blood. I do not remember ever having seen or spoken to prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I was not using any questionable language that evening. I have not addressed young men and women in the Park as an Atheist. (Prisoner here made a rambling statement to the effect that the wrath of God rested upon him, the prisoner, for neglecting to oppose the Atheists, and that when he went to sleep visions of crying children came before him.)</p>

I closed with prisoner and then the sergeant came and took him in charge. I did not see the instrument he used.

I took prisoner to the station and on him I found this piece of iron, a flute, matches, and a pair of scissors. Referring to the piece of iron he said, "Yes, that is what I struck him with. He insulted my religion and I could not help it."</p>

                  </hi>, Medical Officer, Brixton Prison. I have, had prisoner under my observation since January 4, and have had several conversations with him. I do not think he is of sound mind; he suffers from fixed and definite delusions and hallucinations. His chief delusion is that he has a mission from God to kill people who lecture in Hyde Park on certain subjects. I asked him what would happen if he got let off, and he said that he should still pursue that mission. My opinion is that it was whilst under this delusion he com<lb/>mitted this offence, and was therefore not responsible at the time.</p>

They ran off; I followed them till I met a constable, who arrested the prisoner; the other man ran off. When prisoner took my watch he passed it to one of his confederates, a man with a brown overcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I should say there were nine or ten men; I was frightened; I was at their mercy, I could not do anything, because if I had shown any resistance no doubt it would have been a serious matter for me. The other men ran away; prisoner did not have a chance to run away. I was quite certain at the time that prisoner was the man; I did not say on the way to the station that I was not sure prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I was and am quite certain that prisoner is the man who put his hand in my pocket and took my watch. I did not really lose sight of the men only when I spoke to the policeman.</p>

I went up Pentonville Road to find a policeman; I then saw prosecutor talking to the policeman; I told the constable what I had seen, and prisoner was arrested.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On the night of December 31 I was passing through Pentonville Road on my way borne; I saw seven or eight men rowing and quarrelling; I stopped to see the row. A policeman came along, and one of the men says, "Look out, here comes a 'flatty' (meaning a policeman), and they all ran away; I stood still. The constable came, to me and said, "I am going to charge you with being concerned in stealing this watch and chain." I says, "Very well, you can search me if you like; I do not know nothing about the watch and chain." I was taken to the station. On the way prosecutor said he could not swear I was the man. I did not steal the watch, I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I live at 13, St. James's Gardens, Islington. I go that way home, or I could go right straight up and turn by the "Angel"; one way is as quick as the other. I saw this crowd of men, and I stopped to watch them because I thought they were going to fight; there were several others standing there besides me. I did not see prosecutor there; I did not see him robbed. I cannot say that I have seen any of the men before. I have been round that neighbourhood all my life; I have often seen a fight there. When the policeman arrested me the other men were across the road. I was alone when the police<lb/>man spoke to me; I do not know why they ran when the policeman came. When prosecutor said that he was not sure whether I was the man the constable could have heard it; I did not see a man in a brown overcoat there.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN BROWN</hi>, 140 City. On January 18 about 3.20 a.m. I was in Creed Lane: I heard a sound of falling glass; I ran on Ludgate Hill and looked down towards Ludgate Circus; I saw two persons turn into the Old Bailey; I ran after them; they law me and they ran away; I blew my whistle: Baker was stopped by two men by Fleet Lane and Millist was stopped by another policeman by Bishop's Court. I said to Baker, "What about that window?" He said, "What window?" At that time I did not know which window he had smashed. On the way to the station this clock was handed to me by a man unknown who said it had been handed to him by a carman who had found it in his van. When I got to the station Baker took a lady's watch and a pocket-bonk out of his pocket; he said he had been out three or four nights and was not going to stick out any longer. Millist said that he took the clock out of the window and threw it into a van outside a newsagent's in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Baker. You pulled the things out of your pocket at the station and gave them to me: you did not pick them up off a seat in the station: you pulled them out of your pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Millist. You told me that you took the clock out of the window and threw it into a van: the carman is here.</p>

                  </hi>, manager of Luigi Fraulo and Co., 23, Bakers' Row, Clerkenwell. On Saturday afternoon, January 21, I left our ware-house securely locked up; it contained about 1,000 boxes of macaroni, value 5s. each. That night I was shown by the police two boxes, which I identified as part of the 1,000. Going to the warehouse I found that a window had been smashed and the place entered; in all 40 boxes were missing.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">J. KENWARD</hi>, E Division. On January 21, about 7.15 p.m., I was in Warner Street, Clerkenwell, with Sergeant Ebsary. I saw prisoner in Bath Court, which is about 100 yards from Bakers' Row: they were apparently putting something into a bag. Kenneth left the other man and came to the corner of the court, where he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070058"/>
               <p>counted some money in his hand. On seeing me and Ebsary he com<lb/>menced to run. Brown came out shortly afterwards and I stopped him and asked what he had in his bag: he said he had just bought a shirt for 3s. On the bag being searched at the police station we found in it the two boxes of macaroni (produced).</p>
               <p>Brown here said that he pleaded guilty to receiving; he bought the stuff off a man, but not knowing that it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM EBSARY</hi>, E Division. I arrested Kenneth on January 22. When I told him I should arrest him for being con<lb/>cerned with Edward Brown in stealing two cases of macaroni he said, "All right. I will come with you; I can prove I was not with Brown last night." I said, "I saw you leave him in Bath Court, and Brown says he bought it from you "; he said, "You get on with it." At the station, prior to their being charged, Brown, pointing to Kenneth, said, "This is not the man I bought the macaroni from last night."</p>

I left this plate, which is my husband's property, in a basket on the dining-room side-board. I cannot say for certain whether the scullery window was locked. On coming down at 7.15 the next morning the plate in the basket was gone.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HEXAMER</hi>, S Division. On the morn<lb/>ing of January 9 I examined the premises at 6, Barnby Street, and found an entry had been effected by the scullery window, there being marks of foot dirt on the cill; it had been a wet night.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK OXLEY</hi>, G Division. At 10 a.m. on January 9 I went with Sergeant Butt to Shuttleworth's lodging house at 57, White Lion Street, Islington, where I saw prisoner. I told him who we were and that I believed he had in his possession property which did not belong to him. He said, "I have nothing." I went to bed last night and have only just got up." I then drew his attention to his boots and said, "You are sodden in mud and wet mould. How do you account for that?" He said, "That is from yesterday. You can search me. I have nothing." In his trousers pocket I found an ordinary latch key with the middle cut away, forming a skeleton key. I said, "Is this yours?" He said, "It was given to me." On f inding another key on him he said, "I do not know anything about that."I said, "Where is your locker?" and he said he had not got one."We then went into the kitchen where I opened a locker with the small key quite readily, and found this property inside. I said, "We shall arrest you, Thompson, and also this man," referring to a man named Richardson, who was standing by. He said, "You can take me, but he (Richardson) knows nothing about it; he only minds my papers for me." He then asked to be allowed to wash himself, and on my refusing he struggled, but eventually said, "All right: you have got me I will go quietly. We did not know of the prosecutor's loss at this time. In the locker I also found a screwdriver with a broken top.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070060"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You were sitting at a table with some others, and Butt tapped you on the shoulder and called you to one side. Butt did not ask you how long you had been living there; you volunteered the information and asked us to go and see the deputy to verify what you had said. It was Butt who opened and searched the locker; I was standing by when he did it. Richardson when he came up did not say, "This locker does not belong to this man; he has not got a locker here." Butt did not say to him, "What do you know about it?" and he did not say, "I am in charge of these lockers and when a man wants a locker he generally comes to me." Butt may have said, "Well, if that is the case, you will have to come as well," but I did not hear him.</p>

                  </hi>, night porter, Shuttleworth's lodging-house. I was on duty on the night between January 8 and 9. The door is locked at one. Prisoner had been staying there two months. The last time I saw him on the 8th was a little after 9 p.m. The next time I saw him was at six the next morning; I let him in. He was wet; it had been a wet night. I pointed out to Butt his locker to the best of my ability.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You were not in bed at 1 a.m. when I went round to check the beds. It is possible that anybody might go out and come in at any time of the night. There are about 30 or 40 lockers, most of which have their partitions gone. I cannot say whether the locker next to yours was locked; but the partition is gone, and anybody could pass his hand through from his locker to yours. I never saw you borrow a key from Randall or anybody else.</p>
               <p>To the Jury. The keys to these lockers are very common, and pro<lb/>bably one would open different lockers.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">OXLEY</hi> (recalled). The lockers on both sides of prisoner's locker were locked. Some have padlocks and some have the locks in the door. The key to prisoner's padlock would not fit similar locks. About six inches of the partition separating it from the adjoining locker was broken away.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). When Sergeant Butt came and spoke to me he said that he had called last week and had been told that I was not living there. I told him I had been doing so since the 19th of last month, and on that day I had reported myself at the station. The deputy confirmed what I had said. I told him I had no</p>

               <p>locker there, that I Had not been out that morning, and the mud on my boots was from yesterday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. At 5 a.m. on January 9 I got up and let myself out with the intention of going to Spitalfields Market, but as it was wet I returned in three-quarters of an hour. I had been out three hours the day before when it was raining, and that is why I told the police that the mud on my boots was from yesterday. It is true I told him I had only just got up. The two keys on me I borrowed from a man named Randall. The small key fitted his locker, in which I used to keep my soap and towel, and I borrowed it from him at 9.30 that morning; I used to borrow it every morning. When the police searched they found in that and the next locker some old clothes and things. I did not say, "You can take me, but he (Richardson) knows nothing about it"; nor "All right; you have got me fair; I will go quietly." I did not struggle. When the small key was found on me I said I knew nothing about it, because I was confused. The police never asked me whether I had any property that did not belong to me.</p>

                  </hi> (compositor), Shuttleworth's Lodging-house. (To prisoner.) The detective said to you, "I believe you have some stolen property in your locker" and you said, "I have nothing. I have got no locker. I am willing to be searched." I saw you borrow a key on that morning from Randall, which, I believe, you put in your pocket. I did not see you go to the locker. I have seen about six other people besides you go to it. There was soap and a towel kept there, and also some blacking brushes, which I have used myself. Randall has not been seen since that morning; previous to that he had been staying there two or three months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am at present out of work. One key will fit three or four lockers; there was no necessity for prisoner to have borrowed the key from Randall particularly; I have one that will fit that locker. I did not see prisoner come in at 6.15 a.m. He borrowed the key at 9.30. I sleep in the same room as prisoner. He went to bed between 11.30 and 12 and went out at 5.30 a.m.; he was in bed at 1 a.m.</p>

                  </hi>, single woman, of no occupation, 18, Grenville Mansions, Bloomsbury. At 1.30 a.m. on January 13 I was coming out of a shop in Handel Street with two men named Green and Fane when a girl, who was a stranger to me, spoke to me. We had a quarrel. Prisoner, who came out of a house in Handel Street, asked her what was the matter and she said Fane had insulted her. Prisoner struck at him; I could not quite see what happened next, but I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070062"/>
               <p>remember prisoner struck me on the left side; I do not know what with. I fell down unconscious. I did not know him before this. These are my clothes I was wearing at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. "Beatrice St. Clair" is not my proper name. My father's name is Dover; I have assumed the name of St. Clair. I am at present staying with a friend in Kennington; I have a gentleman friend who allows me private means. These men were escorting me home. I have known Green seven weeks. I did not tell my friends that this girl had no right to carry on with a coloured man. The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes, Fane had not insulted her, and I cannot account for her speaking to me. I had seen her in Leicester Square before. She left us and went to this house and prisoner followed her out. He did not demand an explanation of the insults. He did not tell the girl to go home and that it did not matter. He knocked Fane down. He told Mabel, the girl, to go indoors and then went for some of the other witnesses. There were about seven or eight people round. I do not think there was a dead set made upon him. Before I was struck a general scrimmage was going on. I did not strike him in the face. Prisoner struck me twice; those were the only blows I received. I did not see a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GORDON EVANS</hi>, house physician, Royal Free Hospital. Prose-cutrix was brought into the hospital at 2 a.m. on January 13, suffering from an incised wound about two inches deep and half an inch long on the left side of the chest; it was in a dangerous position. It would require a very considerable amount of force to have pierced all this clothing as it did; the wound could have been produced by this knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was more of a rip. I do not think there is any<lb/>thing in the size of the knife to make it improbable that it caused the wound.</p>

I was with prosecutrix and Fane on this night, and we had just come out of a sandwich shop when a girl said that she had been maligned in the shop, which was untrue. She then said she would get her husband, the prisoner, and went into 15, Handel Street. She came out, followed shortly afterwards by prisoner. He said his wife had been insulted, and assumed the aggressive. He struck me in the chest, and then another man, slipping to the ground as he did so. I went for a con<lb/>stable. On returning I found prosecutrix lying in the road uncon<lb/>scious. I took her to the hospital. The whole affair lasted about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was absolutely sober, and I should say the others were as well. I did not hear prosecutrix tell this girl that she had no right to go with a coloured man. She said, "I will fetch my husband—the boxer "—that is the only way I heard him described. The words "coloured man" may have been used in the argument, but I did not hear them. Prisoner did not demand an explanation; he "launched out." Prosecutrix did touch prisoner, but I cannot say whether it was a severe blow. There was a general melee.</p>

                  </hi>, 14, Robsart House, Kenton Street, W.C. At 1.30 a.m. on January 13 I was in my flat which is overlooking Handel Street, when I heard a disturbance. I looked out of the window and saw a crowd of about 12 people. There was a lot of screaming. Pri<lb/>soner ran out of a house and went to hit at a man, who ran away. Prosecutrix got in between them and he struck her. She walked about four yards and then dropped. I assisted Green to take her to the hospital. Green had a stick in his hand, and the girl snatched it from him and hit prisoner in the teeth. Prisoner took the stick from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If prosecutrix had not struck prisoner no harm would have come to her. I saw no knife in his hand; it was Green's stick he had in his right hand when he struck her. I could not see what caused her wound. He struck her with his left hand in the face and in the body with his right. Prisoner was the only one who was fighting; the rest ran away. The girl was the only one who struck him. (To the Court.) I said before the magistrate: "I saw some<lb/>thing in prisoner's hand; I could not say what it was." I was not certain then that it was the stick.</p>

Pri<lb/>soner came out of a house a minute afterwards, and came at me and my friend. Prosecutrix stepped in front of me and received the blow intended for me in the face. He then went for Ellison and cut his coat right through with a knife that he had in his right hand. I saw he had something in that hand when he came out of the house. I afterwards saw him strike at the prosecutrix with a knife. He hit her in the left side, and she fell unconscious. He ran indoors then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. As far as I could judge he had a knife in his hand; it was something white. He evidently had the blade up his sleeve. I saw something flash as he came out. The first time prisoner struck her was with the left hand. I saw nobody else with a knife. There was a great confusion at the time. I did not see any one attack prisoner.</p>

He gave the prosecutrix a slight push and then he rushed over to me and struck at me with his right hand. I saw something flash in his hand. I stepped aside and we both fell down. He hit me in the side, cutting through my big coat, jacket, waistcoat, and card case. He then truck prosecutrix in about the same place as he had struck me and she fell. He went into the house before anybody could stop him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were from 10 to 15 people there. Nobody attempted to strike him: he was "running amok."</p>

                  </hi>, manager to Alfred Phillips, Limited, music publishers, 20, The Mall, Ealing. On December 13 prisoner called on me and said had I heard that the Post Office were taking over the telephone from the National Telephone Company I said I had heard there was something going on, but I did not know that the business had been completed. He said, 'Have you noticed how dog<lb/>eared these present paper directories get?' I said 'Yes.' He said, 'My firm have the authority of the Post Office to issue a cloth stiff millboard cover to go over these directories; would you like-to take a space for an advertisement on this cover? '—producing a green cover like that produced. He quoted £5 5s. a year for the top quarter space on the front of the cover for the district of Ealing and neigh-bourhood; said, 'We have 1,500 subscribers on the Ealing Ex-change "; that the cover would go into every house and also the call offices. I asked him the price for the whole of the back; he said,. £10 10s.; I asked for a discount; he said, 'If you will pay spot cash with the order I will makt it £9.' I agreed. When I was writing out the cheque I said, 'Who shall I make this payable to.' He mentioned the name of Mr. Duval. I said I preferred to make it out to the firm. He showed me a receipt form and said, 'Make it out to the National Telephonic Advertising Company.' He purr chased gramophones to the amount of 9s., and I gave him cheque (produced) for £8 11s.; he handed me receipt signed 'W. Mere-dith.' He said he was the representative of the company, and took the cheque away. I received information and wrote to cancel the</p>

               <p>order, when he replied stating that he had distinctly pointed out to me he was in no way connected with the Post Office authorities, and that it was too late to cancel the order. On January 5 I received my telephone directory without a cover. I have since received two covers from a firm in Regent's Street, in no way connected with the prisoner's company. I should not have given the order or paid the cheque had I not believed the representation that prisoner was author<lb/>ised by the Telephone Company.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I understood that prisoner was connected with the Telephone Company and came from them and that the cover would be put on the directories as issued by the Post Office. He said, "We have 1,500 subscribers." If the covers were issued to 1,500 people with my advertisement upon it I should have been satisfied.</p>

                  </hi>, Stokebridge Park Laundry, Ealing. On December 23 I received a telephonic message from Miss Bailey and saw prisoner. He said he was in connection with the Telephone Company, produced a cover, said that Sanders, of Ealing, had taken the top space and offered me a side space in the front for £18. He said the covers were to be issued with the directory. I signed an order to take that space for three years, he gave me receipt (produced) show<lb/>ing that my contract was number 3,036. I paid cheque for £18 to him (produced) which has been duly honoured. I asked him if I could have a space on the Hampstead cover. He said he was not sure. He called again on December 30 and agreed to give me a similar space for Hampstead, for which I gave him a further cheque for £18, pay<lb/>able to H. G. Duval at his request, for which he gave me receipt (pro<lb/>duced) the contract number being 3,037. I should have paid neither of these two cheques except for the representation that prisoner was acting for the Telephone Company. I asked him if the covers would be in use at the call offices. He said they would be hung up in the call offices and that his company had got a special fastener for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I understood that prisoner was in connection with the Telephone Company—he said so. He said he was an agent for the Telephonic Company, and that his company were under con-tract with the Telephone Company to supply the cover.</p>

On January 5, 1911, prisoner said he had come to solicit an advertise<lb/>ment to go on a cover which was to be put on the existing telephone books. I said, "How am I to know the Telephone Company sanc<lb/>tion this?" He said, "We are in unison with the Telephone Com<lb/>pany." I said, "How am I to know that these covers are going on the telephone books?" He said, "This year we are a little late so that the Telephone Company are not putting them, but we have arranged with them that they will do so next year, and also on any further</p>

I asked him, "Will you guarantee that the directories and the covers will be delivered together?" He said that would be so. I had a communication with Mr. Gray, the accountant of the National Tele<lb/>phone Company, and saw prisoner on January 7. I was prepared to put certain questions to him. I said, "Are you from the Telephone Company?" He said, "Yes. My firm has the contract with the Telephone Company for advertising on the covers." He said, "Marshall and Snelgrove have taken a space," and asked for the cheque for the advertisement. I said, "I cannot give it to you to<lb/>day."</p>

               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ERNEST HILL</hi>, C Division. On January 16, between 10 and 11 a.m., I saw prisoner in Sutton Lane, Turnham Green, and read the warrant charging him with attempting to obtain £4 15s. from Miss Leslie Meadows by false pretences. He said, "All right, but I suppose you know it is a mistake?" Later on, at Chiswick Station, he said, "She has got her back up because I wrote her saying I would cancel her order with pleasure. But I suppose if I say anything to you it will be given against me." I replied, "Probably." He said, "Oh, well it does not matter—it is all a mistake. I think I know what is the matter—I told her I had got an order from a big West-End firm; I might have mentioned Marshall and Snelgrove; but you know that is an old advertising dodge. When you have got a fool of a woman to deal with you have got to mention one or two big firms." On the way to the police station he said, pointing to the bag I had taken from him, "You might let me take out one or two tilings." He opened the bag, pointed to some contract notes, and asked me to let him have them. I declined to do so. I said, "I believe you are the principal of the Telephonic Advertising Company?" He said, "Yes, I am the company." In the bag I found two telephone directories, a quantity of contract forms, Schiller's cheque for £18, marked "payment stopped," and a contract form filled up for number 3,025, with the words, "By official permission."</p>

                  </hi>. My sister and I live at 10, Grafton Street, and are the proprietors of a Ladies' Club. In October we were wanting to take larger premises, and we advertised in the "Daily Telegraph" of October 13 that we would give a good bonus to anyone introducing £500 to £1,000 for a genuine-going West End concern. In answer we got a letter (Exhibit la) headed "Frederick B. Vander<lb/>bilt, 32, Marmion Road, Clapam Common," requesting us to call, and stating that "Mr. Vanderbilt is no moneylender's agent nor is he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070070"/>
               <p>a moneylender. He helps strictly honourable and genuine cases, which does not imply either that he, Mr. Vanderbilt, is a philanthropist." On October 28 we called at that address and saw prisoner. We told him that we were taking larger premises and that we wanted a little more temporary capital. We offered him as security debentures in the club. He said, "I never touch those. I only lend money on the most tangible security. I have to-day financed a very large company for £60,000, and 1 do not mind whether it succeeds or not as I am perfectly secured. I have a friend who is very sweet on debentures, and I shall be very pleased to introduce you to him." My sister asked what commission he would charge and he said, "None at all. I do not do that sort of thing; it is my friend, and I will introduce you to him." He went on to say that he only financed big things himself, and that he was a director of different companies. I then said it was only a temporary advance we wanted, and he said that if it was only a matter of £1,000 or so he would do it himself. Quite at the early part of the interview he said that he was a Vanderbilt, an uncle of the Duchess of Marl borough and Mrs. Payne Whitney and a brother of Cornelius Vanderbilt—the one that drives the coach. He said he was only stopping there for quite a short time and that he had bought a place in Chislehurst, for which he had paid £4,000. He did not mention with whom he was staying at 32, Marmion Road, but he said the letters there were tampered with, so his business address was Cook's, at Charing Cross. The following Monday, October 31, he called on us according to arrangement. He said he had had great difficulty to be in time, and that he had been to a very big board meeting of a com<lb/>pany into which he had put £15,000, and which was starting some sewing machine. He came with me to see the club premises in Cork Street. The agents with whom we were communicating about them. were Coburn and Co., of Leadenhall Street. On returning to Grafton Street he told us that he thought it was a very good thing; that he would assist us to get the premises; that all his own money was practically out, but that he would get it for us from America. I told him the necessity of closing the matter at once, and to assure us that it would be all done he wrote this letter to me to show to the agents saying that if the landlord would let us have the premises he would be willing to pay a year's rent in advance, provided he made certain concessions; it is signed "Fred D. Vanderbilt." Either on that day or the next he said that they were forming a large company which was making a railway near Quebec, and he said if it went through all right he would be "the Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilts," and that he would be the richest of the lot, and that they were also getting up a company for buying up different coal mines in Wales. He also mentioned as a young man he had been in the Royal Navy and had got his captaincy; that he had the full right to use his title of captain but did not do so; and that he had been left a lot of money when he came of age. On the Monday he asked us how much we wanted, and that we had better decide at once. I said about £2,000 or £2,500 would be sufficient. He said we had better take enough when we were getting it because we would not get it again, and that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070071"/>
               <p>he would arrange that we should have £3,000. I agreed to that because we had to pay £2,000 down—the rent. He called again on the following Wednesday and said he had been able to arrange it quite satisfactorily, and that we could have £4,000 or £5,000. I said we did not require quite so much, but he pointed out that we should have to pay £1,000 for the loan whether it was £3,000 or £4,000, and that it would be an advantage to have some surplus capital even if we did not use it. We agreed to take £5,000, of which we had to return £1,000. He then wrote this letter: "Confirming our conversation to-day, you may rely upon my lend<lb/>ing you the sum of £5,000 for rent for your club, and incidental expenses attendant thereon." He then said we should have to sign bills for the amount for four months. I said we hoped to pay the whole thing in a year, but we must have two years' time in which to pay. He said that the bills were renewable, and we had only to give six weeks' notice and they would be renewed at 6 1/2 per cent. or 7 1/2 per cent., but he would try and arrange the thing at less percentage. He called again next day, bringing five unstamped bills for £1,000 each, dated November 7, to "J. Batten, 32, Marmion Road, Clapham Common," three being for three months and two for four months. He left them with us to sign and have stamped. He said that he would get the bills discounted, and that, of course, we knew quite well that they would be valueless without his backing them. He said that his man or his agent would have to go up to Glasgow to do so, as he was not lending the money, and that we should have to pay £21 expenses. I offered him a cheque, but he said that he wanted gold. He arranged to call on the next day, Friday, for the bills and the gold. On the morning of that day we signed the bills and I took them down to Somerset House, where I found I could not get them stamped. At some place in Chancery Lane I bought five blank bill forms. I think I must have taken them to Somerset House and got them stamped, 10s. each. I returned with them and found he was waiting. My sister and I began talking it over and we thought that we would rather not sign them. He said, "You ought to kuow yourself that the risk is absolutely on the other side, for the bills, unless I back them, would not be worth anything, and I shall be responsible for them." He said he was simply backing them to enable us to get the capital we required, and that his name on them alone was enough security. That reassured us. My sister filled them up from a form which prisoner had filled up the night before and we signed them. The name "J. Batten" was on them, as it is now The names, "James Sossick" and "First Sossick" were not on them. He said "J. Batten" was his clerk, that we should have the money within a week, and that, as we had not had the bills ready for him when he arrived, it had delayed the matter for a day or two. When we were saying that we were doubtful about signing the bills he said, "To show you how much I am trying to hurry the matter and assist you, I gave orders to have some shares sold out of my own, so that I would advance you the money myself." He asked whether he could use our telephone as he wanted to ring up a Count Wilhelm, a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070072"/>
               <p>great friend of his, who was a keen business man and did a lot of his. business for him. I think he said he was in King William Street. He said he would like us to hear the conversation and if we would stand by for a moment he would tell us exactly what they said. He rang up and asked for Count Wilhelm, and was told he was not in, but his clerk was there; he told me that the clerk was answering him. He asked if they were hurrying up selling these shares out, saying that it was "Vanderbilt" speaking, and that he had given his orders and wished them carried out at once. He told them where they would find out all particu<lb/>lars about the shares and to hurry up the matter. These two letters, dated November 7, which we signed, were written at his dictation. He took them either at that interview or the day before. In them we give absolute authority to bearer to discount our bills of acceptance of even date upon the most favourable terms, and to pay the prisoner or his nominee all subscriptions to the Grafton Club from thenceforward until all our bills were repaid in full. On that Friday morning we paid him £15 in notes and £6 in gold, and he gave us this receipt. He took the bills away with him and made an appointment for the following Wednesday. On the morning of that day he rang up and my sister spoke to him. He came on the Friday morning, November 9, and said he was getting on with the matter; that he was to get £4,000 for his preference shares, and was going to give us £3,000 of it to start with, as he wanted the other £1,000 just for the moment for himself. He said when the bills had been dis<lb/>counted, which his man was seeing to, he would repay himself the £3,000 and give us the £1,000. He said he was selling out the shares at once, and in doing so he was getting 19s. instead of £1. Before this I had communicated with my solicitor and a warrant for his arrest had been obtained. Whilst speaking to us a police officer arrived and he was arrested. We have received nothing for our bills of exchange and in signing them we believed the statements he had made about himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You did not say that you were going to mortgage your shares. Most of the furniture in the club is our own, but some of it is on the hire-purchase system. I called on Mr. Western before I called on you, but finding that he was a money-lender I did not call again. I never went to Fieldings in Southampton Row to try and get money; I did not know them at all. On the Wednesday, the third interview, you dined with us. My sister was present all the time: I was never alone with you. After dinner you told us about your relations. I do not know that you actually said Cornelius Vanderbilt was your brother, but you said you were the brother of the Duchess of Marlborough's father. You said that you had joined the English Royal Navy at 13. and that you left at 23. You also told us of an incident that happened when the King inspected you as a cadet. You had those Bills in your possession from Friday, November 4, to November 11. I did not write and ask you to return them because we had put the matter into our solicitor's hands. If we had been sued on those</p>

               <p>bills we should not have been able to meet them. We had some money in the bank, but I did not wish to draw the £21 from that, so you wrote us a letter in order that we might obtain an overdraft.</p>

                  </hi>, solicitor, Swan Street, Borough. I first met prisoner in 1899, and from that year until May, 1904, I saw him fairly constantly; he came to my house on several occasions. The name on the card which he gave me when he first called was "William Lacker<lb/>stein Joachim," and I never heard him called by any other name. I asked him one day why he called himself "Captain," and he said he had held a captain's commission in the pilot service in India. He also said he had two brothers living in Calcutta, named Cyril and, Edwin. I wrote to one of them, and had a letter in reply, signed "Joachim." He said he had been to Calcutta himself, and in 1903 he wrote me from there. He never suggested that he was an American; he told me that his grandmother, Mrs. Lackerstein, lived in Calcutta; he never mentioned the name Vanderbilt to me.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You brought a lady to my house, who you said was your wife. I do not think you ever told me who your father was.</p>

He said he was a brother of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and that a brother, William Vander<lb/>bilt, had offered him his place at Maidenhead. When he telephoned.

                  </hi>, moulder. In October I was wanting some capital in order to set up some plaster works, and I advertised in the "Daily Telegraph" that I wanted £2,000 or £3,000, and I received this letter, which is similar to Exhibit la; it is imitation typewriting, and signed "Fred. D. Vanderbilt." I wrote in answer to that and re-ceived a reply. I wrote again, and on October 25 I got a letter, arranging to see me on the following morning at 32, Marmiou Road. I went and saw prisoner. He said he was a brother of Cornelius Vanderbilt, of New York. I explained what I wanted the money for, and he said he would certainly let me have it—£2,000 or £3,000. He said, "Do not look at this house; this is only temporary. I have just bought an estate from Empress Eugenie at Chislehurst, in Kent." He never told me what he had paid for it, but he said he was building a big mansion there, and as soon as it was finished he should move there. He also told me that his family lent some money to the Russian Government, and he went there like a tramp with £500,000 in his pocket. He spoke of so many things that I do not remember them all. I said it would be sufficient for me if I had £1,000 at once, and £2,000 in reserve, and he said he would do his best. I said that all the in<lb/>terest I should be prepared to pay was 5 or 6 per cent. He asked me to give him some references from mv clients, and I gave him nine or ten names, amongst whom were Mr. Frith and Mr. Gotta. On November 5 I got this postcard, making an appointment for me to see him. I went to see him on either the 5th or the 7th. He told me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070074"/>
               <p>he had a proposition to make to me; that he had two ladies, the Misses Taylour in a club in Grafton Street, who wanted to increase the premises and wanted £5,000 in cash, £1,000 for expenses and £1,000 for me. I asked how much percentage would be wanted for my money, and he said 10 per cent., which I refused. Eventually he said, "Here is £5,000 for these ladies, £1,000 for expenses and £1,000 for you-£7,000 altogether. Those ladies have got to have £1,000 for expenses, and you can sign the bills as lender of it." I asked him where the money was to come from, and he said, "I provide the money and give you security for it too." I was to sign seven bills of £1,000 each. I agreed to put my son in to sign also. He said that these ladies would pay the £5,000 back to me in 12 months and I could keep it or refuse it, and the £1,000 which I would have would be free of any interest He told me to buy two bills stamped 10s. each at Somerset House, and I did so. Subsequently he came to my house with these five bills signed by the Misses Taylour, and said if I would sign the whole seven bills he would let me have the money in a fortnight or three weeks at the longest. I signed them all with ray son. I said, "If I sign the bills I am liable to pay," and he said that was not so, and I must do so in order to enable him to give me the money. I had confidence in him. He said, "I must prove that I have given you the money so that I can receive the money. I think he told me that "J. Batten" was a capitalist, and that Lady Trafalgar was answerable for half of those bills. He took them away with him. I considered the matter that evening and on the following morning I went and asked him whether everything was correct. He said, "Certainly. If you fear anything, as you have signed the other bills, give me £2 10s. and everything is finished and I will give you the bills." That reassured me, and I left the bills with him. Next time I saw him was at the Marl borough Street Police Court. I signed Exhibit 14, which is an authority to bearer to discount the seven bills that I signed. I never gave prisoner authority to get Mr. Frith or Mr. Gotta to sign for me.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You told me that Cornelius Vanderbilt was your brother. You did not say that the estate you were buying was near Empress Eugenie's estate. At that time I had a banking account. I pay £1 a week for my flat. If my business had gone on all right I should have been able to repay the money, but not otherwise. I never ask my customers to back bills for me. The £2 10s. that I was to pay you for the return of the bills was to pay for the stamps on the five bills of the Misses Taylour.</p>

I married five years ago and left that address in the early part of last year, leaving prisoner there with his wife. He used the name of Vanderbilt about four years ago, as he said that was his father's name. He said the reason why he used the name of Lacker<lb/>stein was that that was his mother's name. I have never had any financial dealings with him nor have I signed any bills of exchange. I</p>

                  </hi>, sculptor, Elgin Studious, Chelsea. I have known James Sossick for about 20 years. At the end of October he called upon me and had an interview. I then got this letter, signed "Fred. D. Vanderbilt," asking for an appointment to see me with reference to an introduction he had had to me from Sossick. Prisoner called on November 8 and inquired if he was honest, industrious, and sober, and made various inquiries of that kind. I told him what I knew of him and he said that he intended to assist him to start in business, and he, and those acting with him, were going to advance him £1,000. He suggested that I should back up my good opinion of him by signing a bill for £1,000. I said I did not see my way to doing anything of the sort. He pleaded the cause of Sossick generally and suggested that it might be a good thing for me if Sossick was a successful business man because he could get a large amount of work for him from the "Four Hundred" of New York. I did not quite see how that would benefit me. He said it was purely a matter of form and that the real person who would pay was some Lady Trafalgar. I said I should have to think about it. He never came again.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. My suspicions were aroused because I had never heard of a Lady Trafalgar. I thought it was a matter that ought to be looked into; I cannot say it amounted to even suspicion. (To the Court.) I do not think he made any definite statements about himself.</p>

                  </hi>, sculptor, Chelsea. I know James Sossick. About the end of October he called and interviewed me. In the early part of November I received a letter signed "Fred. D. Vanderbilt," say<lb/>ing that he would call upon me in regard to some transaction with Sossick. Prisoner called upon me and told me that he was financing Sossick as a bronze founder: that he had gone into it from a business point of view, and the simplest mode of doing it would be by means of a bill. He said that Sossick would buy the goodwill of a foundry for something like £750 by means of a bill for £1,000. He suggested my putting my name to it in some form, and that he and Soseick were prepared to give me letters relieving me of all liability. I asked him why, if I was to have no liability, I should be asked to back the bill, and he said that he was not finding the money himself, but it was out of some family funds, and that my signature would be more</p>

                  </hi>, bandsman, Irish Guards. From June till about November I was lodging at 32, Marmion Road, prisoner being my landlord. He occupied the top four rooms and I occupied the remaining three rooms on the bottom. I paid 9s.a week. He told me the rent of the house was £1 a week. I knew him as "Captain Van-derbilt," uncle to the millionaire—the man that rode the coach. The first night I was there he said he had got a fine concern going. I asked him what the name of it was, and he said, "When you come into it I will tell you. Let me have £180 and you are made for life." I again asked him for the name, but he said he would not tell me until I came into it. I said I had some other use for my money. On the following night he said that this concern was a West End club, in Park Lane, and that if I would let him have £180 he would appoint me secretary at £5 a week. I said I would consider it. About a month after that he asked me upstairs, and suggested that if I could not go in for £180 I should go in for anything I liked, and suggested £50. He eventually suggested I should have £20 in it. I never put any money into it.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You never asked me what my income was, and I never told you anything about it. I did not leave the house owing you rent. You made a false charge to my Colonel, who ignored it. You said you were a captain of the Royal Navy and I believed it. For my £50 I was to be secretary at £5 a week, and you said that my money would double itself. Of course I did not believe it. You said that you were a member of the Army and Navy Club.</p>

I told him he would have to, and I conveyed him to the station. On the way he took a letter (Exhibit 26) from his inside pocket, which he was in the act of tearing up when I took it away from him; he said, "Let me do away with this; it may get me into trouble."

On the charge being read over to him he replied, "I am not guilty, and will make those ladies pay for this." He gave his name as "Frederick Dennehy Vanderbilt," and his address 32, Marmion Road. On the follow<lb/>ing morning he told me that if I were to go to his address I should find the bills in a cupboard in the top room. I went there and found the seven bills of exchange and other documents that have been pro<lb/>duced; they included a list of members of the Grafton Club, typed on several sheets of flimsy paper, giving particulars as to what each lady was paying as subscription. Amongst them is Viscountess Trafalgar, Salisbury.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. On January 18 you applied to the Governor of Brixton Prison to write the Assistant Commissioner of Police to bring up for you William Kissem Vanderbilt, the Duchess of Marlborough, Mr. Hunsdorfer, Mr. Gotta, and Mr. Frith. William K. Vanderbilt was written to in Paris, but the Paris police inform us that he had left his address leaving his whereabouts unknown. The Duchess of Marlborough is in the south of France, and declines to attend. Mr. Hunsdorfer is employed by Pinkerton's Detective Agency and is in America now.

                  </hi> (as indicted) (prisoner, on oath). My name is Frederick Dennehy Vanderbilt. I am the illegitimate child of the late William Henry Vanderbilt. My mother's name was Ophelia Lucretia Lackerstein. I invited W. Kissem Vanderbilt, par<lb/>ticularly through the police, to bring documentary evidence that he has of my birth. I invited him through the Governor of the Brixton Prison to give evidence on oath and the Governor read me a letter from the Commissioner of Police saying that he had left Paris for America and that his address was not given to anybody. Of course, I could not force a great man like that to come into Court. This action has rendered me destitute of all means. I have always spoken of him as my brother; I would not let all the world know that I was an illegiti<lb/>mate child. There is a deed of settlement from my late father, William Henry Vanderbilt, leaving my mother the interest on a million sterling, which she never drew. That was to come to me. It amounts to a good large sum if I could get the interest and compound interest: He has got the documents. In November, 1909, I was in Berlin. I had bills in my possession from Prince Franz Josef von Braganza, a nephew of the Emperor of Austria. Some newspapers attacked me and I wrote to my brothers for protection (Prisoner read a letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070078"/>
               <p>dated January 20, 1910, to William, George, and Frederick Vander<lb/>bilt, enclosing certified translation of two scurrilous articles that had appeared of him in some of the German papers and letters of sympathy he had received from friends; and asking them as his own flesh and blood to remove the only stigma that attached to him, that of his un<lb/>fortunate illegitimate birth, reflecting as it did upon their deceased father, William Henry Vanderbilt, of New York. He read another letter, dated January 31, 1910, which, he said, was addressed to Frede<lb/>rick Washington Vanderbilt. In this he referred to a request made to him to refrain from using his name, and continued, "My reply to this was that I have used, am using, and will continue using the names that I have a right to, even if I was crucified for it." He was about to read a passage in which he stated that he had never done anything in his life to be ashamed of, but when cautioned by Mr. Leycester he discontinued.) This letter was sent by registered post. I produce the registered receipt. The silver snuff box I referred to when cross-examining Hammond was given me by my father, William Henry Vanderbilt, in 1882, when he saw me in York, in the presence of W. K. Vanderbilt, my half-brother. I endeavoured to get these bills dis<lb/>counted, but could not do so. They are absolutely valueless. I never intended to rob these people, but to further their prospects.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I first learnt that I was the illegitimate child of W. H. Vanderbilt from my mother when I was between 19 and 20. I first adopted the name of "Vanderbilt" five or six years ago. The Vanderbilts have repudiated me now, but they have not always done so. One of them threatened to prosecute me. I have nothing more than I have already read to show that they at any time acknowledge me. My name as a boy was "William Joachim"; I was adopted by my mother's sister, whose name was Joachim, to cover my mother's shame. I used that name until about seven years ago, when my mother died; I dropped it about two years after that—in 1905. I then used the names of Lackerstein, in which I married in 1905, and Frederick Dennehy Vanderbilt. "Frederick" was a fancy name given me by my mother, and I am called "Dennehy" after General Dennehy, groom-in-waiting to the late Queen Victoria, who was supposed to be my godfather. I was baptised as "Frederick Dennehy." William Joachim died and I was put in his place, he being supposed to have been murdered by his father; I was too young to remember where it was. When a child I lived with my mother partly in England, partly in India, and partly in France. I have been to America. I have never seen nor had any financial dealings with Cornelius Vanderbilt, or any of them. I never said that he was my brother: I said that the late Cornelius Vanderbilt was a brother of mine. The Duchess of Marlborough is my niece. I said I visited at her house. I have been there once. I never said that I met his late Majesty the King there; if I did it would have been untrue. I do not remember telling the Misses Taylour that I had financed a company for £60,000 or £16,000; I may have done so, but it would not be true. I was tired when they called and they worried me. I have had £16,000, but I have not got it now. This action has rendered me destitute because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070079"/>
               <p>all my friends have deserted me; a gentleman was going to lend me a large sum of money. I had a pound or two at the bank when I was arrested. I did not tell the Misses Taylour that I had financed big things, but I could do so. I never told them that I could lend them this money myself; I pro<lb/>proposed to lend it to them out of certain shares that I had instructed Count Wilhelm to get a loan on; these shares, worth £5,500, were lent me by a friend of mine named Salter, whom I cannot find. I said that I was going to buy a place in Chislehurst, not that I had done so. I said I was interested in a sewing machine company, not that I had put £15,000 into it. I wrote Exhibit 2a at Miss Taylour's request, but it was understood that I was not going to pay the rent in advance; I was not in a position to do so, and what I wrote was, in fact, untrue. As regards my statement about the estate in Quebec, I was one of the promoters of a syndicate to obtain a concession in Quebec for £300,000, which would mean a grand fortune to any syndicate. I had put no money into it. I have been a captain in the Bengal Pilot Service, which calls itself the Indian Marine; I never said that I had been a captain in the English Royal Navy. I see I describe myself in my marriage certificate as "Captain, late of the Indian Marine." I was negotiating with a Mr. Monell to get these bills accepted and then to raise money on them to lend the Misses Taylour, less my commission. Monell is an agent for finance, of King William Street, and I worked through him as a financier. I have not tried to get him here. If I had got decent acceptors he would have got the bills discounted. I never told the Misses Taylour that I had arranged they could have £5,000; I said I was arranging it. I had arranged with Monell to renew the bills at 6 1/2 per cent. I told the Misses Taylour that before I could do anything with them it would be necessary to get the acceptance of some responsible person, and I asked if I could ask some of the ladies of the club. They would not permit this, but I was going to take upon myself to call upon Lady Trafalgar as a last resource, but I never did so. I did my business from my own residence and employed no clerks. I said that my man was going to Glasgow to discount these bills, but this was not so; the £21 I obtained for Monell to go to Brussels and Paris where his people are; I said Glasgow because I did not want the Misses Taylour to know where the money was coming from. I did not pay Monell anything. I spent part of the £21 in going about and trying to get people to accept these bills. I went to five people altogether, including Mr. Frith and Mr. Gotta. Some of the money is in the hands of the police. I never told Sossick that Cornelius Vanderbilt was my brother, nor that I had bought Empress Eugenie's estate. I told him about lending money to the Russian Government by way of a joke, and after we had arranged the business. I asked him to sign the bills because Monell told me to get two different sets of signatures to them if possible, and he said that it would be necessary also to have two persons to accept the bills before his people would touch them in any way.</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">FOWLER</hi> stated that, according to the police records, pri<lb/>soner appeared to have come to this country in 1882, and, having married, left shortly after with his wife, and went to Calcutta. There he worked for his father, a merchant, as a clerk, and returned to this country in 1897. His real name was <persName id="t19110207-name-266">

                     <interp inst="t19110207-name-266" type="given" value="WILLIAM LACKERSTEIN"/>William Lackerstein Joachim</persName>. The police next heard of him by that name at Old Kent Road and Mincing Lane, where he was conducting a loan-office agency, in re-spect to which the police received many complaints. That was in 1897. In the following year he was at Grove Lane, Camberwell, where he carried on a next-of-kin agency. Later in the same year he was at Russell Road, Peckham, carrying on a similar business. In 1900 he conducted a matrimonial agency in Victoria Street, Westmin-ster. In 1901 he was engaged in frauds in connection with a person in India who appeared to have some claim to a peerage; having obtained a power of attorney he offered remunerative positions in a company to exploit the man's claim on condition that the applicant bought certain shares in it. He was next heard of in Kingston, carrying on a fraud of a similar nature. Further fraudulent dealings in 1904 led to his conviction in May of that year, when he was sentenced to six months' hard labour on each of the charges made against him. Whilst on re-mand he confessed to having committed bigamy in 1901; this charge was not proceeded with owing to insufficient evidence. In 1909 he was engaged in Berlin in extensive frauds in connection with Prince Franz Josef von Braganza, by which £325,000 worth of bills had been ob<lb/>tained from him. He had done no honest work since he had been to this country. Hunsdorfer, to whom prisoner had referred, had been sent by the Vanderbilt family to New York to prevent him using their name if possible, he having been a great source of annoyance to them. There was no shadow of truth in his statement that he was the illegiti<lb/>mate son of the late W. H. Vanderbilt.</p>

                  </hi>, labourer. At 1.30 a.m. on January 16 I was in Harford Street, Mile End Road, when I was suddenly set upon prisoner and three other men; prisoner caught me by the throat while the others went through my pockets; they took two half crowns and a few coppers. I was flung to the ground and the four men ran away. I saw a constable and he and I gave chase. We came up with pri<lb/>soner and one other man at a corner; they were standing still. I told the constable that prisoner was the man who had caught me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070081"/>
               <p>by the throat. Prisoner said, "It's not me, guv'nor, they have run round the corner." I have no doubt that prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. It is not true that when the inspector asked me, "Are you really sure this is the man," I said, "I am very nearly sure." The two half-crowns were not found on you. I do not say that you had the money.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES BRADY</hi>, 300 H. On this morning I was in Mile End Road about 100 yards from Harford Street, when Fisher came to me and complained that he had been knocked down and robbed by four men; he pointed out two men running, and we gave chase to them. At the corner of Claverly Street we came up to prisoner and another man, who were standing still. Prisoner at once said, "It's not me, guv'nor, they have just gone down the street"; he said this before prosecutor or I had said a word. I arrested pri<lb/>soner; on being searched at the station 4s. 6d. in silver and 6(d. in coppers were found on him. On the charge being read over to him he said, "I am not guilty."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). This morning I had been to my married sister's place at Fairfield Road, Bow, and was returning home. I was at a coffee stall talking with a friend when prosecutor and Brady came up; prosecutor said, "That's the man"—meaning me—and I was arrested; they said nothing about my friend. At the station prosecutor charged me with robbing him of 5s., and said nothing about the assault. The inspector said to him, "Are you really sure that this is the man that got hold of you?" Prosecutor replied, "Well, I am nearly sure he is one of them"; the inspector said, "You must be sure"; prosecutor replied, "Well, I am sure." At the police court Brady told the magistrate he was not sure that I was one of the men he saw running. The money I had on me was three separate shillings and three sixpences and some coppers. I am absolutely not guilty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The friend I was with is named Johnson; I had him in attendance at the police court, but he was not called; I don't know whether he is here; my wife tells me that she has found him and also a man named Oligar, who saw everything. It is not true that I spoke to Brady before anything was said; prosecutor said, "That's the man," and I then said, "It is not us, guv'nor"; we both spoke at once and said, "It is not us, guv'nor, it's some men running down there"; Brady could see them running away.</p>
               <p>A call was made for "Oligar" or "Any witnesses on behalf of Michael Fitzpatrick"; nobody answered.</p>
               <p>At the suggestion of the Jury <hi rend="smallCaps">FISHER</hi> and <hi rend="smallCaps">BRADY</hi> were recalled (each being out of Court during the evidence of the other); they stated that when they came up to prisoner and the other man, both men, although they were standing still, were breathing hard and showing signs of having been running.</p>

Prisoner came up immediately and said, "I was just having a drink in the 'Globe' when they went off"; he had been drinking, but was quite able to take care of his horses; he was wearing a cap. The van was one of Hempleman's; on Decem<lb/>ber 31 I identified it in Hempleman's yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The horses were very restless. I saw no ground for detaining prisoner and he got on the van and drove away.</p>

                  </hi>, potman at the "Lion and Lamb," Chapel Street On December 16 I saw Alf Williams in the public bar about 6 p.m. and again about 10. Just after 10 prisoner pulled up with his van—one of Hempleman's fish offal vans. He and Williams had two drinks each: after about 10 minutes they went out; prisoner got on the van first and Williams got up on the other side; they took one rein each and drove away, the van going from one side of the road to the other. Prisoner seemed as if he had had a drop of drink, but he was not falling about; he got up on the van all right. He had a cap on.</p>

                  </hi>. On December 16, about 20 past 10 p.m., I was standing with Lewington at the corner of Hubbard Street and Northam Street, when I saw a pair-horse van coming from Rokeby</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070083"/>
               <p>Street; it was going at a great pace, and on the wrong side of the road; two men were driving, each holding one rein. Evans started to cross the road from opposite to me; he had got two steps from the pavement when the van came upon him; the pole chain struck him and he fell; the offside horse trampled on him and the two offside wheels went over his back. The van went right on without slackening pace, although I and Lewington shouted for it to stop. Both the drivers had their hats off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is rather dark just where this happened. I cannot identify prisoner as one of the drivers; I cannot say what colour the horses were; they were galloping; I do not think the drivers had lost control of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am night watchman at Hempleman's. Part of my duty is to check the carmen as they come in and go out. We employ about 28 carmen; they go to different parts of London collect<lb/>ing fish offal. On the night of December 16 prisoner left the yard about 7 o'clock in charge of a two-horse van; he was due to return between 5 and 5.30 a.m. At 10.40 he came back with the van; he was driving alone; he told ma that one of the horses had gone lame. Prisoner was the worse for drink; he had no cap on. I noticed Williams (another of our carmen) come from behind prisoner's van. After he had put the van and horses away prisoner asked me to book him in at 12 o'clock; with the condition he was in I was frightened that he would strike me and I marked the time-sheet 12 o'clock; when he had gone I erased this and entered 10.40, which was the time he had, in fact, arrived. The rule is for one man to ride on the dickey. I did not see Williams on the van at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before the coroner I said that I had timed pri<lb/>soner by my watch at 12 o'clock; this was untrue; prisoner was sitting beside me while I gave that evidence. (To the Court.) The horses were in a cold sweat; one seemed slightly lame. I cannot say what advantage it would be to prisoner to appear to have come in at 12 instead of 10.40, except it was to convince the firm that he had been farther on his rounds than he actually had been.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS NORTON</hi>, 43 K. On December 20 I saw prisoner at his house.

               <p>Street on that night. Prisoner being in bed, I asked him why he was laid up; he said, "I was returning home on Friday night or early Saturday morning, when I slipped on the steps leading from Plaistow railway station, and it was past 11 when I drove through Hubbard Street." On December 21 I again saw prisoner; I told him that the man I had been inquiring about the previous day had died. I cautioned him, and he made the following voluntary statement: "Between 10 and 10.30 p.m. on the 16th my horses ran away from the 'Globe' public-house, Mile End Road, and my name and address was taken by a constable there. After then I stopped at two public-houses and had drinks. It was half-past 11 when I went through Hubbard Street. I did not knock anyone down, to my knowledge, or I should have stopped. My offside horse having fell lame in White<lb/>chapel, I was returning empty; I was returning home alone."</p>

                  </hi>, clerk at Hempleman's, said it was a rule of the firm that only one carman should ride on a van. Prisoner had been in the firm's employ five or six years.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH MORRIS</hi>, 67 K, Coroner's Officer, was called to prove the deposition of prisoner at the inquest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Avory expressed a doubt as to whether it was not necessary to call the coroner himself to prove a deposition taken before him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham-Campbell referred to Archbold, page 441: "A deposition taken before a coroner may be proved by the coroner or by any person who can prove the coroner's and the witness's signature and that the witness was sworn," etc.; also. Coroners Act, 1887, sec. 4, ss. 2, sec. 5, ss. 3.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Avory (after the luncheon interval) said he found that he was not the only Judge who had expressed a doubt upon this point. In R. v. Bateman (4 Foster and Finlayson, 1068) Baron Martin said he would reserve the point if the prisoner were found guilty; but prisoner was acquitted. In R. v. Colmer (9 Cox. 506) the same learned Judge admitted the deposition. He (Mr. Justice Avory) thought that the deposition was admissible under the Coroner's Act, 1887.</p>
               <p>Witness said he was present at the inquest when prisoner gave evidence on oath. The coroner himself took down the deposition and the original (produced) was in his writing. The deposition was read over to prisoner and signed by him in witnesses's presence.</p>
               <p>Deposition read, as follows: "On the night of the 16th I went to work about 6.30 p.m. I proceeded on my round and got as far as Whitechapel. I found the offside horse, 'Teddy,' had gone lame in Whitechapel: I walked him to Holborn Viaduct and I found there that if I continued this pace I could not do my work, so I turned back. I walked him back to the 'Leaping-bar' in Aldgate; I had drinks there again. I first stopped at the 'White Horse' in Bow; then went to the 'Earl of Warwick' in Mile End; then to the 'Leaping-bar,' and then I returned there. I came down the road and went to the pub. on the left, I think the 'Black Boy.' I then came down the road as far as the 'Globe'; that is where my horses turned round and were stopped by the police. I asked the constable to take no notice, as no damage was done, because I was having a drink: he said, 'All right, jump on.' I came down towards home as far as 'Marsh Gate' tavern; there I had a drink. I jumped on the van and did not stop until I got to the foot of Crowe's Road Bridge, when I got off to make</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070085"/>
               <p>water. I came down Chapel Street from 'Marsh Gate' tavern, down Rokeby Street, turned the corner of Northam Street into Hubbard Street, into Manor Road, down Pond Road, into Manor Road under the archway, where I stopped. I do not know anything about knock<lb/>ing anybody down in Hubbard Street. I was the worse for drink. Nobody else was with me. I had no cap on when I came into the yard; it was on the tank; I hit my head against the beam in the alley<lb/>way of our works, which knocked the cap off. I have no recollection of any conversation with Ellis about being lame. I did not meet any<lb/>body in the public-houses I went to. I first discovered the horse was lame between the 'White Horse' and the 'Leaping-bar.' I left the works that night at 7; went to the 'White Horse,' Bow; got there at 7.30 to 7.40; stayed there a few minutes and went to the 'Earl of Warwick'; got there about 8; stayed a few minutes there; went to the 'Leaping-bar'; stayed there a few minutes; then went to Holborn Viaduct; I then turned back to the 'Leaping-bar' and got back about 9; then back to the 'Black Boy'; then pulled up at the 'Globe,' where the horses ran away. I then proceeded home; I stopped again at the 'White Horse' and at 'Marsh Gate' Tavern, and got home after 11. I did not see the time-sheet; I did not see Ellis look at his watch. I left the works at getting on to 12. I put the horses away; I asked Ellis to give me a hand. I do not remember much about it at all. It was about 1 o'clock on Saturday morning when I fell down the steps at Plaistow; I was alone at the time; I have sprained my knee. I pitched on the top of my knee-cap; did not hurt or cut myself anywhere; I was on the second step from the bottom; no one picked me up when I fell down. I was alone all the way in the van. I did not graze my leg. I may have told Ellis that I had struck it against the tank. I had been on the drink for five weeks. I do not know whether I put the horses away or not. I remember catching my head against the arch<lb/>way when driving. I was sitting on the dickey. The seat of the dickey is about 18 inches above the tank."</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SIMPSON KERR</hi>, West Ham Hospital. Evans was admitted at 1 a.m. on December 17; he was suffering from concussion of the brain; there were abrasions of the skin of the face and on each arm; there was a large bruise on the lower part of the back and a similar bruise on the front lower portion of the abdomen. I think the bruises were the result of a horse trampling on him, or they might be caused by a wheel going over him. He died on December 21. The post-mortem examination showed lividity on the back extending from the head downwards; on incising the situation of the bruises there was found to be extravasation, which proved them to be bruises, not the result of post-mortem lividity. On opening the chest I found a collection of fluid in each pleural cavity. The lung lobes were consolidated from pneumonia and there were other evidences that pneumonia had super<lb/>vened before death. I consider that the primary cause of death was shock, the secondary cause pneumonia.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He must have had pneumonia before he died, but I did not detect it before the post-mortem examination. The heart</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070086"/>
               <p>was feeble and irregular. I am satisfied that he had not pneumonia when he was admitted to the hospital. (To the Court.) Before the post mortem I came to the conclusion that the cause of death was shock following the accident; he never recovered from the shock before he died.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BURRELL</hi> proved arresting prisoner on the coroner's warrant; on being told he would be charged with man<lb/>slaughter prisoner said, "All right."</p>

On January 2, at 10.50 a.m., I saw prisoner at Liverpool Street Station, Arthur Peak being there. I said, "You are Mrs. Peak?" She said "Yes." I said, "Your husband here alleges that you have committed bigamy by marrying him in April last while your husband, Edwin James Crow, was alive, whom you married in or about September, 1908.' She said, "He is wrong, I was only living with Jim Crow. I never was married to him." I took prisoner to Forest Gate Police Station. She there said, "I would not tell you in front of him, I will tell you now. I am married to Jim Crow and he knows it—I have told him. He thought I was coming into some money. I was a good wife to him and he knows it. I told him the whole truth before we married." She was then charged. I subsequently obtained certificate (produced) showing the marriage with Crow took place on September 2, 1908.</p>

                  </hi>, Petty Officer, H.M.S. Ganges, stationed at Harwich. On Sunday, April 17, 1910, I met prisoner in a public-house at Chat<lb/>ham. I went home with her that night and on the following Saturday married her at St. Pancras Parish Church. We lived together for some time at various places. About four months after we were married she said, "You would be surprised if I told you I had been married four or five times." I said, "What do you mean?" "Oh, well," she said, "I have only been living with those men." I took my Christmas leave on December 29. I came home on December 30, when she men<lb/>tioned she had some friends of the name of Crow living at Chatham. I took her to Chatham to see them. As we were coming home she said she had been married four or five times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. After going home with prisoner on the first occa<lb/>sion she said she was coming into some money, and I was going to retire from the Service.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate. This man Peak knew that I was a married woman two days before I left Chatham to get married to him. On the Tuesday two days after I met Peak I was in my room where I was staying. Peak came to see me and we did not go out that night. My landlay made a fire for me in my bedroom. I said to him, "I will show you all the photographs and letters I have from different men," and I told him my life story. He said, "I pity you, and if you will promise me to be all that a wife should be I will make you a good husband." I said, "I am already married to James Crow." He then asked me who was Jim Crow; I said he was my husband, and that he could read the letters that he sent me. They were all written in lead pencil to me in the name of Mrs. Rogers. He read them and called Jim Crow all the scoundrels he could think of Then I gave him my marriage certificate, which he also read find handed me back, and told me to burn it lest people should see it.</p>

I was away until about 1900, when I returned to England, and I sent prisoner money for her to come home, which she did. We found we could not live together happily, and separated by mutual consent while in Portsmouth in 1901. I left the Navy in March, 1903, and went into hospital. I am suffering from consumption.

                  </hi>, 60a, Leytonstone Road, Stratford, tobac<lb/>conist. Prisoner came into ray shop at 6.20 p.m. on January 3. He asked for a packet of Woodbines and put down a florin. I gave him a shilling, a sixpence, and fivepence in bronze as change. As he went out of the shop I tested the coin and found it was counterfeit. He had then left. I followed him. I stepped into the road and saw him a little distance in front. I lost sight of him for about 30 yards. He then went into Thompson's, a tobacconist and newsagent. I also went in and asked Mrs. Thompson what he had asked for. She said, "A packet of Woodbines." I said, "What has he given you?" She pointed to a coin lying on the counter, which I picked up. This is the coin. I told him he had been in my shop and passed a bad coin on me. He said, "I have never been in the shop. That is the only coin I have, and that was given to me by Mr. Mitchell in the "Essex Arms" for helping him to carry a body." I said, "This one is a bad one, too." I sent a lad for a policeman and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Leytonstone Road is fairly busy at 6 p.m. People then are mostly coming up the road; prisoner was going down. There was a fair number of people between me and prisoner. From the time I saw him 30 yards off I did not lose sight of him. I did not see him give or throw anything away or speak to anybody. He had neither money nor Woodbines on him when he was searched at the station.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">MARY THOMPSON</hi>, 42, Leytonstone Road, £., tobacconist and newsagent. Prisoner came into my shop on January 3 about 6.30 p.m., and asked for a packet of Woodbine cigarettes. While I was getting them Mr. Jones came in. Mr. Jones's is about three minutes' walk. Prisoner had laid a 2s. piece on the counter. I think when Mr. Jones came in he said, "What did he ask for?" and I said, "A packet of Woodbines." He said to prisoner, "You gave me another coin of the same sort." Prisoner said he had never been in Mr. Jones's shop. I cannot identify the coins; I never touched them. They were handed to the constable in my shop.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE SIDEY</hi>, 630 E. On January 3, about 6.30 p.m., I was called to 42, Leytonstone Road. Prisoner, Mrs. Thomp<lb/>son, and Mr. Jones were there. Mr. Jones said, "This man has passed me a bad coin and I followed him into here and just caught him in the act of passing a second one." I said to prisoner, "You hear what this gentleman says? "Prisoner replied, "That is all the money I have got on me and that was given to me by Mr. Mitchell at the 'Essex Arms' for helping him to carry a body. You can search me if you like. This man has made a mistake. I have never been in his shop." When he was searched nothing was found on him. When charged he said, "I have never been in the man's shop." These are the coins Mr. Jones handed to me.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191102070090"/>
               <p>Mr. Mitchell, a coffin maker, of Lucas Street, Commercial Road, E. There were four of us helping to carry a coffin. At the end of the job a 2s. piece was given to one of the men who helped. He asked me if anybody had change. I felt in my pocket, gave the man 1s. 6d. and took the 2s. I was in the "Essex Arms" at the time. After I came out of there I went into Mrs. Thompson's for a packet of Wood<lb/>bines. The account that has been given of what passed there is correct. I had not been in Mr. Jones's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am a labourer. It is about 12 months since I did regular work. I only did that work for Mr. Mitchell that day. My sister gave me 2s. that day and I had 1s. 6d. on me in the "Essex Arms." I do not know why I did not buy the Woodbines in the "Essex Arms." I did not want them at the time. I do not know where Mrs. Jones's shop 1s. I do not know who the other three men are that Mr. Mitchell employed. He picked them up at the Leyton<lb/>stone Cemetery. I went there as a kind of mourner; I knew the party. After the service was read in the chapel we carried the body to the grave. I did not go down with the intention of getting a job.</p>

I knew all of them by sight. Only prisoner came to the funeral. I gave one of them a 2s. piece for the four of them in the "Essex Arms" a little after 6 p.m. I got the coin amongst others from the cemetery people in change.</p>

               <p>This case was heard at the January Sessions before Judge Lumley Smith, when the Jury disagreed (see page 304),. The evidence given at the former trial was now repeated and the following additional witnesses were called:</p>

                  </hi>, 3, Bailey Street, Camberwell. About three weeks or a month after he was arrested Arthur Cooper told me about the charge, and that was the first time I heard of it. I remember seeing him at the "Rockingham" and at the repository on the same day when he was arrested between 8 and 10 o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was in the neighbourhood all day. If he had been there before the time I have said, I should probably have seen him.</p>
