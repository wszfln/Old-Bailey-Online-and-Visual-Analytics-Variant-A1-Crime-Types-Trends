I went up stairs again a little after ten, and missed the two guinea piece. and three crown pieces: my husband was out, when he came home I told him, we went up to the prisoner's door and knocked, she opened the door, and we desired she would go with us into our servant's room to search; she did, we found nothing, then we search'd her room, finding nothing we charged the watch with her, and took her to the watch house; I went the next day to her, and told her, if she would tell me the truth, I would forgive her; she then told me she had the money I charged her with, which was the two guinea piece, and three crown pieces; but she said she did not know the value of the piece of gold, and that she flung the money away at the last turning before she came to the watchouse.</p>

               <p>Ann Potter. I am wife to the prosecutor, the prisoner came to our house on the 18th of Jan. in the evening, and asked me to lett him a little mare, that he said he had had before; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175305020005"/> he could not have that which he describ'd, (but don't remember he ever had her, or any one of us before;) but I told him he should have another; I went to the stable and shewed him one, he gave me a shilling earnest, and said he should come the next morning about eight o'clock; my husband works at a brew-house, he saddled her and hung the bridle ready before he went out; the prisoner came about half an hour after ten, and gave me the other 1 s. 6 d. and took the mare, and said he should be back again about two in the afternoon, he then said he had had a fall from a horse in St. James's-street, which had gave him a fear under one of his eyes, which I took particular notice of, by which I am sure he is the same person, he said he was going but into Long Lane, on the other side of the water, and could walk it in two hours, but he wanted a bit of a ride; he told me he liv'd at the King's-Arms, in St. James's-street; but I went afterwards to enquire, and found no such place in the street, we never saw the mare since.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the mare?</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these pieces, is this your master's tankard?</p>
               <p>Mulling.

On the 20th of April I came home, and was inform'd I had lost a large quantity of iron, and that Trow was stopp'd in Noble-street with it on his back, and he was had to a publick house, near mine. I went to him, there was Mr. Goodwin with him, he told me he stopp'd him in Noble-street; the iron was at his house. (Produced in court and deposed to.) I believe I lost much more than I have found. I have got about three or four hundred weight again, the prisoner confessed he had taken it, and seemed to be very sorry, and said he was persuaded to it. I had employed him in pulling down these houses where he had the iron, and had discharg'd him but the day before. He said also there were two other persons concerned with him: in consequence of this he was carried to the Compter. We tried to take

After carrying him to the Compter we found out his house with a great deal of difficulty, We asked his wife leave to go down into the cellar, to which she consented, and the constable went down stairs with a candle, there we found two bags of iron, which Trow had said they had taken away that morning, that is Stansley and Price. There was also a great many other things, which I knew to be my property, though I have not laid them in the indictment. Then we went to my Lord-Mayor and told him what we had found; he desired me to get Price before him to be examin'd. When he came there he told my Lord that Stansley and Trow had that morning call'd him up, I think a little after four o'clock; that they three went to this place of mine, and that he went with a great deal of reluctance. When they came to the door he believed either Trow or Stansley broke it open, he thought it was Trow, and he himself was on the other side of the way; and that the other two went up stairs, and brought down three bags; and that he took one and Stansley the other; that they both persuaded him to let them be at his house till after breakfast time, and promised they'd fetch them away; that they brought them, but as they came not for them, he threw them down into the cellar.</p>

               <p>Gyles Poulton. I have known him about a year and half, he has behaved like a gentleman: I believe this prosecution is carried on in a malicious manner, on account of his insisting that all publick monies should be brought and accounted for in a publick vestry. The prisoner has behaved as a good husband, a tender father to his children, and a good master; he has improved the estate above a hundred a year.</p>

She said, indeed I have not. Then he came in, and swore he'd beat her; he offered several blows at her, but did not hurt her; she got up and stood against a chair; he gave her a blow on the side of her face, whether his hand was open or shut, I know not; she took up her apron and held it to her face: I said, don't both back-beat and belly-beat your wife; she cried, he used me with many ill words, and said, d - n your eyes, you have nothing to do with it; and said to her d - n your eyes pull off that pocket, or I'll murder you; she took a pair of scissars off the table, and rip'd her pocket off, and slung it down; he did not touch it; she said, good God what would you have, I have not a farthing in my pocket ; she then sat down in the chair, and seemed ready to saint ; I said, will you have any water; he said, d - n you, you bitch, I had rather see you dead than alive, die and be d - n'd. Then he ran and took her about the back of her neck with one hand, with the other under her chin, as if going to kiss her: I went to put the pot to her mouth to drink some water, her teeth would not go together, her tongue was between, I saw her eyes stare in her face, she could not swallow, he held her head as if hugging her so all the while. He took the pot out of my hand, when she did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175305020014"/> not swallow, he held one hand at the back of her neck all the time. During all this time I thought he was kissing her. When he held her so, her eyes stared; I said, you Judas son of a bitch, you have murdered your wife; her limbs gave a jerk, and she never stirr'd hand nor foot any more, as I saw. This I made a deposition of before the coroner. He said she was subject to fits, and bid me give him the pot; he tried to power the water into her mouth. She fetched her breath till two o'clock in the morning, and this was between two and three the afternoon before: she remain'd in my house all the time. He tried to give her drops, but could not get it down; he poured hartshorn into her mouth, but that did not move her.</p>

She did not speak, and I apprehend she could not; she breathed freely, and I did not apprehend she was a dying woman; there was some talk of drinking, I imagin'd something of that sort might be the cause, and that she was asleep.

            . I am a surgeon, at the time the coroner sat on this body, I was sent for to view it, and found the skin a little discolour'd, just below the ear, upon the neck; upon farther enquiry by opening the parts, I did not find any thing that appeared to occasion her death from that part; upon which the jury adjourned, that we might make a farther enquiry. I was call'd upon again, this day fortnight, and another surgeon was sent for, and upon opening the head, and examining the upper part of the brain, we found the brain extended, and a quantity of coagulated blood: we both concluded that that was the cause of her death, without paying any regard to the blow, and which we apprehend was occasioned by suffocation or strangling, which caused the bursting of the blood vessels in the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the evidence given by the woman, do you think by the description she has given, whether or no this usage might occasion her death.</p>
               <p>Edwards. From the circumstances it seems to correspond with it.</p>
               <p>Q. If strangling was the cause of her death, could she bleed two or three hours after.</p>
               <p>Edwards. She might bleed whilst she was warm.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person so suffocated breathe freely as mentioned.</p>
               <p>Edwards. These vessels bursting in the brain might be some time in spewing out the blood. There was the quantity of a turkey's egg-shell full of blood. They may breathe strong at the first, but in time will breathe shorter.</p>

I fetched some water, and pour'd some down her throat; after that I sent for some sweet oil and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175305020015"/> some wine, and fed her with it. Then I got some drops, and stroked her temples, and thought to have brought her to again. She has had many children by me; I should be a rogue indeed, to go to put her out of the world. I never touched her throat, no more than I do this minute. I sent for Mr. Darkin, he bled her.

             would have turned her out of the door, in that condition, and some of the neighbours were much put to it, to persuade her to let her be there. My wife used to have something come up in her throat, I believe it was the rising of the lights; she used to be much affrighted about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Edwards. Will this occasion a breaking of the blood vessels.</p>
               <p>Edwards. I have known persons in fits to have blood come from their mouth and nose, but I never knew the vessels to burst, except it was apoplectic.</p>

I told him he'd loose by that, and said, I would either buy it, or get him a chap for it: I suspected it was not honestly come by, and therefore went immediately and got a warrant from Justice Manly. I took Mr. Tomb, the constable, with me, and we told the prisoner he was a Jew, and would buy it, if he had the body, but it was not worth while to buy that alone. Then he went with us into a room in Angel-court, St. James's ; there he took the body of the tankard from off a place, among some old rags. Then we discovered our intent, and took him before the justice. The prisoner said there, he bought it in Holland for 10 l. 15 s. at a place called Bushey, in Brahant.

I then suspected the prisoner, and went in pursuit of him to Smithfield: the turnpike man told me my mare was taken up, and put into Mr. Baker's grounds at Paddington, and that he saw a man go by with a lamb on his head, and a saddle on his back, who had told him. his horse had thrown him: the prisoner was taken up, and he confessed the taking the things mentioned, to me and Mr. Brown, and that one Barker was concerned with him, who, after he had given him the lamb before him on horseback, got up behind him ; that they rode as far as Tyburn, when he took the lamb and saddle on his back, and did not know what was become of the mare and Barker; he own'd also he had sold the lamb to a pork butcher for 5 s. at an ale-house in the pork-market, Leaden-hall ; then he told me he carried the saddle to one Mr. Linch, a baker, in the Mint-square, Southwark. We took him after this to justice Fielding, where he confessed he had taken the mare, in order to carry the lamb away, and Barber was to bring her back again; and that he had sold the lamb, and left the saddle at Mr. Linch's; I went to Mr. Linch, there I found the saddle; I also found the man that bought the lamb, and he deliver'd the skin, which I don't swear to, but believe it to be mine.</p>

The prosecutor came to me, I told as I have here: the prisoner owned before me at the New Prison, that he stole it from Mr. Finch at Wilsdon.</p>

The prisoner having lived at a relation's of mine, had been often at my house, and came again on Good Friday in the morning, between nine and ten, with a saddle ; he said Mr. Underwood (with whom he lived) had lost his saddle and he was desired to get him another; and that Mr. Underwood desired him to leave it at my house; and that I was to give him 3 s. 6 d. which I did, and got him to sign a little bit of a note that he had received the money. I had no mistrust, had he asked for more I should have let him had it. The saddle produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

She went to enquire after her, and brought word she had heard the prisoner was all new cloath'd, and had a great deal of money about her, and was at Lambeth. I went there to her aunt's, and could not see her; but coming away I saw the prisoner near her aunt's house with 40 or 50 after her. I took hold on her, she said, dear master don't send me to gaol, I know 'tis in your power. I asked what she had done with the money; she said, take me from this mob, and I'll tell you. I took her into an alehouse, where she gave me my purse with twenty guineas in it, and said, she had laid out the rest in cloaths, and own'd she took it. I took her before justice Clark, who committed her for farther examination. I went the next morning and brought her before justice Fielding, where she would not speak, so the justice said silence gives consent, so he committed her.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. It was one Sunday morning, he gave it to me, to carry it to the pawnbroker, Mr. Price, at Dick's-Shore, and I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I live at Mr. White's, an Apothecary at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How near does Mr. White live to Mr. Gilbert's ?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. About two stones cast off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you, when you saw the prisoner take this bowl?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I stood and looked through the window at the time; the prisoner and I had been out together that morning; he went in, and bid me stay without; and brought it and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go out about that morning?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What use was he to make of you?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I don't know; he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go directly to the pawnbroker's with it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. No, I carried it home, and kept it there about an hour and half, till he came; then carried it to the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was this done in?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I believe it was in February.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out in the morning?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. Between five and six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you carry it to the pawnbrokers?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you lent you upon it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I asked two shillings, and he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. No, he did not; he asked me no questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you before?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pawned things there before?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I had, for my aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to keep open shop, on Sunday mornings ?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>Q. From between five and six, to the time he took the bowl, what were you doing?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. We walked up and down in Shadwell ; he went in there, just as Mr. Gilbert was up, and had open'd the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he go in for?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He went in for a penny-worth of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bid you hide it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He bid me carry it under my coat; which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this bowl the same, that is here produced?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. It is; for I fetched it again, with Mr. Cock the constable, I asked for the bowl, that I brought on the Sunday morning; and he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you carried it, that you fetched it again?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I think I fetched it the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name did you put it?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I put it in in my own name; and the prisoner's name; so the pawnbroker wrote it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you before ?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Gilbert. Did you see the prisoner in your house, that Sunday morning you lost the bowl?</p>
               <p>S. Gilbert. My husband was up, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this lad that gives evidence, do you know him?</p>
               <p>S. Gilbert. The prisoner has been married to his mother about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gwilliam. How long have you lived with Mr. White?</p>
               <p>Gwilliam. I lived with the prisoner, and my mother, at the time of his taking this bowl; I went to Mr. White, since the prisoner has been in confinement.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gibbons. I think the prisoner brought this spoon on Monday the 19th of March to pawn; he wanted 6 s. on it; I asked him whose it was; he said it was his own; I asked him if he had any more; he said he had three; I asked him who he bought them of; he told me Mr. Johnson, a Pawnbroker, and that he gave 9 s. a piece for 'em. I weighed it, it weighed 2 ounces, then I said, I hoped the others were a great deal bigger than this, if he gave that money for them; he said they were a great deal bigger (and this was worth much more than nine shillings, I was satisfied he had not bought them for that money); so I said I would stop it: he told me his name was

The prisoner had lodged in my house four years, a little before last Christmas ; on the 5th of Feb. he went away; I was sick in my bed ; my wife went away on the 7th of Feb. and I never saw her after, till she came to justice Fielding's : the prisoner came home on the 10th, to his lodgings as usual, he lay there all night; the next morning he came down stairs and told me he had packed up two bundles, and had put his foul linnen in his box; and that he would keep his lodgings on as before; and bid me take my sheets, and get them washed; he sent for the two bundles on the 15th, and on the 20th, he sent a note, by

               <p>Temple. That I don't know ; the prisoner had the key of the room last.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Temple. Because when we went into the room, there was no key in the door, and it was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to leave the key in his box ?</p>

            . I was at the door, opposite the prosecutor's house in the Ship-Yard, near Temple-bar, on the 24th of February; he call'd me in, and desired me to go up stairs, and see this box broke open, saying, he had a great suspicion of some of his goods being there. I, Mr. Corbet, and the constable, went with him, and with a chizel he broke open the top of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box lock'd?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was: we took a catalogue of the goods which he said was his property: it is here in my hand, the goods here produced are the very goods. I remember in particular two fine large smocks: they were packed up in the room, and the constable took the key, after which Mr. Temple went and got a warrant.</p>

            . I am the constable, I was by when Mr. Temple broke open the box in his house, and these goods here produced were taken out: I have had them in my custody ever since. He produced a letter. This letter the prisoner owned to be his hand-writing before Mr. Fielding. It is read to this purport :</p>
               <p>Directed to Mr. Statchman.</p>
               <p>'' I desire the favour of you to go to Temple's, '' tell him to let you have my box and glass, and '' the remainder of my things, and pay him 4 s. '' 6 d. for one week's lodging, that being all I '' owe him; and let my things stay at your house '' till I come to town, put the pint pots in your '' cellar, or any where that suits you. I shall not '' be in town to stay this good while, so 'tis not '' worth while to keep a lodging in town, and in '' so doing you'll oblige your's,</p>

            . I am a house painter, so is the prisoner, he was doing work for me at Richmond lodge, he had been at work for me the two last summers and all this spring; he has been trusted in many places of consequence at Richmond, Hampton-Court, Mr. Pel ham's, &amp;c. under me. If he had been a person of that disposition, he had it in his power to have done great mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of him as to his honesty?</p>
               <p>Abbot. I have a very good opinion of his honesty, he is a very sober honest man, I would trust him with untold gold: the woman told justice Fielding she was sorry she should be guilty of so rash an action, to put any thing into an innocent man's box. I was bail for the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Then how can you come here to justify a man that can suffer a woman to put things into his box, and after that he sent for it as his property, to be delivered by her husband to him?</p>
               <p>Abbot. I believe the prisoner to be no ways guilty of the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he never knew of the goods being put into his box.</p>
               <p>Abbot. I cannot know any thing of that, I speak of his behaviour to me, and what the woman said before justice Fielding.</p>

            . I am one of the hostlers at the George inn, in the Borough, I took in a little black horse, that the prisoner took into the inn upon, on the Monday before Christmas day; the prisoner said he must have him taken good care of, for he had come forty miles that night. I belonging to another stable, told him the man that belonged to that stable would be there in two or three minutes. He said he must take him out and go elsewhere, for he could not stay; so he was in a hurry to have him out again, and took out a wrong horse, which was Mr. Cocks's.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was Mr. Cock's house, and how high?</p>
               <p>Edwards. It was a bay horse, about fourteen hands high. I stopp'd the horse, and put him in again, and told him it was not his horse. Then the prisoner walked up the yard and would not have his house then I went to my stable. After this Mr. Cock's horse and the prisoner was gone, and the prisoner's black horse was left.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What time did I come in that morning ?</p>
               <p>Edwards. About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>B. Jones. About the eighteenth of December last; at night, the prisoner, came to my house, the Ship and Dragon at Barnet, on a bay horse about 14 hands and a half high : I apprehended him on suspicion of robbing the Darby waggon. I went to St. Athan's and fetch'd the box that had been stole out of the waggon, which was found in the field. The prisoner was sent to St. Athan's goal. I read the advertisement on the 19th, of a horse being last, which answered to the horse the prisoner rode. I let Mr. Cock know of it, he came and swore to it, as his property. The prisoner sent a note to me from goal, to deliver his horse to the constable, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house in Middlesex or in Hertfordshire ?</p>
               <p>Jones. My house is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Joseph Buckle. I carried the prisoner to St. Alban's goal, the horse was delivered to me by Mr. Jones, it was a bay horse about thirteen or fourteen hands high: Mr. Cock came and swore to him.</p>

            . I live at the Dolphin at Holloway, the prisoner came to my house with a boy behind him, the Monday before Christmas about three o'clock in the afternoon; he asked me if I could write, I said I was busy in attending upon some of the Birmingham waggons. He put his boy into a Birmingham waggon, at my door; he was on a bay gelding, about fourteen hands high. My wife wrote a letter for him. He said he was going to sea that night, and that he wanted to dispose of his horse, and asked me if I would buy him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, ask that witness if he did not offer to go with me to Gravesend, and to buy the horse.</p>
               <p>Farney. The prisoner would have had me to have gone with him to Gravesend, and bought the horse; and brought him home from thence :</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going on board a ship, I came up from Gravesend, to put out my little boy into the country; I came all night on the Monday night; the captain told me he should fail away on Tuesday at two o'clock. I rode my horse into the inn in the Borough, and called for the hostler ; I did not think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175305020027"/> to bring my boy any farther than Friday-street, to the waggon. After I put the horse up, I called for the hostler, seeing the horse had the bridle in his mouth, and they did not offer to shut the stable door, I saw they took no care to seed him, although I desired them. I said, bring him out again, I don't care he should be used so. I went into the kitchen, the girl said the hostler was not there, a man came to the stable to me when I had got one out, and said that is not your horse (it was very dark) he turn'd that horse back into the stable again. After that I seeing him neglected, I called the hostler again, he did not appear, I went into the stable again, and by mistake brought out the wrong horse. My horse was as good a horse as that. I had my boy to send down to Birmingham to my father. I went with him so far.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Did you see a boy with the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, my lord, not till I came to St. Alban's, there was a boy came down stairs at the inn where the waggon was that belong'd to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Farney. Which way did the prisoner come when he came to your house with the boy?</p>
               <p>Farney. He came from Highgate, and my house is between there and London</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he go from your house?</p>
               <p>Farney. He went away towards London, and took up a man behind him, and he staid in Woods-close.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The horse I brought to the Borough, was my own horse, about thirteen hands high ; I did not know I had the wrong horse, till I came on that side London, it being dark; so I thought I might go on to carry my boy to the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cock. He had also my bridle, saddle, and saddle cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the black horse of the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Cock. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the difference as to their value ?</p>
               <p>Cock. Mine was above 4 l. better than his.</p>

The goods produced in Court, and deposed to. The father was taken up, he confessed he had the saucepan to beat out a bruise, and the boy said his father ordered him to take these things from me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>E. Brown. A flower'd cotton gown, one linnen gown strip'd; one camblet petticoat, one black hat, one scarlet cloth cloak, a pair of leather shoes, a pair of green worsted stockings, and one cap; they were all in the room where I lodg'd, and over night we lock'd and bolted the door within side, which was about ten o'clock: several of the things I had worn the day before, and I pull'd them off, and laid them on the chair. I arose between six and seven, the door stood open, and she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the key?</p>
               <p>Brown. That was left on the inside of the door?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her go out?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, I did not; we took her on Shrove-Tuesday: I went to St. Alban's after her, and at the house where she had lodged, I found my necklace on a child's neck; but that I did not lay in the indictment: she was taken before my lord-mayor. She confessed at the Magpye and Sun, facing the New-market, Holborn, that she had sold my strip'd gown, at a sale-shop in Market-street, about eight miles beyond St. Alban's, for 4 s. 6 d. and that she had sold my purple and white gown in a barn at Barnet to a traveller for 2 s. she would not tell where she sold the rest of the things, but said she took them all, and went out at six in the morning.</p>

There came a woman in a great hurry, the 26th of December, and told me my daughter was robb'd of all her things, except her shift and cap; her mother carried her things to put on. We found the prisoner was apprentice to one Steward, in Blue-Anchor Alley, we went there, and was told, it was supposed she was gone for St. Alban's: we advertised the things lost. On the 6th of March my wife and I going to dine out, we met with her in Field-lane, and my wife asked her if her name was not Mary Brown; she said no, her name was Betty; but by her Face it appeared to be her. We took her in at the sign of the Magpye at Holborn-bridge, where she confessed she took the things, and went out about six o'clock in the morning; that she sold one gown to a woman at Barnet in a barn, and the other to a shopkeeper at Market street for 4 s. 6 d. she would give no account of the rest.

            . At the time this robbery was committed, I knew the prisoner Barber and Briant, and being constable of St. John's, Wapping, I saw Robertson about four or five in the afternoon of a Sunday, the last day of the old year, I have seen him out several times after twelve o'clock, as if he was a thieving, and have had him in custody two or three times for riots and assaults. There had been two or three gentlemen robb'd, one a captain of a ship that liv'd by Shadwell church, who was cut; for it was a common way to knock people down before they spoke to them to stop: there was a proctor's clerk robb'd, and his finger cut, which made us suspect these men. This robbery was on the Sunday night, and on the Monday morning the thief-catchers were about; they said they had got Briant and Barber, and wanted Robertson, whom I had seen just before go down the lane. Barber was then admitted an evidence before Sir

Some time after the prisoner came to a publick house, of which I had notice, so went to him and tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him if he knew me; he said he never saw me before; I charged him with taking the things away, and he held down his head and owned it. I went to Mr. Cross, and told him the prisoner confessed to us he had sold the silver mug in Pulteney-street for 2 l. 13 s. and that he had sold and pawned the other things.</p>

               <p>Justice Fielding said to this woman, he was surprised she should buy a silver mug of such a fellow as I; she said I was dressed a great deal better when I came there with it, but I was in the same cloaths, and the y made me say things that I did not like, I wanted to get out of their company. Mr. Cross said he'd do this and the other. I never was in any house, and know nothing of the things. I have lived with my lord primate of Ireland, who allows me 20 guineas a year. My father lives but at Kingston-upon-Thames.</p>

As I drew up near them I called, hollo ; the man along with the prisoner, who was taller than he is, call'd, hollo; I had a basket on my head, the other man rushed up against me, and asked me how much money I had got in all; I made answer, the d - l a jack; he said, let me have Jack, let me have Gill, he'd have all I had got. The prisoner said, money we want, and money we must have. One of them was on my right hand, and the other on my left. I had seen the prisoner on that road more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light, or dark night?</p>
               <p>Molye. It was star light, no moonshine; the other man took three half crowns from me and some halfpence; he said to Kettle, do you take the money, Kettle held my basket all the time; then the other man said, let us tie him and toss him into the ditch, then he will not follow us; so Kettle took my garters from my legs and gave them to the other man, and they bound my hands; gentlemen, said I, you have got my money, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175305020033"/> have no occasion to use me ill; then the other man said, d - n him, let him go, so they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your hands tied then?</p>
               <p>Moloye. Yes, they were, I untied them with my teeth, and took up my basket; as I was taking up my basket the other man came back and asked me how much money I had got. This made me suspect they were jealous of each other; I told him I did not know how much money I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you untied your hands then?</p>
               <p>Moloye. No, I had not, they were got about ten yards from me; then they went towards Newington, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Moloye. I did not see him till after he was taken up; I had described him.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Moloye. The next morning to a fishman that knew me, and bought fish with me that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Moloye. He goes by the name of Irish Tom.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his answer?</p>
               <p>Moloye. He said, tell no person of it till you take the prisoner, then people will believe you.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here?</p>
               <p>Moloye. No, because I have no money to subpoena him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Moloye. He was taken up upon my description by Long Charles and some others, they had got him in Kingsland Road; when I came into the house, there were a great many, four or five of them were asleep; I said, awake that man in the corner, let me see his face, and I'll tell you whether he is the man or not; he looked in my face, I knew him, and swore before justice Chamberlain, that is the man that was in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the other, do you think?</p>
               <p>Moloye. I should if I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Moloye. I have.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Moloye. I have by times as I go the road backwards and forwards with carts about his master's business.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you given evidence about highway robberies.</p>
               <p>Moloye. I never was robbed but once before, and then I was drunk and did not know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober this time ?</p>
               <p>Moloye. I was, I was not drunk, drinking I had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the road was this robbery?</p>
               <p>Moloye. I was robbed facing the Cock.</p>

               <p>Q. How near to Enfield? </p>
               <p>Moloye. About eight miles from Enfield church ; it is a little way from Kingsland turnpike.</p>

            . I received two letters from the prisoner, at two different times, and carried them to Mr. Wharton's a Woollen-draper, and delivered them to Mr. Leise the servant, and had goods back with me, it was cloaths both times, but I can't tell the quantity, and I delivered the cloaths both times to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, not to my knowledge; he came to me by the corner of St. James's-street, where I stand as a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these letters sealed up?</p>
               <p>Jones. They were, and directed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these letters, are these the two you carried?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't write nor read, so can't tell that.</p>

               <p>Leise. I have. He is shewed the first letter or order.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this his hand writing?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you then to deliver the cloth according to its direction then?</p>
               <p>Leise. On its expressing the blue cloth so particular, that he had last July, I thought it must come from him, and he might be out of the way, and his wife or somebody else might write in his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the porter bring the two letters to you?</p>
               <p>Leise. He did, I believe them to be both one man's writing, but not Mr. Tomlinson's.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How came you to find out Michael Jones to come to give evidence here?</p>

            . I am a watchman in Grace-church-street, on the last day of April between 11 and 12 at night, the prisoner was coming by me, and just as he pass'd me he let a pocket full by my foct : I said, you have dropped something here, so he came back and took it up; but as he was stooping I saw the tankard shine under his apron. I asked him what, he had got there, he would not tell me, so I put my hand upon it, and felt it was a pot. I said I would see what he had there, he said I should not, so I took him by the collar, and got hold on the handle and pull'd it away. I asked him how he came by it, he said he found it in the Borough. I took him in one hand, and the tankard in the other, and led him to the constable of the night, where one of the watchmen said, after looking upon it, he knew the people it belonged to, so he and I went to the prosecutor's house, and asked her if she had lost a tankard; she said, yes, that it was marked A K, and had never a lid; she went with me, and describ'd it to the constable. The tankard produced in court, and depos'd to.</p>

I told her there was nobody there when we came away, but the man in a red coat (meaning the prisoner), and that he talk'd of going to Kent-street to see for a two penny lodging, so they went there to enquire.</p>
