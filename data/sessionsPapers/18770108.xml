I carry on business at 38, Southampton Buildings—in January, 1876, the prisoner applied to me to purchase a piano, a harp, and an harmonium—I went with him to Brixton to see the pianoforte, and then to Magdala Terrace, Dulwich, where I saw an harmonium and a harp those three articles were afterwards delivered at my place, and next day the prisoner came there and I gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was an absolute purchase Mr. Leatherdale, the trustee, brought an action against me, and I gave up the goods after I found that I had no proper right to hold them.</p>

He contended that the fad of its being an affidavit used in the course of legal proceedings was an important element of objection, as it would not admit of contradiction or cross-examination at the time it was used, and it was therefore deprived of the protection which would be accorded to a mere statement; he had never before heard a matter of this kind contended for, and he submitted that it was not evidence.

"I really cannot distinguish this from an ordinary case of a letter which is brought to the knowledge of a person who has read and considered it, and who deals with particular parts of it. As to those particular parts, it is quite clear they could not be excluded, and I do not see how one part can be excluded and the other part admitted. I think the whole must be admitted, at the same time the Jury must be told that they are not to take it as evidence of facts stated which are not dealt with by the defendant.</hi>" I have the original affidavit sworn on 30th January, 1875, and 16th February.

I am a solicitor, of 5, Jermyn Street, St. James's—Mr. James Passmore, chemist, of 82, King's Road, Chelsea, is a client of mine—on 26th November he came to me about purchasings business—he came a second time with a letter—on 27th November Budget and Brown called together at my office; they had previously made an appointment—Brown produced the lease of the premises—47, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, also an assignment on parchment of one Griffith to Appleby—they are not here, they were either left at the police-court or they are at my office; if they are there I can fetch them—Brown did not produce a memorandum of deposit of the bill of sale; he told me that he had a memorandum of deposit; I did not ask him to produce it then, but I did ask him to produce the bill of sale; he said he had it not with him; I asked him why, and he handed me some document which showed me that an interpleader was going on; it was a receipt for money paid into Court—on looking at that I said if there was no difficulty about it, Appleby and Brown could make a title together, but I should want Appleby present—Budgett replied that he would not attend—I said "Then you need not go any further; you need not put my client to any further expense"—I said to Brown if he had a legal mortgage we could have done without Appleby—they then left and I did not expect to see them again that day, because I insisted on Appleby being present to execute any deed that might be wanted—I don't think Brown said anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080013"/>
               <p>when I said if he had a legal mortgage we could have done without Appleby—Budget assured me, in Brown's presence, that there was no chance of Appleby being bankrupt, and it was that which brought up my remark that in that case we could take a title from Brown without Appleby—I asked how much was owing; I don't recollect what Brown said, but it was at least 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than Passmore was to have given—later in the day, about 3 o'clock, Brown and Budgett came—to my office, quite contrary to my expectation, and brought the bill of sale—Passmore was with me in my private office, and I went to them in the clerks' office, where Brown handed me this bill of sale, dated 2nd July, 1874, that was the date outside, I did not look within—I took it into my private office and was proceeding to make some extracts when my clerk brought in a message that Brown wanted to see me—I then went into the clerks' office to Brown and he said he could not wait any longer, and he did not intend me to make extracts from it; I said "Then if you will not allow me to do it, you must send me an abstract in the usual way," and I gave him the bill of sale back—he said he was trying to oblige me—I said I supposed he was wanting to sell the place; he said he did not care about it; I said if it went on he must send me the abstract in the usual way—at that time no other document than the bill of sale was produced—on 4th December Budget left the bill of sale in my absence, and on 5th December Brown called alone, he then said that he had a legal mortgage—I said I should proceed no further with the business until I had a copy of both legal and equitable mortgages—he did not say anything to that, he went away, he did not say whether or not he would send them—on 8th December I received a copy of the legal mortgage with two equitable mortgages—these are them, they were either left at the police-court or are at my office—I don't know how they came to me; I know that they did come to my office by the entry in my diary—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the documents, copies of which were sent to me. (<hi rend="italic">These three documents were put in and read, the first was dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and was a memorandum of deposit by Appleby to Brown of the lease of</hi> 47, <hi rend="italic">Mortimer Street, as security, witnessed by Budget; the second was a legal mortgage, dated November</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1874; <hi rend="italic">and the third dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st December</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">was a mortgage from Appleby to Brown.</hi>) On 5th December I first heard of the legal mortgage—I had never heard of the other two documents—I saw Budget on or about 10th December, and after Borne conversation with him Brown called again; he then inquired how the matter stood; I replied that I had heard of bankruptcy proceedings being taken against Appleby, and that I could not go on any further with it until they were got rid of, that if they were got rid of my client would resume negotiations at some future time if he had not already met with some other business—I don't think I saw him again before 21st December; he then called and told me that Appleby had been adjudicated bankrupt and asked for the copies that he had sent me, which I then returned, having previously had copies made of them—after the bankruptcy I acted for Mr. Passmore in purchasing the business from the trustee—I don't recollect what was given for it; if I have to fetch the other documents I can bring the deed with me—my experience of stamps is not that the document of 6th November is the only paper on which the stamp was impressed on the paper before it was written on that—the documents of 27th April and 1st December had their stamps impressed on them after being written; we know that you may buy impressed stamps,</p>

               <p>in fact stationers generally keep them in stock, impressed as this is, unless there has been any recent alteration—it does not follow that this was stamped before it was executed—when I was examined before I thought the red stamp was put on after the paper was written, but I have found since that I am continually sending documents to be stamped, and I find that these pink stamps are put on them before they are executed—up to a certain amount they stamp the documents while the persons wait, and they have a pink stamp similar to this—the date is put on whether the stamp is put on before or after execution, showing the day they are stamped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder; I have known Brown about three years—on 6th November, 1874, I saw him at Peckham Eye, by appointment—I first saw him at the Vivian Hotel—Budget was with him—I complained to Brown of his bringing him; I asked why he brought him—he said that Budget and Appleby had been up to his house in the Brecknock Road to do some business that morning, to pay him some money, and that he had after wards met with him in the Holloway Road, and he could not then get rid of him—Brown had come down for my brother to sign a mortgage—after we left the Vivian Hotel, going down the Eton Road, Budget said to Brown "Now, Mr. Brown, what is it that Appleby owes you, is it not" 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Oh, yes; that's about it, anything you like; you have had your answer"—Budget had some bank notes in his hands, I believe to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I could not say positively, but he had several notes, he was flourishing them about, and Brown snatched them away from him, and handed them to me, and I merely said "Good morning, Mr. Budget" and I put them in my pocket, and ran into the buildings there, just for a lark, for a few minutes—at a later period of the day, I was at Anderton's Hotel with Brown and Budget—Budget again asked him, as he had at Peckham, what the amount was, whether it was not 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or what it was that it was owing—Brown replied "You have had your answer to-day already"—while at Peckham, Brown mentioned that Mr. Brain and Mr. Budget had been at variance, but he said he had nothing to say against Appleby and Budget, that they had paid him honourably so far as they had got, or words to that effect—I think Brown said that Appleby and Budget had paid 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning in bills, not in cash—Budget was the one that mentioned the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't remember being at 66, Ludgate Hill, that</p>

I have an old stamp," or an old bill stamp, or something to that effect, to Mr. Brown, that was after I had offered to let them have the old stamp I had if it was of any service, as it was no use to me—all I know is that I heard a something about their being got out, and the only way they could be got out was by an old stamp or something; I can't say who said that, whether it was Brown or Brain—Brown said that he had made 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of one old stamp, that was when I offered my old stamp—Brown thanked me, and said he had got some, and had sold one for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard Appleby's name mentioned, and something about the brokers, I really can't tell you what it was; it was a broken conversation—it was a very long room—I was sitting near the door, and Brown and Brain were at the other end of the room, and since I had a cold, I have been a little deaf—I heard a portion of the con<lb/>versation; I heard the brokers or sheriff mentioned—I heard nothing else particular that I remember—I don't know that I heard anything more—<hi rend="italic">I.</hi> won't pledge myself to it; it does not strike me just at present; if you will ask me anything I will try and remember—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Gossett Street, Bethnal Green—I first knew the prisoner about eighteen months ago or a little more, and from time to time discounted bills for him—he represented them—to be all trade bills—I discounted for him these three bills of March 2nd, 14th, and 25th, drawn by him and accepted by Graham—he said that they were trade bills and that the acceptor, Mr. Graham, was an outfitter of Windsor, and a very respectable man—I presented this one which is for 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the London and County Bank, London, and had it returned; I did not present the others—the prisoner carries on business at Hedge's Grove, South Hackney, his bill heads call him a canteen contractor appointed by Government—I wrote to Mr. Graham and got my letter back in seven or eight days, marked "Not known."</p>

               <p>bill drawn by Hatch, but I will not swear I have not—I do not know perfectly well that I have—I never knew that Hatch had absconded and let the prisoner in for a large amount of money—I have unfortunately seen the prisoner a number of times since—I know Mr. Barron, his solicitor; I have not spoken to him about Hatch absconding—I did not say that Freans, the biscuit people, would prosecute him—I could not see the prisoner after the bills were returned, he absconded; I saw the woman he was cohabiting with at Charlton, and I saw his wife at Eccles Road—I have not offered to take 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from his wife directly she gets a legacy under her grandmother's will; but she said to me that if, I would not prosecute her husband, when she got her legacy she would pay me—I dare say I saw her the day after the bills were returned, thinking to see Mr. Taylor; she did not make the offer then, but she did within a few weeks afterwards—I did not take out a warrant till last week, because I left it in the hands of my solicitor—it was not a little bit on account of the expected legacy—I never expected to get a farthing—I do not think I waited so long as seven months—I took the warrant out some time before Christmas—I waited all that time because I did not know where he was—I will swear that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was not because I expected to get my money from Mrs. Taylor—I did not offer to do anything for them and their children, I have six children of my own—the signature to both these cheques produced is the prisoner's—I dare say the acceptances may be in a totally different writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister—I recollect Mr. Hannan calling at our house in Islington on 8th February last—he asked if I had been told of the arrangements that had been come to about my brother's defalcations—I said that I had not heard—he said it was very serious, and the sum was over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that there were other serious offences, such as tearing leaves out of the books—he said also "We have taken a bill of sale on the furniture for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and have two life policies for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he is now going about all to-day to find two sureties in 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, making 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I asked "Do you mean to say if he obtains these securities there will be no prosecution," and he said "I am justified in saying so;" in the result I gave him a bill of exchange for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote to Messrs. Malvin on the 10th, saying "I am willing to assist my brother as far as lies in my power, provided the arrangements are satisfactory, meaning the arrangements that Mr. Hannan had told me of, that there would be no prosecution, and that he would be continued in his situation—I afterwards received a telegram from Mr. Hannan, "Send your accep<lb/>tance for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did so and Messrs. Malvin hold it still—I fully under<lb/>stood a general condonation was to be given, and I regarded the matter as settled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, living at 4, Bloomfield Street, Poplar-prior to Tuesday, 19th December last, I had been staying with a man named Francis Allen, a seafaring man—about 1 o'clock that morning I was in bed with Allen, at 14, Bloomfield Street, the prisoner came into the room, he broke open the room door, and the door downstairs as well—I believe he was the worse for drink; Allen was quite sober—the prisoner first struck me as I was in bed—Allen, who was lying against the wall, got up in the bed and said he could not see me struck, and with that the prisoner struck him in the face and pulled him out of bed on to the floor on his back, and struck him several times and fell a-top of him—Allen did not strike him, he had not time to do so; as he fell he must have struck his head on the chamber, I did not see him do so, I was so excitable—there was a lamp on the sideboard in the room—the chamber was on the washing stand by the side of the bedstead, it was quite sound before; the prisoner came in; after the struggle it was broken all to pieces, I did not observe any blood on it—there was blood on Allen's face, he ran down stairs in his shirt, and I got his clothes together and ran down after him in my petticoat—Allen went for the police and brought back two police<lb/>men whilst he was gone the prisoner ran downstairs and ran up again into the bed-room and laid there on the floor till the policemen came and took him into custody—he was taken to the station—I told Allen to go to my sister's and I went home—I next saw him lying dead in my sister's passage later that same morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner <hi rend="italic">about</hi> two years—he had been a teetotaller for a year and nine months before this, as far as I know; I have stopped with him now and then—the house in which I was living was taken in his name; he had promised to keep me; he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said at the police-court next day that Allen was drunk, I was excitable; he was not drunk, he was quite sober—I said at the police-court that Allen struck the prisoner in the mouth and they struggled together—the case was remanded, and on 30th December I told the Magistrate that I wished to make another statement, and I then said that Allen was quite sober and that he did not strike the prisoner at all—I had been at two public-houses with Allen that night, he had a glass of gin hot at one house, and a share of my glass at the second—he complained of being ill there, and said he felt queer in his heart, and in doors the same, before the prisoner came in—the prisoner had paid the landlord twice, by my giving—I was very excited at the time of this struggle—Allen was pulled out of bed and fell against the wash stand—I heard the noise of the fall and the chamber break—I am sure he was struck several times, and he begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I generally paid the rent myself, when the prisoner paid it I gave him the money—there was not room to put a chair between the,. bed and the wash stand—Allen was pulled out of bed over me; he had no opportunity of getting on his legs afterwards, there was only one other lodger in the house; I received the rent from her—the prisoner had no right to come to me, except as an ordinary visitor—the street door was shut, and my room door was locked, and he burst them both open—Allen had been at home from sea three weeks—I had known him five years, and</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S., Three Colt Street, Limehouse 90, Gill Street, is about a mile from 4, Bloomfield Terrace—on 19th December, about 6 o'clock a.m. I was sent for to 90, Gill Street—I found the deceased, seated in a chair supported by Mrs. Grimm, quite dead—there were some contusions about the eyes, one more especially, what is commonly called black eye—he had been bleeding a little from the nose, but he had wiped it off—there was an abrasion of the skin about the eye—I did not observe any other wound—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found effusion of blood about the brain from a rupture of a blood vessel, and a small fracture at the base of the skull—the heart was enlarged to twice the ordinary size, the lungs were healthy, the liver was normal, but congested like that of a man who had been drinking lately; the spleen was natural, the kidneys inflamed and granular, the stomach and intestines natural,—in my judgment concussion of the brain was the cause of death—I believe the concussion caused the effusion of the blood vessel, not the actual rupture, that was very slight—the skull was the thinnest I have ever seen; I believe an ordinary skull submitted to the same amount of violence would come out unscathed—I do not, of course, know what the amount of violence was, but I can account for it in this way, that the peculiar fracture was caused by pitching on the head and the shock was communicated to the spine—I don't think a blow on the face with a fist would produce the fracture, unless it might in this being an exceptional case on account of the malformation of the bones—if he had been pulled out of bed violently and fallen on the top of his head, that would be the most probable way in which it would be occasioned—I don't think a fall against the chamber would aggravate it, that would shield and prevent the shock more or less, it would depend upon how he fell on it—death might have been due to the state of the heart if it had not been for the fracture of the skull—I think mere excitement might have caused the effusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have said that the effusion was caused by the con<lb/>cussion and not by the fracture, the fracture was the exciting cause—if I had not seen the fracture I should have attributed the death to apoplexy—I should have been led to the belief that he died from heart disease—the effusion was capable of being caused without the fracture; where you have effusion you seldom have fracture—the effusion was on the surface of the brain, the fracture was at the base of the skull, at the hinder part, where the bones are weak—the effusion, however caused, was of itself sufficient to account for death; it depends upon the quantity—in my opinion the effusion was not caused so much by excitement as by the fracture—there were no internal injuries corresponding with the blow on the eye—the condition of the heart was such that it might have caused sanguineous apoplexy, or congestion of the brain, or effusion of blood on the brain—in my opinion the effusion arose from the violence which occasioned the fracture—excitement from the quarrel might have occasioned it—I did not say before the Magistrate that pure excitement alone might have caused it, I meant excitement caused by the quarrel and the fall—pure excitement'</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080030"/>
               <p>would cause sanguineous apoplexy, which would cause death—he had sanguineous apoplexy sufficient to cause death independent of the fracture, but I should not call it sanguineous apoplexy; I should call it effusion of blood on the brain; without the fracture it would be sanguineous apoplexy; with the fracture it would be owing to the violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I say that the death was due to concussion, and the concussion was due to violence to the skull, the fracture.</p>

The heart was in a bad condition, but I found no symptoms to lead me irresistably to the conclusion that he would have died of heart disease; I think be would have lived longer, I can't say how long—the fracture might have been caused by a blow from the fist, on account of the thinness of the skull, but a fall is what generally occasions that particular kind of fracture—that was the immediate cause of death, the remote cause would be disease of the heart—if I had not seen the fracture I should have thought he might have lived for years, perhaps ten year—from the condition of the heart there was nothing to lead me to suppose that he would have died within so short a period.</p>

I came out to go home, down near the side of these steps, and I tumbled down, having had a little too much to drink, and hurt my shoulder, very near put it out. I tried to steady myself on the next flight but tumbled down that, and <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> hold of the prosecutor to save myself.

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the first battalion of Grenadier Guards, which is stationed at Chelsea Barracks—the deceased, Noah John<lb/>son, was a private in that battalion, the prisoner was a private in the second battalion—on the night of 25th December, I was sergeant on guard in the guard-room-men in the regiment are confined in the guard-room for drunkenness, and all other offences—there is a large bed in the guard-room, I suppose it would hold twenty men, it is a board or bank raised at one end—on 25th December, at 11.30 there were three men confined in the guard-room, Rawlings was one, he was confined for dis<lb/>obedience to orders; he was sober—Slack was brought in by an escort at 6.10 from the Tower, he was sober; the third man was Brewerton, he was in custody for absence; he belonged to the third battalion, and I did not take any account of him, he was sober—at 11.30 Johnson came in, he was drunk and dirty; the back of his coat was dirty; I ordered him into the guard-room—at 11.50 the prisoner was brought in <hi rend="italic">by</hi> two police-constables and Corporal Jacobs, he was drunk—he was reported to be drunk <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the corporal who brought him in—he was placed in the guard-room between the escort, Nuttall and Carter—I noticed that his cap was dirty as if it had been in the mud, and his tunic was dirty on the sleeve, I ordered Nuttall and Carter, to see him in the lock up—the prisoner said "Are you going to do me drunk"—I told him to mind his own business—the expression "do me drunk" is a common saying with soldiers, it meant was I going to keep him in the guard-room, to treat him as a drunken man—it would have been my duty next morning to report him for drunkenness—I saw him put in the lock up; that is where the prisoners are confined, it is the same place in which the other men were confined; it is not the same as the guard-room, the guard-room is where the men are on guard—it is all one room.; there is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080034"/>
               <p>a door leading from the guard-room into the passage, and there is another door leading into the lock up, and on the other side of the passage there are three or four cells—I saw the prisoner put in the lock up; he made tie fifth man there—there is a peep-hole in the wall of the lock up from the guard-room—there was a light in the lock up—you cannot see quite all of the lock up from the peep-hole, you can see the whole of what is called the bed, the bed comes right under the peep-hole—the bed runs from the one end of the wall to the other, the peep-hole is above the bed, so that you can see all the way up it, I believe it is about a yard above the bed; in looking through it you cannot see the part of the bed nearest the peep-hole—the peep-hole is about as big as the top of that inkstand, it might be a little larger, about as big as a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and there is a slide goes over it—a brick wall separates the lock up from the guard-room—it is my duty to be in tie guard-room during the night, I do not keep the peep-hole always open during the whole night; there is no glass to it, there used to be, but it is deficient—when the slide is up you can put a stick right through the peep-hole into the lock up, the slide is an iron one—at the time I put the prisoner in I saw the inside of the lock up, I noticed the four other men who were already in there; I went to the door so as to be able to see the men distinctly; three of the men were at the far end of the lock up lying on the bed asleep, Slack, Brewerton, and Rawlings—Johnson was lying on the same bed nearly opposite the door, asleep—I looked through the peep-hole at 12 o'clock, and the four men were in the same position, and appeared to be asleep; the prisoner was sitting on the bed between Johnson and the other three, nearer Johnson, about a yard away from him, he was sitting with his feet on the floor; he was sitting near Johnson's feet—he had his tunic off, it was on when I put him in—Johnson's tunic was on—I am sure of that—the prisoner was sitting with—his body inclining forward, and his arms across his knees, and his faces towards the wall opposite the bed—I could not see whether he was asleep or not; it was a mere momentary glance—I then closed the slide—my attention was next attracted to the lock-up about a quarter of an hour after, by cries of "Murder" and "Sergeant of the guard" proceeding from the lock-up—I then looked through the peep-hole; I saw that Johnson was off the guard bed and I saw the remaining four prisoners at the end of the lock-up; the prisoner was standing over a man, pulling at his legs, the remainder were in the act of getting up—I am not certain of the man whose legs he was pulling—Rawlings, Slack, and Brewerton were all on the bed—the prisoner was not standing up; he was bent over—the men were all aroused at the time—I immediately went to the lock-up with the escort—when I got in I saw Johnson lying on the floor behind the lock-up door—I could not see him, looking from the peep-hole; he was lying faces downwards, his left side was resting against the foot of one of the legs of the guard bed, in a pool of blood—I turned him over, I could not recognise him, he was that much bruised, and his face covered with blood—he appeared to be dead—he was not then wearing his tunic; his shirt was smothered in blood—I ordered Nuttall and Carter to take the prisoner and place him in a cell; he said "Take me to a cell, for I have killed him"—he was then sitting near Johnson's feet, he was drunk—I noticed his shirt, hands, and boots; the boots were saturated with blood, covered all over, and his hands had blood on them, and his shirt—he was then put into a cell on the other side of the passage, and Mr. Fernandez, the surgeon, was sent for—I saw Johnson's</p>

               <p>tunic on the guard bed over where he was lying; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Johnson was lying at the foot of the guard bed on the floor, and his tunic was over where he was lying; I noticed that one of the epaulets was torn in this condition, and the button was off the other one—this is exactly the state in which it was when I found it—the epaulet was on when Johnson was brought in, and the button on the other side as well, and the tunic was not torn, it was all right—I found the epaulet on the floor near his feet, it it has been lost since—I afterwards searched the prisoner in the presence of the adjutant and the doctor, but found nothing—he said nothing—after he was left in the cell he was very riotous, kicking at the door, and I then had his boots taken off—about 3.15 Sergeant Thompson, of the police, came and fetched the prisoner; I gave him the boots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was in my battalion, the 1st, quartered at Chelsea barracks—the prisoner was in the 2nd battalion and was quartered at Wellington barracks, Birdcage Walk—they might have been quite strangers—when men are brought in drunk and put into the lock-up their boots are not taken from them unless they make a noise or kick the door, that is if they are riotous—it is not an understood thing in our battalion if a man is very drunk to take his boots off—the bed is a sloping bank, sloping down from the wall—when I looked in at 12. o'clock he was lying down in his tunic, he was lying in the ordinary way, with his head on the raised part of the bank and his feet at the bottom of the slope—I hare marked on the plan the spot where he was lying, and also the spot where I found the body when I went in at 12.15—the bank is about 7 feet in length from the wall to the foot, and about 7 yards long from wall to wall, that is the length of the lock-up—there' is about a yard's space at the entrance, just enough room for a man to walk up and down; two men might walk up and down together; that extends the whole length—when I went in and found the body I found the tnuic lying, on the bank as if it had been thrown there, and the epaulet was on the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. When the slide is down you cannot hear anybody talking in the lock up—we put all prisoners in the lock-up unless they are riotous, then we have to shift them into the cells for safety—if a sober man is put into the lock-up at 10 o'clock in the morning for disobedience, and a drunken man comes in at 12 or 1 o'clock, he would be put into the same room—if half a dozen drunken men, not riotous, came in, they would be put in the same room where the man was sleeping who had only been guilty of dis<lb/>obedience—there is no order in our battalion to put the men in cells; the door that leads into the lock up from the passage is a wooden door; that is the only door to the lock up; it is close to the door of the guard-room—you have to pass through two doors to get from the guard-room into the lock up, one into the passage and another from the passage into the lock up—the guard-room door is an ordinary wooden door; it is opened from time to time and closed after it has been used; this was on Christmas night—there is a sentry at the entrance gate in front of the guard-room—the officer of the day does not visit us at night-no one visits at night—when anyone comes in, the sentry calls out "Gate," and the gate is opened—there is a wooden bed-place in the guard-room of the same kind as that—in the lock up for the men to lie down on—there would be about twenty men usually in the guard-room—there were two separate guards, two sergeants or acting corporals, and eighteen privates; the lock up was entirely under my control that night—no one had any duty to look into that room except</p>

               <p>myself; a number of the twenty men had just come off sentry, and were sitting by the side of the fire, and a number of them were lying on the guard bed—if a man was riotous in the lock up, he would go into the cell, because he would be annoying the other prisoners; if a man came in drunk and incapable and obliged to be carried in he would be put in the cell; if he was only staggering he would not be put in a cell, he would be put in the guard-room—it is my duty from time to time to visit the lock up, once every hour, at the hour—I did not go in after the prisoner was confined, because he was confined at 11.50, and that was under the hour—there is no fixed time to visit, the sergeant uses his discretion; I generally visit at uncertain times—there is nobody whose duty it is to keep a constant watch; there is no sentry over them to watch them constantly—I frequently look through the peep-hole.</p>

I am a private in the first battalion of the Grenadier Guards—I was confined in the lock up at 6.15 on Christmas night—I had come from the Tower in custody of an escort—I had been in confinement from the previous night for being drunk, at 5.45; when I was put into the lock up at Chelsea Barracks, I was quite sober—there was another man there when I was put in, Rawlings; he was awake and sober—I afterwards went to sleep on the wooden bed—there was then nobody else in the lockup but Rawlings—I can't say what time it was when I awoke—I don't know what caused me to awake—I sat up and saw the prisoner standing over the other man and kicking him at the side of the head as he laid on the floor—I did not hear them say anything—the man was lying straight out on his back and his hands were lying down by his side—I did not see him move at all; his head was towards the wall where the peep-hole is—the prisoner stood at the side of him, with his face towards the hole—I only saw him kick him once; it was a violent kick—he had his boots on—when I saw this I was still on the bed—I noticed that there were then two other men in the lock up besides rue, Brewerton and Rawlings—I was lying at the further end of the lock up against the wall, Brewerton was next to me, and Rawlings next to him—they were not awake when I saw this, neither of them—after the kick the prisoner came towards me and took hold of Brewerton by the legs and said "If you take this man's part I will serve you the same"—Brewerton was not awake when he said this; he said it directly he pulled his legs; he might have pulled him a couple of feet off the bed from what I could see—Brewerton woke up and shouted out for the sergeant of the guard, and I called out "Murder"—the prisoner was then standing against the guard bed—he spoke in a violent manner—he did not say or do anything when I called out—I did not notice the peep-hole when I called out—you can tell when it is opened if you look; I did not notice it at all—when we called out the sergeant of the guard came in—the prisoner was then sitting in the middle of the guard bed, 2 or 3 yards off from the man on the ground—he seemed to be very violent—we were on the bed when the sergeant came in—we got off afterwards, and I went out into the guard room and know no more about it—I did not know the prisoner before that night, nor Johnson, Brewerton, or Rawlings—I did not know when Brewerton or the deceased or the prisoner came into the lockup.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, East Street, Manchester Square, and am melter at a tallow chandler's—on the morning of 12th September, about 2 o'clock, I was at work at Messrs. Harris &amp; Blackburn's, in Tooting Court—i I heard some persons talking in the court—I could not exactly catch what it was or who it was—I was at work on the ground floor, and the window looks out on the court—I heard a man sing out "I am stabbed, I am stabbed; police, police"—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running down the court from a man on the opposite side of the way—I had never seen her before to my knowledge—as she passed my door she made a mo<lb/>tion with her left hand to me, but the words I could not swear to; it sounded to me like "Go in, it is only a drunken man"—there was a lamp under the archway—I had an opportunity of seeing her face; my gaslight reflected through the door, and I was able to discern anyone's features going by—I can swear the prisoner is the woman—she had no boots on—I looked up the court, and saw the prosecutor about 2 or 3 yards from the top of the court; he had got his hand to his left side, and was staggering from one side of the court to the other—he was in the direction the prisoner had come from—I saw no one else in the court, only those two—I did not see anything in her hand—the police came in two or three minutes, and I then saw the man was bleeding from his side through his clothes.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—between 2 and 3 o'clock on the morning of 12th September the prosecutor was brought there by some policemen—he had a punctured wound on the left side of his back, which proceeded downwards and outwards—it was about 1 or 1 1/2 inches long and about 2 inches deep—it extended obliquely underneath the skin—it was a very dangerous wound; it had opened the chest and injured the cavity in which the lungs are contained—air was bubbling from the wound—it might have been caused by such knives as were shown to me at the police-court—he has continued at the hospital till now, an will return there this evening—he is out of danger now, but I fear he will suffer from the effects of it for the rest of his life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, of Teddington—on 30th November I saw an advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph," and between 1 and 2 o'clock on that afternoon I went with my partner to the place indicated, the Old Catherine Wheel stables, where we saw the prisoner and were shown a horse which the prisoner said was for sale and he walked it up and down the yard—he said that it belonged to his master, Mr. Shaw, of Walthamston, who had no further use for it, and he was authorised to sell it; that it was a hunter and was sound, and just the sort of horse which would suit a dog cart or to ride—the price was 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked for a trial; he said "Yes, you can have a trial if you like"—I went away to Long Acre and bought a dog cart, and returned to the Old Catherine Wheel about 9 o'clock, and asked the prisoner if I could have the horse; he said "Yes"—I said that I had no harness; he said that he would lend me some, but he should have to go to Walthamstow for it by train—I saw him start in a pony cart; he was away an hour and a quarter and brought the harness back—while the horse was being harnessed he called me on one side and said that as I was a complete stranger to him and he to me he could not allow me to take away a valuable horse like that without having the value left—I said "I will let you have the money, but I must" have an</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at Colchester—I have been assisting my father, who is also a solicitor, in his business—I Was doing so in July, 1873—my father was then and is now Clerk to the Magistrates of the Lexton and Winstree Division, and also to the Highway Board—the prisoner was at that time a clerk in his employ—his department was that particular portion of the business which related to my father's appointment as Clerk to the Magistrates and Clerk to the Highway Board; it was the practise for him to receive payments on those accounts, all pay<lb/>ments I may say—all monies paid into the office on those accounts passed through his hands; if I received any I handed them over to him the first time I saw him; or if my father or some other clerk received any in his absence it was instantly handed over to him on the first opportunity—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is called the Magisterial Cash Book—all payments respect<lb/>ing the magisterial department ought to have passed through this book;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080071"/>
               <p>that was the course of business in the office—the left-hand page denotes cash received by the prisoner, and the right-hand page cash paid by the prisoner—when my father or I received sums from the prisoner we put our initials against the sums so received; it was very rarely indeed, I think, that my father received any—I see here an entry on 18th August, 1873; it is in the prisoner's handwriting—it is "August" 18th, 1873, to H. W. J., cash 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., H. W. J."—those are my initials—when I signed my initials to that item it was not as it is now; it then stood 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have my own cash-book which makes me say that positively, I have it here—the moment I received any money from the prisoner or anybody else I always entered it in that book—at this length of time I would not undertake to pledge my oath that on that particular day I only received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is four years ago, I could not go to the length of saying that—I notice something with regard to the figures in this entry in the magisterial cash-book—when I signed my initials to this entry the entry wag 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; another "I" has been put in front of it, and the first "1" is in a different coloured ink; the other two figures have been run over at the same time the second "I" has been put in; it appears so—the prisoner has had credit for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that item—the prisoner used to hand me the balance of any sums he had in hand—the balance was taken at uncertain times, there was no regular time for taking it—the whole of this page is the prisoner's writing—there is no balance struck on that page, of course balances are struck after<lb/>wards, at the end of the year—this book shows that a balance was struck, there was then a sum brought forward to the 1st January, 1874—this book shows that at the end of 1873 the prisoner was indebted to my father on that account 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is, that he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in hand.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This affair was on 18th August, 1873—the prisoner remained in my father's service up to the middle of 1876—my father is here and in Court—I know Mr. Fry of the firm of Palmer, Bull, &amp; Fry, attorneys—I do not know Mr. Bull—I was not present at Colchester when my father charged Mr. Bull with receiving a press copy of a letter knowing it to be stolen—I am well acquainted with all the business matters in my father's office except magisterial business—I know that my father had a client named Jeffreys—I know that my father is making certain claims upon insurance offices with regard to policies which had been assigned to Jeffreys from one Blomberg; we are bringing actions against these insurance companies; they are defending the actions; they are disputing the claim on the ground of fraud, they alleging that Blomberg had gone to Japan and had died before paying the extra risk premium—they also allege that my father was aware of the fact and concealed the fact of Blomberg's death—the prisoner abstracted a press letter written by my father to Messrs. Digby, solicitors, of Malton, and forwarded that press copy to Messrs. Palmer, Bull, &amp; Fry, the solicitors to the insurance company, and that is one of the charges against him—we charged him with stealing the press copy of the letter, and Mr. Bull with receiving it knowing it to have been stolen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080072"/>
               <p>—we preferred an indictment at this Court against the prisoner for stealing that press letter—Mr. Bull was discharged before the Magistrate—I have heard that the prisoner's defence with regard to that letter was that he had sent it to Mr. Bull because he knew that a fraud had been committed on the office, and for the purpose of furthering the ends of justice—it was after that charge that, we brought this charge of forgery, because we did not know of it till after he left—Mr. Digby was not representing Jeffrey because he was a client of my father's—I believe he was concerned for one of the assignees of one of Blomberg's policies—the charge of stealing the press letter was committed to the Colchester Borough Sessions—this book has been in my possession from time to time, and this one in the prisoner's—since he left it has been left in the office that he used to use; the clerk that succeeded him took over the books—when the prisoner left the books were taken home by my father—I believe the prisoner left on the last day of June or 1st July—when my father took the books home I believe they were brought back the next morning; I think we took them home two or three nights—there was no regular stated time for balancing the accounts between the prisoner and the firm—they were not balanced weekly—some<lb/>times they were balanced monthly, or when it suited my father and the prisoner to balance them, at irregular times—my father has two farms—I have never known him to borrow money of the prisoner to pay on to the farm—I never heard of it—he was paid his salary, sometimes by cheque, and when he was not, I used to pay him, that is to say, supposing 1 had not sufficient money in the office on the particular day his salary was due, I should go to my father and ask him to give him a cheque for it, and I know he has done it, but in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred I have done it, and you will find the entries in this book—he was always paid on the 1st of every month, unless it was on a Sunday, or I was not there, or some<lb/>thing of that sort, you know—I mean that his salary was not always paid on the 1st of every month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is the fact that before Blomberg died the assignee of his policy had tendered the extra premium on account of Blomberg having gone abroad—it is the case that Blomberg had gone out of the limits of the policy before he died, and that before he died the assignee and holder of his policy went to the office and informed them that he had gone out of the limits of Europe that he did not know where he was, and tendered the extra premium—I was not present, and as to some of the questions 1 was asked by the prisoner's counsel, I was not present—it was alleged by means of a bill in Chancery that my father had concealed the fact—I know, as a fact that the bill has been dismissed with costs—Mr. Bull kept the press letter twelve days, photographed it, and sent it back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked whether the prisoner's defence was that he wanted to expose a fraud—as far as you know, was there any fraud to expose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, that I am quite satisfied of—the prisoner was committed to the Borough Sessions at Colchester for stealing a letter; it was a charge of larceny, triable at Sessions; this charge of forgery* was not triable at Sessions, under an order in council, the Essex people are brought to this Court for the Winter Assizes—I don't think I have totalled the page in this book where the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is—I will do it—the total in its present state is right—the whole of these figures are the prisoner's writing—I think there has been an alteration of the total in the book; I will just look at it again; there have been in several, I don't know whether there has been in that one.</p>

This book was not kept under lock and key during the time the prisoner was with us; it was kept on his desk—he had an office to himself; other account books as well were kept on his desk, anybody in the office had access to them—there was no formal audit of his accounts—I did not say to him "Bring your account in, and let us check it off"—I looked into the book a great many times, and looked through the different items; I did that sometimes twice a week—I am out a great deal, and I may not be in the office from one week's end to another—I have sometimes gone two or three weeks and not seen it; I think that would be a long interval—on the average, I think the book would be looked into once a week, because he used to make payments to me about once a week—the accounts on either side, debit or credit, would be presented to me; I should look at the items, I should not cast up—I took the items and looked at them to see if they were correct—I only pointed out one entry to him in my life as being erroneous, and that was within three days of leaving; that was the first intimation I ever had—that item appears in the books; that was the only one that I remember—I kept a cash-book of my own; I kept that on my own table, in my own private office—I have a separate room—that cash-book was subject to anybody's inspection at the time, it was always open to anybody who might come in and look at it—I made the entries under the prisoner's inspection, he used to bring me this book, and the cash, and say "I have to give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." whatever it was, he would previously have entered it in the book before handing me the money, and I should immediately put my initials, as I have done to thousands of items,. and make the entry in my book—I can't say when that particular entry was made—I have not the slightest recollection; it was a matter happen<lb/>ing every week, and twice a week sometimes—I have no recollection whether that entry was made in his presence or not—I made very few entries, I should think, when he was not present; I feel sure I must have made some—he used to see me make the entries, they were always done so that he could see them, he was not so far off as your Lordship is; my table is a small one—I can't say that he read it; I know that he has done so—this is the office cash-book, there are nobody's entries in it but mine—it was no part of the prisoner's duty to make entries in it—none of the entries in the other book are in any handwriting but his, only after his discharge.</p>

                  </hi>. It was the prisoner's duty to receive monies and account for them to me or my father in a book—all moneys he paid to me I always initialled in the book as a receipt—I had most unbounded confidence in the prisoner—I kept a cash-book of my own in which I entered the sums he paid me—in the magisterial cash-book under the date of May 7th, 1374, I find this entry "H. W. J., cash 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and that purports to be receipted, H. W. J. has been put to it, or rather I should say H. M. J., the middle letter is an M, there is one stroke too many, but it purports to be H. W. J.—I always receipted monies paid to me by the prisoner, with those initials as appears by the book—I certainly did not write those letters H. W.

               <p>—the entry is in his handwriting, and I believe the initials are in his hand-writing, I would not swear it positively; in my own mind I have very little doubt as to it—I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner at that time—I have the means of refreshing my memory on that point, I have a cash-book in which I enter every sum I receive (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—I always enter them at the time I receive them, at the very first opportunity, invariably—I am not aware of any occasion in which I did not—I am perfectly satisfied that I did not receive that money—the total at the bottom of the page is 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not totalled up that column, I was just doing it; I see there is a mistake of a shilling—it ought to be 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is including the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., taking the book as it is now—the total is written upon an erasure, the balancing line is carried up from the left hand bottom corner, and the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. entry is written over it; the balancing line goes to an item one line above it—the same total is carried forward on to the next page 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I really cannot see by this light whether there has been any alteration since it was put there; it appears to be all right—the prisoner has had credit with me for that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the balance was struck after that on December 4th, not at the end of that year, at the end of the next year—there was no occasion to, balance this book at all, the balance was on December 18th, 1875; it goes on to then, and then a balance is struck—I tested the correctness of the entries in this book by comparing them with my cash-book—when I compared them this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not there—I com<lb/>pared that page of this book with my cash-book—when I made that compari<lb/>son the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in his book, I have never seen the book in any other state than it is now—to my recollection I made the comparison when my attention was called to this particular item, within the last three or two months; I did not make it in 1874—before the prisoner left the employ I called his attention to one error in the cash-book; here it is "April 24th, 1876, H. W. J., cash 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I was looking over his book and I was surprised to find that he had debited me with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I asked him for an explanation and his explanation was "I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand which I intended to give to you, but I did not see you and I forgot to scratch it out of your book"—I said "Run your pen through it at once," and I made him do it, and here it appears so—I never had that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think that occurred at the latter end of April, 1876, I had unbounded confidence in the prisoner at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The balancing line is not in pencil, it is ink I believe, a very light pale ink, blotted off instantly; it is the top part of the line that I think has been erased—I thought so, looking at it cursorily in the wit<lb/>ness box here—I have seen it before; I don't think it ever struck me before, I saw it in the witness-box that there had been an attempt to erase; it never did—I should very much like to have the opportunity of looking at it again (<hi rend="italic">it was handed to the witness</hi>); oh, no, I don't think so now—I do not see any trace of an erasure there, or any attempt to erase—I said it struck me as being an erasure on the ground that it was some<lb/>what fainter at the top end; I say I formed the opinion on the ground that it is obvious that the balancing line was put in before the last two items, and on the further ground that it looks lighter—I do not mean still to say that there is an erasure; I do not think now that there is an erasure—I did not check the items of payment in this book, because I do not interfere in any way with the magisterial cash-book; it is not part of my duty to check them, all I have to do is to check my own entries—it has been left too much to the prisoner—my father does check them, he looks over the book—I never received any money from the pri<lb/>soner without putting my initials; I don't think there is one in the book—my father does the same thing—I always put my initials; I don't know about my father; it is the habit certainly always to put the initials; <hi rend="italic">my</hi> father as well as myself. (<hi rend="italic">The attention of the witness was called to several entries against which no initials appeared.</hi>) The rule does not apply to my father so much as to myself; as a matter of rule it does, but he was not so particular in doing it as I was—in the page where the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is entered there is a second entry of a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Superintendent Daunt; he is the super<lb/>intendent of police for the Magistrates' division—I don't think there is any account that would show whether that 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to him—I believe my father asked Daunt; Daunt is not here—I believe he said he could not tell, because we pay him so many sums—that is one of the items written over the balancing line; it was properly there if it was ever paid; I don't believe it was; I believe it is purely imaginary altogether, because it has been put in subsequently, and the book does not add up with it; that is my reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your balancing lines seem to be as irregular as the initals—I find a great many of these pages at the bottom have no balancing line at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not his, I think—allow me the book; he has been in our ser<lb/>vice about three years—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>) the initials H. W. J. to all these entries are mine; there is not a single one in the book that is not mine—I put my initials in different ways occasionally, but you will see at that time I made them alike—I did form my initials differently at some periods—I began to change, I should think, about two years ago; I could tell if I had the book again—I have altered my initials to a certain extent; I used to write them without taking my pen off, and I now write them</p>

               <p>separate, and the reason was because they were sometimes mistaken; I did not break myself of the habit at once—I think it very possible that they may be different at different times—I see they are different in July and October—in the column where the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is, I can easily detect that it is not my signature; in an instant—there is another signature immediately over that; there are very few items in that page—I did not discover this until my attention was called to it.</p>

I am a solicitor, practising at Colchester—I am the pro<lb/>secutor in this case—the prisoner was my clerk for about three years and a quarter up to 1st July in the present year, his leaving had no reference whatever to the present charge, or any other charge; a few words, and I gave him a month's notice, and he left on 1st July—I am clerk to the Magis<lb/>trates of the Lexton and Winstree division—the prisoner was my clerk in that department of my business—this book was kept by the prisoner, it was his duty to enter all receipts by him of a magisterial kind in that book, and to account for the payment on the other side—I see this entry of May 7th, 1874, it is the prisoner's writing—I say that the initails there are a forgery, they are not my son's; I am well acquainted with my son's initials; I say that, in my opinion, these decidedly differ—I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner at or about that time—my instructions were that my son should always initial payments made to him by the prisoner, those were my instructions to the prisoner and to him, and I believe they were—when he handed money to me, very frequently, as a rule, I used to initial them; sometimes he has said I did not, and I have not questioned it, I have accepted his statement and there was end of it, as far as I was concerned—I had very great confidence in the prisoner while he was with me—these initials are certainly not in my handwriting—I very seldom looked through the book—I see an item of a shilling under the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that would be a payment to Superintendant Daunt of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the service of a summons, perhaps, or something of that sort, in the matter to which it refers, it says here "Re Fisher"—I have totalled up this page—I did not have any conservation with Superintendant Daunt about the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pri<lb/>soner's presence; I had a conversation with him, but the prisoner was not present.</p>

               <p>genuine one; is seems to me that the down strokes ore so close together that it would look like H in the last stroke of the W and the J, as far as my eyes enable me to judge—the genuine one is, to my mind, exactly like a genuine one, but I think the first stroke of the W is run into the stroke of the H; that is all I can say—in other respects, I think, I know of no other way of signing his initials—I do not keep a cash-book—when the prisoner pays me cash it is entered by him in his book; I have no check against it; I don't say that I have always initialled the sums he has paid me—sometimes when he has paid me money, if I have been before the Magistrates or elsewhere, I have given him a memorandum of "G. W. E." so much money, and it has been accounted for to my son in making up the books—I don't think it would be a matter of very rare occurrence that my signature was not attached to the payments made to me, it certainly would not happen week after week, or entry after entry—I have a client named Jeffreys, he was the assignee of certain policies of insurance of a man named Blomberg—I know a person of the name of Digby—I believe he was an assignee of one of those policies, a small one, on Blomberg's life; he is a solicitor at Maldon—I have heard that Blomberg went to Japan—I don't know that he died there, I have heard so, obviously I can carry it no further—the insurance companies dispute the claim—Messrs. Palmer, Bull, &amp; Fry are the solicitors to one of the insurance companies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you advise him to pay that extra risk premium as though Blomberg were alive, when you knew that he was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I advised him no more than what was in the letter—I did not advise him to pay it as though Blomberg was living when I knew he was dead—at the time I wrote to Digby I did not know that Blomberg was dead; I had heard so, but I did not know it; I never disputed it—I had a doubt about it—I said "I should not tell them at present that he is dead," because I had already sent a message to him by Mr. Evans the day before; that the information I had received could not be vouched in any way—I say, when I gave that recommendation to Digby, I had been told that Blomberg was dead; had my doubts about it; I thought be might be, but I had my doubts of it—I really cannot say that I formed a belief sufficient to say either one way or the other—there was nothing authentic with regard to it, and probably would not be until the 12th October, when the mail came in—I did not conceal it; I had sent that very message the day before—I certainly recommended Digby not to mention the allegation of the death—I think that was an honest trans<lb/>action under the circumstances.</p>

The board have recon<lb/>sidered your application and, under the circumstances, are willing to accede to your request that in the event of the assured having gone beyond the limits of Europe without license, you shall be permitted to pay such extra premium as the nature of the risk may require, yours faithfully, Charles J.</p>

               <p>Rowe"—I first knew that Blomberg had gone to Japan in September, I don't know what day in September; I heard it from Mr. Murray, a solicitor in Whitehall Place; I have understood he is solicitor to Blomberg's family, and I believe so—he said that he had had a telegram, or that a telegram had been received; I don't know that he said he had it,; he had knowledge of a telegram and he read to me what the contents of it were, it was in a very few words, but he said "You must not rely on it as authentic or authoritative, but we shall probably know something more about it by the mail which is expected on 12th October, and on 12th October I called on him again and no further information had come—the first time I heard where Blomberg had gone to was when I heard this report of his death—. we know now that he died on 25th July, and that the information conveyed in the telegram was correct—I don't know who the telegram purported to come from; I asked Mr. Murray to give me some further particulars as to who it came from, in order that I might communicate with them, and he said it came to some firm in London; it was not Messrs.

After these letters had been received in April and May, I did not consider, with regard to keeping the insurance alive, that there was anything more to do than give them information as to where he had gone—that was the state of affairs when I wrote this letter on 25th September, 1874, to Mr. Digby; this is the letter: "Dear sir, Re Blomberg, I suppose Mr. Evans delivered my message to you yesterday"—that message was what Mr. Murray had said, that it could not be considered as authentic—"What I recommend you to do is to write and say that Blomberg has gone to Japan, and that you are ready and willing to pay the extra risk premium; I should not tell them at present that he is dead"—when I wrote that I did not refer to any other source of information except what I have told the Court, through Mr. Murray, with the proviso that he had put upon it—"We yesterday telegraphed to the Foreign Office for five certificates of death, including one for you, that you might write to Jeffreys on Saturday, as he wants to see you particularly; I will then arrange the matter."—Those were the circumstances under which I wrote that letter—the insurance companies have objected to pay this claim on the ground that Blomberg was dead at the time the extra risk premium was paid—my client and myself filed an answer in Chancery on 10th June, 1875.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I believe the policy would not have been vitiated so long as he kept in Europe; the fact is it would not be vitiated by his going abroad—the extra risk premium depends upon where a man goes—I should say it would be different for Algiers or the Gold Coast, India, China, or Japan—there was another letter from the Sovereign, prior to the one that has been read—before Blomberg's death nobody had ascertained what the extra risk premium would amount to—the fact of his reported death was not made known to the office because I assumed they would demur to take the extra risk premium—I thought they had entered into a contract but that they probably would not take the money, and, perhaps, would not tell us what the rate might be, and we had no means of ascertaining—I did not mean them to be kept in the dark upon what I thought was a material piece of information—I thought my duty to my client required that I should keep the office in the dark as to the information I had received; I thought it would increase my client's difficulty in regard to the matter; I thought it would induce them to prejudice my client in not receiving the money, or telling us what the rate ought to be, or anything else; they would probably have said "The whole thing is at an end, and you may do what you like"—I thought my client's interest would be best served by not telling them that; they might demur and probably would, I thought they would.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Hall, the tenant of Little Bar<lb/>rington Hall Farm, Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex—on the night of 8th December, about 10.40 I went into the premises and saw a barley stack on fire—I had been called by cries of "Fire"—it was the stack which was nearest to the road which was on fire—it was about 10 rods from the road I should say—there are 5 1/2 yards to a rod; that would be about 55 yards—another stack behind it at right angles to it, caught fire and some buildings also—I saw the prisoner throwing the burning <hi rend="italic">haulm</hi> with a fork high up into the air—the wind was blowing towards the buildings, and it blew the burning particles towards the buildings which are now standing, but not towards those which are burned—some of them told the prisoner to leave it alone, they called him <hi rend="italic">Lump;</hi> they said "Leave it alone <hi rend="italic">Lump</hi>"—that is his nickname—the prisoner said "Let it burn, it wants to burn, let it burn you b—"—as soon as the fire was got under, my attention was called to some foot marks going to the stack; they were a few feet from the stack which first caught fire—I cannot read and I do not understand this map (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the Sunday afternoon I went with the prisoner and constables Hitch and Gall, to the footmarks—we then traced footmarks away from the stack; they went round by the hedge, but there is no path there, only a horse path; there is no right of way there—we traced them to the road again which leads to Barrington Hall—the constables had two pair of boots with them, they each had a pair—I saw them compare the boots with the foot prints—one pair of boots corresponded with the prints and one pair did not—the prisoner said that they corresponded with one pair.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the Essex Constabulary—en the evening of 8th December I as on duty in Tateley, which is about 2 1/2 miles by road from Little Barrington Hall—I saw this fire commence—I saw a light flash up in the air as if a lucifer had been just struck and I saw smoke—I went home and looked out from the upstairs window and could then see the flames from Little Barrington Hall—that was about 10.30—I proceeded to the spot and got there about 11.15—I took out my watch at 10.20 and looked at the time—when I got there I saw the straw stack all but consumed, and a stack of hay was burning also—I assisted in putting out the fire and saw the prisoner there—I watched him very narrowly—he was going about in the kitchen instead of helping' at the fire, and I was obliged to order him out—he assisted a little when the engine came at 3 o'clock in the morning—next morning I observed footmarks on the road going to the stack-yard; that is the road which leads from Bush End, where the prisoner lives—I understand the Ordinance Map (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is where the fire was, and the footmarks were along this gateway by the side of this fence to this point; they came straight to the stack and went along here, up this cart path—there is no footpath or right of way there—those were the footsteps going to the stack and they were the proper length of the boot, but going away they were on the slip—when a man is running, his feet slip, and the impression is very distinct of the heels and there are long strides—before going to the road he</p>

               <p>has stopped at a privet hedge and then got over into the road and went along the edge of the forest—this iron fence runs by the edge of the forest—just under the privet hedge I could see that some person had been standing there for some time, by the numerous foot-steps, it is a ploughed field, and the steps were on the ridges—there was grass within about 30 feet of the stack, so that the footsteps could not be traced—the footsteps that could be traced to and from the stack came directly to the corner of it—I went down to the prisoner's house which is on the Green opposite the Ancient Forester's public house—I saw footsteps in the garden leading to his house, which were the same as those I traced along the fields—I went into his house—I fetched him from the Ancient Forester's beer house—the policeman Gall was with me all the time—he asked the prisoner where the boots were which he went to the fire with—this was on the Sunday, at 2 o'clock p.m.—he brought them from another room, and said "These are the boots I had on," handing them to Gall—they were dry, and I could tell as soon as I saw them that they were not the pair I wanted, and I went into the other room, and saw this pair (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the dirt was all round here, and wet—there was ashes and slate on them—there was plenty of it on them at that time—I took possession of them; they both want toe-irons—there had, no doubt, been a toe-piece of some kind, a piece of metal—they are in the same state as they were when I found them—the sole of one them had four nails in the front, and the heel has four in front and two behind, and there is a little nail with the head knocked off; the other boot has three and two, and this little nail made a scratch as he was running; that is on the left boot—there is not a similar nail in the right; there are four there—the prisoner was then apprehended by Gall, and told the charge; he said that he did not know anything about it; he went straight to the fire by the road, and never left the road that night—when I brought the boots out, I said "Whose boots are these?"—he said "They are not my boots, they are my father's"—I know his father, he was not at the fire up to 1 o'clock, which was after we found these marks—from 11.15 that night, to. I o'clock on Saturday his father was not there, and that was after I found the marks—Gall and I took these boots, and in the prisoner's presence compared them with the footprints, and that pair agreed with the footprints in every particular, heels, and everything, through the whole of the track that is marked on the map, and in his own garden as well—in the footprints leaving the stack, I noticed the slip made by the one with the nail; the other boot made larger marks—they corresponded in every possible way both as to the right and left boot—the heel iron is removed from the left boot, and there are three nails in front and two in the centre—the prisoner was with me when 1 compared them, and he could see that they compared, but he said "I did not come round this way; I did not make them"—I have measured the distance from the prisoner's house to the stack which is burnt, it is 244 rods—there are 5 1/2, yards to a rod—from the stack to the prisoner's house, going by the fields is 104 rods further, from the point where you would get into the road is 104 rods additional—going round the field would be 104 rods further out of his way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Bailey, of 6, Kingston. Terrace, Charlton, a naval officer—I have known the prisoner between five and six years—when I first knew him we were living at Portsmouth, and he was apprenticed to a chemist there—I have three, daughters, Mary Ann, the eldest, was then in a situation at Southsea, but living at home with the others—she was very little acquainted with the prisoner then that I knew of—about December, 1875, we moved to Charlton, and the prisoner came to lodge with us—he was out of a situation a fortnight after he came—my daughters were all living with me there—on Monday afternoon, 4th December, I had some words with him, about being about the house, and my daughter took it up—I told him that unless he got more energy about him he should never have a daughter of mine—I had not noticed that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080090"/>
               <p>been paying attention to her; I said that because he was at all times very indolent; he would go out with her when he had a chance—he had not made any proposal to marry her to my knowledge—about 9 o'clock that evening, I was having my supper in the back kitchen with my three daughters, a younger boy, and the prisoner—about 9.20, I heard the postman's knock—I had part of a glass of beer on the table; I went to the door, and took in two letters—I left the prisoner in the kitchen, nobody else; the others had gone upstairs before me—I took the letters upstairs to my daughter's—one of them was in the front parlour; I gave one of the letters to her, I had to go up to the second flight of stairs to the eldest, and I gave it her there; the third daughter was in bed; after giving them the letters, I came down towards the kitchen; as I was descending, I met the prisoner by the side of his room door, ascending; he slept on the second-floor—I wished him good night—I then went into the yard, and on returning, I was in the act of going down the kitchen stairs, when I met my second daughter, Elizabeth; she gave me the glass of beer in my hand that I had left half finished—she gave it me at the top of the first flight of stairs—I had not asked her to fetch it for me; she had brought it for me before, if I left my beer—I took it out of her hand, and went downstairs—I smelt it, or rather I was going to put it to my mouth on the stairs—I noticed that it had a very peculiar smell, it was so overpowering that I stood it down on the table and drew back for a second and smelt it, and said "Some one has been putting something in my beer"—it had a sort of almond smell—I took the glass, and threw the contents into a glass dish with some pickling vinegar in it, which had come from some pickled cabbage—I put the glass back on the kitchen table—I then closed the door, and went upstairs to my bed room; that was about 9.55—I slept in the second-floor front room, the prisoner slept underneath in the first-floor back—my daughter, Mary Ann, was in the habit of sleeping with me—we both went to bed together that night about 10.15, we read till about 12 o'clock, and then went to sleep—I was awoke by a man's hand on my throat, pressing heavily on my throat, and I could feel the mouth of a bottle at my lips; the stuff, whatever it was, was over my face—I struggled violently, and in the struggle, I awoke my daughter—the liquid smelt like the beer—ray lips were in a terrible state for about a fortnight—I bled from the mouth—I rubbed my mouth violently with my night gown—I could not see the face of the person who was thus attacking me—I could swear to him by his back, I saw his back—after he released me I fell off the bed, the window was exactly opposite the, door, and I saw him distinctly go down the stairs leading to his bed-room—there was no candle in my room, it was moon-light—he had no coat on, he was in his shirt sleeves—it was the prisoner's habit to hang his coat in the kitchen—my daughter screamed when I awoke her, and we both went into another room, and gave an alarm—I saw nothing more of the prisoner—he had not given me any intimation of his intention to leave—I was got out of the house that night, and went next day on board ship with my husband—I afterwards saw some handkerchiefs given to the police, one knotted and the others folded.</p>

                  </hi> I reside at 79, Great Tower Street, City, and am a Fellow of the Chemical Society and of the Society of Analysts—on Monday, 11th December, I received from constable Morgan this small phial, tied over with a piece of wash leather secured with red tape and bearing the seal of the Woolwich station—I also received this larger bottle with the contents said to be ale and vinegar; also the night dress and three hand<lb/>kerchiefs; those are the thing upon which I formed an analysis—the smaller phial contained, as it came to me, two or at most three drops of a liquid—on removing the cork there was a very perceptible smell of prussic acid, or some substance resembling prussic acid—I tested it in five different ways and I found prussic acid and nothing else, and if the cork is removed now there is still a sufficient quantity adhering to the sides of the bottle to give a very perceptible smell—the larger bottle contained 5 1/2 fluid ounces of a liquid; that is it was nearly two-thirds full; that liquid had a peculiar smell of beer, pickles, and prussic acid mixed—I tested it in altogether seven different ways, and 1 found prussic acid present by each of those processes—I took another portion and estimated as accurately as it was possible to do so the amount of prussic acid and it was a trifle under a quarter of a grain of actual dry prussic acid—it is an extremely volatile acid, there<lb/>fore the amount found in the liquid would not represent the amount which was in it before it was exposed in the basin for some hours—I therefore made an experiment with a liquid of the same kind, beer and vinegar, putting into it four times the quantity of prussic acid that I found in this bottle, and at the end of six hours I found seven-eighths of what was originally present had evaporated and only one eighth was left,; therefore if that calculation was fairly applicable, this liquid would have originally contained eight times this quantity, or two entire grains, which would be nearly double a fatal dose, nearly two fatal doses—I then examined the handkerchiefs—these two were knotted together, I untied them and cut them in numerous places and took out from each place a small piece and tested it, and it contained minute traces of prussic acid—in that portion that was tied together the whole of the handkerchief had evidently been saturated in some way with prussic acid, and wherever I applied the tests I had the reaction—I cut the other handkerchief also in the same way in eight or ten different parts and wherever I cut it I found an approximately equal amount, as if it had been saddened by being dipped in or sprinkled with the acid, and then squeezed—I have taken off the breast of the nightdress and cut several pieces in the same way—there are distinct spots of somewhat large size which have been moistened with prussic acid and which show the reaction—I also found on the breast, in a position that would perhaps correspond with that, some very minute lines, which I have microscopically examined and found to be blood, and round those lines there was a distinct stain of prussic acid, as if the lip or hand from which the blood had come had at the time bees moistened with the acid—there were some four or five of those minute lines in the immediate neighbourhood of the blood stains, so that the poison and the blood might have been wiped away together—I searched for other poisons and found none.</p>

I am a surgeon practising at Dover—I know the prisoner—I used occasionally to visit her husband for two or three years—on Tuesday, 12th December, I called at the prisoner's house to see her husband, and she called my attention to the baby and asked me to look at it—I asked her how she fed it; she told me by the breast, and with milk and biscuit—I asked her if she had plenty of natural food for it; she said that she had—I recommended her to feed it naturally from the breast—I think it most likely that I also prescribed warmth—it is not the case that I prescribed mutton broth—I prescribed nothing but the breast—it was a very thin, emaciated, unhealthy looking child; it did not look as if it wanted medicine—I do not know of my own knowledge whether she was able to suckle the child; I took her own word without seeing whether she had plenty for it—on the following day but one I saw the child, but the prisoner was not there; it was at the relieving officer's office, and I recommended that it should be removed to the workhouse—I assisted the last witness in conducting the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I have heard his evidence and agree with it.</p>

My husband has sent the children for the grocery, and I have gone on a Sunday morning for the meat; the only time I ever left my child was on that Thursday, and then I shouldn't have stayed so long only I thought my husband would have given the child a little food; I am given to drink at times, but I am not half so bad as they make out."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, stating that she was not guilty of Starving the child although she had neglected it, and had not provided sufficient clothing for it; that at the time it was born she had everything ready for it hi a gown, which Mrs. Woodruff lent her; that Mrs. Duff came to nurse her and got drunk constantly with brandy which she purchased by taking money from the till, and had taken a dislike to Mr. Bishop, when he found her out, which she now vented upon the prisoner; and that four of the female witnesses were the worst women in Dover, and turned against her when there were no more clothes to pawn for drink; that she saw Mrs. Biggins nearly drunk with her baby, and called a policeman who made her give the child up, that she had been drinking off and on for four months, and had no milk for the child, but that she was not drunk on the night she let it fall, but to weak to turn it over, drink having taken away all her strength; and that her imprisonment would kill her husband who is seventy years of age.</hi>

On Thursday evening, 23rd November, about 7 o'clock, I went to Silverdale House, and saw foot marks leading up from the step? to the pillar of the portico, and marks of some one having climbed the portico, and on the top of the portico were foot marks in red brick earth—the window adjoining the portico was open, and there were footmarks there as well as on the window ledge—the window was above the portico—you could reach it from there; I went into the bed room and found it in great confusion—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the dressing table—the depth from the window to the area is 26 feet—I found a quantity of blood in the area and this white-handled knife—I saw some red-brick—ballasting in the road in front of the house—I also found this black mask in the place.</p>

I live at the Warwick Arms beer-house, and am a commercial traveller—it is about three quarters of a mile from Silverdale house—on 23rd November, between 6.30 and 7 o'clock, two men came into the Warwick Arms, blood was running down from the left ear of one of them, and the side of his head—to the best of my belief that man was Baker—some water was asked for, I sent Thomas Butler to get some and the man's head was bathed—I said to the other man "Why don't you take the man to the doctor and have his advice?"—I left them there; the companion of the injured man was Homan, it was he who asked for the water—my belief is stronger as to Homan than as to Baker—I will not swear to Baker.</p>

I fetched him back, and he made the charge in Baker's presence of breaking and entering into his house on the night of the 23rd—Baker said "How could it be breaking and entering, when the window was open, and it was not night?"—on the 9th December, about 4.30 p.m., I took Marson—he was at Commercial Street station, detained on another charge—I said "You will be charged with being concerned with James Baker and others in breaking into Silverdale House, Sydenham, on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 19, Berners Road, Hackney Road—on Thursday, 23rd November, about 12.30 in the day, I met Baker in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, and he went with me to various places in the neighbourhood and was with me till 4.30—I had my van and was delivering goods—we first went to Cornelius Barham's in Raven Road, Spitalfields—Barker left meat 4.30 in Pitfield Street, Hoxton; that is about five minutes' walk from the Turk's Head, Virginia Row.</p>

A. Perkins, some cottage, Rotherhithe—she asked me to fill up the notice, and asked if she could have the warrant left at the post-office till called for, as she did not know which house they would be at, as they were about moving—I filled up the notice of withdrawal—I saw the book and saw that there was more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, but the prisoner said that she only wanted 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out then—I sent the notice to the chief officer—the prisoner made her mark and I witnessed it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then gave her the deposit book and she left—she came again on Mon<lb/>day, the 11th, and asked if the papers had arrived; she had not got her book with her, and I told her to come again—she came in the afternoon and brought Mary Ann Perkin's book—she was asked to call a little later on and she came about 4.30—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the warrant for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable to Mary Ann Perkins—I did not give the prisoner the money, because she could not bring anybody to identify her as Mrs. Perkins—she said that it was very awkward as she did not know anybody who would know her as she generally dealt at Deptford, and no tradesmen near would know her—the deposits had been made at Rotherhithe, and we suggested that she should get Miss Crowson, the daughter of the postmistress to identify her, to witness her mark—she went away and came back with the book—I then found that the warrant was signed "Mary Ann Perkins," and a cross put to it—she said that Miss Crowson had guided her hand, and had put the cross to make it all right—I said that Miss Crowson must put her name as a witness, and she went away and came back and said that Miss Crowson said that she was not going to do it as she did not know anything of her—I told her she had better go to the post-office, and I gave her back the deposit book and the warrant, and she left.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a grocer's shop, at King's Langley—on the night of 29th November, I left my premises all secure and went to bed—the next morning I missed some twist tobacco, which was kept at the back of the shop—I also missed some money—the tobacco produced is similar to what I am selling, and I believe it is mine—I saw the tobacco upon the shelf on the previous day—I also missed a coat, a pair of shoes, three half-sovereigns, three half-crowns, and some coppers.</p>
