I did not miss the grater till an hour after, I thought I had put it in my pocket; there had been nobody in the bar but my mother; my husband came in very soon after, and I told him of it. I never found the grater, nor I should not know the notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When was this? - A. The 17th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they before the Justice? - A. A fortnight and three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband went to Mrs. Hester the same evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had put the grater upon the table? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you had put it in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it might have dropped out? - A. Yes, but that it certainly never did.</p>

I opened them, my son was in the shop; after I had opened them, I went into the parlour to dinner; while I was at dinner these two women came in, and wanted some cotton stockings; I opened the cotton stockings upon the silk stockings; they did not buy any thing, but went away; my son and I went to finish our dinners, and when we came back we missed two pair out of the four, and we never heard any more of them till I was sent for to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Your son was in the shop with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could any person come in and take those stockings without your seeing them? - A. I am sure they could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When were you at Bow-street- the first time these women were examined? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at first express some doubt that they were the women? - A. No, I did not; I knew them as soon as ever I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. You were half an hour, or an hour, perhaps, before you returned from your dinner to make up your bundle? - A. We were not ten minutes.</p>




               <p>Q. It was some time after they were gone before you missed these things? - A. It was about a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Nothing of your property was found upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your son any share in the business with you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of your cloak? - A. It cost me three guineas and sixpence. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that that is your cloak? - A. I know it by the number and the mark, it was the very first cloak I had shewn her; she objected to it on account of the lace being of a bad colour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You knew Mrs. Hutchinson? - A. I knew there was such a person who lives in Oxford-road, they have lived there a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to doubt that that person who was with her was the Mrs. Hutchinson who lived in Oxford-road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar gave you her address? - A. Yes, Running-horse-yard, King-street, Portman-square; I went the same evening to enquire, and found that she lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you any reason why she would not pay for it then? - A. Because she had not made up her mind which of the two she would have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about her husband at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find out who her husband was? - A. Yes, a horse-dealer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he provide horses for the King's troops on the Continent? - A. I do not know; the people I enquired of said he had been on the Continent.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a great many cloaks lying upon the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have slipped down? - A. It might, but it could not have slipped under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you apprehend her? - A. She had not got past the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she looking at some articles in the window? - A. Yes, she was just going to move off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make any enquiry respecting Mrs. Hutchinson? - A. Yes; she answered the description of that Mrs. Hutchinson of Oxford-road, she wore spectacles, and is a person of very good character.</p>

(Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. There was nobody between you and him after he came out of your shop? - A. I never lost sight of him after I came to the shop door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you got out how far was the prisoner from you? - A. About four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. I should suppose, if he was the same person, he must have got farther than that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks in the hats? - A. Yes; I wrote Mr. Combes's name in it, it was bought by Mr. Alderman Combes's brother; I had been at work upon it not five minutes before.</p>

               <p>Mrs. SAUNDERS sworn. - I live at No. 14, Little Maze-pond; my husband is a baker; I work needle-work; I was sitting at my own door at work: On the 2d of August, about half past three o'clock, the child came to me, she had been crying very much; she asked me if I would shew her the way to the Fleet; I told her, she was a great way off from the Fleet; oh dear ma'am, says she, my daddy lives in the Fleet, will you take me home to him; she had a silk handkerchief crossed over her arms, and the four corners tied behind; I asked her, if she was lame; she said, no, a woman had brought her, and took her frock and skirt off, and tied that about her, and told her, she would buy her a new one, and give her a new pair of green shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner? - A. No, not till I saw her in custody. I took her home, and about a week after, she came with her mother, and shewed us the door where the woman had taken her things off.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Dawson). What day was it you lost the child? - A. The 2d of August, about eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. But did you see him afterwards? - A. Yes, at the Flying-horse, on the 23d, opposite the Justice's office; I had applied at Lambeth-street for a warrant on the 22d in the evening to Col. Williams, and he was taken up; he came to the Flying-horse, and two or three along with him, and asked if I was going to make it up; I said, yes, I had no objection if he would give me my things; he said, not till I had paid him his bill; he said, if I would give him two or three glasses of wine, he would talk to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with him? - A. No; then I went over to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention at first that you had lost the goods, or did you only complain of the blow that you had received? - A. I only took out a warrant for the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you mentioned more particularly the whole of the business? - A. Yes, and then the Magistrate committed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the cloaths since? - A. Yes, I saw them at the Justice's, and my watch with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. So this man brought you from on board a ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I strongly suspect he paid for your carriage to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he occasionally lent you some money? - A. He gave me two guineas in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Which, I dare say, you, like a silly sailor, just come on shore, spent as fast as you could? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought things for you, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And paid money for you for different things? - A. Yes, in bad company.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought you a jacket, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought you some silk stockings, did not he? - A. No, silk and cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought you a shirt, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And blue trowsers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What might he pay for you in this bad company? - A.Four pounds fifteen shillings, as near as I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did not he spend a great deal of money in liquor for you in your drunken frolics? - A. He paid for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he told you, I believe, that you owed him a great deal of money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he asked you to give an order to receive your wages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By that time you had ran up a good score, had not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a little quicker than him, for you went and got your wages first? - A. I asked him if he had seen the captain, and he said no, he had been, and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he tell you your bill was? - A.Twenty-two pounds seventeen shillings and eight pence.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after he learned that you had got your wages from the captain that he gave you that blow upon the nose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very angry that you had received your wages? - A. I did not know that; he ran up stairs, and gave me a blow on the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take out the warrant for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120010"/>blow upon the nose, and nothing else? - A. Yes, the Justice would not hear it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you get a warrant for, for the blow on the nose, or for taking the bundle? - A. For the blow on the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say any thing about the bundle then? - A. They said, if I had any thing more to say, I might say it to-morrow morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the sweetheart he recommended to you, and went to your other sweetheart, Mrs. Prager? - A. No, she was no sweetheart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sleep there? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not he say he would take that bundle, and keep it till you paid him? - A. I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did he not say he would keep that bundle till you paid him? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He took the bundle to his own house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, I will keep this bundle till you discharge my bill? - A. No, he gave it to his wife for her to lock up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you repeatedly, that when you paid him his bill, you should have your cloaths, and that you should not have them till then? - A. No, he did not say so that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell him, if he would give you your cloaths, you would give him a note upon your return from the next voyage? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were persons there who heard you, now be a little careful; did not you tell him at the Flying-horse, that you would give him a note for the remainder of his bill, if he would give you up the cloaths? - A. He said he would not give them me if I did such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you made him that offer to give him a note for the remainder of the money, did not he refuse it, and say, he would not part with the cloaths unless you paid him ready money? - A. He did not say any thing about ready money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he not say I must have my money, or something of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Prager was by at the time he took the cloaths? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no secret of it to her, did he; he took them away before her face? - A. Yes, he took them out from under her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the people asked you at the public-house, what you did owe him, did not they? - A. I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at the office that you believed you owed him eighteen or nineteen pounds? - A. No, I did not say any thing about how much I owed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never asked by any body whether you owed him any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are sure that the prisoner took the things in the way in which you have described? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A great deal has been said of what passed at the Flying-horse-you were anxious to get on board a ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you offered him the note, that you might get your cloaths, and not be detained from going on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason then for offering the note? - A. Because I wanted to go to see if they would let me have my cloaths.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were employed to wash for him the last month? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time that he bought any things? - A. Yes; he bought a coat, a pair of pantaloons, a pair of white stockings, a pocket-handkerchief, and a watch, to the amount of 5l.; he paid for them, and desired me to bring them home to my lodgings, which I did; when I got home, I put them upon the table, and soon after he came in all over blood, and soon after that the prisoner came in; I think it was the 22d, it was on a Wednesday; when he came in, I had my hand upon the bundle; I was talking to Barry, and he came in and said, whose bundle is this? I said, it is mine; he said, I will let you know it is mine, and took it away from me; from thence he returned to the chair, and took the outside jacket that the man has on now, and put it under his arm, and then he took the waistcoat; he put his hand into the pocket, and took out a watch; he told Barry that he had robbed him, that he would have him to Newgate; upon that he went away from the house.</p>

               <p>Q. So that these things were taken away from your house? - A. Yes; I rent the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your husband's name Henry? - A. Yes; Barry then went away after Purnell; I saw them both the next day at the Flying-horse; he got abusing of Barry, and said he would have him out of the place because he was a foreigner, and he could get five pounds by him; I told him he could not, for my husband was a foreigner, and I knew better than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose handkerchief was this bundle wrapped up in? - A. Mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. So I understand you are an old acquaintance of the prosecutor's, but a stranger to the defendant? - A. Yes; I washed for his brother three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money might you have spent for him? - A. I did not spend any; he laid out five pounds while I was with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he lay out any other sum that day while you were with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120011"/>Q. What money did you see besides that? - A. I saw a twenty pound note.</p>

               <p>Q. What passed at your house? - A. Mr. Purnell asked whose bundle that was, and I said it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you to say that it was your's? - A. The handkerchief was mine, and it was delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the sailor owed that poor man money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard any conversation about his owing him money? - A. No, never till after Purnell was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prosecutor said after that, that he did owe the prisoner money? - A. He said he owed him some money for board and lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he say he owed him? - A. I cannot say; he said, if he would give him his clothes, he would give him a note to pay the remainder of the money that he owed him upon his return from his next voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know you told a lie when you said it was your bundle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You had this bundle delivered to you by the poor sailor, to protect his property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your reason for so saying was, that the handkerchief was your's and the bundle being delivered into your care - Upon you oath did you yourself take any part of this poor sailor's money, or receive any benefit therefrom? - A. Yes, I sent for a pot of ale to drink, and that was all.</p>

             sworn. I am one of the officers belonging to Lambeth-street: On the 22d of August I received a warrant for an assault, and on the 23d I went down to execute it; I saw Purnell, and told him I had a warrant against him; he said, very well, he would go with me; he said, it would be more convenient to go at six o'clock in the evening, and he did come up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made no search, as you had only a warrant for an assault? - A. No; the next morning I went to his house with a search warrant; I asked for Mrs. Purnell, and they told me she was in bed; I desired one of the young women to go up stairs with me; I went into the room, and she delivered this bundle up to me (producing it); I have bad it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You went in consequence of a warrant granted by the Magistrate against this man; that was for the assault only? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Purnell knew who it was that charged him with the assault? - A. The sailor went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then attempt to charge him with any thing else but breaking his nose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear Purnell mention that he had those things, and would keep them till the money was paid him? - A. I believe I heard him say he had them at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before you executed the search warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He made no secret of it that he had these goods? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say he had them for? - A. I was there but a very few minutes, and I cannot recollect what passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you not hear him say he took them for the payment of his bill, and he would not part with them till the bill was paid. - A. No, I did not, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prosecutor talked about giving him a note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Barry.) Look at these things, and tell the jury if they are your's? - A. Yes, they are.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Upon you oath do not you believe that that man took them for the security of his debt, though it was against your will? - A. I did not know what I owed him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you believe you owed him some money at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do not you believe he took these things to make you pay him the money you owed him? - A. It might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he did? - A. I cannot tell, I had paid him eleven pounds before, and I did not know that I owed him any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he took them to force you to pay the money? - A. He might; he said he would give me the clothes when I came home; it could not be upon that consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe that he took them to compel you to pay him the money that he said you owed him - Did you think he took them for any other reason? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. Under the circumstances of this case, I think it is a very different thing from a larceny: to be sure this man seems to me to have behaved extermely ill, and that we shall have him here again, I think is by no means improbable; but it is your duty and mine, to keep the time between an immoral act and a felonious act, otherwise, we shall have enternal confusion, It is very clear that this man has attempted to screw as much as he could out of this poor foreigner, but the question for us to decide is, whether it was a deliberate plan from the beginning, to get his goods, or was it his intention merely to secure the payment of a very extravagant bill? - The latter seems to me to be the case; and therefore, with my utter disapprobation of the whole of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120012"/>transaction on the part of the prisoner, I think you will do amiss if you see it in any other view than as a means of extorting from this poor sailor, an extravagant bill, and that it was not a plot originally laid for the purpose of obtaining his goods. You see, when he was apprehended for the assault, he makes no secret of having these goods, but says he shall not have them till he has paid him his bill. That seems to me, very plainly, the state of the case, and therefore you will acquit him of this charge, however much you will convict him in your own minds of having extorted this money from the prosecutor.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Elstree; I know the prisoner and the deceased very well; I keep the Artichoke; they were both at my house about eight or nine weeks ago, I cannot say exactly when, it was the day that Birdseye was killed; the beginning of the quarrel was, that East said he had paid some money for him, and, says he, you have never paid me; he jumped up and said, d-n your eyes, if I have never paid you, I will pay you; and then he kicked him; and East hopped about a good while before he could stand; then Birdseye took hold of East's collar, and said d - your eyes, I will fight you; East said, no, you are a better man than I, I will not fight you; and then he said, d - your eyes, you shall fight; then Birdseye threw East down, and beat him and kicked him, and used him very ill again; and said, he would serve any body the same that assisted him; then I begged East to go home, I took him away as well as I could; he went with me a little way, and then Birdseye came after him; I asked him what he wanted with him; he said, he would follow him, and d - his eyes, he would give him a good hiding before he got home.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a labourer at St. Alban's: I was at Elstree the day that Birdseye was killed, I cannot tell what day it was; I saw the prisoner and Birdseye at the Artichoke, just as I left work, I saw them wrestling in the yard; they kicked one another several times, and then East said, I will give out, you are a better man than I am; he said he pinched him so hard he could not bear it; Birdseye said he should not give out; I saw the prisoner come out of the yard towards home, and Birdseye followed him, and then East threw a stone at Birdseye.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing before he threw it? - A. No, I did not hear him say a word; then I heard East say, I will shoot you if you follow me home to my premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Birdseye say any thing to him? - A. He said he would take away the stone from him if he could, that is all I heard; then East went home, and Birdseye followed him, and then East came out to the door with a gun in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Birdseye stand? - A. I cannot say; I did not see him shoot him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a shoemaker, I knew the deceased and the prisoner: On the 11th of July, hearing a noise in the street, I looked out at my own shop-window, about three yards from East's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Artichoke? - A. I think about a quarter of a mile; I saw East seemingly in a great passion, saying, if he came to his house he would shoot him; I could not tell then who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there besides East and Birdseye? - A. There was Pickett with Birdseye, and one Hamilton, a labourer; East was first by himself, then he came to his own house, and went in at his door; he was gone in the space of half a minute, and then returned to the door with a gun in his hand, declaring that if he came there he would shoot him; upon that, he took the gun and presented it, bearing against his right hip, with one foot on the stone step, and the other in doors; then Birdseye came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120013"/>up, and Pickett and Hamilton stood right in the front of him, in the middle of the highway; and one of them, I cannot say which, said shoot; I rather think it was Birdseye, he said shoot again; and then they repeated a few words of a song:"Shoot at random in a wood,"At some curious lady wheresoe'er she stood." then Hamilton said, go it; and then Birdseye made a rush, seemingly to seize the gun; with that, before he got within half a yard of the muzzle of the gun I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the gun go off? - A. I cannot say, I believe he had it against his hip, Birdseye fell; I saw no more then, but came out of door's to go to East's house, Birdseye was then brushing his wound, and looking at it; then he got weak, and slipped down, and called to Cowley, and said, Cowley, give me hold of your hand, for I am a dead man; then there was a cry where East was, they said he was gone out backwards through his garden, and into Mr. Berry's field; I immediately went after him, in pursuit, to take him, and when I got into Mr. Berry's field, about half way up it, I saw William East in an alley between a gentleman's pleasure ground and a nursery ground; as soon as he saw me he came towards me, and as soon as I got pretty near him, he said, I hope in the Lord I have not killed him; I immediately said, I fancy you have, or very near; but you must go back again with me, and answer for what you have done; upon which he replied, and said, I do not care where I go, or what you do to me, it was all his own act and deed, for he aggravated me to it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When you first saw the deceased he was in a great rage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Mr. Const, can you carry it any further?</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. A.Certainly not, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Mr. Knapp, you do not mean to say he did not kill the man?</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. A. We mean to shew, by evidence, that the gun went off by accident, occasioned by the man seizing it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. On Wednesday the 11th of July, I was standing at tea, and heard a noise in the street; I looked out, and saw East, the prisoner, go by in a passion; he swore he would be d - d to hell, if he followed him, if he would not shoot him; Birdseye then came up, with two others, and was going to turn into the Plough, but turned back again, and said, he would go and see what he would do; and then East came out with the gun, and said, he would shoot him, and he told him to shoot away; and he said he would be d - d to hell if he would not shoot him if he came near him; then there was some conversation, which I did not hear, I was at forty yards distance; and then somebody said, go it; and then I heard the report; he said to me, God bless you do what you can for me, I am a dead man; I took two small shot out of his side where the wound was; I looked after the man, and he was brought back; I asked him how he could do such a rash action; and he said, we might hang him if we would, for if he was aggravated to it, and if it was to do again he should do the same.</p>
               <p>The Court being of opinion that it was too much to say, upon the evidence, that the gun went off by accident; and also, too much to say, under the circumstances of aggravation, that it was wilful murder; the Jury pronounced a verdict of</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you don't know that it has happened before and since this accident, that there have been quarrels between coal-heavers and press-gangs? - A. Not to my knowledge, there might for any thing I know; but I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you at home the whole of that evening? - A. Yes, from five o'clock till the time it happened.</p>

               <p>Mr. YEOMANS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a surgeon, No. 60, New Gravel-lane; I saw the body of the deceased on the 27th of August; the first wound that I examined was under the left breast; it had penetrated about two inches into the abdomen muscles, which would have occasioned his death; the next wound was in the upper part of the left thigh, near the groin, which had penetrated into the intestines; the large artery of the thigh was cut in two, and the vessels entirely empty; either of them alone must have been the cause of his death.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a watchman; I was on duty near this place; I was called to the spot by Canty; I was on duty from ten o'clock at night till four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular happen that night? - A. When I went round at eleven o'clock every thing was quiet and still, and about half past eleven, or twenty minutes before twelve, I was coming back to my box again; my box is at Mr. Phillips's brewhouse, about 400 yards from where the corpse laid, as nigh as I can judge; when I came up to where the deceased laid, his nephew was supporting him against his knees, and when I came up to him, he was feeling about the temples and round his head to feel for any wound or blows that he had received, but he could find none.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean Canty? - A. Yes; and he desired me to support him till he went to his lodgings to get more assistance; he was gone about a minute and a half, or two minutes, and there came eight or ten people, men and women, to our assistance, and while the nephew was gone, a man dragged him up to a higher part of the ground, and he exclaimed three times, he is stabbed, he is stabbed, he is stabbed; then I sprung my rattle; I went a little further and sprung it again; and then I went to Spring-street and sprung it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. So soon as you had discovered that the man was stabbed, you very properly sprung your rattle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had discovered that before, you would have sprung your rattle before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The nephew was feeling over the temples for the wounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it if you had seen the man stabbed, you would have known where to look for the wounds? - A. Yes, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your box was about 400 yards from the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment the nephew returned, there came several people, eight or ten? - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When these people came, and you supported the corpse, did these people come out before him, or did he come first? - A.They followed him to where the deceased was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The people clustered round the corpse, I take it for granted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with them when they were dragging him to a higher part of the ground? - A. He was present then, and assisted in getting him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stripped then? - A. No further than to see the wound in his left breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any riot or fighting in the course of that night? - A. No, every thing was quiet when I went round at eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. A moonlight, clear night, and a fine evening.</p>

             M'Carry's, at near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120018"/>eleven o'clock, where we had been with the shipwright to have a pot of beer, coming out I laid hold of his arm; we had not gone far, before we men a woman; the passage being narrow, he says to me, give her the wall; we had not passed far before a man came up; he asked what was the matter? Sampson said, nothing was the matter; we had not gone two minutes further, before a voice called us back to have some beer, in an Irish tone; and in about two minutes after that there came a stone, and took me on the side of the head; I called out to Sampson, by the help of God clear yourself if you can, and I saw no more of Sampson till I came on board; before I went on board, I went to a woman and told her of it; then I went back to the Boarded entry, and called my shipmate, but could not get an answer, and then I went to the waterman, and told my story, and he told me some expressions that Sampson had told him, and I said, I hoped it was not so; I am innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Sampson's defence. I was coming with Middlemas from Mr. M'Carty's, about eleven o'clock; we laid hold of each other's arm, and proceeded to go on board; we met a woman in the passage; I said to my mess-mate, let us give her the wall; accordingly he said, certainly; she had not passed us but a little distance, when we met a man; he asked us what was the matter? I answered, nothing; my shipmate asked if there was any offence? to which he replied, none; we bid him good night, and walked on; a voice then called after us to have some beer, in broad Irish language; I said, we had had quite sufficient; then we went on but a very little distance, when we were assaulted with stones; one of the stones hit me on the side of my head; he immediately flew from my arm, and cried out, by the held of God, carpenter, clear yourself if you can: I turned round, and the stones were flying very hot; thinking my life in great danger, and thinking every moment that my brains would be knocked out, I pulled out my knife; a man immediately seized hold of me, and we both fell down, and I suppose in the fall the wound might happen; I ran away with the loss of my hat, expecting a second attack; I then went to a woman and told her of it, and she said, it was most prudent to make the best of my way aboard, and she conducted me to Wapping-wall, and then I knew where I was; I went to Shadwell, and told the waterman we had been attacked in a furious manner, and had lost my hat, and he put me off on board, and when I found the mate was not there, I was very much afraid; but I had not been many minutes on board, before he came on board; there was a boy on board that knew the place better than me, and we went on shore to look for the hat, and when we got to the stairs, the runners laid hold of us.</p>

I think it might be near the hour of twelve I heard the quarrel; at the first of it between eleven and twelve; most of the language was Irish, which gave me little concern, because it is a usual, thing that I am accustomed to in that same track; I threw my window up, I heard a man that ran call out, with a loud voice, clear yourself, carpenter, if you can; instead of the carpenter getting clear, he went into a strong bustle, which continued about the space of two minutes, as if they had hold of each other, while the brick-bats were going very fast; then I heard them go to the ground, but in what manner I do not know; then one with a loud, and a hard voice, called out, oh Lord! Lord! Lord!</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as state to my Lord, and the Jury, what passed, when they came into your house? - A. I was at tea in the bar with another young woman; Bartholomew came into the bar, and asked if he could sit down there; I said, they might; and they all three sat down in the bar, and a lifeguards-man, of the name of Sharp, sat down with them; they then called for some porter, and some gin and water, and some bread and cheese; they had it; they sat there for some time, till very near nine o'clock in the evening; I then had occasion to go up the yard, to light a person out, with a candle;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120021"/>when I came down the yard, the candle went out, Wilson, the soldier, that was quartered at our house, was standing making water before me in an indecent manner, I did not observe it myself, Symonds was behind me, I did not know it; Symonds said, it was a very indecent manner for him to stand in; Wilson and Symonds then went into the parlour, and wanted to fight; the two prisoners were then in the bar; I went into the parlour, and said, for God's sake, do not fight there; I then fell into fits, being frightened, and they took me into the bar; it was as much as five or six people could do to hold me; after that, Wilson and Symonds went out of the house to drink together somewhere; they came in again, and Symonds came into the bar to his other company, they had been gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; then they sat down drinking again in the bar; the quarrel then seemed all made up entirely, and they all three called Wilson into the bar, several times, to drink with them; he went in to drink with them, and then went into the kitchen to his comrade, Wakefield, who was quartered with him, and this old <rs id="t17980912-15-viclabel83" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

               <p>Q. Was this exactly at the time that Wilson and Symonds were shaking hands, and said, it was all made up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Knight, the other prisoner, at that time? - A. In the bar. I then said, to Wilson and Wakefield, there has been a piece of work in the beginning of the evening, now you had better go to bed; Knight then jumped up, and held the kitchen-door; the kitchen-door, and the bar-door are near together, and through that door was a way for them to go up to bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Wakefield and Wilson had not then moved to the door? - A. No. I said, to Knight, why should you hold the door, to prevent them from going to bed; then Bartholomew knocked down Wakefield, and Symonds knocked down Wilson, the other soldier; and the sailor, the deceased

               <p>Court. Q. Had he interfered at all in the quarrel? - A. No, he had not said a word; Symonds hit him with his double fist in the stomach, and knocked him back against the wooden knob of the door, and hit him and kicked him about several times after he was down.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, had the deceased said any thing, or attempted to do any thing towards this man? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole of this transaction, where was Knight situated? - A. He continued keeping the door all the time; Wilson and Wakefield bled a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they upon the ground at the time that Symonds struck the sailor? - A. Yes, they were in liquor, and the blow had stupified them so, that they were not able to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. About what age was the deceased? - A. Near 60, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he or not of a quiet, peaceable disposition? - A. Very much so, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was knocked down and trampled upon - was that what became of him? - A. All the three men ran away, the two prisoners at the bar, and Symonds, without paying the reckoning, and the two soldiers and the deceased got up soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long the deceased lived after? - A. Yes; they all three went to bed; he got up on the Wednesday morning and went about, but complained that he was very poorly, and the next day the same, and on the Friday he went for me to my brewer's, at Pimlico.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complaint of any part in particular? - A. I did not hear him complain of any part in particular; when he came back from Pimlico, I asked him whether he would have a glass of gin or a pint of porter; I had left him some Irish stew for his dinner, and he chose a pint of porter; after that he took a trunk to Clare-market; he came back about nine in the evening, and had a pint of porter, and while he was having his porter, he said, he was very sick; I said, Hayes, do not be nasty, to spit the blood about the floor, you had better go up stairs to bed; I sent somebody up stairs with him, and they came down, and said he was very bad indeed, and I sent for a surgeon to him; the surgeon told me I must take particular care of him, and keep him quiet; I left people in the room with him; about three o'clock on the Saturday morning he was very bad indeed, bringing up blood; I then sent for the surgeon again, and the surgeon said it was of no use to send any thing for him, for he was a dying man, and he died about half past six o'clock that morning; he was very sensible, called me by my name, and told me how hard he died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had known Bartholomew before some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had done business at your house as a <rs id="t17980912-15-deflabel84" type="occupation">recruiting serjeant</rs>

                        targets="t17980912-15-defend180 t17980912-15-deflabel84"/>? - A.Sometimes he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120022"/>Q. He had done business there that day? - A.He came to settle with captain steele, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he came, he came in company with these two men, Symonds and Knight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say every thing went on very well till Wilson had been guilty of this indecency towards you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a good deal shocked, I believe, at the indecency of Wilson's conduct, in the presence of a decent woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon that Symonds was very angry, and that began the quarrel? - A. Yes; Bartholomew had often used my house, but I never saw any thing amiss of him; Knight and Symonds I had never seen before, but one evening I saw Knight when I buried my husband, about a month before.</p>
               <p>Q. Wakefield was the comrade of Wilson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore they sat together as friends, and a party of their own? - A. Yes, with Hayes, in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. The soldiers were both in soldier's clothes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Hayes was very quiet, and took no part at all in the business? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a sailor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At eleven o'clock, when they were going, the expression of Bartholomew to Symonds was, you take one, I will take the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Symonds attacked one soldier, and Bartholomew fought the other soldier? - A. Yes; Knight did not strike any of them, he was holding the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the two persons selected as combatants were the two soldiers, Symonds taking one, and

               <p>Q. You say now, and have always said, that with respect to any ill usage given by Symonds to poor Hayes, Bartholomew took no part? - A. No, he only fought with Wakefield.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Symonds knocked down poor Hayes, he took no part whatever in it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe captain Steele called to know if Bartholomew was there to settle the account? - A. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How is the bar and the kitchen situated? - A. The kitchen and the bar are together.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Must Hayes necessarily pass that door to go to the bar? - A. Yes; he had just got to the door when he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then probably if the door had not been shut, he might have got out that way? - A.Certainly he could.</p>
               <p>Q. And of course that would have been his shortest way to get out of this affray? - A. Certainly it would.</p>
               <p>Q. However, from the dresser he was coming towards the door, and towards the bar? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I was at that time an assistant to Mrs. Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the two prisoners, with Symonds, coming to your house? - A. Yes, they came in about six o'clock in the evening, and they staid drinking till about nine in the evening very comfortably; Mrs. Marshall went up to light somebody out, and as she came back the candle blew out; one of the soldiers was standing very indecently before Mrs. Marshall; Symonds was behind her, and talked to him very much for standing in that manner; many words ensued, he was going to fight Wilson; Mrs. Marshall was very much frightened, and went into fits, and when the Russian, Symonds, saw that, he was very sorry, and made it up with Wilson, and they came in and drank together, and were very comfortable; it was all made up till twelve o'clock, when the two soldiers were going to get up to go to bed; Mrs. Marshall and I wanted them to go to bed, but Wilson was very much in liquor, and he stood equivocating and talking with Symonds, but not quarrelling; Symonds said to him, will you go to bed, or what do you want, or will you fight? no, says Wilson, I do not want to fight; Symonds laid hold of his hand when he stood at the bar door, and while he had hold of his hand, he said, d-you, what will you have now, I will fight you now; Bartholomew, the prisoner at the bar, then got up, went forward, and struck Wakefield, one of the soldiers, two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he struck him, did he say any thing? - A. He said some phrase or word which I did not understand, like chiac; then Symonds came out of the bar and struck Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of these blows? - A. Wilson and Wakefield both fell on the ground; I did not know that the blows being so rapid was the reason, but they were so in liquor, that they were not able to assist themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Knight do any thing at this time? - A. He did not strike any body; he shut to the door, but with what intention I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. These men then were lying on the ground? - A. Yes; then Hayes was coming across the kitchen to get into the bar, for fear, I suppose, that he should get hurt, and as he came across the kitchen, he unfortunately received a blow or a push, and fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night, had you any conversation with Knight? - A. Not particular, several words passed; I heard him say, that in the course of the evening there might be a fight, or he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120023"/>dare say there would be a fight; I think he said, he dare say there would be a fight.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he when he said that? - A. In the bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long before the blows were given was it that he said that? - A. In the evening, after the quarrel was made up, while they were friends, and drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hayes complain much? - A. He laid a bed part of the next day, and when he got up, I asked him how he was, and he rather complained of his head; on the Thursday and Friday he was very well; he went to Pimlico on Friday, and came back and eat a very hearty dinner, but about nine o'clock in the evening, and from that time till past six in the morning, when he died, he scarce ever ceased vomiting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Had Wakefield and Wilson been quarrelsome in the former part of the evening? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The only provocation came from Wilson's indecent behaviour to Mrs. Marshall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They had never spoke at all to Hayes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And all the fighting began with Wakefield, and Wilson, and Bartholomew, and Symonds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Hayes was no party in the fighting? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday and Friday he was very well? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the evening did you first see them? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect either of them speaking to you when you were in the yard? - A.No, neither of the prisoners, Symonds did; he chastised me, as he said, for making water in an improper manner, and wanted to quarrel with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he quarrel with you? - A. No, there was no dispute at that time, it was all settled till such time as I was going to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed at the time you were going to bed? - A. He came out of the bar, and asked me to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you in the kitchen? - A. My comrade, Wakefield.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the deceased, Hayes? - A. Yes, he was in the kitchen, at the further end of the dresser; I told Symonds I did not wish to drink any more; Symonds said, he hoped there was no animosity; I said, no, I never had any animosity to any man; then he asked me to shake hands, and bid me good night, and then he knocked me down, and after that I never saw what passed; when I came to myself, they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Just before Symonds knocked you down, did you see or hear any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear nothing said? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the situation of Knight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- WAKEFIELD sworn. I belong to the Coldstream regiment of guards; I was billetted at the Thistle and Crown on the 30th of January; on the evening of that day the two prisoners and the Russian came in, and were drinking the greatest part of the afternoon; I do not recollect what time they came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Wilson going out into the yard? - A. I heard some dispute between Wilson and the Russian; they were drinking in the bar, and my comrade, Wilson, drank along with them some considerable time, and they had a dispute several times over and over, and at last they made it up together; then Mrs. Marshall wanted us to go to bed; we had a candle in our hands to go to bed, and Wilson and Symonds were shaking hands together, and seeing there was no animosity between either one or the other, and then he knocked Wilson down, and Bartholomew knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Symonds knock him down immediately after they had declared there was no animosity? - A. They were hand in hand at the time, shaking hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said just before that? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the situation of Knight just at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were knocked down, were you able to discern what passed? - A. No, I bled very much, and was senseless.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know before this where Hayes was in the kitchen? - A. He was sitting at the time I saw him in a chair by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him rise to pass along the kitchen? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Bartholomew knocked you down with a blow of his fist? - A. Yes.</p>

            , who, they said, was dying from a vomiting of blood; I found he had vomited a very large quantity, from which he appeared very low and saint; Mrs. Marshall informed me he had had a blow in the stomach; he said, he had been very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120024"/>much abused, but did not say by whom, but put his hand up to his left eye; after desiring him to be kept quiet, I went home to prepare some medicines for him; about three I was called to him again, and found he had vomited a great quantity more of blood; I went to him, and found he was a dying man; I was present afterwards at the opening of the body; I examined it, and found a discoloration upon one of the smaller intestines, and another upon one of the large ones; the liver was of very extraordinary appearance, and the right kidney was much larger than the left, and of a soft, pulpy seel, with a perforation in it, and in the abdomen, I suppose, pretty near a pint of fluid, which indicated that the man, had he lived, might have become dropsical; we opened the thorax, and found the lungs adhering very strongly to the adjacent parts; we opened the stomach, and found it inflamed; we found also about three or four ounces of blood some what coagulated; we were at no loss of judge from whence that proceeded.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence do you suppose that proceeded? A. From the stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to trace the cause of his death to any particular injury that he had received? - A. I understood he had received his blow three days before; the stomach had been in a very unhealthy state before that, and therefore not able to bear the blow.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you think that such a blow was the cause of death, the stomach not being in good order? - A.Certainly; it is very clear that the stomach could not have received such a blow, without producing very great mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the hemorrhage proceeded from the blow? - A. I cannot pretend positively to say that; that is more than I can say; the external appearances were, a confusion upon the left eye, one upon the right ear, and a considerable one on the side.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the appearance of the body, was there any thing that should lead you to suppose the man would have died in three days, if he had not received that blow? - A. That is impossible for me to tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you think would be the effect of such a blow upon an unhealthy stomach? - A.It might have caused death or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say that the hemorrhage proceeded from the blow? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say that the rupture of the blood vessel might or not proceed from a violent blow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It might proceed from carrying a weight, or over much exercise? - A.It might</p>
               <p>Q. There was not the least outward appearance of a blow upon the part? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot decide with certainty that the rupture of the blood vessel was in consequence of the blow that he had received? - A. There is no doubt but a blow may produce it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A. violent blow upon a diseased stomach might produce death? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court Q. But whether it is so in any particular instance, it is very difficult for you to say? - A. It is.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I was called in, on the 5th of February last, to examine the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state to the Court what was the condition of the corpse? - A. There were several bruises in different part of it; there was one on the right side of his neck, his left eye was bruised, and his loins were bruised, I did not see any other external marks; I proceeded to open the body immediately; I found that the small intestines were discoloured, as though they had received some violence; there was likewise discoloration of the large intestine; I then examined the different vessels, and in the stomach I found a very considerable quantity of blood; this man's viscera, independent of this, was in a very diseased state; he had a considerable quantity of water in his belly, as though a dropsy had begun to take place; but I have no doubt that he died from the hemorrhage in the stomach; I found also, that the right kidney was larger than the left.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgement, from what caused did that hemorrhage proceed? - A. I could not have conceived any cause whatever, unless I had been told that he had received a blow.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will a violent blow on the stomach produce a hemorrhage? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of the kidneys being one larger than the other? - A. That I take not to have originated in a recent cause, but in an abscess, I should suppose, of long date.</p>
               <p>Cross-examiend by Mr. Knowlys. Q. No doubt a man may die of a rupture of a vessel, without having received a blow? - A.Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the extremely diseased state of that body exhibit an appearance very liable to ruptured vessels? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Coroner, did you at all say, that you absolutely affixed it to any cause arising from the blow? - A. Yes, surely I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, it arose from an inflammation? - A. Yes, occasioned by the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had carried a heavy weight, do you think that might not have produced a rupture of the vessel? - A. Certainly; I think it was a very improper think for him in the diseased state of his viscera, it might have accelerated the circulation so much, as to have brought on an hemorrhage.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120025"/>Q. But do you not believe; that carrying a heavy weight, on the Friday evening, might have caused that hemorrhage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance: the carrying a heavy weight from Charing-cross to Clare-market would increase the danger? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And more particularly if this same unhealthy man had walked from Charing-cross to Pimlico, and back? - A.Certainly; that would add to the liability of a ruptured vessel.</p>
               <p>Bartholomew's defence. My Lord, we are totally innocent of the charge; the deceased I never saw in the course of the evening at all; and when he was struck, I never saw him struck at all.</p>
               <p>Knight's defence. I went in to ask for Bartholomew, and they said, he was up stairs, with his officer, and I waited for him; Mrs. Marshall went to light the officer out, and Wilson was standing in a very indecent way, and Symonds and he stripped to fight; I fetched Bartholomew down to prevent them, and then they made it up; I said to Miss Taylor, in the evening, I would lay a wager they would fight yet, before they went to bed, for they seemed rather quarrelsome all the evening; and then, at night, when they did fight, I would not let Mrs. Marshall go in among them, because she had been in fits at only hearing them talk of fighting, and as they were going to fight I told her she had better let them fight it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, I have an objection to take, which, perhaps, I ought to have taken before.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I take it, that wherever death is charged, as happening in the prosecution of an illegal act, to which the parties then before the Court are alledged to have been present, aiding and abetting, it must appear most strictly in evidence, that it arose from the very individual act in which those persons charged as aiders and abetters were then engaged, and from no other act whatever; though it might happen at the same time, it might not be the immediate and necessary consequence of that act in which they were engaged.</p>

               <p>My Lord. There are certainly a number of cases to fortify that position, the principle has been adopted, and has never been disputed; I apply the principle this way. It stands, prima facie, in evidence, that these two parties did agree, at the house of Mrs. Marshall, to engage with two soldiers, one of them saying, you attack one, and I will attack the other; and that, in consequence of that, each of them took his man, and did attack him; that is certainly an illegal purpose, in which these two men, Bartholomew and Knight, were engaged; one of them actively, and the other being present and approving of it, while the other man, Symonds, was engaged in his part of that illegal act; but I submit to your Lordship, taking it upon this evidence, that for nothing corollary to that act are they answerable. Now, if the man with whom Symonds was engaged had died by the bruises which Symonds inflicted upon him, I mean Wilson, I cannot say that Bartholomew would not have been answerable for his share in the homicide of Wilson. I do not mean to put that - I think he would. But, my Lord, I take it, that the attack upon Hayes was perfectly unknown both to Bartholomew and Knight, it was a thing not in their contemplation at the time that the violation of the law first took place, as I think appears most clearly upon the evidence; for after Bartholomew has mastered his man, Wakefield, he desists, and does not take up the other man to whom Symonds was opposed; he takes no share in Symonds's part as against Wilson, but confines himself to his man, each of them selecting his antagonist, and each beating his antagonist; there Bartholomew stops, and goes no further. Unfortunately, this man Symonds, whose bad blood was roused by his success against Wilson, chuses to transfer the purpose with which they originally set out, namely, as a combat as between Wilson and him and as between Bartholomew and Wakefield, he chuses to transfer his purpose to another person, perfectly unknown, as I contend, upon this evidence, to Bartholomew and to Knight; - Hayes is not present as taking a share in the combat, either to part them, or at all interfering with Symonds, he having mastered Wilson, and knocked him down, sees the other man coming across the kitchen, his ill temper is roused, and he falls upon that other man. My Lord, for argument sake, I will suppose for a moment, that he occasioned the death of Hayes; then I put it, that this is not a general agreement to break the peace, but an agreement between two men to fight other two men; and that, for all the consequence that arose to those two men, I admit all the three parties are answerable, but no moral consequences ensue. Then, I say, there is nothing tending to shew a general purpose to break the peace, but merely upon Wakefield and Wilson; why then, my Lord, I take it, that this position has been fortified by cases, and by strong cases. The case that I shall first quote to your Lordship, is to be found in Keyling's Reports, the case of the King's, Plummer; a case in which a special verdict was found; and it was argued before all the Judges; - that special verdict stated, that

            , and others, to the number of eight, assembled to run wool; and that while they were so assembled, in pursuance of an illegal purpose, some officers of his Majesty appeared with intent to seize this wool; upon which, one of the eight who were engaged in this transaction of smuggling, fired his susee, in which one of his comrades was killed; and the Judges, in that case, said, that he who fired the gun, and he alone, should answer for it; if the special verdict had found that he fired the gun at the King's officers, most unquestionably all the eight would have been guilty of murder, though they murdered a man they did not intend to murder; because their purpose certainly was against those officers, whom they had had no legal power to resist; but as that is not found, says the Court, we can only take the facts as they are found; and upon those facts, it does not appear, that although these eight persons were engaged in a high illegal transaction, it does not appear that their joint illegal purpose at all touched that comrade of theirs who fell by the shot of the men who did fire, and therefore, though the man who fired the shot being engaged in an illegal purpose must answer for that purpose, yet those who were equally engaged in an illegal purpose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120026"/>are not answerable for it. Therefore, I think, that case fortifies me upon facts, that this case cannot be distinguished from it in principle, and that, therefore I ought to have the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there is another case, which, if possible, seems to come nearer still to the present: it is a case frequently cited, and the only printed note, I can find of it, is in Leach, page 6, it is entitled, the case of the King v. Hodgson and others. There the party, whose goods were liable to distrained by his landlord Hodgson, assembles number of other persons with him to take away those goods, which the landlord was about to distrain; a constable makes his appearance, and a fighting ensues; while the rest of the party were parting, one of them saw a child at the door, and with barbarity, which one cannot sufficiency condemn, he chuses to strike this child, of which blow the child died, and all the parties were charged, as aiding and abetting at the time the mortal blow was given. My Lord, this was, at first, a special verdict; but, to relieve the parties from the expence of arguing it, it was turned into a reserved case, which was argued before all the Judges; two of the judges differed from the rest, but the majority of the Judges ruled, that it was no offence whatever in those persons who were not engaged in the actual blow that caused the death of the child, upon this principle, that they were engaged in an illegal act, and they shall answer no further. The death might ensue in consequence of their opposition to this illegal purpose; it might ensue from their contest with the landlord in distraining the goods in consequence of the straggle which they chose to make illegally to get them into their possession; but it is too much to say that because one of them, and perhaps the only one who had a deliberate intention in his mind to give the blow,the rest, not at all expecting to mix that child in the fray, it is too much to say that they shall all answer for the death of that child, which never could have arisen as a necessary consequence of the dispute and contest in which they were engaged. So I say here, these two persons agree to fight two men, neither of them expecting to strike Hayes, with whom there had been no quarrel, and therefore could not have it in contemplation to strike any other person than those with whom they were engaged. Suppose, instead of this, Symonds had gone up to the landlady, and knocked her down, could we have supposed that that was in the contemplation of Bartholomew or Knight, they had no ill will against her - Suppose he had knocked the maid down, and she had died of the blow, could it be said that that was in the contemplation of the prisoners? It does appear to me from these cases, that as it was not a necessary consequence of the illegal act in which they were engaged, they ought not to answer for it. I certainly would not contend that Symonds is not answerable for the death of that man, but does seem to me from this evidence, that these two men could not be conscious of the part that Symonds chose to take.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there is another part of this case which your Lordship may perhaps say is for the Jury only: it has been always necessarily required, that the death which is averred to have happened, shall be substantially proved to have happened from that, and from nothing else, surgeons have always been called to that point.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. That is certainly a question of evidence only, and I shall lay before the Jury all the observations that seem to me upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. My Lord, I will trouble your Lordship with a few words on the same side. My Lord, it appears upon this evidence, that all the quarrelling was between Symonds and Wilson; and in the subsequent part of the business, the only quarrel was between Symonds and Wilson on the one hand, and Bartholomew and Wakefield on the other; and it likewise appears upon the evidence, that the deceased, Hayes, not only took no part in the fray, not only was not the object of the malice of any of the parties there, but that he sat at a distant part of the kitchen, and at last, when he put himself in that situation, in which he received, as it is charged in the indictment, his mortal wound, he was endeavouring to escape into the bar for the purpose of avoiding any mischief that might fall upon him: it likewise appears, that the blow was given by Symonds, unassisted by any other person, unencouraged by any other person; that no word was uttered, and no gesture made use of by the other persons to encourage Symonds in giving that blow, Then it does seem to me to come strictly within the authority of those cases, in which it is determined, that in order to involve other persons in the guilt of him who gives the blow, that it shall be the intention of the whole.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Mr. Justice Foster says - "I have, by way of caution, supposed that the murder was committed in prosecution of some unlawful purpose, some common design, in which the combining parties were united, and for the effecting where of they had assembled. For unless this shall appear, though the person giving the mortal blow may himself be guilty of murder, (he may possibly have conceived malice against the deceased, and taken the opportunity, which the confusion of a croud, or darkness of the night, afford to execute his private revenge), he, I say, my be guilty of murder; or if it were upon a sudden quarrel, of manslaughter, and yet the others who came together for a different purpose, will not be involved in his guilt."</p>
               <p>I shall trouble your Lordship with only one other observation. It appears that the purpose for which Bartholomew came to that house, was not only a legal but a laudable purpose namely, to settle some business with his captain; that he used this house for the purpose of recruiting, in which service he was employed, and therefore he was acting in the ordinary concerns of his occupation in coming there. There does not appear to be the least tittle of evidence, that either of the prisoners conceived any malice to the deceased, and therefore it comes diretly within the authority of Mr. Justice Foster, that to involve all the persons in the guilt of murder, the  intention of all must be precisely the same. It also comes within the authority of the case of the King. Hodgson, where though all the parties were engaged in an unlawful design, namely, a trespass, which is the lesser crime, they were not to be involved in the guilt of murder in consequence of one of their party having had wickedness to involve himself in the greater crime. There ten of the Judges, out of the twelve, held that they ought not to be involved in that crime.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. I take it to be extremely clear and settled law now, that where several persons are engaged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120027"/>in a design, it does unquestionably extend to such acts as arise out of, or are connected with the specific illegal act in which they were engaged: for instance, if a number of persons set out with a design to oppose the civil power, and one shall chuse to steal a horse, that is collateral, and he alone is answerable for it; it has no connection with the illegal act in question. But what is the evidence here? Very different indeed from that. In the first place, when Symonds was shaking hands, Bartholomew says, chiac, you take one, and I will take the other; that, I think, implicates him in the attack upon these two men most distinctly. The next question will be for the Jury to consider, and that is, that the moment this cant word is used, and the exhortation given, you take one, and I will take the other, Knight immediately jumps up and shuts that door which the woman had opened, the question will be quo animo he shut that door; if he shut that door with the animus of keeping these soldiers in, then he took a part distinctly in the assault upon them, and if that should be the opinion of the Jury, I apprehend there will be very little difficulty in the law, for he then becomes directly implicated in the illegal act, and, in my judgment, is answerable as much as they are, if a murder has been committed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. I am very much of the same opinion. To be sure, in the case of murder, malice is a matter to be determined by the Court, but still it must result from the facts, that is the province of the Jury, and all that a Judge can do, is to sum up those facts to the Jury, with such admonitions as he thinks proper; taking the result of those facts to be one thing it is murder, taking it to be another it is not murder, and therefore it is a complicated case of law and fact. Now to apply that maxim to the present case, here it has been proved, that one of the parties did come there with an intention to settle an account, but it may happen that he afterwards combined with others to do an illegal act, and in that case he shall not protect himself under the idea that he came there originally for a legal purpose. Here it is stated in the first place, that every animosity was entirely laid aside, they shake hands, and it is supposed that every thing was over; afterwards one of these men cries out chiac, you take one and I will take the other, and then, without any other quarrel, they go to fighting at the time that every animosity was laid aside; the third man shuts the door, and keeps it shut; that is a matter likewise to be left to a Jury to say whether that act of shutting the door did or not mean to facilitate that breach of the peace that the others were engaged in; if it was so, that will implicate him in the whole of the fact. Therefore it does seem to me that this case should be summed up to the Jury with such observations as occur to the learned Judge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I am clearly of opinion this is a case to go the Jury, and not for the Court to decide upon; these three men are implicated together: the question is, how far they are implicated, and what the bad intent was that they had in view; one cried, chiac, and the other went to the door and held it that they might not escape; and it is very clear upon the face of the evidence, that they had a bad intention towards Wilson and Wakefield; and if they had, they must answer for all the consequences in pursuance of that bad intention. Now the case put by the Counsel is this - Suppose, instead of making the attack upon Hayes, the attack had been made upon the landlady or the maid, would that have been murder? The answer I give to that is, it would depend upon what the landlady or the maid were doing at the time: if they were sitting still in the bar at the time, it would not have been a pursuance of the attack upon the soldiers; but that is not the case with the attack upon this poor man, Hayes, for he had got off his seat when he found the two soldiers knocked down, and might have been considered by Symonds as coming to the assistance of the soldiers; for as soon as he sees Hayes coming up, he knocks him down too. The case in Keyling appears to me to be a case in point against the prisoners; for there it was admitted by all the Judges, that if at the time the men were engaged in smuggling, the gun had been levelled at the officers, who were going to seize the wool, it would have been murder in them all, but that did not appear in the special verdict. So here it is for the Jury to decide, if they are of opinion that when Hayes quitted his seat he was thought by Symonds to have come up to assist the soldiers, there cannot be a doubt that they are all answerable, for they are all pursuing the same line, two of them in actual combat, and the third doing that which might prevent any assistance coming to them. If, on the other hand, the Jury should be of opinion that Hayes was not coming with that view, and that Symonds did not knock Hayes down in consequence of the illegal purpose for which these three men combined, then the consideration might be a very different one; but, under all the circumstances, I have no doubt that it is a case for the Jury to decide.</p>

I am a serjeant in a corps belonging to Major Steele, which was afterwards drafted to Chatham barracks; I saw the deceased the morning after he had received the blow, between twelve and one o'clock; he was a sailor, and had been with me several times trying to get into the supplementary militia, for he said he was totally starved where he was; he was not a very healthy man, he was a very weak man and appeared to be much as usual that day; we drank part of five pots of beer together, and I went about my business; the next day I had been on the parade, and I met him about half past ten in the morning; he said he was going to see about his prize-money, somewhere towards King-street, that was on the Thursday; he appeared to me to be then much as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards, the next day? - A. I had been up to Clerkenwell, and meeting an acquaintance of mine promisenously who had come from Coventy, we went into Mrs. Marshall's to have some beer together, that was between three and four in the afternoon; during the time we were drinking this pot of beer, Hayes came in and said to Mrs. Marshall, I have been and done your job; she asked him to have a glass of something, and he asked her for some dinner, and Mrs. Mar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120028"/>shall reached him a soup-plate with some Irish stew in it, and he eat it as hearty as ever I saw him eat; he then joined my friend and me in drinking; he gave the boy the pot to draw some more beer, and the boy refused to draw it without having the money; and he said d-you, you dog, go and draw it. I was there about an hour and a half, and he said, he had been carrying a trunk to Clare-market; and a young fellow came in, and d-d him for a fool, for taking so heavy trunk to Clare-market, for so little money; he said, he had nothing to do, and he might as well earn ninepence that way as any other.</p>

I give him my private mark, and I afterwards saw a pair of stockings of mine at the Public-office, Marlborough-street; I know them to be mine from the mark; I cannot swear that I had not sold these stockings, because I did not miss them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they new stockings that had not been used? - A. They had not; I had not sold any to him.</p>

This box was with this rag, and this woman's dirty cap, and a pair of scissars; there was a candlestick with a piece of candle lying on the floor, but not so that we could tell that it had been lighted lately; in the back kitchen, where Willis was taken from, were these two basons, in one of which there appears a settlement of cream of tartar. Both the prisoners fingers and thumbs were as if they had been using these kind of ingredients. Wray searched the place afterwards.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went with Armstrong to this house; Armstrong went in first; and in the first room there was a woman stamped, and cried out, murder; then we went down into the kitchen; just as we got to the bottom of the stairs, Sydney passed us, I caught her, and delivered her to Harper, who then went and got a light, and went into the front kitchen; a large bason was the first thing I perceived, it had been kicked up, and there was a great deal of liquid upon the floor, I cannot say what that liquid was; there was a fire place, but no grate in it, there I found a great quantity of base money, some on the hearth, and some in the fire-place, (produces it); there are very near a hundred sixpences, and about thirty-five shillings, they were all over wet, some of them stuck against the back of the chimney, and the wet was dripping down; I picked off, I think, four. There was only one chair there, and this box turned down; there was no furniture there at all. After making a further search, I found some in the back kitchen, that was bad money too, wrapped up in a paper, five shillings and seven sixpences. There was a candlestick and a piece of candle lying upon the floor, which appeared to me to have been very recently put out, the snuff was not stiff; and I found this blacking-pot.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was with the rest of the officers, on the 4th of July: I went into the parlour, there was a woman crying out, murder, and stamping on the floor, I secured her, and took her into the back room; then the two prisoners were brought to me without gowns or stays, and I secured them; their hands were very black, as if they had been at work at that sort of business. I afterwards went down and saw the liquid spread about, and I saw the things that Mr. Wray had found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Armstrong). Q. Explain the use of these things? - A. That liquid is used to bring the silver to the surface; after that it is dipped in water, and wiped it with a rag, they rub it between their fingers, and wipe it with a rag, and then the blacking is the last thing that is used, to take off the appearance of newness, and make them fit for circulation.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these sixpences? - A. They are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Lahey's defence. I was coming past the New Church in the Strand, and I found a paper parcel; when I came home I opened it, and saw it was money, and when these gentlemen came into the room I was wiping the dirt off; whether it was good or bad I know not.</p>
               <p>Warner's defence. We found the blacking and cannister in the room when we came there, the room door was open always; I did not know whether the money was good or bad.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Perry.) Q. Had you examined the room before they came? - A. Yes; nobody had slept in the room before they came except my apprentice, and I am sure there were no such things there then.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the board? - A. It went clean out of the shop, I never heard of it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I take it for granted the same account you have given to-day you gave before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came in with the ear-ring in his hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your shop was a shop that a person would naturally report to if they wanted ear-rings, or wanted an ear-ring mended? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When these ear-rings were upon the ground, the prisoner at the bar was picking them up, and you called thieves at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he continue picking up the ear-rings after you had cried out thieves? - A. Yes, before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no hand at all? - A. No; I am sure there was no hand came in the shop at all, nor no person.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person, besides the prisoner, might have been under this place and moved the board? - A. No, I am sure there was nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the shop-door from where this place was? - A. About a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the hands of the prisoner above the counter at the time you heard that noise? - A. I cannot swear as to that, either one way or the other.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. To a court in Whitecross-street; I delivered them to a woman that was in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You were from home at the time they were left, and therefore you could not know who had left them? - A. I had seen the person in the morning.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did your wife tell you who she had them from? - A. She did not know his name, nor I neither, till after that.</p>

            ? - A. Yes; they were made payable to bearer, and drawn by Robert Sturdy, one for 75l. and the other for 140l.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the 75l. draft that you so paid?(shewing it him.) - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you pay it to? - A. To Barker, the porter, I had paid several before to him; he was accustomed to write upon the back how he would have them, and upon this is wrote seven twenties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I take it for granted you made a memorandum in you book immediately how you had paid it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. The person who demanded the money shewed you, at the back, how it was to be paid? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow those directions? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I must beg first to ask another question. - Have you any memory how you paid them, except your books? - A. No; I put in the book how I paid them.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you rely upon your book, and not upon your memory, how you made your payment? - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you positively certain, without recurring to the books, that you paid it according to that direction at the back? - A. Yes, I am certain of it; I gave seven 20l. notes of following numbers for the 140l.; and for the other, I gave a 50l. two tens, and a five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You have discharged Mr. Sturdy of the account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I think you told me as to the memory of numbers, you rely upon the books entirely? - A. I recollect these two drafts coming late in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. But have you any recollection of the numbers of the notes, without recurring to your books? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a Mr. Croft a partner in your house at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no other person but the four whose names you have mentioned that derives any profit from the business? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the Bow-street officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did not; I was at the office on Wednesday evening when the prisoner was brought there by Noble and Owen; I searched him, and found upon him Bank-notes to the amount of 210l.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That was the amount of the two drafts? Mr. Close. No, it was 5l. short.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Evans.) Did you take any account of the amount of those notes? - A. I marked them all; I first shewed them to a gentleman who was in the room with me and the prisoner, and afterwards I sealed them with my own seal, and it was sealed with the seal of the office likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. This is the same parcel, this is the seal that was put to it at Bow-street; I gave them to Mr. Close.</p>
               <p>Mr. Close. I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Evans.) Where about did this pass? - A. In a back room, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You marked the notes-look and see if these are the same? - A.These are the same notes.(They were given to Mr. Shelton.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. Here are two 10l. one 50l. and seven 20s.; the 20s. begin with No. 1542 and end with 1548.</p>
               <p>ROBERT STURDY sworn. - Mr. Knowlys. I object to Sturdy as a witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. We have a release. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the young man at the bar? - A. Yes, he came to me as clerk in the month of May, 1797, and continued to live with me till the 27th of July, when he withdrew himself upon the plea of being indisposed, and having been for some time dissatisfied with his appearance, I had given orders that he was to be dismissed, and no more to enter my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that draft-is the signature your hand-writing? - A.Certainly not, or any part of the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Are Messrs. Devaynes and Co. your bankers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whose hand-writing it is? - A. I am sorry to say it has too much the appearance of his writing, I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him authority to draw upon your banker? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He is a very young man? - A. About eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q. His friends live in Warwickshire, I believe? - A. Yes; I never observed any thing improper till this; he was in a very inferior situation in my office.</p>

Yes, in Mr. Batho's yard; I went there in consequence of some information on the 24th, and there I saw 600 weight of stones, of the value of from 40s. to 50s. they correspond exactly in size and quality with those I landed myself, as near as possible.</p>

I do; I was desired by my father to meet him in Nightingale-lane, in consequence of a bargain having been made between them; I went to Gatehouse to know in what manner he came by the stones which he shewed to me in a place called Black-horse-yard; I asked him how he came by them, and from his vague manner of answering me, I had a suspicion; he took me to the Dundee arms, in Nightingale-lane, and there introduced me to the landlady of the house, and she informed me she had lent Gatehouse thirteen shillings to pay for these stones; in consequence of that I thought it was considerably under price, and I mentioned my suspicions to my father; we consulted, and thought it best to remove the stones to our town premises for security; they were what we call six and seven inch Aberdeen granites; I removed them to our yard, and on the Wednesday morning I applied to Mr. Goudge, mentioning that I thought these stones were his property; my father had agreed with Gatehouse for 1l. 11s. 6d. they are worth more than that; I appointed Gate-house to come for the money, and I appointed Mr. Goudge to come at the same time; they met, and in consequence of his strange way of telling how he came by them, we all three went to Nightingale-lane to make enquiries of a Mr. Huffin, that he said, he had bought them of, but Mr. Huffin said, he had given him no orders to purchase stones; then he said they came out of a Scotch vessel at New-crane, Wapping, and we knew very well that no Scotch vessels ever came there; then he said he had them from two men that drove a brick cart, but did not know who they were; then suspicions fell upon the two prisoners, who had worked for Mr. Yandall; I went with Mr. Goudge, and they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Gatehouse gave different accounts of these stones? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You pursued through a number of courts and turnings, and therefore must have lost sight of the person? - A. No; I was in sight of him all the time till after he dropped the cloth; in going down Durham-yard I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at a considerable distance from the Strand? - A. Yes.</p>

I am not quite sure, but I thought it was bolted, or else I should have fastened it, it was down; when I came down I missed the things named in the indictment; I missed some of the articles, and my wife and daughter missed the rest; I missed a silver milk-pot, six tea-spoons, two silver salt-ladles, one pair of silver salts, and six silver table-spoons; I had seen some of them the day before, two tablespoons were about in common, and the milk-pot was upon the board in common use; I always lock the street-door, and carry the key up, and we thought she must have got out at the window; the next morning I went to be shaved, and saw a Mr. Clark, a pawnbroker, and I told him what the things were, and begged him to stop them and the parties if they should be offered to him; he went out and came back directly, and said, his man had taken the spoons in that mornings; he then advised me to go to the different pawnbrokers; Mr. Clark went with me, and the first we went to from his house was Mr. Davison's, a pawnbroker, and he said, he believed he had two of the spoons; he produced two of the table-spoons, and likewise a gown and petticoat belonging to my wife. We then went to several other pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about the prisoner at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor had any conversation with her? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At times I have been very insensible, that I have not known what I have been doing.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Draper). Q. Did you ever perceive that in her? - A. No; she had only lived with us three weeks.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner came into my shop, on Tuesday, the 17th of July, between the hours of three and four, and a woman with him; she asked to look at some cotton stockings; I shewed her one parcel, which did not suit her; I then produced another bundle, and she made choice of one pair, which were paid for, five shillings; just at that moment came on a violent shower of rain and a thunder storm; they were very well dressed, the man had not the appearance then that he has now; I asked them if they would stay till the rain was over, which they accepted; I quitted the counter, and went to my desk. In a very short time after, my nephew, who is my shopman, came round to me, and wrote upon a piece of paper, that the prisoner at the bar had pocketed some silk stockings; I asked him, if he was sure of the fact, he said, he was. The man and woman both drew towards the door, it then rained very hard; one was standing on one side the door, and the other on the other; I told them, they had better stop till the rain was over; the man said, no, he did not mind a little rain, and was in the act of moving off; upon which, I took hold of him by the collar, and pulled him into the shop; he, at that instant, turned his back to the counter, and pulled these goods out of his pocket, I saw him pull them out; there are three pair of silk stockings and a pair of cotton drawers, which I am sure are my property; the silk stockings are my own manufacture, there is my name in them; and the drawers I know, because they tally exactly with the quantity that I had of this quality. The counters were a good deal confused at the time, and there were a number of stockings upon them. He made a great deal of resistance, broke my shin in two places; he could not escape that way, and he ran up stairs, threw up the window, and got in at my next door neighbour's. We sent for assistance from Bow-street, and he was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Were there any other people in the shop at the time? - A. Yes; two gentlemen that had been giving me an order for the Indies, they were the sons of Mr. Cooper, of Southampton-buildings; there was likewise a lady, of Argyle-street, whom I know perfectly; she saw the whole of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other things upon the opposite counter? - A. No stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not buy the cotton stockings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not give you half-a-guinea, and receive five shillings and sixpence in change? - A. I cannot say whether the half-guinea came from the prisoner's pocket, or the woman's.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Which pocket did he take them out of? - A. I cannot say positively, it was so instantaneous, that I cannot say, I believe he put his hand in both pockets, but I am positive he took them out of either one pocket or the other.</p>

We immediately sent for a constable to secure him; and he struck me several times, in attempting to get from us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Did you not say, before the Magistrate, that you could not swear that you saw me take them out of my pocket? - A.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had you known this woman before you married her? - A. About three months.</p>
               <p>Q. She had visited you, or you her? - A. The first meeting we had was in the street, in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the next interview? - A. She called upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might she call upon you? - A.Several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call upon her? - A. No, I never did; I went to her friends; I had called upon her at her first cousin's; she said her husband had been dead a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. You never visited her at her own home? - A. No; and when we came to the point of marriage, she put me to my oath that I should have her, and no other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you know that she was a married woman, and have you not done this in order to prevent a prosecution against yourself? - A. No; she said her husband was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What gave you any suspicion that she was married? - A. I had no suspicion of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it out in a fortnight after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you might have found it out before if you had made the same enquiry? - A. Yes; she was with me one week, and then she went away from me to her first husband, and in a fortnight after I found out that she was married.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You met with her first in Long-acre? - A. Yes, after I left work in the evening, she was coming home with some linen, I believe, or something of that sort, she had a bundle in her hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you ever made her an offer since she has been in Newgate, that if she would come back and live with you, you would not prosecute her? - A. No, I have not; it was her first husband that took her up, and he has used me very ill, and would not come to the Court; and then he said, if I would not come forward and prosecute he would prosecute me; and then he said he wished he had not done it, for he wanted to live with her again.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you at all form a judgement how the people had got in? - A. Yes; they had taken out two bars from the cellar-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they upright, or across? - A. Upright.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner, Wingrove? - A. Yes; he lived about two hundred yards from me in the town of Staines. After they had got into the cellar, they broke the cellar-door, and had the range of the house; they had bored a gimblet over the latch of the door, to prevent any body coming down in case of an alarm; they afterwards opened the yard-door that went into the stable-yard from the passage of the dwelling-house, to get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120049"/>the tubs out, for they were too large to get out at the cellar window, where they had broke in: the next morning I applied for a search-warrant, but it was near six in the evening before I served the warrant upon the witness, Clarke; I was present when his house was searched; we found there one dozen of wine; we found nothing else there; I found a tub of gin and a tub of ox-moor buried in the aits, a little island in the Thames; I never saw Wingrove after that, we searched after him several times, but he never appeared in Staines afterwards to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a labourer: In October, 1795, I lived in Staines, about 300 yards from Mr. Lawrence's house; I have known the prisoner these thirteen years; I saw him and another come out of Mr. Lawrence's passage with bottles in his hands between one and two o'clock in the morning, I cannot tell who the other man was; they both crossed the road, and went up the back side of Middle-row, towards Clark's house, with the liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean that Clark who was admitted King's evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Wingrove? - A. I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that Mr. Lawrence had been robbed? - A. About ten o'clock the next day, and then I went and told Mr. Lawrence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Wingrove since? - A. Yes, I saw him one night at Staines, I suppose a twelvemonth ago, or not quite so much, he was leaning over some rails in Staines, but I did not know it was him at the time I saw him, I have heard that he has been there several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This robbery was near three years ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the night was it you saw him? - A. Between one and two in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you up at that time? - A. I went to bed very soon, and I was very thirsty, I could not find any water in the house, and I took a pitcher to go out to get some water, but I could not get any, and then I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived in Staines, and not know where to get water? - A. I went to the Angel and Crown, but the yard was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever gone out for water in the night before? - A. Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending your evening? - A. I was in bed by nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you went to bed sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him a twelvemonth ago, and did not know him? - A. He was leaning over the rail, I did not see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say your memory improves in the course of a year - Do you mean to say now that you know the prisoner? - A. I did not see his face then.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not a witness upon the former trial? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you saw a part of the transaction, you were not called as a witness upon that trial? - A. The prisoner was not then taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a reward for a burglary? - A. I have never had any reward.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard there was a reward of 40l. in that case? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Knotts was the man who was convicted of this offence before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of Knotts, and therefore they did not make you a witness upon that trial? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner about his ordinary business from that time to this, in Staines? - A. No.</p>

            , the accomplice, sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I lived in Middle-row, Staines, when Mr. Lawrence's house was broke open; the prisoner, Wingrove, and Knotts, were concerned with me in breaking the house open, about one o'clock in the night; we broke the cellar door open by pulling the bars down; we took out some wine in bottles, and two tubs of liquor; we carried them all down to Knott's house, and there we parted the liquor, the tubs we carried over the water into the aits; Knott's house was close to the water side, about two hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had parted the liquor, what did you do with it? - A. They carried theirs to their house, and I carried mine to my house; Wingrove's house was about one hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bottles had you? - A.Ten or eleven, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you were taken up for this? - A. The Friday afternoon, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Wingrove? - A. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live? - A. In the George-yard, Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever been living publickly in Staines since the robbery was found out, till this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you quit the house? - A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were one of the gentlemen that broke into the prosecutor's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were taken up the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120050"/>Q. And then you thought it was the best way to charge the prisoner and another man with robbing the house, in order to escape yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no new trick, you know? - A. I did not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us the things were taken to Knott's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were carried to Knott's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body says they were carried to Clark's house, they have not told the truth? - A. I carried my share home, but they were taken to Knott's house first and shared.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body else has said the things were carried to your house in Middle-row, it is not true? - A. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you kind enough to break into this honest man's house? - A. About one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in the house? - A. About an hour, not much more.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in about one o'clock? - A. Yes, and left the house between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not possibly have come out of the house till after two o'clock? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body else has said you came out at half past one o'clock, that cannot be true? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up the evening of the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You prosecuted another man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any share of the 
reward? - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. But you got your liberty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you have been a reformed man and lived a good life ever since? - A. Yes, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you lived since that time? - A. At Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known any body of the names of Drake and Aldridge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Aldridge? - A. He is dead; Drake lives at staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give evidence here against them too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you had reformed since that? - A. I was in confinement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you examined in that case as in this, as King's evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys.(To Lawrence.)Q. What is the value of these things? - A. The gin I valued at 3l. the wine at three guineas, and the oxmoor at two guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That man would swear any man's life away as he did the other man's; I have been at Staines for a week and a fortnight together, and nobody ever said any thing to me, or took any notice of me.</p>

               <p>Q. It was pretty heavy, I suppose? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. That is in the County of Middlesex? - A. Yes, where I first saw him.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see his face? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say, that you saw him take the box off, but that you saw it in his hand? - A. I saw him lift it from the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not stop him at that time? - A. I had no suspicion that he had stolen it till after I saw the strings dragging on the ground.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not been particular in looking at the money, so as to say it was all good? - A. Yes, I always look at my money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence. GUILTY (Aged 44.)</p>

After we crossed Woodstock-street, the prisoner entered into conversation about the rebellion of Ireland, when I told him I should be happy to hear of a peace in that country; this conversation continued almost to the opposite side of Cumberland-street; the prisoner then laid hold of my arm before. I came to Park-street; I told him to keep his distance, that I did not like his mode of laying hold of me in that sort of way; in the mean time I crossed to the corner of Cumberland-street, in my way to George-street, Edgeware-road; when I came to Upper Berkeley-street, the bottom of Cumberland-place, I turned myself round and saw the prisoner at a distance, I walked down Berkeley-street towards the Edgeware-road, when the prisoner came up to me a second time; I asked him his reason for lurking after me; his answer was this, that he hoped I was not affronted; I then walked from him, and turned round to the side of the turnpike in the Edgeware-road, in my way to George-street, and then I lost sight of the prisoner; when I got within twenty yards of <placeName id="t17980912-54-crimeloc313">George-street</placeName>

Yes; at this time I got myself from the prisoner, when he seized me by the neck-handkerchief, and put the knuckles of his fingers into my throat to choak me; he then said, I will have your watch, when he immediately put his fingers down to the bottom of my fob-pocket, and took out my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there a chain to it? - A. No; the prisoner then asked me if I had any Bank-notes; I told him, no, when he immediately put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and took out what silver I had, and some papers, there were three or four shillings, and five pence in halfpence; he then said, I will feel in your coat-pockets, when he took out my pocket-handkerchief, and some papers; he then shoved me away from him, and told me I might be d - d; the prisoner then left me, and walked into the Edgeware-road; I followed him, and told him I must have my watch, my watch was dear to me being my father's; the prisoner, and myself, was by this time at the corner of Berkeley-street, he told me he would go home to his quarters; I then asked him where his quarters were; his answer was,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120057"/>d-n your eyes shall I tell you; I told him I did not want to know, I only wanted my property, my watch I valued; the prisoner said, if I followed him one inch farther, with his fist up to my face, but did not strike me, he would be hanged for me, when he immediately laid hold of my waistcoat, and said, I think I know you, and looked very stedfast in my face; he immediately shoved me away from him against the iron rails, when I called out, watch, but no assistance came; I called out more than once or twice; the prisoner then went away from me to the corner of Park lane, in Oxford-street, opposite the coffee-house, when I seized the prisoner, and told him I must have my property, it being my father's; he then laid hold of me with his left-hand, and took his right-hand away from me; I at that time called out watch but to no purpose; several times he put his right-hand up to my face, and stopped my mouth that I should not speak; then he said, if you will give me five guineas you shall have it, and he was to go home with me; he then said, but stop, if you ever take me into custody it shall be worse for you, I will either do, or cause to be done your business; he then said, if I would adjourn to a public-house below he would make the matter up with me, as I set to much store by my father's watch; from that place we walked down Oxford-road, about an hundred and fifty yards, when a public-house appeared, with the landlord, or some man, putting up the shutters; the prisoner said, here, we will have a pint of porter, accordingly he asked the person who was putting up the shutters for a pint of porter, and the pint of porter was brought; the prisoner first put it to me, I refused; the prisoner in the mean while had occasion to pull out his pocket handerchief, he took out two, and a piece of string; I said to the prisoner, that is my silk pocket-handkerchief, the one that he had was a white one; he then asked me if the piece of string was mine; I said, no; he then asked me to drink a second time, I refused; he then drank, and threw the remainder part into the street, when he paid for the pint of porter, and we went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see at that house? - A. Nobody, except the man who was shutting up, he was crippled and deformed; when we left the public-house, the prisoner asked me where I lived, the number of my house, and my name; I told him where I lived, the number of my house, and my name; he then said, if you will bring me down two guineas, if I go to the door with you, you shall have your watch back again; then he went down to the corner of Queen-street, about an hundred and fifty yards below the public-house, into Brown-street, Grosvenor-square, when I shewed the prisoner the house where I lodged; I knocked at the door, and a very elderly lady came to the door, a Mrs. Haycock, who is the landlady of the house, having first looked out at the window and asked who was there; I then told the prisoner, if he would wait, I would go up stairs and bring him down two guineas; when the door was opend by the landlady, in her shift, I called out at the bottom of the stairs to the person whom I lodged with, and nobody answered; and this person being a very elderly lady was the only person in the house; I came to the door again, and the prisoner had got away near fifty yards; I followed him, and came up to him in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square, when the prisoner said, have you any pistols about you, have you brought down any; I said, no; the prisoner said, I will search you, and immediately put his hands into my coat-pocket, both right and left, and in my waistcoat, and my bosom, to see if I had any there, for he said, there were such cases; the prisoner then walked into Grosvenor-square, almost close to the railing, at least within five or six yards of the railing, then he said to me, do not make any noise here, or otherwise I will do your business; the prisoner then told me, if I would bring him two guineas to the King's-arms, in Little St. James's-street, about twelve o'clock the next day, five minutes before, or five minutes after, I should have my watch back again; he told me his name was

            ; he said, but mind, if you bring any constable, or runner with you, from Bow-street, or if you hereafter have me taken; up, I will do your business, or cause it to be done by some of my comrades; then the prisoner immediately shoved me away from him; I then thought I must let the matter drop, for I perceived there was no use in following him any further, and I returned back. On the Monday following I attended the parade in St. James's Court-yard, fronting St. James's-street, when the prisoner stood under the south side of the portico; I crossed from the west side, and in crossing the prisoner said, how do you do, sir, why did you not come down according to your appointment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go at all according to your appointment? - A. Not at the hour that the prisoner proposed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go? - A.From the fall, and the ill usage of the prisoner. I was not able to get up till two o'clock, and then I did go to the King's arms, with my brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the prisoner at the bar then? - A. No; they did not know any thing at all about any person of that name, but they thought they knew the description of the person that I had given, but he did not go by that name; I told the prisoner, upon his asking me the question, that I could not come to my appointment; I then asked him for my property, when the prisoner said, do not make any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120058"/>noise here; I told him then, if he did not give me up my property, I certainly would have him taken into custody; his answer was, then if I would adjourn to a public-house he would make it up to me; I told him, no, if he did not immediately give me up my watch I would have him taken into custody, I should lay hold of him; the prisoner then made a frivolous excuse, there is no occasion for that; when I immediately took hold of him by the collar, and called out to the adjutant on the parade; I held the prisoner till the adjutant called out a file of men to conduct him to the guard-house; I then went to the Queen-square Police-office, and brought two constables to take the prisoner from the guard-room to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, from the opportunities you had of seeing him, that he is the same man? - A. I am very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of your property again? - A. Yes; I saw my watch at a pawnbroker's in the Almonry, Westminster; the pawnbroker is here that took it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any thing of the handkerchief? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are an apprentice to a statuary? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. May I take the liberty of asking who you might have been going to visit? - A. Mr. Howard, a surgeon, in George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might it be from where you met the prisoner to George-street? - A. About six or seven minutes walk; if I say half a mile it is as much as it can possibly be.</p>


               <p>Q. What time of night was it when you parted with the prisoner? - A. When I got into my house it went eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been with the prisoner near an hour? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed as he is now? - A. No; he was dressed in his full regimentals, and his full dress.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have thought it rather an extraordinary thing that a man of that description should accost you who was a total stranger? - A. Yes, I did think it a very extraordinary thing, and several times put him at a distance, and told him I did not approve of his following me.</p>
               <p>Q. I should take it when he talked of the affairs of Ireland, you did not give him an answer? - A. Yes; I did give him an answer; I said, I wished for a peace in that country; from his manner of speaking, I took him to be a man of good sense; he said, he expected some of his comrades home in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was set, I presume, upon your return? - A. No, there never is any watch upon that road in that month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure you were not in any public-house? - A. yes; neither public or private house, or any house whatever, with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any wine-vaults? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned into Oxford-road, the watch was set? - A. Yes; but from the time we left the Edgeware-road till we got into Brown-street, I did not see a single soul except four profligate girls against the Park wall, and when I got there, I called watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were so near Mr. Howard's house, how came you not to go on? - A. I had no idea that the prisoner meant to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that, after he had kept following you so far? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got within twenty yards of Mr. Howard's house, how was it that you did not go on for assistance? - A.Because I was afraid of losing my property.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that you did not seek for the assistance of watchmen, after you came into Oxford-road? - A. He threatened me so much what he would do to me, that I thought I had better make myself quite sure of his face and person, as I had not had a full view of his face at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from you? - A. A very short distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen might you have passed? - A. Not any from the time the prisoner robbed me till I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you come after he had robbed you? - A. to the corner of Berkeley-street; there is a watch-box near the turnpike, and I called out watch, there, but there was no turnpike-man nor watchman, and I can prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the turnpike-man's box? - A. I called out watch, and I called out assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Oxford-road is Brown-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120059"/>in? - A.Between North Audley-street and Duke-street, on this side of Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And you passed down that public street, Oxford-road, and no watchman was to be met with? - A. On my return there was not either man, woman, or child.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you met with neither man, woman, nor child, during all that time? - A. I mean to say that upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came to your house in Brown street, you did stop at a public-house, and the prisoner called for a pint of beer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did see a man there; how came you not to ask his assistance? - A. He was a cripple, and the prisoner had told me if I made any noise he would do my business for me; I went to put my ear to listen it there was any body in the taproom, and the prisoner would not let me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me the only reason why you did not speak at that public-house was, because he had intimidated you, and said he would do your business for you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the wounds you had received, you could not attend according to your appointment? - A. No; I had received no wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that you did not attend on account of the injury you had received? - A. Yes, from the prisoner keeping me down with his knuckles in my throat, and his foot upon my breast at the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of bringing some weapons down with you? - A. I could not get into my room, there was nobody in the house but the person that let me in, and the was in her shift, about 80 or 90 years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might you have walked with the man after you left your own house? - A. Not more than twenty yards; I left him in consequence of his saying that he would do my business, or be the means of my business being done.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you apprehended him? - A.On the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, before you apprehended him? - A. On the Thursday I was very ill, on the Friday I went to Whitehall, and begged leave to walk through the line, and observe the man; on the Friday, on the Saturday, and on the Sunday, I did the same, and on the Monday I met with him as I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it you went next day before the Magistrate to give information of this transaction? - A. No, I did not, till after I had taken the prisoner into custody, for this very reason, I could not apprehend the man form the fictitious name that he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could not have gone to a Police-office and given information? - A. The adjutant told me, the only way I had was to walk through the lines till I found him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met with him in the court-yard, at St. James's, he spoke to you first? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About the time the guard was relieved at St. James's; it was about eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not ask you for five shillings that he had advanced you? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You had been several times to see the guard relieved, in order to see if you could find the man? - A. Yes, I attended Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You valued your watch because it was your father's - Did he bequeath it to you? - A. No, he gave it me on his death bed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been ten years in the Guards, and never was arraigned at the bar in my life before; that gentleman and I had been together at different public-houses, drinking together, and he was going with some girls; he said, he had no money, and I lent him five shillings, he gave me his watch in my care till he paid me; he ordered a pint of beer as we went along, and he called at Brown-street, and said, his wife was gone to bed, and he could not get me five shillings; and then he appointed to meet me the next day, at the King's-arms, and to bring me the money, and have his watch. I have a comrade here to prove that I went to the King's-arms at the time appointed; and when I met him on the 27th, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, why did not you come to your time, I am very sorry, but I have been obliged to pledge your watch, in consequence of not having the five shillings. I told him, I would give him the duplicate.</p>

On the 2d of August, I was ill of the rheumatism in my head, and staid in the bar till I could not stay any longer; I laid down my head in the kitchen upon the table, till almost eleven o'clock; just before it struck eleven, I ordered the girl to put up the shutters, for I was so wearied, I wished to go to bed; I then went into the bar, where were the two prisoners sitting with a woman with them; I desired them to go to bed, I thought it was time; when I was going to shut up the house, the girl went into the parlour to shut the window-shutters, and I outside to hold the shutters to till she fastened them inside; I came into the taproom, and missed Whomby all at once, I did not know which way he had gone; I asked Radford to go to bed, and he went out, and stopped about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120061"/>minutes; he then came back and asked for a candle to go to bed; I then ordered the girl to go and fasten the cellar flaps and shoot the bolts; and I went to see it done; since my husband has been gone, I have been very careful to see that every thing was fastened before I went to bed; I heard the girl shut to the bolts while I was fastening the shutters; I locked the tap-room door and the girl locked the cellar-door, and gave me the key; I make it a rule always to take up the keys with me; the girl sleeps in a bureau bedstead, opposite to the cellar door; I saw every thing fast, I went to bed a little before eleven; I got up to washing between three and four, I found every thing fast as I left it; I went out of doors, I took the bolt out of the window shutters, and called the girl; when I took the bolt out of the window shutters, I found my cellar flap almost out of the place where it shuts in, and lifted into the street, it must have been unbolted inside; I have every reason to believe Whomby concealed himself in the cellar, for he had not been to bed, that I am sure. I then called the watchman, I found a cask of shrub missing, and the rum all poured out, I suppose there might be four or five gallons in it. I found myself incapable of washing, and I got a washerwoman; I continued in my tap-room and bar all the morning, till about half past six o'clock; Whomby came in very much in liquor, he did not say a word to me, nor I to him; he went into the yard and stopped there, it might be five minutes; then he went up stairs, I took particular notice of him, for the back cellar has a spring in it, and is generally ancle deep in mud and water; and to prevent my servants going into it, I pump it into the front cellar. When he came in, his shoes and the lower part of his trowsers were all over mud, the same as was in my back cellar; he stopped up stairs about a quarter of an hour, and he made Redford get up, and they came down stairs; they had a pint of beer in the tap-room, it was then near eight o'clock. The girl and I went out to drive some ducks in, and Radford followed me, and stood at the door; and then Whomby gave a great whistle; I thought something was the matter, and I saw Whomby attempt to go up stairs; I went to go in, and Radford stopped me at the door, so that I could not get in; I followed him up stairs, and I got up the two-pair of stairs nearly as quick as him; then I saw him with the cask of shrub under his left arm; I told him, he ought to be ashamed of himself, in the manner in which I was left, to be robbing of me for six weeks; says he, d-n you, you b-h, if you don't get down stairs, I will kill you immediately; with that, I returned down stairs, and called out, murder! thieves! and alarmed the people in the house and at the door; then I went up stairs, but before I could get up stairs, Whomby had given Radford the cask of shrub, and Radford was putting a knapsack over it in a box of Radford's; I did not know then what it was he was putting in the box; I begged of Whomby to give me the cask of shrub, and he said, he had not seen it; and he threatened me a great deal, and said, I was so and so, and he had never robbed me of any thing; Radford kept fastening up the box and standing before it. I came down stairs, and Whomby followed me; I then sent for a constable, and Radford came down afterwards. The constable took Whomby away, and Radford went into the tap-room; I said, Radford, I am afraid you have had connections in robbing me, these six weeks, of every thing I have lost; I told him, he might he ashamed of himself, when he did not know whether I had a father living for my children, or not; and he abused me very much. There was a corporal there gave him a share of a pint of ale; and the corporal was more curious in watching Radford than I was; for I was so full of trouble, I did not observe what was going forward. The corporal went up stairs after Radford, and saw the cask, and then the constable fetched it down; I am sure it was my cask, I had emptied a little shrub out of it the day before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever see your cask of shrub from the day before, till it was produced to you by the corporal? - A. I saw it that evening before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see it from that time till it was produced to you by the corporal? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see it in Radford's box? - A. No.</p>

I came down stairs, and he was sitting in the tap-room; I called for a pint of ale, and gave him a glass of it, and I asked him who that box belonged to that was in the room; he said, it was his; I said no more, but went into the parlour; and he went up stairs;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120062"/>I followed him up, and saw him take the canteen strap off the box, and take the cask out and carry in into another room, and put it under the bed; when I came down stairs, the officer was there, and I told him of it, and he went up stairs along with me, and found it in the box.</p>

               <p>ROBERT COOMBES sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Public-office, Whitechapel; the prisoner used to preach by the road side, near the London Infirmary, Whitechapel; we had an order from the Magistrates to desire him to quit that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120064"/>place, which he would not do; in consequence of that he was summoned to appear before the Magistrate; he was fined in the penalty of 20l. When I went to serve the warrant of distress upon his goods, the landlord came in first for rent, and when I was there, his first wife came and made an uproar about the door; I said, can that be your wife? he said, yes, I was married to her two or three and twenty years, but she had defiled my marriage bed, and God, my master, told me to take a second wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the second wife, whether he got any money with her or not? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury. May you live for ever, and may it please you that I may find grace in your fight. I am happy that I have to make a defence before your Graces, because ye have wisdom to discern between wickedness and simplicity. The Lord, who is my judge, knoweth, that in the simplicity of my heart I have done this; your suffering prisoner, in bonds, has, by his first wife, been cruelly oppressed, as you shall see in the sequel of my defence. After that I had been married to this my first wife about five or six years, the Lord was pleased to give me a knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness of my fins, after a thorough conviction of my lost estate by nature; but before this we lived very unhappy together, because she was not ashamed to own to me, my Lord, that she knew two men before I married her; and also was about to be connected, and was on the bed with her father's baker, but was interupted by the housekeeper, which, before I was converted, I could not brook; but when the Lord was pleased, my Lord, to manifest his pardoning love to my foul, I then, as he had forgiven me, could forgive her; and having now the spirit of light, I was given to see into my past wicked life, and saw, that though I was married to her according to the laws of my country, yet before God we did not come together according to his word, but as the brutes, for the gratification of our lusts. When I was thus convinced, my Lord, I then did heartily beseech the Lord that he would marry us afresh, and that I might then perform the duty of a husband unto her, and I earnestly prayed also for her conversion, and was in good hopes the Lord would have been pleased to hear my prayers, and make her a help-meet for me; but instead of that, my Lord, she became a most dreadful persecutor of me for my profession's sake, and took every advantage of me, my Lord, that she could; she drank very hard. However, soon after this, I believe about a twelvemonth or there away, after the Lord was pleased to convert me in his providence, he removed me to Portsmouth, my native place, from the want of business. When I came there, the Lord was pleased to open a door in his providence for me, and I got work, and between us both we could get a tolerable good living for poor people, our income was about a guinea a week between us both, but I was dreadfully persecuted by her, many times have I been in danger of my life, she has gone to bed with a knife by her side to kill me. It is true, my Lord, and the Lord is my witness, after having been at Portsmouth some time, the Lord had given me a deep experience upon my mind, and a strong impression that I ought to tell what the Lord had done for me, and the people there desired me to speak in the name of the Lord, and I believing that the Lord had appointed me thereunto, I, after earnest supplication to the Almighty, went forth to speak in the name of the Lord, they going with me. When this commended, this women declared she would not live with me, because that I would not let her usurp authority over me, as she did in this thing, she would be cash-keeper, and would not let me, when I received my wages, have any more than a shilling or so at a time, and then I must give her an account of every sixpence that I laid out, and when I gave her a true account she abused me very much. She resolved, however, that she would not live with me. I reasoned the matter with her about breaking wedlock. I told her what the scriptures said, that whom the Lord had joined together, no man should put asunder; I told her I knew her make, and that she could not do without a man, but would be perjured, and would commit adultery. She told me she would go from me in a fortnight; at the fortnight's end I little thought she would leave me, for she had been very quiet with me.</p>

               <p>Court. Why did you marry the second woman?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Because, my Lord, the first went away and left me in Portsmouth, and bedded with a man for a year and a half in my absence; then, after that, my Lord, at two years end it pleased the Lord in his Providence to bring me to London, and I took her again, not knowing what she had done till afterwards; then again, we were removed into East Smithfield, where we lived for three or four years, or more, together; then she went on again drinking and pawning every thing she could lay her hands upon; she retailed my coals, my candles, my tea, and every thing out to the neighbours to get money to purchase drink; when I came to the knowledge of this, she used me exceedingly ill, throwing irons, and knives, and a variety of things, at me; after this, one night, when I was gone to hearing -</p>
               <p>Court. The Court cannot sit to hear all the quarrels between you and your first wife, tell us your reason for marrying the second, as to all you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120065"/>can say with respect to your first wife it cannot avail you at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, when she had run away, I had not the gift of continency myself, and I understood, from the Scriptures, that when a woman has gone aside from her husband, it is lawful for a man to put away his wife; and as I saw myself clear before God, I did not know I was not clear by the laws of my country; I met with my present wife, whom I married, in the Lord, that I might not commit fornication, having first told her that my former wife was living; my first wife was as young as myself, -</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot hear the point argued, the law is clear, and you confess the fact.</p>

Yes, one part he had, because he could not get the holdfasts out; after we had secured him he acknowledged to putting up the chain, he denied touching any thing in the house; he said, he only went to case himself; I asked him if there was any body else in the house besides himself; and he said, go and look.</p>

             sworn. - I live in London-street, Fitzroy-square.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A gentleman's son; I was coming down Oxford-road, I heard a cry of stop thief, I stopped this man, who was running, and told him it was for a coat, I searched his pocket for his apron, and he had not got it; he said, he would go back with me; the boy told me he had an apron on, but when I stopped him he had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What coloured coat did the boy say I had on? - A. He said you had a brown coat on, he made several hesitations about it, he was not quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you yourself? - A. A gentleman's son; my father is a Portugal merchant, and generally resides there, he has no business here, he transacts for Mr. Duff, in Finsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The man was running when you stopped him? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is your father's partner in Portugal? - A. I do not know, all his letters come in Portuguese, I do not know any thing of him, he is a steward, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Steward to a merchant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Purtugal is it? - A.Somewhere in the North.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not stop him in Poland-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not told us a word of his running away? - A. A young man laid hold of him from me, and asked him what business he had to stop or be taken, and he ran away down Poland-street, and there he was stopped by a constable, and then I went back with him to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hammond.) Did you ever say any thing about his having a brown coat? - A. No; I went into the crowd, and said, it was a blue coat; this Mr. Brown has been to see him in Clerkenwell prison.</p>

               <p>Brown. No, I have not; I went to see another person there, Bill Doyle, and then I saw him.</p>
               <p>Hammond. At the time I was getting the bill, I could not find him, and he did not answer, and when he came back, he said he had been to see poor Manning, that he had got five children.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Brown.) Q. I shall enquire your description - what is your father's name? - A.

               <p>Q. And you never enquired what he was? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. It is signed by Mr. Hilditch, as deputy clerk of the assize, and therefore as such I shall certainly receive it.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Alley contended, that it ought to be signed by the clerk of the assize himself, and not by his deputy, and that therefore it ought not to be received in evidence.)(The Court over-ruled the objection.)(The copy of the conviction read.)</p>

               <p>Court. What is the evidence here? I have under the King's signed manual an assertion of this fact, that the prisoner, George Williams, otherwise Christopher Holyland, the very man at the bar, was convicted of stealing goods, the property of

            , and received sentence of transportation for seven years; that the King says, and then he says, he shall be pardoned, on condition of serving in the navy, and the prisoner admits that he is the man, for he accepts the terms of the King's gracious pardon, by going on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it that is by no means proved. The man having him in custody delivers him over to a person who gives a receipt for him, but it is by no means proved that he is called up and asked whether he will accept it.</p>
               <p>Court. I hold that not to be necessary; the favour of the King's mercy it shall not be in his power to refuse.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Alley also contended, that there were but three Acts of Parliament which related to the offence of returning from transportation, and that the present case did not come within either of them.)</p>
               <p>Court. I am perfectly satisfied that there never was a clearer point before a Court. The learned gentleman says, there are but three Acts of Parliament which relate to this offence, one making it selony to be found at large after having received sentence of transportation; another, where a man having first received sentence of death, and after wards the King's pardon, if he is found at large that shall be felony; and the third is, where he undertakes to transport himself, and is found at large. Now, what is the case here? This man is under sentence of transportation upon one of these very acts of Parliament, he is proved to be in custody under that sentence, he is discharged from thence on condition of entering and serving on board his Majesty's navy, and he is to remain there till he is duly discharged. If he deserts, he is directly within the Act of Parliament for returning from transportation. It seems to me, therefore, one of the clearest points that ever came before a Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am no deserter; I was regularly discharged.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, are you sure he is the man that put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket? - A. Yes; they were all three taken before Alderman Boydell, but the other two were discharged.</p>

When they came in, on the 19th of May; I had been shewing some lace to some ladies of fashion, I did not much like their appearance, and I put this lace into a drawer, and placed it at the far end of the room; as soon as I was disengaged, I went up to these women, on purpose to get them out of the house; I went up to

            , and asked her very sternly, what she wanted; and she immediately turned round hastily from the table where the lace was; they both seemed very much confused, but more particularly the young one, Lister; she told me, she wanted a bonnet; I told her to make choice of one, if there were any there that suited her, and to leave the room; she fixed upon one very improper for her; I had a very strong suspicion that she had robbed me; the price was to be eighteen shillings; I told her, she could not have that that she had fixed upon, and she desired to have one made like it, and she would call for it in the evening; she gave me a guinea. I then called two or three of my young people into the room, who were my apprentices or assistants; I was looking about the room, to see if the lace veils were safe; we found the veils, but did not look into the drawer where the laces were. I was conscious they had robbed me of something, but did not know what; when I was at leisure, I went up to this drawer, and upon opening it, I missed the two cards of lace that I have named; they did not come that evening. On the Tuesday following, I went to the door by accident, and they were just passing; I do not believe it was their intention to come in, had I not seen them; they came in, and appeared very much confused; indeed, I asked them the reason they did not call on Saturday; they said, it rained; I then asked them if they wanted any thing else; they seemed both to answer the question; I had not change, I told them, I must send out for it; they then seemed very anxious to get away, without the change; while I sent for the change, I called up a boy that we have, I desired him to go to the front door, and take particular notice of these women, and to watch where they went to, after they left our house. When I went back into the room, they said, they would not stay longer for the change, they would call again; they took the hat away, and went without their change; the boy watched them into Mr. Gray's, a silversmith, in Bond-street; they had been in a great number of shops; then they met a post-boy with a returned chaise, who went with them into a public-house at the top of the Hay-market, and there staid some time; the boy then followed them to the White-horse Cellar; he lost them there, and returned home; they went into the Richmond stage. Some weeks afterwards I heard that two women were in custody, and I went to Bow-street to hear their examination; there was an advertisement in the paper, cautioning shop-keepers, and saying they were in custody; I immediately knew them to be the same women, and I was bound over to prosecute. I never found my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any body else in the room? - A. Only the two ladies that were there when they came in, Lady Carhampton and her friend, nobody else had been near it, there were a number of persons near the drawer of our own people, but they were perfectly honest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where is your shop? - A. <placeName id="t17980912-68-crimeloc401">No. 142, New Bond-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. This happened so far back as the 19th of May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a number of people that serve in your shop? - A. I serve myself principally, I have a number of people that make up the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say you saw them take this lace? - A. I have no doubt but they did, for they turned from the place where the lace was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw them take it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear that they took it, though you did not see them? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. If any of the veils you have been speaking of had been missing for five minutes, you would have charged them with it? - A. If I had known there had been nobody left in the room but themselves, I should most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 19th of May, of course you had mentioned your suspicions of these people? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday following they came in again, without your calling them? - A. Yes; I looked at them very earnestly, but I did not say any thing to them before they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. And they paid you? - A. They had left a guinea the first time, I sent out for change.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they wait for change? - A. Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. The change was only three shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were going out of town? - A. They went by one of the short stages, I think it was the Richmond.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Mr. Baker's house; I saw Mrs. Baker put the laces into the drawer just after the prisoners came into the room; she put it upon the table where the women were trying the hats.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120072"/>Q. Were they covered with any thing? - A. No; there was not any body at that end of the room but the prisoners; I was taking down a lady's address, and Mrs Baker was taking down another lady's address; we could not then see the drawer, because we were both writing at this end of the room; there was then nobody there but the two prisoners; the ladies went away instantly; they were not at that end of the room where the box and women were. When the ladies were gone, Mrs. Baker, as well as myself, saw the women coming from the drawer; they turned from the table just as we turned from the ladies; I went and looked in the drawer before any person came in afterwards, and I missed the two cards of lace.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body else of your own family in that room, or near the drawer, after the ladies went away, and before your mistress searched? - A. Certainly not, for the people coming from the work room go a round about way, because of distinguishing the people in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There were a number of other girls in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And all very honest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they had access to this room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are there backwards and forwards occasionally? - A. It is very seldom that they do, they were not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people had been in after the ladies of fashion went away, and before you missed the lace? - A. Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the laces, you did not see them yourself? - A. Yes, I saw Mrs. Baker put them in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the shop might the looking-glass be? - A. The glass they were looking at was close by that table.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore they might be near the table without any dishonest intention? - A. Certainly.</p>

             sworn. - I live servant to Mr. Devesmes: On Sunday the 8th of July, the prisoner came down to see me -</p>
               <p>Q. He paid his addresses to you? - A. Yes; he came down and left with me, as I was told 201l.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120074"/>Q. Who reckoned them? - A.My fellow-servant; there were two hundred and ten pounds, but he had nine out of it, he asked for ten, and my fellow-servant thought she had given him ten; I put them into my box, and on Monday Mr. Trimbey, and his clerk came down, and I gave them the pocket-book exactly as I received it.</p>
               <p>Pearson. (Produces the pocket-book.) I have had it ever since, it has my name registered upon it, it is the same pocket-book; it contained, when I received it, two hundred and one pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any of them to be the same notes that were lost? - A. Yes; I thought two sufficient, and here they are, the hundred pound and a ten pound note, these I swear to; the ten pound note was in the tin box, and the hundred pound was in the large pocket-book of my own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What do you swear to these notes by? - A. My own hand-writing, and the dates that I had put upon them when I received them. (The dollars produced).</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Mr. Trimbey.) Q. I believe he had a very good character when he came to you? - A. I had a very good character with him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Pooley. I am a surveyor of the Marine Police-office. On Thursday night, the 30th of August, about eleven o'clock, as I was going down the river, on the north side, in the course of my duty, just below Ratcliff-cross, I observed a boat coming towards me with two people rowing, and one sitting a-stern; I was then close in shore, under the shadow of the house; as the boat came nearer to me, I sheered off from the shore to intercept her; upon my coming out from under the shadow, they discovered me, and immediately sheered off towards the South side; another of our boats was following directly after me, and we both pulled towards them as fast as we could; the boat in which Mr. Wright was went on the south side of a ship then riding in the middle of the stream, a ship or brig I am not positive as to that; our other boat followed her, and I went the north side of the ship, athwart her bow, and by the waving of the water under her bow, which I could see by the light of the moon, I conceived that something was thrown overboard, I rowed immediately to the place, and took in a bag of coffee from out of the water, where I perceived the waving; at this time the two boats were in sight, but had turned to go down the stream; I mean Mr. Wright's boat and our other boat; it detained me the space of a minute to get this bag in; in that time they had got a considerable distance, so much so, that I could not distinguish one boat from the other; I perceived there were two; I soon after perceived one rowing close in upon the south shore, and the other following; I then rowed in for the shore, shaping my course a little a-head of her, that I might keep her off, and rowed up along-side of her, one of the watermen hooked her with his boat-hook, and held her; I desired Mr. Wright to come out of that boat, and come into mine, that he must go with me to the Marine Police-office, there to give an account of his conduct, upon which he refused to come; I told him I was in the execution of my office, and it was my business to take him; he would not come into my boat; I told him it was of very little consequence, and I got into his, and took one of my men to row; I sat down in her stern, but he would not let my man row; he said, he would take one oar, and his man should row us where we pleased; I told him that would not do, if he would not go into my boat, or let my man row, I must take him by force; I then took hold of him by the collar, and by the assistance of my men, I took him by force into my boat, and we took him to the Marine Police-office, just by Wapping New-stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Is Mr. Wright one of the prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side of the river was it? - A.The Middlesex side.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the coffee which you picked up in the river came from the boat in which Mr. Wright was? - A. Certainly, I have no doubt at all; I suffered him to depart that night, in consequence of the man at the office saying he was a man of property and respectability, and he would answer for his returning in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120075"/>Q. What became of the man and boy? - A. The boy I left in charge of the office-keeper, and the man I put in Wapping watch-house till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. You are a surveyor of the Marine Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to say, you are one of the officers employed by the Justices? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Wright before? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mr. Wright's boat seeing you, they tried to evade you? - A. As it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been surveyor of the Marine Police-office? - A. Two months, or something better.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your employment before? - A. I had been a wine-merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever employed by the Customs or Excise? - A. Yes, by the Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been employed by the Excise? - A. Five years.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thames? - A. No, on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Wright was taken at last, and the boat was stopped, you let him go, upon his promise to return in the morning? - A. Yes; I understood he was a <rs id="t17980912-71-deflabel419" type="occupation">coal-merchant</rs>

               <p>Q. He did come the next morning? - A. Yes, he came between eleven and twelve o'clock to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you his address that night? - A. He did; he left a card with me.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning he came to his appointment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The card was a true representation of his address? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have been in the employment of the Excise, I dare say you can tell us this coffee, wherever it came from, was in the berry, was it not? - A. Yes, it was raw coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course being found in that situation, it was liable to be condemned, you know? - A. It was undoubtedly, as contraband goods.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you know too, that the person upon whom that species of property is found, is liable to a penalty of treble the value of the goods, and his boat liable to forfeiture? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that part of the river Thames, I take it no smuggling ever goes on? - A. It would be absurd in me to suppose it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that as one of the officers of the Police, and having been in the service of the Excise, you should feel it your duty to stop smuggling, as well as any thing else? - A. No, at present I have no authority to interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no authority, perhaps, to put in force the Bum-boat Act? - A. I think I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Wright came the next day to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And offered himself to the Magistrate as the person that had been taken the night before? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am one of the surveyors of the Marine Police-office: I was on duty on the 30th of August; we were dropping down the river upon the watch with Mr. Gottey.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the hours assigned you that night? - A.From ten at night till five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as describe what took place? - A. A little after eleven, as near as I can guess, we were lying under the shade of the house, when we saw a boat coming up, and as soon as he perceived us, he rowed directly towards the south side.</p>
               <p>Q. She was coming to westward at first, and then changed her course to the south? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to do that to avoid you? - A. They certainly did; I made my people pull as hard as they possibly could pull up the river; they turned upon me very quick, and turned down the river; I pulled as hard as I could, and then she turned again; I found it impossible to catch her, and Mr. Gottey, my brother officer, got sight of them passing a ship, and cut her off short, and I continued in full pursuit of her at the same time; in a very short time he cut them off, and ran them on shore; in one or two minutes after I came up, and we took possession of Mr. Wright; he made some resistance, by laying hold of my coat; Mr. Gottey wanted to put him into our boat, and he would not go; then we forced him into our boat; I was perfectly well armed, and I thought of giving him a cut or two, but I thought it would have been cowardly if I had; I took possession of his boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any kind of cargo on board the boat when you took possession of it? - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on the bottom of the boat? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say captain Gottey's boat kept much nearer to her than you could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other boat than this in which Mr. Wright was, and captain Gottey's boat, near to each other at the time? - A.None, I saw no other boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see any thing thrown overboard? - A. No; I perceived nothing thrown overboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken out of the water? - A. No; Mr. Gottey had taken up a bag before I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the contents of the bag? - A. I did afterwards, I examined it, and found it was coffee, I only felt it, I did not open the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wet or dry? - A. It was wettish.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120076"/>Q. Was it opened in your presence? - A. Yes, at the Police-office; it contained coffee, but I did not take particular notice whether it was raw or roasted, but I believe it was raw.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know before that where the Three Sisters lay? - A. Yes, I had been often by that way with our skiff.

               <p>Q. Where did the Three Sisters lay at this time? - A. At Limehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation at any time with Hewlings, respecting any part of the cargo? - A. Yes, eight or ten days before the 30th of August; having in my mind no evil design, I was speaking of my small income; on being accosted by Hewlings one evening, on deck, he told me, I might as well have a few shillings as not, because he said, it was a customary rule for officers and mates, in such cases; and that he would find a customer for a few beans, meaning coffee, and a little sand, meaning sugar, which he expressed three or four times over; he likewise told me, he had been mentioning it to the steward, and that he was agreeable to it; I told him, it was a dangerous circumstance, and I did not wish to be concerned in it; he told me, there was no fear, for he would find one who would take it away without discovery; upon saying so, and feeling a pressure upon me from the wants of my family, I was so foolish as to consent to it; the Custom-house and Excise-officers were to have a small quantity of coffee out of a number of bags, to prevent a discovery, that it might not be missed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the ship loaded with? - A.Coffee and sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea how many bags you had on board at that time? - A. I suppose there were about seven hundred and fourteen or sixteen bags at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What size were the bags? - A.Different sizes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the officers that were to take these small quantities out of the bags? - A.Hewlings and Bearblock, and one Dowling, a man who has absconded; Oliver was not on board at that time; and in a day or two after, they set to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it set to work? - A. I saw all the Custom-house officers and the steward on deck, and Dowling, an officer of an adjoining ship.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see Mr. Wright on board? - A. One evening I saw Mr. Wright on deck, speaking to Hewlings, and in consequence of that, Mr. Wright told me, if I had any private venture, he would take it safe on shore for me, and send it safe to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before Thursday, the 30th? - A. I think it was the Monday night or Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say in answer to him? - A. I made him very little reply, because I did not know the man; I said, I had nothing at present. I saw him several times afterwards, speaking with Hewlings and Oliver, but I did not know what passed between them. It was agreed between me and Hewlings, and Oliver and Dowling, that I should walk the quarter-deck while they were in the hold. A few days before, Hewlings told me, there was a mate wanted thirty pounds of coffee, but I had no share of that, nor the steward.</p>
               <p>Q. State any thing that passed between you and them respecting the transaction of Thursday, the 30th of August? - A.There was no conversation passed more than that; there were four or five bags filled with coffee, and carried away, I did not see them filled; I was on deck while Oliver, Dowling, and the steward, were in the hold; I saw four or five bags brought out of the hold, Hewlings assisted Dowling in hauling them up, and Oliver handed them up; then they were handed into Mr. Wright's boat, Mr. Wright received them; I handed one of them in myself, and Oliver and Dowling assisted; Bearblock was on the quarter-deck, that he might give notice of any Revenue-boats coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Could Bearblock be on deck without seeing these bags lowered over? - A. No, I do not think he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received them from the ship's side? - A. Mr. Wright; I saw him hand them along the lighter into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Mr. Wright, the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bags did you see slung over the ship, and received by Mr. Wright? - A. Either four or five, I am not certain which; I am sure of four, I saw the skiff put off with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the boat besides Mr. Wright? - A. There were two others, but I could not see who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any time received, from either of the prisoners, any money on account of the transaction of the 30th? - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation respecting any money for that transaction? - A. No. Oliver told me that Mr. Wright was pursued by the <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120078"/>police-boats, and taken; but that he was set at liberty, and his two people kept in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bearblock near enough to hear that conversation? - A. No. I told him, I should not permit any more such practices.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You were mate of this ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the cargo of this ship been delivered? - A. I understand it has; I was not from on board till it was all delivered.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never had any dispute about your accounts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the mate of that ship? - A. The mate and I had some dispute, and he entered on board a man of war, at Limerick.</p>

               <p>Q. How came that not to be paid you by the owners? - A. I cannot say; the mate and I had some dispute, and he thought that I had put down more persons than were employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to say that that man was not pressed before he entered? - A. Yes; at least he told me so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you enquire for him before you left Limerick? - A. I saw him in Limerick, upon the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had entered? - A. Yes; he told me he had entered.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know that he was pressed? - A. He was not pressed that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Your owners did not allow that 150l.? - A. I do not know how much they allowed, it was left to arbitration.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120079"/>Q. How much was allowed you for that? - A. I am not certain, I have not got the account.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not 30l.? - A. It was more than that.</p>

               <p>Q. And in consequence of that, were you not dismissed from the ship? - A. I never was told that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no idea that you were discharged from being master of that ship, because your accounts were incorrect? - A.Never, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send any private adventure on shore with Mr. Wright? - A. Yes; he took a bag of coffee on shore for me on Tuesday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, whose writing is that? - A. It is mine; I gave it him with that bag.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, as you had no evil design, of course, this is the only transaction of the sort that you have had, this trip? - A. Nor ever any other trip.</p>
               <p>Q. You never offered any coffee to sell, as your own, to any body else? - A. Not to sell, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether you ever offered coffee to any body else to sell, as your own? - A. There was a gentleman, one Mr. Taylor, who was on board of the ship one evening; when he came in, I told him, perhaps, before the ship was out, I might be able to give him a little for sea stock, which I meant to get out of the cabin, that was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the only person, was it? - A. I do not recollect any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Cooke? - A. Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Before any of these people were on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember asking him how things went on in London? - A.  I told him, I had a little rum of my own, which I had got from the captain, and that, perhaps, as I had heard that it was customary for the mates to have the sweepings, I might have a little coffee for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask him what price? - A. Yes. He told me, he did not know, but he would find a customer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him it was to be stolen coffee? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you mean it was to be smuggled coffee? - A. I considered it as my perquisite.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much sweepings of coffee there was on board this ship? - A. No, I cannot say, because I was not on board when she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. The sweepings of the hold can never be ascertained till the cargo is delivered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And those sweepings, you told Cooke, you should have as a perquisite? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. I believe the mates on board these ships, give a bond, that no loss shall happen by smuggling? - A. The owners give it, I suppose, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever read your ship's articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not one of the conditions, that you shall forfeit your wages, in case of your smuggling, or any other of the officers? - A. Yes, in some cases.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not in all cases, upon your oath? - A. I cannot be certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different articles have you signed in the course of your life? - A. I cannot say; I have been a great many voyages.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been mate? - A. Five or six voyages.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been master? - A. Only one voyage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. This disputed article of 300l. with your former owner, I think you have stated at 150l. Jamaica, how much sterling is that? - A. About 100l. I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you received money at different times? - A. Yes; I received from Hewlings, 3l.; from Oliver, 4l. 19s.; from Dowling, 2l.; and from Hewlings, another time, 2l.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon what account? - A. For eighty pounds of raw coffee, taken out of the cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is frequent for the petty-officers to have some small adventure of their own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that kept? - A. We had very little private adventure in our ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cargo of your ship put in the hold? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any private adventure mixed with it at all? - A. There was none that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. And it is your business to know that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Upon what account did Oliver say that he paid you the money? - A. For the second delivery to Mr. Wright, including a hundred weight carried on board the adjoining ship by Dowling.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday night, what was your answer to Mr. Wright, who offered to take on shore your private adventure? - A. I said, I was not certain whether I should, but I did send it afterwards.</p>

No, nothing but a ticket that I lost out of my pocket; as soon as I waked I missed the property; I went down stairs, and found the parlour door fastened inside, to prevent my getting in, I had locked it the night before, and left the key in; I had fastened all the doors when I went up; I went through a large room that I forgot there was a door in, and I was going to jump out at window; the parlour door going into the walk was left open, there are two doors to the parlour, one going into the walk, and the other into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door going into the walk was fastened? - A. Yes, I barred it and locked it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore must have been opened by somebody from the inside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the house besides you and the prisoner? - A. Not on that side of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the people on the other side of the house have access to it? - A. Yes, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the property before? - A. The same day, the 19th of July, I saw them all when he went into the house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you missed it as soon as you went down stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have found none since? - A. No, only the ticket that I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that ticket? - A. I was necessitated for a little money, and I had made use of something.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the ticket again? - A. It was sent home to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This duplicate, which we have heard talked of, and you do not know from whom it came, was a duplicate of some property belonging to your mistress? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you had pawned before that time? - A. Yes; my mistress told me if I had pawned any of her property she would forgive me; I meant to replace it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never pawned before any articles? - A. Not belonging to my mistress.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. He never before came in at your invitation to take a cup of tea and eat a bit of supper, and go up stairs together? - A. He was in the house once before for five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him the trouble of taking you up stairs, did you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he staid with you in your room from eleven at night till three in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man, I dare say, did not go to bed? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other persons in this house, who might, if they had been so disposed, have got at these things? - A. There were more gentlefolks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not had other persons in the house, that you have invited exactly in the same way? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not what he said at Bow-street taken down in writing? - A. I do not know.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a stable-keeper and post-master in St. John's-square; I was in Smithfield at the time this business happened; I was waiting in Smithfield to try to buy some cheap hay; I observed a man who went under the denomination of a coachman, walking along very well dressed, and a gay companion with him, that looked as if he was a lieutenant or a midshipman; they kept walking from Snow-hill till they got near Long-lane, by themselves, and sometimes one first, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see those two persons in Court now? - A. Yes, those are the two men at the bar; one of them I have known many years, I never saw the other before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the man that you knew before? - A. The prisoner, Atterbury, but I did not know him by that name before, I knew him by the name of Spungy; they walked on till within two rails of Long-lane, near the sheep-pens, called the rounds; before they quite quitted these rounds, there seemed to be a stoppage, and with that the short one, Dowles, took a short turn, and knocked up the prosecutor's bundle; I did not suspect that he had a shilling about him from his appearance; I did not take much notice, but saw the tall man, Atterbury, run away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near was he to the foreigner? - A. They were all three as close together as they could possibly be; when he turned round, the foreigner immediately made a great noise; I immediately ran up, I had not a dozen yards to run; I asked what was the matter; he took hold of his pocket, and said, me robbed of 41l. I then laid hold of Dowles, and said, Sir, you are a gentleman, but you are a party concerned, if this is a robbery, which I did not suspect it was; I held him a considerable time, while my acquaintance, a salesman, said, for God's sake hold him; they sent for an officer, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. He shook very much, and said, me, Sir, and I said, oh yes, I saw you do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man, Spungy, the tall man? - A. He ran away down St. John's-street, and got clear off; he was not taken for seven or eight days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the tall man was one of them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him some years? - A. Yes, rather too well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were not there at the beginning of this transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do not you know there is 80l. reward if these men are convicted? - A. I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here before to day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were talking about buying hay and did not much attend to what passed, till there was a cry out? - A. There was no cry out till I made one, by laying hold of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You said to him, you are one of the men that I suppose is a party concerned? - A. No, I did not suppose it, I told him he was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the prosecutor staggering along? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing remarkable in two men walking one before the other? - A. No, but they seemed to co-operate together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any body saying at the time, or the prosecutor saying to the short man, Dowles, that was not one of the men, and you made this reply, go along and be d-d? - A. I said no such a word.</p>
               <p>Q. I tell you fairly, I shall call two witnesses to prove you did so? - A. I think you are very able to call two dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Having told you that fairly, I ask you again, did you or not make use of any expression similar to that? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120085"/>Q. Did you not say, when a person observed that he could not be one of the men, that he was, go and be d-d? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The tall man was an old acquaintance of your's? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you had known him a long time? - A. The town know him pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. The other young man was lucky enough never to be acquainted with you at all? - A. I do not know any thing of him, he had a little of it that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when he was searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon him belonging to the prosecutor? - A. I believe there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not run away, but was taken upon the spot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was it you saw him do? - A. He knocked the bundle upwards with his hand, and immediately put his hand into the foreigner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see them converse together before they came up to the prosecutor? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see his hand in the pocket? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whose hand was it? - A. The tall man's; and he whipt his hand out again instantly.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect, any time in the month of August, being in Smithfield? - A. To the best of my recollection, it was the 2d, about a quarter before five; I had been in the Borough for my mistress, coming across from Cow-lane to Long-lane there seemed to be a bustle, and there was a foreigner very much intoxicated in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There was a little bit of bustle when you came up? - A.No, not before I came up; as I came along I saw him with a bundle and a stick across his shoulder, and I saw a young man passing by at the same time, in a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the young man before? - A. I never saw him, to my knowledge. As he passed by the foreigner, being in liquor, happened to turn round, and the stick slew up in his face, and as he put his hand to save the stick from going into his face, his hat sell on one side, and then there was a man immediately came and collared this young man in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that the immediate next thing that happened? - A. There was a man that passed by, and took something out of the foreigner's pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Are you positive that the young man in the blue coat did not make the first attack upon the foreigner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were there, had you any conversation with any body? - A. Nobody in particular, only I gave my service so far, that I gave my address where I lived, and told them, if I could be of any service in regard of what I saw, I would come forward.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a stick do you mean by a notched stick? - A. I do not know whether it was white or yellow.</p>

               <p>Q. You attended the next day before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, I did attend, but the man that opened the door would not let me go in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at the man at the bar - is that the man that you speak of? - A. I cannot say to the man again.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You did not see the purse taken at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Plattin behaved extremely ill, I understand? - A. He abused me, and called me an impudent b-h.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not see the property taken, how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120087"/>came you to say to Plattin, that young man is innocent of what you have taken him for? - A. I saw that he was by himself.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; I was walking along, and saw three men at the trunk-maker's door, the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard, just before two o'clock; by that time there were two of them parted, and went towards Newgate-street, and the other man went towards Ludgate-hill. In about half an hour after I was sitting in my box, and I saw the three men come past my box again; I took them to be the same three men; they had all brown coats on; my box is against St. Paul's school; they came from towards Cheapside, and were going towards Watling-street; by that I watched them, and they made a stop about three doors on this side Watling-street, at the bottom of my beat, and there they stood with their faces all three of them towards the window shutters in my beat; upon that I got out of my box and went up to them, and they turned up the Old Change; I followed them up the Old Change, and I turned up towards Cheapside; I went upon my beat again, and then I saw the same three men at the other end of my beat, with their faces against the window shutters again; I went up to them again, and they crossed the way to Newgate-street to a post there; I then went and told Apothecary that I saw the three men, and he went and told Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they about with their faces to the window shutters, were they trying the window shutters? - A. No, I did not see them trying to do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think that odd? - A. I thought they were going to bore or cut the shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them first before two 
o'clock? A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. When was it you saw them last? - A. About half past two, it was hardly day-light I believe then; Humphreys then pulled off his coat and followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same men that were afterwards apprehended? - A. I believe they were two out of the three; there was only one brought to our watch-house, and I am sure he was one that I saw at the bottom of the beat the last time altogether; I saw them four times, I saw them twice at the bottom of my beat; after I saw them go towards Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The bottom of your beat is Watling-street? - A. Yes, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120090"/>top of my beat is at the trunk maker's door by St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>Q. The east side of St. Paul's is your beat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw three men looking at some window shutters; you don't mean Mr. Tinkler's shutters? - A. No, my beat is not of his side.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought they were the same men, because they had all brown coats on? - A. They seemed so.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see their faces? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had had the misfortune to be going that way, with a brown coat on, you would have supposed I was one? - A. No, they were all three together.</p>

             swron. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the officers of Worship-street. On Wednesday, the 11th of July, between six and seven in the afternoon, I went, in company<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120091"/>with five other officers, to a house in <placeName id="t17980912-76-crimeloc457">Checquer-alley</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner's hands? - A. Yes; the press had then been recently pulled, because I found a plate with a stamp upon it; his hands were as all men's hands are that work a rolling-press, with black ink or red ink, they wipe the plate with their hands; his hands were then stained with red ink, and the stamps that hung upon the line were worked with red ink, they were damp; the linen is obliged to be damped to receive the impression; this plate was on a thing which they call a jigger, that they wipe on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. I take it that has been in your custody ever since? - A. No, it has not; I marked it with my own name, and gave it to Mr. Estcourt's clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is a jigger? - A. It is what the plate is wiped on after it receives the ink; this grate is for laying the plate upon, with charcoal underneath, to keep it in a little warmth; this is the pot that had the charcoal in it, which was then alight; after the prisoner was secured, these printed stamps I took down from the line, and I have had all but three ever since in my possession. (Produces them.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were they damp when you found them upon the lines? - A. Yes, they were, they are two shilling stamps, No. 24. This quantity of cloth was over the press, but had not received any impression, it was wet, in a fit state to print; I found the press compleat at work, and every apparatus compleat for printing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. The door of the garret was open when you went up stairs? - A. It was just opened as I entered, three of us going up stairs, I saw the prisoner with the nob of the door in his hand, and Barnett Solomons was behind the press.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that all you know of him? - A. No, I did give evidence once against him in this Court for coining of halfpence, I believe about twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any other circumstance about Mr. Solomons? - A. No, not of my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know he is as great a rascal as lives? - A. I do not know that; I know many of the Jews are a deal worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these plates did you find under the press? - A. This, the sixpenny one, that impression had just been pulled.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the other? - A. Ready to be put in the press as the other came out, I found it lying on the jigger. I served five years to a copper-plate printer, that makes me know so much of the nature of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that stamp, is that an engraving of your's, or belonging to the Stamp-office? - A. It is a counterfeit; our stamps are engraved 4, 6, and 8, on a plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at one of these impressions, does that stamp resemble the original? - A. No, this is a counterfeit, it is an impression from this plate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does it mean to resemble the real stamp? - A. Yes, so nearly, that persons not conversant in these things would be deceived.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Tell me the distinguishing circumstances? - A. They have omitted the chain in the counterfeit stamp.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you fetch it from there yourself? - A. I believe this gentleman delivered it to me who fits next me, Mr. Linley.</p>

               <p>Q. Now point out to me the difference between that on the large plate, and that which you have in your right hand? - A. There are many differences that you would not be a judge of, there is a chain totally omitted.</p>
               <p>Q. These plates, by wearing, become unfit for use, without re-touching? - A. They are repaired upon the same plate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I think it is not necessary for me to say much, being fully conscious of my own innocence; that man is the greatest traitor that ever was born, he has sworn as false as any thing under the sun; if ever an innocent man stood at the bar I am he; my Lord, and Gentlemen, I have nothing more to say, I leave it intirely to your discretion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. My Lord. This indictment is founded upon an Act of Parliament, the 36th of the present King, which refers to a former statute, the 24th of the King, by which it is enacted, that no person is to sell hats without a licence. It then charges upon hats a duty of two shillings for every hat above the value of twelve shillings, and so on. Then the statute of the 36th of the King enacts, that every hat made of felt, wool, stuff, beaver, or leather, &amp;c. shall be lined, or covered, in the inside of the crown, with silk, linen, or other proper materials, whereon a durable mark, or stamp, can be conveniently affixed, to denote the duties by the said recited Act imposed; and on which materials, a stamp, or mark, to be provided by the Commissioners of the Stamp-office, shall have been stamped.</p>
               <p>Now, if this same status had charged the duty which has directed the stamp to be used, and has created the subject of the offence, beyond a doubt this indictment would have been good; but, I submit to your Lordship, upon the face of this indictment, that it is at least equivocal by what statute this duty is charged; if this indictment had stated that he forged a stamp denoting a duty charged by the 86th of the King, it would be bad, because there is no duty charged by that statue; and, therefore, it must be stated to be a duty charged by some other statute than that set out in the indictment; because, by that statute, there is no duty charged at all. It is stated in the indictment, that the prisoner has forged a stamp to denote a duty charged by virtue of the statute. - I say, that is not sufficiently stated; for the only statute in the indictment is the 36th of George III. which charges no duty at all. I submit to your Lordship, that it ought to have been stated in this way; that he has forged a stamp to denote a duty charged by virtue of the statute of the 24th of George III. and then it would stand perfectly clear; that the duty being charged by one statute, and the stamp provided by another, that he had forged the stamp directed by the 36th. denoting a duty charged by the 24th.</p>
               <p>Court. You see, Brother Shepherd, the words are - "forge a stamp, and mark, then and there directed to be used, in pursuance of a certain Act made in the 36th, denoting a duty of two shillings, charged by virtue of the statute in that case made and provided."</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. If your Lordship thinks that must necessarily refer to some other statute, my objection falls; but I submit to your Lordship, it is most perfectly equivocal as it stands at present.</p>
               <p>Court. If there is a statute made and provided for the purpose, am I to suppose it refers to a wrong statute?</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. If your Lordship takes the statute in that case made and provided necessarily to refer to the 24th.</p>
               <p>Court. He has transgressed against the 36th, by forging a stamp in that case made and provided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. I will just trouble your Lordship with another objection. This statute creates an offence. the object of which is to defraud the King of a duty raised by another statute. - Then this man has offended against two statutes, and this indictment concludes "against the form of the statute" only; whereas, I apprehend, if there is a breach of the law against two statutes, it is necessary that the indictment should conclude "against the form of the statutes;" I admit it will not vitiate an indictment which concludes against the form of the statutes when the offence is only against one statute; but I contend, that where it is stated against the form of the statute, when it is an offence against two statutes, that indictment is bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I shall apply myself entirely to the latter objection of my learned Friend's. - My learned Friend says truly, an indictment must conclude against the plurality of statutes, if a plurality of statutes be necessary to contemplate the crime of which a party is accused; if, therefore, it were necessary in any degree to consider the constitution of the crime, as made by the 24th of the King, it would give a semblance to the objection of my learned Friend; but, inasmuch as here, whatever other duties may be imposed by former Acts, the 36th comprises all those cases, so as to bring them within one focus. I consider the crime, of which the prisoner is indicted here, to consist in what I shall now state to your Lordship: whatever the duties were before, whether they had been imposed by one, two, three, or four different statutes, it does not at all signify here; the statute of the 36th says, that a stamp, ordered by the Commissioners to denote any thing that had gone before, that the forging, or counterfeiting that stamp, is the crime in the contemplation of the Legislature. Therefore, your Lordship can have nothing to do with any other statute; for the 36th of the King expressly makes it criminal in the party to forge that, which, by the order and direction of the 36th, is adopted in order to denote such duty, and therefore it could not have been necessary for us, in the least degree, to have taken notice of the manner in which the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120094"/>duties were imposed by the 24th of the King. It is true, the Act of Parliament does not expressly charge the duty of 2s.; but there are a great variety of cases in the books, where I take the distinction always to have been this: that where the crime in the contemplation of the Legislature is laid altogether, and the punishment affixed by a latter Act of Parliament, though there may have been several preceding Acts of Parliament, it is always laid as against that statute. The crime here, is the counterfeiting a stamp, that stamp is directed to be used by the Commissioners, by this very Act; and all we have to consider is, whether the stamp, so made use of, was ordered by the Commissioners under this Act. We conceive we have nothing to do with the antecedent Acts, and therefore, we trust your Lordship will be of opinion that the indictment is good.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, There has been one position of law assumed upon this occasion, against which I beg leave to enter my protest. In the first place, the foundation certainly fails - The crime with which the prisoner at the bar stands charged, is forging a certain stamp; that crime was created by the 36th of the King, and created by no other statute whatever; because, till the 36th of the King, that stamp, which he is charged with forging, as a capital offence, was not in existence. The 24th of the King had ordered stamps to be made, but they were to be impressed upon paper; that mode of collecting the duty was found to be open to considerable evasion, and therefore the 36th repealed that mode of impressing the stamps. To denote the duty, it says, that new stamps shall be prepared by the Commissioners, to be impressed upon linen, and so far fixed to the hat as to make evasion more difficult. Then comes the enacting clause, which says, if any person shall forge or counterfeit any stamp directed to be used by this act, then they shall suffer death, without benefit of clergy. There is no other stamp legally in existence, and therefore there can be no other forgery than that individual forgery created by this individual Act; therefore, that would be the answer to the position, upon which the subsequent objection must be grounded, namely, that there are two statutes relative to this offence; but, supposing that were so, yet the inference of law deduced from it, cannot stand. It is taken as a position, that the indictment ought to conclude against the form of the statutes - I know that Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, when he treats on the subject of indictments, says, there have been some authorities for it; but he adds, there are also strong authorities for the contrary opinion, which is also most agreeable to precedents; and I will venture to say, that there are no precedents in the margin of this book(4 Hawkins, 71) of indictments, upon which the objection has been raised, and upon which the objection has been allowed. The precedents there cited, are precedents of actions qui tam, in which the objection has been allowed; but in those cases there is no allegation of a crime, and therefore the party claiming a penalty may be held to greater strictness than in an indictment calling upon the party to answer for a crime. There is no precedent, so far as I have been able to search, of that kind; but those precedents which are cited in the margin, are proceedings in actions qui tam, and not upon indictments; and therefore, do not warrant the assertion that there are precedents, in which the Court have decided, that, in indictments, the conclusion must be against the form of the statutes; on the contrary, the strong authorities, as well as the course of precedents, are on the other side; and therefore, unless there is some modern case stronger, in which those former opinions are taken notice of, and held not to be law, while it is said, the stronger opinions are on the other side, and the course of precedents too, your Lordship will not give way to the weaker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. My Lord, With respect to the authority of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins, there are cases which appear of a contrary determination. Mr. Serjeant Hawkins says, where the proceedings are in latin, and may not be understood, the safest way is to put it with an abridgment, contra formam statut, which may stand either for statuti or statutorum, as will best maintain the indictment. Where one act creates an offence without reference to another, which enacts what the punishment shall be, there I apprehend it should be against the form of the statute, because the subsequent statute has nothing to do with the offence, but merely with something that is to be done with the prisoner, after the verdict of the Jury has passed, namely, punishment: But where an offence is constituted, and necessarily must be founded, upon more than one statute, it is not a true description of the prisoner's offence, because he has not done any thing criminal against the form of the statute, but against the form of the statutes. Now, to apply that observation, suppose for a moment, the 24th Geo. III. was expunged from the book of statutes, neither my learned Friend, or any body else, could form an indictment, or convict a man upon the 36th, because the 36th creates an offence forging a stamp denoting a duty charged by another statute; therefore, the 24th of the King, must be an existing law at the time the offence was committed, or it is no offence at all; and therefore makes one of the ingredients upon which the indictment is framed; for the indictment is for doing an act prohibited by the 36th, producing a fraud, the existence of which fraud can only be against the 24th; for there must be an act done, and there must be a fraud intended; the act must be done against the 36th of the King, the intention of fraud is against the 24th, because it is an intention to defraud his Majesty of a duty charged by the 24th-Then there must be two Acts of Parliament to constitute the offence charged, and if so, then I submit to your Lordship that this indictment cannot be good.</p>
               <p>My learned Friend, Mr. Knapp, refers me to an authority very much in point, in Hale's Pleas of the Crown, 2d vol. 173. The case cited, is the case of Dingly and Moore, from Croke, Eliz. 6."If one statute be relative to another, as where the former makes the offence, the latter adds a penalty; the indictment ought to conclude contra forma statutorum." That is not exactly this case to be sure, but the principle, as it seems to me, is the same; that where two statutes must be taken into contemplation, in order to constitute the offence, it must be against the form of the statutes. The indictment charges that he has forged a stamp denoting a duty of 2s. upon all hats above the value of 12s. to be sold by any person; suppose they had blundered at that description, and said, denoting a duty upon all hats above the value of 5s.; beyond a doubt, it would have been bad, because it must charge, by the 36th of the King, that the stamp forged, is a stamp denoting a duty. - There is no duty upon a hat of 5s. therefore, if it does not say, forging a stamp denoting a legal duty, as charged by the 24th, it would not be any offence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120095"/>at all. That shews that your Lordship must necessarily look at the 24th, in order to see whether he has forged any stamp which does denote any thing at all; and here the offence is founded upon that statute, because the offence is, forging a stamp, directed by the 36th of the King, to denote a duty charged by the 24th of the King; and therefore, unless the indictment had stated it to be against the form of the statutes, it cannot be good.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. This objection, in the first place, is perfectly new. I believe I have attended scores of prosecutions in the offices which I have had the honour to fill, and in every case these forgeries are attended with the consequence of breaking in upon some revenue, founded upon some Act. I agree with my Brother Shepherd, that if one Act shall speak of the crime, and another of the punishment, you must take the two Acts together; but it is singular, as it strikes my mind, to suppose that the 24th of the King had any thing to do with the present indictment, which is an indictment for offending against a mode of offence, which is, for the first time, described in the 36th; it is an offence against that Act, and that only; but in describing the offence, and purely as matter of description, the indictment says, he has forged a stamp and mark directed to be used in pursuance of a certain Act; for what purpose? it then describes the thing, for the purpose of denoting a stamp duty of two shillings, by virtue of the said statute. Then it is nothing more than describing what sort of stamp it is that has been forged; but the crime of forging depends entirely upon the 36th, and not at all upon the 24th. I take it this does not fall within that sort of case, where you must necessarily look into two statutes to see what the offence is; you only look into one, and there you see what the consequences of that offence is; it is a very different case from where the crime is defined in one Act, and the consequences in another. I am therefore of opinion, that the objection should be over-ruled: at the same time, if Mr. Knapp, and my Brother Shepherd, think it a point worth reserving, it shall be reserved.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called thirteen witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p> GUILTY Death. (Aged 23).</p>
               <p>After the verdict was pronounced, the prisoner addressed the Court as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am perfectly satisfied with my trial; I meet the sentence with every fortitude that a man ought to do. To the Counsel, who have pleaded for me, I return my most sincere thanks. The evidence of Barnett is completely false; and knowing my own innocence, and the manner in which I have been drawn into it, I shall meet that God hereafter, whom he dare not shew his face before. I am totally innocent, and I know that God will stand my friend, and a crucified Christ will receive me in the arms of his faithfulness, when I launch from the gallows into an endless eternity.</p>

             sworn. - I am a grocer: On the 8th of this month, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was standing behind my counter, in Compton-street; I saw the prisoners, and two other young men, pass along on the other side of the way, they went on to the corner of Stacey-street, all four together, they stopped about a minute in conversation, when Shaw left them, appa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120096"/>rently to go home, he lives that way; he might have got ten paces, when the other three lads followed him, and in about two or three minutes afterwards I saw Harris with a bundle of linen under his arm, such as was described at Marlborough-street; Harris, and the biggest of the other two, passed close under my window, the other was on the other side of the way, and when he saw me looking at him, he stopped running; it struck me it was a robbery, and I learned that they were gone into the Bull's-head, in Crown-street; the bundle appeared to the like a bundle of sheets done up with a brown wrapper over it, that did not quite cover it, the things were apparently in a rough state, not mangled. When the constables came, I went to the Bull's-head, and the two prisoners were taken into custody; I pointed out Harris as the person who had the linen under his arm, But I never saw Shaw after the time that I speak of.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you know the prisoners before? - A. I have known Shaw a long time, and the other I know by sight; I have seen him frequently.</p>

               <p>Harris's defence. I went into this shop with a young man who had got a cold, to buy some barley-sugar, he said he could have more than that for money, and we came away, and went to the Bull's-head, and there we were taken.</p>

               <p>Shaw's defence. I know nothing at all of the bundle, I went into that public-house as I generally do at my meals, I never saw Harris before in my life, I am entirely innocent.</p>
               <p>Shaw called three, and Harris one witness, who gave them a good character.</p>

On Monday, the 9th of April, I went, in company with some other officers, to a house in George-yard, Whitechapel, where we apprehended the men that were tried at Chelmsford, in company with the prisoner at the bar; the three men that were tried at Chelmsford resisted very much, in the mean time the prisoner made her escape; I searched the apartment, it was a lower room, she acknowledged that it was her room; I searched the room, and found the articles stated in the indictment tied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120097"/>up in this handkerchief, and concealed in a bureau bedstead; I secured the three men, and took them to the office. On the Wednesday following, I went, in company with Griffiths, to a place called Salter's-rents, near Shoreditch-turnpike, where we found the prisoner in bed; I asked who that room belonged to that she made her escape out of, and she said it was her's; I asked her if she knew any of the prisoners that we had apprehended; she said, yes, she knew Morris, he had slept with her about six weeks; she had a bed-gown, which, upon my asking her, she said Morris gave her after the first robbery; Mr. Chapman was robbed twice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chapman. I was robbed the 17th of March the first time, and afterwards in the night of the 8th of April.(Nowlan produces the property.)</p>
