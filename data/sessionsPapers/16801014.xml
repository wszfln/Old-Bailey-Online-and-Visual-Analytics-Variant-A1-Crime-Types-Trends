            <p>So likewise was a Servant-Maid who had robbed her Master, stealing first his Keys, and then twenty eight pounds odde Money out of his Trunks, and then absenting herself till she was taken.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>Two Youngmen (the one a kinde of a Fruiterer, the other a Pewterer) were Tryed for Murdering a Watchman. The Case was thus; The Fruiterer carrying some Goods to Market very early in the Morning, and being accompanied with this Pewterer, two Watchmen stopt them near Pater-Noster-Row, and would have them go along before the Constable; which they seemed somewhat unwilling to do, but at last consented: And as they were going along, the Pewterer did, or offered to strike up one of the Watchmens Heels, as he testified, with an intent as it seems only to get from them; and thereupon a Fray began between them: And a person, that lives by the place, gave Evidence, that upon the first disturbance looking out of his Window, he heard one of them often say, Give me my Hat; but of which side he was, he could not tell, but said, that presently after he saw the Fruiterer engaged with the person kill'd, who having got the now Prisoner by the Hair of the Head, did divers times knock the same against the Wall, upon which the said Prisoner (the Fruiterer) turning short, got under the said Watchman, and flung him down, and struck him with his own Watch-staff, giving him severe Blows and Bruises, of which he languish'd above<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16801014002"/>three Moneths, and then died. The Fruiterer did what he could to get him Cured, promising to pay the Chyrurgeon; and the Deceased did declare, he did forgive him with all his heart. And that as for the Pewterer, he never so much as toucht him, yet he being in company with the other, and the first that began the Fray, and the Watchmen being upon their Duty, (as was proved by the Constable and Beadle, who that Night gave them their Charge and Stand) the Court gave Directions, That it was Murder by Law in them both; and they were found Guilty of Murder accordingly.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>Then a Carpenter's Servant, and a Coachman belonging to a

            , were Tryed for Murdering a Gentleman at Hampton Court: The Carpenter's man upon his first Apprehension and now at the Bar did confess, that he himself did the Murder; having in a most barbarous manner clest his Head with an Ax, which was produced in Court. But he also added, That the Coachman 
               <persName id="u16801013-4-person13">Arraigned</persName>
             with him did put him upon, and bribe him to do that horrid Deed; because, he said, he had spoken ill words of somebody he belong'd to; promising to give him Fourty Shillings and a better thing [for so were his words] for the same, and that thereupon he did it; but had no body could prove any of all this. Only it was proved, that when it was told the Coachman, that such an one was Murdered, he said, It was no matter, for he used to speak ill of a Person of Quality, or words to that effect, on which he was taken upon Suspicion. But this did not seem a sufficient proof to convict several persons of Esteem testifying his honest Conversation, &amp;c. so he was found Not Guilty. But the other, who confessed he did the Murder, and afterwards took the Gentlemans Money out of his Pockets and his Watch, which when he was taken he was found exposing to sale, was most justly Condemned.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>A Gentleman was Indicted for Murder; the case to this purpose; The Prisoner sent in some Cloaths to be mended or altered, to an eminent Tailor, and one of the Workmen promised him they should be done by such a day; but coming for them, he found they had disappointed him, which put him in some passion, to add to which, one on the Shop-board told him, if he had left some Money to drink, the work had been finisht; whereupon he flung a pressing Iron, or Goose amongst them, but without doing mischief, and so went out of the Shop; upon which, the Journeymen (as he alleadged) set up an hallow by way of derision, then returning he caught up a pair of Sheers, and threw it towards the Board (whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16801014003"/>aiming at any particular, or promisonously, did not fully appear) but so it was, that they hit one of the men, and gave him a grievous wound, of which he languished some time, and dyed; though it was the opinion of some Surgeons, that the same might not be the occasion of his death, yet it was proved, that he was an healthy man before, and never enjoyed himself afterwards, but complained thereof as his deaths-wound. However, there oppearing no prepensed Malice, nor particular aim at him, upon consideration thereof, and all Circumstances, too tedious to recite, the Jury thought fit to find it Manslaughter.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>After this, Four persons were brought to the Bar, viz. one 
               <persName id="u16801013-6-defend14" type="defendantName">Mr. Markland
               <interp inst="u16801013-6-defend14" type="surname" value="Markland"/>

             and his Wife, and Maid-servant, and a Refiner that dwelt in Grub-street, all Indicted for High-Treason, for Clipping and Impairing the Kings Coin; Markland had formerly been a Brewer, and lived in good fashion, but failed, and was Imprisoned in the Kings-Bench, there Poverty, and an Ill Conscience, and bad Company, taught him this mischievous Clipping Trade; which he has since followed to great advantage, living like a Gentleman by the Ditch-side in Black-fryars. The Evidence against him, was, One that being informed he was a Clipper, got a Warrant, and in searching his House, found a shilling under a Chest of Drawers, just newly Clipt, and not so much as rounded; and also two low stools on which they were wont to rub the Money after they had Circumcised it. Another person a poor woman gathering Herbs in St. Georges fields, found two pair of shears, and being advised to carry them to some Workmen that made such Instruments, happoned to light on the very Man that made them, who being examined, swore that he sold them to Mr. Markland, and that what with new-steeling, and all, he had had of him four pair. Markland was askt what use he put those shears to, being a Brewer, which Trade has no need of such Tools; wherefore being able to assign no occasion, he utterly denyed that he had any shears at all of the Witness, which rendred all the rest of his defence little regardable. But besides, there was one swore, that he had bargained with him to give him twenty two shillings in Clipt Money, for Twenty shillings fair and large, and that he had actually allowed him that advantage, they having dealt so long on that score, as to have Exchanged five or six hundred pounds. But that which put all out of doubt, was the Testimony of one of the same Gang, that he had actually seen him Clipping, so that there was no colour of excuse, but he was found guilty.</p>
            <p>The Refiner had been formerly questioned and got off, and so to he did now, there being no direct proof, but that he held a Correspondence with the other &amp;c. so neither could it be fixt on his Wife or Maid, that they were actually concerned in, or privy to it, though some Evidence and Circumstances were offered to that purpose; so these three were Acquitted.</p>
