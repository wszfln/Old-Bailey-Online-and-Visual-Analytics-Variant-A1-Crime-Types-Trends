I was formerly the wife of James Cooper, who kept the Albion tavern and refreshment rooms, at King Street, Greenwich—the prisoner was a waiter there—my husband died six or seven years ago last september, I can't recollect exactly—the prisoner continued to act as waiter.—I had two houses of business at that time—on 8th June, 1866 I was married</p>

               <p>to the prisoner at St. Bartholomew's Church, Islington—I did not know that he had a wife alive—I went with him on one occasion to the Nunhead Cemetery, and he went into a house and left some money for a grave-digger to make up the grave of his wife that was dead—I knew he had been married previously—I believed his wife was dead—he told me so—after we were married, in June, 1806, we lived together at the Albion—I am not living there now—he sold all my furniture, and took all my money—I have not a peony—he sold everything over my head—I am houseless and home<lb/>less—hero is one of the bills—the letter produced is in the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is that bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a bill of the sale of my furniture—the prisoner went into partnership with my husband two or three months before his death—the prisoner bad no money—he was only in partnership as to the house we lived in—he did not pay any money into the concern—he said he had money, but he had not—I did not quarrel with my late husband—I was not charged at the Police Court with beating him, I charged him—he used to drink, and was excitable then, but he was not a bad husband—he always, gave me money—this man did not—he did not I show marks and bruises at the Police Court, and charge me with doing it—I could not tell you now—the prisoner persuaded me to take my husband before the Magistrate, for he said I had endured too much—I had been married before—I was married to Cooper; that man was prosecuted for I bigamy—I did not prosecute him, my mother did—I did not marry Cooper till two years afterwards—after Cooper died, in 1865, I did not always con<lb/>tinue to live in the same house with the prisoner—I had two houses, and I sometimes I was as one and sometimes at the other—the prisoner continued I to live at the Albion, and till we were married he slept in his own room—that was not the room in which I slept—I did not sleep in the same room I with him for several years before I married him—I did for a short time; I will say six months—he used to give it out that I was Mrs. Maynard—I did not do so—the bill of sale under which the furniture was sold, was given twelve months ago—it was not given long before I married him—I have not got it here—I did not know the prisoner had had a wife from when he had been separated seven or eight years—I know John Tickey—I new said in his presence that Maynard had parted with his wife, and did not know what had become of her—I never said that his wife had left him eight or ten years before, taking his savings' bank book with her, and playing up the devil with him—I never said that we were waiting till the seven years had expired, find then we were going to be married; nothing of the kind—I was living with him without being married because the business tied me so much—I used to do the cooking—we were to have been roamed some time before, but the business detained us—he did not say we must wait till the seven years had elapsed—I never said so to anybody—to wanted to be married by license—he came to us from Hastings—I believe he was at times a waiter at the House of Commons.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Canterbury Place, Lambeth Road—I was: a clerk—in March, 1866, I made, the acquaintance of Charles Webb, and he employed me as clerk, at 54, Cornhill—there was an office there—it con<lb/>sisted of two rooms, on the, second, floor;, at least, one room, and a little lobby—I knew him by the name of Charles Webb, and no others—the business carried on was the London and Provincial Plate Glass Insurance Company—that was put on the office-door; and also on the doors, at the entrance of the passage—I was to have 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I made the arrangement with Charles Webb—I saw nothing of George Webb till six months or more afterwards—I was there, altogether, about eighteen months—I was, engaged on 18th March. 1866, and I went about a week afterwards—I continued there till August, 1867, regularly, except being occasionally laid up with the gout—Charles Webb acted as manager of the company—there were forms of policies in the office—I was asked by Charles Webb to sign in the name of Joseph Watts Lodge—he did not like the name of Dodge—I occasionaly signed policies, not many—a few—I made them out—I signed them as secretary—Charles Webb signed his name as Charles Randall—I under stand his name is Charles Randal Webb—I frequently, saw, him sign as Charles Rahdall—George Webb came there occasionally while I was there—I don't know that he did anything at first—I believe, after some months. he was appointed as an agent—I never received, any Moneys from him—I did not give him like policies—after he became agent he might, come there more frequently—I can't say how often—he had nothing to do with the policies, so far as I know, except receiving them occasionally, I suppose, to take out, after they were executed—I never saw him pay over any moneys or receive any from Charles—I knew Frederick Webb—I Was not present at his trial—I have seen him there many times—he sometimes brought me my Money—I have seen him sign policies; but I never noticed what he signed; it was no business of mine—Frederick Webb used to, pass, in the name of Sidney, in the way of receipts, when he was out as an agent—I think I once saw a receipt signed by him in the name of Sidney—it might have been a policy, I can't say—it is over two years ago—I know of no</p>

W. underneath—I should not like to swear it; I believe it is—here is another order to Mr. Mote—I don't know whose writing it is—it is not mine—it is a similar form to the other—it is a form in use in the office—the C. G. W the same—I can't swear for the other part—here are five orders in my writing—I wrote them by the direction of Charles Webb—I believe the whole of these others to be in Charles Webb's writing—this letter of 1st September, 1866, directed to Mr. Mote is my writing, by the direction of Charles. Webb—previous to writing that letter Mr. Mote had been wanting payment of money—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir, your account is to hand; it till be examined and reported upon in a few days. Yours respectfully, James Watts Lodge, secretary")—This one was also written by me by Charles Webb's direction; "London, September 17th, 1866. Dear Sir. I am instructed by the directors to inform you that your account will be settled on 8th October."—I wrote those letters from instructions, I copied them from written instructions, on loose pieces of paper—I am sure I wrote them by the direction of Charles Webb—I did not call his attention to the expression "the directors," I thought it was all <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>—OK 30th March, 1867, I wrote this letter to Mote—that was from instructions: "Dear Sir. We shall be happy to see you here next Thursday, to make some definite arrangements relatives to your account. Yours respectfully, J. W. Lodge."—I saw Mr. Mote at the office once, I imagine that was after I had written that letter—he was not paid any money, that I am aware of—there is more than one person's hand writing to this policy—the second signature, George Edward, is that of I Webster—the body of it is mine, that was my duty—I filled up the policies by Charles Webb's direction—he has signed it in the name of Charles Randall—I did not give out the policy, I merely made it out—I can't tell bow many policies like that I have made out—some days there were not any—it might go for weeks without any—there was a policy kept, and the rotation number was kept correctly from some number that was started with—I should say they did not begin with No. 1—I commenced from a book that was in use—this is a written number—I should say I filled up nearer 500 than 100, I should think over a thousand—this is not the policy book, it is an agency book—part of it is in my writing—it was kept in the office—it contains the names of the agents—I could not say that I made out policies for all the agents—I have seen the agents at the office—I cant tell what has become of them—there might have been many policies issued from the office, not through agents—I have taken money occasionally by instruction—if any person brought money to pay into the office I took it, and that would be used for petty cash—very little was received—the money was paid for the insurance of their plate glass—in those cases the polices were issued—my name is down in this book as an agent—policies issued at the office was not put down as my agency business—my agency business was very little—I got it by making applications, the same as other agents, and I was paid a commission upon the custom I introduced from out of doors—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—I don't know whose it is—</p>

               <p>it is written on one of the headings of the company that were in use in the office—I don't think any claims were made for broken glass for six or seven months after George Webb came there—I can't say how many claims were made while I was there—a great many were made where the glass was replaced—not only by Mr. Mote but by other parties who have paid small amounts, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not tell how many claims, altogether, have been made, without the entry-book—I don't know where it is—every claim was attended to as soon as it could be, according to instructions—when I left the company, about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to me for wages—I left because I became disgusted with the affair—I could not positively swear whether, before I left, persons had complained that they could not get their glass replaced—there might hare been one or two instances—I believe everything was replaced as far as they could possibly do it—I could not point out any special case where a claim was made and not paid, of cannot remember any—it is two years ago—I knew nothing of the office at 14A, Lime Street—I never went there—all the time I was employed it was at cornhill.</p>

On 17th August I was on duty in Castle Street, about 1.30—Mr. Hales spoke to me—shortly after that the prisoner came and spoke to me—he afterwards asked Mr. Hales to go and speak to him privately, but he refused to do so unless I was with him—when he was asked for his name he asked me for a piece of paper to put his name down, but I could not see what it was—I asked what his name was and he said Ricardo, and mentioned 41, Surrey Street, I think—Mr. Hales said he should let him bear of it—he asked Mr. Hales three or four times to write to him—Mr. Hales asked him to give him his name and address—he said he had not got a card—I gave him a leaf out of my pocket-book, and my pencil, and he wrote only two R's, what the other letters were I don't know—Mr. Hales then asked him for his proper address and where he was doing his duty, or whatever his occupation might be, and he said it was at the Surrey Theatre—I asked him if he could tell me his name and address and he said it was Mr. Ricardo, Surrey Theatre—I took it and gave it to Mr. Hales, and he then left: that was all—he said that money was no object to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Poulterer's Arms, Cheapside—on 8th October about 2 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a glass of ale and gave me a bad shilling—(I recognized him as having been there about three weeks before, when he passed a bad shilling for a glass of ale)—I called my mistress, handed her the shilling, and said, "This man gave me a bad shil<lb/>ling before"—I then said to the prisoner, "You were here before and gave me a bad shilling, and this is a bad shilling"—he said, "Why did not you come after me if I gave you a bad shilling before"—I broke the shilling and gave one piece to Mr. Edmund, and the other piece fell on the floor—I found that the first shilling was bad, about five minutes after the prisoner had gone, and put it at the back of the till, where there were three shilling"—my master went there shortly after, and said, "Here is a bad shilling"—he put it by itself at the back of the till, and it was afterwards handed to the constable.</p>

I am the wife of James Collier, of 44, Cornwall Street, and am sister to the prosecutrix—the prisoner came therein Sunday morning, 12th September, about 9 o'clock, just as we were sitting down to breakfast—I heard him ask my mother if she would allow my sister to go home, and he would behave better to her—mother said, never with her consent, in regard of his not giving her sufficient to eat—he asked my sister whether she was of the same opinion as my mother—she said yes, for she did not think he would ever behave any better—he said, "Try me once more"—I had his child in my arms, and put it down against the door, and he took it up and kissed it, and nursed it several moments—I called to my mother, and told her not to leave the two together, for he looked rather wild—I was going up the stairs, and I heard my sister say, "Oh!"—I came down, and mother said, "He has struck her with a knife"—my sister was then making her way to the front door, and he was coming towards her again, with the knife open in his hand, when I shut him in the kitchen, and kept him there—my sister was bleeding—I held the door and called to my husband to come down, but he would not, and I opened the kitchen door again, the prisoner <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> down hw neck handkerchief, and</p>

I am a surgeon, at 273, Cable Street—about 10 o'clock on the morning of 12th September I was called to 44, Cornwall Street, and saw both prosecutrix and prisoner—he had two wounds in the middle of his throat—one was superficial, injuring the skin only—the other was deeper and of longer extent, and was bleeding profusely, that was perhaps half an inch deep—I stopped the hemorrhage—I had him removed to the hospital—I did not notice any wound on his chest at that time—he did not complain of any—I subsequently examined his chest and found three marks—I could not give an opinion whether they were self inflicted or not—the prosecutrix had received a stab immediately over the collar bone—I should think the blow would have come strongly on the bone, because the covering of the bone was divided—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would came such a wound—when I first saw the knife it was lying open on the table—the plaintiff had possession of it—the prosecutrix's wound has healed favorably—it might have been serious—there is always danger where the covering of the bone is injured—I should not call it a dangerous wound—it was of very slight extent—it was in a part that is dangerous—if it had misted the collar bone it would have been a very serious matter—it is just possible it might have been caused in a struggle—I should infer, however, that it had been done with some force.</p>

Miller," and to the best of my belief it is in the handwriting of Luke—I have seen him sign his name—(<hi rend="italic">litter read</hi>)—it asked for payment of Campbell's share, and was addressed from No. 6, Elisabeth Place, Grundy Street, Poplar—an answer was returned, the draft copy of which I produce (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—it stated that the money could only be paid to Campbell personally, or by letter—on the 30th July a letter was received, dated the day previously, purporting to come from John Campbell, and I believe the signature to be in the handwriting of Lake (<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—I pro<lb/>duce another letter dated 9th August, purporting, also, to come from Gamp<lb/>bell, which I likewise believe to be in the handwriting of the same prisoner (<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—the writer requested that a printed form might be sent to a Mrs. Collins, in Ellerthorpe Street, as the first one had been lest—on the 6th September another letter, enclosing a form, and signed John Campbell, was received—the questions in the form were filled up by the applicants—they showed that he had served in the 3rd Madras European regiment, that he enlisted in London, that he sailed from this country on board the <hi rend="italic">Salamanes,</hi> that he was discharged at the time of the proclamation, and that he came home again in the <hi rend="italic">Tasmanian</hi>—there was also sent a certificate of identity, signed by the Rev.

Miller" was shown to Bird, and when asked if it was his handwriting, he hesitated a little, and said he thought that it was—some pieces of paper taken by the policeman from Bird I believe to be in the handwriting of Lake—on one of those the words "John Campbell" are written three times, and on another is the regimental number, 999—since Lake has been in custody, a letter has been sent by him to the Military Secretary (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced and read</hi>), asserting that he had purchased Campbell's share of the prize-money for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I sat down on a seat in the park, and conversed with him. He handed me a letter of the 16th September, from the Military Secretary, and asked me if I would go in and receive it. He said that before his God there was nothing wrong in it. I thought I could go in, sign his name, and get the money, without doing anything wrong. I did go in, and hand in his letter, and ask for John Campbell's share of the prize money. I did not say that I was John Campbell. Mr. Walpole was not in the office then; another gentleman came in first. I did not answer Mr. G. Walpole, but the other gentleman. I did not, during the whole time I was in the office, say that I was John Campbell. If I have done wrong, it was unintentionally.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Lake's Defence.</hi> I am a total stranger in England, having been born and brought up in India. I came to this country, where I had a little prize money due to me for my service in India, having served through the late mutiny. By not obtaining employment, I was brought to a state of abject poverty, destitution, and starvation. I found all attempts to get to India of no avail. I applied repeatedly to the authorities of the India office, for a passage back, by working for it, but my request was declined, and I thought this was hard treatment; and seeing that all my friends were there, I felt a yearning desire to get back to them. In the meantime I took the necessary measures to lay my case before the Government; but my complaint was ignored and discharged, on the ground of improbability. If inquiries were made into my case, I am convinced that British law and government could not tolerate such proceedings. I was subjected to very serious injuries, when coming from India, by the neglect of the owners of the ship, and I received no satisfaction. In January last I purchased John Campbell's share of the price money for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at Liverpool, and received a receipt in the name of T. Miller. I forwarded a letter to the India Office, and it was returned, with instructions to apply personally. Unfortunately for me John Campbell has left for Australia. I throw myself upon your lordship's clemency, and upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

On the 18th October I and other women were at work in a field on the Cold Harbour Farm, occupied by Mr. Newman—between I and 2 o'clock I saw the prisoner Holden come into the field, from a lane—we spoke to him, when he said, "Don't you women hurt yourselves"—we told him that we thought a day's work would do him good, to which he made no reply—he was close to the stacks of wheat—he went to take some potatoes from a basket, and we told him to put them down, and he did so, and passed on towards the ricks—about three minutes after we lost sight of him—I looked round, and saw a man running, without his hat—it was one of Mr. Newman's men, who was going to give an alarm—I saw that the first of the wheat ricks was in flames, and was blazing up—the wind was blowing the flames towards the other ricks—three wheat ricks were destroyed—Holden was brought back to the fire, in custody, when he said he would rather be in prison than not, walking about with nothing to eat—I never saw the other prisoner there at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Glenn, who keeps the Grosvenor Arms, Hounslow—Sarah Ann Smith, the deceased, was my sister—she had for some years past lived at our house, the Grosvenor Arms—she was married to the prisoner—he was often absent at work and looking for work, for a month or two at a time—he is a stone sawyer—he had been away four weeks on the Monday that he came home on the Thursday—his wife was at our house when he came home on 23rd September, about 5 o'clock—she had been out in the early part of the day; she loft between 7 and 8 in the morning, and came home again about 12—I do not know where she had been, she did not tell me that—the went out again after that, and came borne about 3 o'clock, or it might be 4, I cannot say—I could then see from her manner and appearance that she had been drinking—I do not think she was exactly drunk, but she was the worse for liquor—the prisoner came home about 5 o'clock, and asked for a pint of beer, which I gate him at the bar—I said, "Why don't you come into the kitchen?" because he always used to go into the kitchen—he said, "No, this will do for me," and I think he went into the tap-room with it—his wife was then lying on the sofa in the kitchen, which is on the same floor as the tap-room—he had not seen her or asked for her when he asked for the beer—a little later on he went into the kitchen where she was and lit his pipe, but I did not hear them speak to one another—I did not hear them speaking, I was too far off—I cannot say how long they remained there—the next time I saw them they were standing at the bar together, between 10 and 11 o'clock, but I heard nothing pass between them—I then saw him knock her down with his fist at the bar where they were standing—he said, "I have <hi rend="italic">bunged</hi> one eye up for you, and now I will bung the other up—that was after he struck her—I had not observed anything the matter with her eye before that—he then took this hand-chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his pocket, and said, "This will <hi rend="italic">do you"</hi>—she was lying on the floor, and I stood in front of him that he should not do anything more to her—when he had used those words he put the chopper back into his pocket again—it is, I think, a tool used in his trade—he did not strike her again, that I saw—she got up soon after, and Went out at the tack door—I went into the kitchen to get her up to bed, and while I was in the kitchen I heard a rustling at the bottom of the stairs, and before I could light the candle, I went to see what it was—there was a light in the bar, and I found my sister lying with her head towards the wall, and her feet towards the stairs (the staircase is in the direction of the back door)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250061"/>
               <p>—the prisoner was dote to her, touching her—I put my hand to her chest, and found she did not breathe—I said, "Sarah does not breathe"—he said, "Nonsense, she is only faint; I have seen her faint oftentimes before"—I tried her again, and found she did not breathe, and I called my husband, who looked at her, put his hand to her forehead, said she was dead and told the prisoner to go away for a doctor immediately the prisoner went out, and my husband went after him—the prisoner returned a minute or two before my husband—he went towards the beer cellar when be came back—that is on the same floor with the kitchen—my husband came back soon afterwards, with Sergeant Hooper, and a constable—the distance between the foot of the staircase and the wall against which her head laid is four or five feet, I should fancy.</p>

               <p>suffering from the effects of drink, I do not think she was drunk, she had been drinking—ours is a beer-house, the tap, the kitchen, the cellar, and the parlour are all close to one another—we have not a beer engine, we have to fetch the beer in jugs from the cellar—he came in and lit hit pipe when the was lying on the sofa—Sophia Barlow was in the kitchen—the prisoner was quite sober then—immediately after he had lighted his pipe he went into the tap-room—I know Sophia Barlow went into the room—I do not know whether she persuaded his wife to go to him—I do not remember a conversation between Smith and his wife and Barlow, about a soldier running away from Hounslow Barracks—she did not say something to him in the kitchen, nor did I say to her "Hold your tongue, you fool, you know too much"—I never named such a thing—I do not know whether she was using foul language at that time, but she used to do so when she was drunk—there was nobody else in the bar during the evening—I do not know whether there was anybody in the tap-room, I did not go in—my husband and I serve, and Sophia—Sophia lit the gas and served in the evening—I only served a coachman with a pint of beer—I saw on soldiers that night—my husband was serving, but he was in and out several times—it was between 10 and 11 that I saw him strike her, in front of the bar, on the right eye—I cannot say to a few minutes—I then interfered to prevent his using further violence—I stood in front of her and pushed him away—that was the only blow with the fist that I saw—but he took the chopper out, and I saw him lift his leg to kick her on the left shoulder and the left side—I will swear that—I could see that hit foot touched her shoulder or her side—this is my mark to this statement—I do not recollect it being read over to me before I signed it—I think what I had stated was read over to me by a gentleman in Court—what I have said here is true, and I cannot recollect but what I said the truth before the Magistrate—that was on the 25th September, two days after it happened—(<hi rend="italic">The witnesses deposition stated</hi>: "He knocked her down four or five times, and kicked her awfully")—he kicked her very much on the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now, in the hearing of the Jury, you did not know whether he touched her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He touched her somewhere—he did not knock her down four or five times, only once—I took her wedding-ring off her finger within ten minutes after I found her dead—I do not know why I did that—I knew that she was dead, and I thought she had been killed by her husband's violence—the prisoner took the tool out of a side pocket, I do not know which, with his right hand—it was completely hidden from my view before he took it out—I could not see a piece of it—that is the same coat he has on—I think he has got an inside pocket—(<hi rend="italic">The hatchet was tried to the prisoner's pockets, but would not go into any of them to at to be concealed</hi>)—He put his tools in the yard when he came in—I think this is the basket of tools he generally carried (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think he took it into the yard—I saw it in the yard next morning—this hatchet was found next morning in the beer-cellar, by the policeman—I did not send the policeman for it—t cannot recollect saying to Hooper, "Have you found the <hi rend="italic">dipper</hi>?—I may have—I saw it in the cellar when Hooper said that it was there, but not before he was there—I did not notice the basket in the cellar, I do not know whether it was within a yard of where this lay—I had not looked for the <hi rend="italic">clipper</hi> the night before, because I did not know whether he had it in his pocket—I think I named to the policeman that I had seen him</p>

I am a market gardener, and make the Grosvenor Arms beer-house my home—on September 23rd I arrived at home at 9.30—I entered the tap-room, and saw the prisoner and his wife there; he was standing, and she was sitting down; there did not appear much the matter with them then, but the woman was the worse for drink—she talked to him a little, but I do not remember what about—about 10 o'clock they went out of the tap-room together, and were at the bar together—I did not follow them, but I could see from the tap-room that the man knocked the woman down—I saw him knock her down with his fist—no one else was there at the time—I had not heard anything said by anybody, and I was near enough to hear if anybody had said anything to them—I was as near the bar as I am to you—I saw Mr. Glenn inside the bar, but he did not talk to them—Mrs. Glenn was in the kitchen—she went up to the deceased when she was knocked down, that the man should not hit her again—the deceased continued down for half an hour or twenty minutes, sitting on the ground where she fell—she asked for someone to pick her up, but I was afraid to go for fear the man should serve me the same—she stayed there a quarter of as hour or twenty minutes before she got up—she then got up of herself, and went out at the back door—the prisoner was there in the passage between the parlour and the back door, doing nothing—that was the way she would go she had to pass him, but there was room to pass without touching each other—after that I went to bed—as I passed the prisoner he was putting something in his pocket, a bit of iron or wood about twelve inches long—that was about two minutes after she had passed him—when he knocked her down he said that he had not done with her yet—I heard that distinctly—after that I heard nothing more till I heard Mr. Douglas's name mentioned in the middle of the night.</p>

I am coachman to Mr. Barber, who lives in the Bath Road, Hounslow—on 23rd September I was lodging at the Grosvenor Arms—I got home about 8.45 at night, went into the tap-room, and saw Mrs. Smith sitting on the settle on the right-hand side in the tap-room—she had a black eye—I cannot be certain which, but I believe it was the right—she was very drunk—she was sitting on a settle, a sort of fixed seat behind the door—she had her handkerchief up to her eye, and was crying—Mr. Glenn was in the room, and the prisoner and two or three soldiers—the prisoner and one of the soldiers were playing at skitties on the baga<lb/>telle board—I heard the prisoner's wife ask him if he would let her have some beer, and I believe he made her no answer—he did nothing to her while I was in the tap<lb/>room—I stayed in the tap-room tin I went to bed, at about 9.30—the four soldiers had then left, and Mr. and Mrs. Glenn, and the prisoner and his wife, were all four standing at the bar—I did not hear anything till I got up stairs, but there was a bother among them all, I believe—I did not hear what was said, but there seemed to be a general quarrelling—I heard Mrs. Smith say, "I will go up stairs, and you sha'n't come up into my room," and she used very bad language—I had not heard anybody else say anything that I could distinguish before she said that—I did not hear anybody say anything afterwards, but I heard her halloa as she fell, I believe she fell down to the bottom of the stairs—I did not see her fall—I heard her run up three or four steps, and then heard a scuffle at the bottom of the stairs, and then she halloaed, and I heard the noise of a fall—I did nothing, I stayed in my room till the policeman came—I cannot say how soon he came, because I got into bed and dozed off to sleep—from the time she fell till the policeman came, Which was two hours, or two hours and a quarter, I did not hear any blow struck.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Honslow—on 23rd September, about 12.30, I was sent for by the police, to the Grosvenor Arms, Hounslow, and found a dead woman at the foot of the stairs—she had been dead, I suppose, some hours—the surface of the body was cold—I found severs bruises on the right arm and elbow, a bruise under the collar-bone, and a small, severe bruise on the temple; a black (right) eye, and a laceration of the eye-lid, not so recent; a bruise on the left elbow, and an injury to the left shoulder; but no bruise—next day, with assistance, I made a post-mortem examination—there was a blow on the head, which I had observed the night before; but she had a great quantity of hair—when I opened the head I found that the sutures were divided, and a large quantity of blood had escaped from a large blood vessel, which was lacerated, and was the cause of death—there was no external laceration opposite the fracture; but there was an extensive bruise—I have seen the instrument; it might produce what I saw; but it is not probable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Hanson's, and the foreman, at my request, Called up all the men, and Threadgold picked out Haven. Foulkes, and Day—they are the men I had seen go across on the 7th, 8th, and 9th—Craddock afterwards came in, and I identified him—I have known him for years, and 1 am sure he is the man—I said they would be charged with stealing lemons, and taking them to the White Hart—each of them said they knew nothing about it, and had not been to the White Hart—they made the same statement at the police-station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 144). About 4 o'clock, on the morning of the 25th September, I was on duty in Crouch End, Hornsey—I saw the prisoner with an umbrella in his hand—I wished him "Good morning;" but having some suspicion, I pushed against him, when I heard something jingle in his pocket—I asked what it was, and he said, "What it that to do with you?"—I took him to the police-station, Highgate, and searched him—I found two sets of silver castors, six silver spoons, two pencil cases, a gold watch, a lady's card-case, and a knife with a broken blade—on his person were three coats, two pairs of trowsers, and a table cover round his neck—I gave the knife with the broken blade, to John Harrison.</p>

On the morning of the 25th September, about 6.30, I visited Mr. Webster's house, No. 1, West Field Villas, Hornsey—that is about a mile and a half from Crouch End—I found the house had been broken into, and I called up the prosecutor—a panel had been cut out of a door leading to the kitchen—the scullery window had been forced open—in the door I found a piece of the blade of a knife, which corresponded with that which the last witness gave me.</p>

I am a clerk in holy orders, and live at 1, Westfield Villas, Hornsey—about 11 o'clock, on the night of the 24th September, I went over my house, and looked all up—the scullery door and the place where the panel has been cut out were all safe—I was called up by Sergeant Harrison, and found the scullery window bad been forced open—these things found upon the prisoner are all mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Metropolitan Magistrates at Westminster Police' Court—on 1st June last I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at my Court—Realf; "Sir,—My object in sending you this letter is to put you upon your guard, and avert mischief. You have, some years ago, iniquitously and most unjustly condemned to a very heavy fine a very innocent youth; this was on a pretence of drunkenness, though at the evidence proved that he had not been drinking. Through this condemna<lb/>tion he lost a very profitable employment he had at the time, and has ever since been in difficulties, of which he is tired, and he has, therefore, taken the resolution of having his revenge upon' you, the cause of them. Yes, he is decided to have your life, unless you give him a fair compensation for all the trouble he has had through your injustice. My utmost has been done to calm him, and make him give up the idea of murder, but all has been in vain. To-morrow he is to leave for London, and if, in the course of next week, he does not find in one of the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper an advertisement headed 'Compensation,' intimating your intention of giving damages for all he has suffered through your injustice, be has taken the catch that next Sunday you shall be dead. For your sake, then, heed this notice; save yourself by giving the justly-demanded compensation, or other<lb/>wise be will commit the deed. He is tired of the iniquities life your con<lb/>demnation has made his, and would prefer death. Suicide is a crime, he has often told me, but he would one day die by the hangman's help, and quite delighted to be revenged, and to have made you suffer for your base in<lb/>justice. I willingly would give you my name, to prove the sincerity of the notice, but your past behaviour to my friend shows you to be a dishonest old rascal, and I fear that if I did sign in name you would in a black<lb/>guardly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250082"/>
               <p>guardly mannor, through foul means, use it to bring me before men of high authority, and oblige me to betray my friend that you may have him arrested and locked up, that you may save your mean self without giving any compen<lb/>tion for your base injustice. I, therefore, will end, and add that if you wish to live longer, the best is to give the said advertisement in the newspaper mentioned, and act fairly, without any treacherous, hidden intention, for which you would soon after suffer either directly or indirectly by the hands of your victim or of some of his friends, amongst whom is Your Forewarner, again advising you for your sake to notice this letter,' In consequence of that, I communicated with the police, and on the follow<lb/>ing day, 2nd June, by my direction, an advertisement was put in the Everything; <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Compensation.—Threats are quite unavailing, though if the facts are as stated, something perhaps might he done. What is asked?"—That appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard—on</hi> the 5th June, I received this letter, dated the 4th:—"Sir. This morning I have received a letter from the young man in whose behalf I have seat you my last, a also a number of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi> of the 2nd inst, the advertisement in which delighted me, in shewing that you are willing to compromise the matter in a friendly and honorable manner, which will prevent any unnecessary crime. My friend also expresses his satisfaction at hit finding it is thus. All facts are as stated in my last, but he thinks, that if you want convincing proofs to that effect, an interview would be more convenient. His financial less, all included, at the time of its occurrence, amounted to between: 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides the other damage he went through. At present, he is in very reduced circumstances, out of which, by a sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he could disentangle himself, and get in a position to earn respectably some money; a retribution to that amount, then, would satisfy him, for which, besides, he would ever be grateful, since it would put him in a situation to earn respectably his life, the only thing he longs for. Should you be willing to come to his terms, without further delay or intercourse, or should ye prefer an interview, to have convincing proofs of the veracity of the stated facts, please to let him know it by another advertisement, headed "Compensation," given before long in another number of the tame newspaper; and in the former instance you shall be respect<lb/>fully informed where to forward the said retribution, while in the second, my friend should wait upon you at the place and at the time appointed in the advertisement. He begged of me, in his letter, to send you all these particulars, because he told me he felt too nervous to write directly to you himself. I trust you will, in the present, find nothing offensive, and hoping that the friendly feelings, which at present seem to actuate you, shall not have altered at your reception of it. I conclude with the hope, that he and my friend, at present enemies, shall one day be good friends; and that then you will know who has been the party, who at present sending you his compliments, has taken the responsibility of Intervener in this matter,"—I received that also at my Court—the post-mark to both, is Jersey—I looked at the handwriting of the two letters, with a view of comparing them, and I have no doubt they arc in the same hand<lb/>writing—on 12th June, I caused another advertisement to be inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi>—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Compensation. Facts should be given; an interview as suggested seems desirable, or references, will be at Freemason's Tavern, Great Queen Street, at 5.30 P.M., Wednesday next")—I next received this letter, with the post-master of</p>

               <p>Jorney, 13th June—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir. I have yesterday received a letter from the friend in whose name I have written; be expresses his surprise at seeing no reply in any number of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi> of this week, and damands me whether I have written to you according to his wish this week, or if I have sent ye my name and address, and received a direct reply. As this has not been the case, I beg of you on receiving the present to give without delay, in the newspaper, one of the replies demanded through my last letter, or if you find too high the damages demanded, through what ye offer. I would be sorry to see this other week pass on without a reply, became in suck a case I fear, from the content of the letter received as aforesaid, some mischief. If you have lost memory of the letter received by you on Monday last, I hope this one will refresh your memory. Com<lb/>pensation,' ye must not forget, is to be the heading of the advertisement, whatever may be the main part of it With complements, and the hope that this affair shall soon come to an end, believe me, air, yours; obediently, The Peacemaker")—I have no doubt that letter is in the same writing as the others—it was contained in this buff or brown envelope—on 16th June I caused another advertisement to be inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard,</hi> of which this is a copy (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Compensation.

Yesterday week I wanted to explain all this to Mr. Arnold, but I was seized with a fit, and the consequence is I have been locked up a week, not knowing I could have bail, which bail I could have procured if I had been conscious when I was thrust into the prison-van, and taken to gaol"—(<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner took the envelopes and letters produced, and says,</hi> "They are not Mr. Jackson's writing at all, they have been humbugged."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fancy goods dealer, of 166, Piccadilly—I have been a little over four years in the country—before that I lived at Paris, and had some business transactions with the prisoner there—he lives on big income—I know his writing—in February last I received this letter by post, at Piccadilly, in this envelope—it is signed by the prisoner—the signature only is his—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was translated by an interpreter as follows,</hi> "Great thief. Before killing thee I give thee fair warning. Boulevard, Montmartre, Saumade")—that is his address in Paris—on 30th April I received this other letter—the signature only is by the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Transmitted</hi>: "Paris, April 30, 1869. Great thief. If thou wilt not send me some money I will threaten thee")—that letter was brought to me by a gentle<lb/>man—I had not seen the prisoner between the two letters—about 30th September, it was four weeks last Wednesday, I was in my parlour, and he came into the shop—my wife would not let me go out—she went out and spoke to him (I had last seen him in England about a year and ten month ago)—a constable was sent for, and he was given in custody—I cannot say what day that was, but it was about two hours before I went to the Police Court—I only came out of the parlour when the constable was there, after my wife had given the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Business Direc<lb/>tory of London, and carry on business at 4, Moorgate Street Buildings—the prisoner has been in my employ as canvasser, for a little over two years—his wages were originally 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the shilling upon these class of payments—there was a similar commission upon all books and adver<lb/>tisements—the commissions upon advertisements were to be paid in a man<lb/>ner specially laid down, and one of the clauses in the form of application which the prisoner filled up is, "All amounts collected must be paid into the office upon the settlement after collection, and in cases where the canvasser has not brought enough money with him to square up completely, and correct</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250092"/>
               <p>any errors that may have been discovered in previous accounts, he will re<lb/>ceive no work and no pay until he does square up"—the prisoner came into my employ upon that understanding—afterwards I altered his salary to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for lodging-money, and no commission, and if I felt extra satisfied with him and felt inclined to make him a present, I might do so but there was to be no claim beyond, and he was to settle up every week in the same way as before—during that year I made him a present of about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., extra beyond the money that he was entitled to; but taking the whole body of canvassers, I found they had done about half the amount of work, and I thought it advisable to alter the terms again, which I did—I made a third arrange<lb/>ment, viz., that they should receive 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the shilling commission, and on all moneys they collected they were to take the commis<lb/>sion from it, and send me the difference—after that, on the 29th June, I put up, voluntarily, a memorandum, in my office, that the following can<lb/>vassers, on account of their long services, would receive 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. instead of 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—during the present year the prisoner has been receiving 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and a commission of from 16 to 25 per cent.—the moneys are accounted for in the manner set out in this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the numbers here ought to tally with the counterfoil of the receipt-book, consequently, it is impossible to miss a number if you look carefully into the receipt book—it was his duty, specially enjoined upon him, if he had any deductions of any sort or kind to make, to do so when he accounted to me—I made a communication to him in March, in consequence of his being behind hand in a sum of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me as a reason for that, his family difficulties—that the lady he called his wife, and his children were ill—he so worked upon my feeling that I accepted it as a civil debt, and he gave me an I O U for the amount, which from time to time he has paid off a portion of it—he has at times exerted himself rather more than was customary for men to do, and upon those occasions I have sent him, in one case, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he never, until this charge was preferred against him, made any claim against me for 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or of any other kind—he has never told me I owed him that amount for revising sheets—I have not received the sums mentioned in this indictment, viz., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have carefully examined the sheets, referring to the dates on which they were paid—he has never ac<lb/>counted to me for them—during the present year he has paid me large sums of money, but he has never made any counter charge against me—there was a settlement on the 28th July, 4th August, the 7th August, the 14th and 23rd, the 2nd and 10th September.</p>

I am the head constable of the Victoria Docks, in the service of the London and St. Katharine Dock Company—I know the prisoner, he is a ship worker at the E jetty department, in the employ of the London and St. Katharine Dock Company—on 21st September I accompanied Clements to 10, Cheshire Street, Bromley, the prisoner's residence—Clements went into the house, and brought out these four skins, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) value about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took them to my office in the docks, and next day the prisoner came to my office, and said, "I hear you want to see me about some skins"—I said, "Yes; what do you know about them?"—he said, "On Saturday last I went into Clements' office, he showed me some skins, and asked me if I would take them out of the Dock for him; I unfortunately took one of the skins under my coat, and conveyed it out of the Dock into the Marine Hotel; Clements followed me out, and came into the hotel, where I gave him up the skin, and he put it in a bundle with other skins; I afterwards went to the Sir John Franklin public-house, Poplar, and Clements came in while I was there, and offered these skins for sale; he said, 'I will sell them for half-a-crown;' he offered them publicly for sale; I said, 'Do not be pleading poverty here; here is a half-crown, and I will take the skins, and I took the skins from him"—I took the prisoner on the 20th, and he said, "This is a very bad job; Clements has drawn me into it"—I had held out no promise or threat to him—this portion of the skin was found at Clements' house, and this other portion in a cask at the Docks—this exactly corresponds—the Dock Company's regulations are in writing—I have not got them here—no one is supposed to pass out of the Docks with any article, without a pass, which is not given unless it is a proper transaction—the prisoner had no right whatever to take these goods out—he has been many years in the service of the Docks—the skills are the Company's property.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know that he has been fourteen years in the Company's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from my own knowledge—he has always borne a very respectable character—Clements was tried at Alford Police Court, on Saturday last, for stealing these skins, and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment—the prisoner insisted on being tried here—it is a fact that when the matter came to Seaman's knowledge he came to me first and said, "I hear you want to see me about the skins"—I went to his house, but did</p>

I am a baker, of 34, Manor Street, East India Road—five weeks ago last Saturday I was at work in the, docks—I went to the Sir John Franklin, to have a glass of ale—a man named Clements came in, and said that he was rather hard up, for he had spent his money on the previous evening, and he wanted some money to make up for his week's board, and he would sell the parcel which he had got for a half-crown—he had a parcel—the prisoner afterwards said that Clements was not to plead poverty there; but he would lend him a half-crown if he was hard up—Clements asked the prisoner if he would take the parcel home, and let it remain there till he called for it—the parcel was not opened at that time—there were several other persons before the bar—Clements had a little half-and-half, and the prisoner also had something to drink—I did not hear the prisoner say anything about his not wanting the parcel—he said he wanted to make something for his chest.</p>

I am a mechanical engineer, of 4, Lampton Terrace, East Greenwich—on 2nd October, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in Mile Street, Greenwich, and heard cries of "Murder!" and "Oh, my poor father!"—I went to the spot, and saw Williams on his knees, with one hand on the ground and the other on his cheek, just outside his own door—I did not see the prisoner then—I took Williams up in my arms and carried him into the house—he was bleeding from his face, breast, and arm, profusely—I asked for a cloth, they gave me a towel, and I attended him till a doctor came—I afterwards accompanied the police-sergeant to the next house, and saw the prisoner sitting on a sofa—I said, "It is a very bad case, and very bad cuts, I should like to see the knife it was done with"—the prisoner's wife said that what her husband had done he had done with his fist, he had no knife, and it was in his own self-defence—the prisoner said that all he had done was to stand in his own self-defence, and he had no knife—the sergeant told me to go and get a candle—previous to that the prisoner's wife produced two table-knives, and said they were all the knives she had in the house—</p>

               <p>the prisoner was present at that time—I obtained a caudle, and went up stairs with the constable—the prisoner's wife went up first—I went on one side of the bed, and the constable on the other—I held the candle, he took the bed off, and said, "It is pot here, but we turned up the mattrass, which was in two halves, and something dropped on the ground; he then picked up this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had been washed, but there was a little blood on the shoulder—I know it had been washed, because both blade and handle were wet, and there was water on the floor—it was closed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi> 19). On the night of the 2nd October I went to the prosecutor's house—I was directed there by Mitchell, and found Williams attended by a medical man—I went next door with Jones, and knocked, but could not get an answer—there was no light in the house—I put my hand against the door, but could not break it open—I tried a second time and broke it open—there are only two rooms in the house—it being dark I caught hold of the prisoner's wife, not knowing whether it was a man or a woman—Willoughby, who was with me, Went up stairs, and brought the prisoner down—I said, "This is a very serious charge, I must take you in custody for cutting and wounding this man"—he was going to say something, and I said, "This is a very serious charge, I would rather you would not say any thing"—he said, "I have done nothing but in self-defence"—he was, I believe, sober, I saw nothing to the contrary—I asked to see the knives—two common table-knives were shown to me and a third was produced afterwards—the wife said, "This is all we have got"—I obtained a candle, and Jones and the constable went up stairs—the prisoner's, hands bad blood on them, and his right shirt sleeve was saturated with blood—the prisoner's wife was also taken in custody, but discharged by the Magistrate—I went up stairs next morning, Sunday, the 3rd, and found a hand-basin in the bed-room, containing water stained very much with blood.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—on 2nd October I had been out with him to market, about 7 o'clock, we returned about 9—my husband was sober—he had had one pint of beer, when he came home to his supper—he had his supper, and after that went to the door to take his pipe, which I handed to him, when it was knocked out of my hand by the prisoner, who stepped out at his door, and asked Mr. Williams what was his game—Mr. Williams said, "What is yours?" and Clark said, "I will soon show you"—he stabbed Mr. Williams four times before he fell, and then he fell—I went to get the prisoner's hand from his throat, and could feel something in his band; but cannot say what it was, because it was so small—I was trying to get the prisoner's hand from my husband's throat, because, he was bleeding so—Mrs. Mars heard me crying for help, and catched hold of the back of him, and pulled him off, and so soon as he rose he made a strike at me, which numbed my arm—it was with the same hand which I held at my husband's throat—I afterwards examined my arm, and found I was stabbed—I undid my jacket, and found a gash, and my arm was all lying open.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Wellington Street, Rotherhithe, and am a hairdresser—on the afternoon of 19th October, about 1.30, I was in the Deptford Road—the prisoner overtook me, and by his invitation I went into the Windmill public-house—I have known him fifteen years he called for a quartern of rum, which he paid for—about a minute or so after we bad been in the public-house, the prisoner looked out of the window and said, "Who is this coming here?"—I went to the window, and saw that it was Abrahams—I told him to—Abrahams came into the house this spoke first, and said to the prisoner, "Halloa, Joe; you have beaten me to-day, you are here first"—Welsh replied, "You have beaten me this morning; I will have my money"—Abrahams said, "I will pay you, but not what you want"—Abrahams then said, "Well, let the work be judged by Mr. Finlen, Crackwell, or any other competent man you like; I will pay you all they say it is worth"—Welsh said, "When?" Abrahams replied, "Once within a week"—Welsh then said to me, "Mr. Fox, I have done the work for Abrahams, Abrahams has received his money, and he won't pay me mine"—I said, "Whatever differences there may be between you and Mr. Abrahams, you can settle without my interference"—Abrahams then handed me a Police Court summons—I have it here—it is a plaint for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for work done, taken out by Welsh against Abrahams—I knew nothing about the summons—Abrahams handed it to me, and said, "Read it, Mr. Fox, that will explain all"—he knew that I had known Welsh for many years, in fact, I have known them both an equal period, ever since I have been in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe, that is fifteen years—Abrahams said, "Well, I will have a glass of ale; Fox, have you got any money?"—I said, "Yes—he said, "Lend me sixpence"—I did so, and Abrahams called for a pint of ale; be offered a glass to Welsh, he would not accept it—he said, "I would not drink with such a man as you are"—I was reading the summons, and I saw Welsh make a push at Abrahams with his two hands thus (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—it was a push, not a blow—Abrahams did not advance towards him, but he advanced towards Abrahams, and pushed him—Abrahams said, "Joe, keep your hands down; talk as long as you like, but keep your hands down;" and Abrahams put his open hand within about six inches of Welsh's face—I suppose they might have been two feet apart at the time, an arm length, and six or eight inches over—Welsh said, "If you could serve your wife in that way, you cannot stop my tongue"—I said, "Welsh, lot the dead rest, you ought to know better"—Abraham's wife had been dead about three years—Abrahams remained in the same position, with his ale in front of him—I was reading the summons, and I saw Welsh force Abrahams on to a seat, underneath the window on the opposite Me of the bar, at the back of me; he then retreated back from him, about 4ft.—I heard somebody call out, "Look out, Fox, Joe has got a knife"—I don't know who it was said that, someone in front of the bar; that caused me to turn round, and I then saw Welsh almost upon Abrahams, and the knife within about six or eight inches of his belly, and When wrote it into Abrahams' bells, before I could get hold of him scarcely—I pulled him from Abrahams with my right hand, and pulled Abrahams off the seat with my left, and thrust him out at the door, and followed him—I was standing in the door way Abrahams</p>

               <p>outside and Welsh in, and Welsh was making an advance towards me, and I said, "Joe, get away"—he then had the knife open at his hand—it was a white-handled knife, 8 in. or 9 in. long, with a spring back—I did not see the handle then; I saw the blade—I did not observe whether there was any blood upon it—in consequence of what Abrahams said, I took him into the tap-room and examined him—I undid his trowser and found blood on his shirt, at the left side of the belly—I did not notice anything protruding then—I went outside and a policeman was called, and Welsh was taken into custody—I then took Abrahams inside again, and made a further examination, and I then saw the intestines protruding—I put him into a cab, and he was driven, first to the police-station, and then to Guy's Hospital.</p>

Q.</hi> You seem to have been reading the summons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I don't think anybody could have seen much more of the transaction than I did—I saw a push; there was no scuffle—I saw Welsh push Abrahams on to the seat; there was no scuffle on the part of Abrahams—there was no scuffle, I did not see it—I was not with my back exactly to the two men—they were standing, as it might be, at the side of me—I know Phillips—I believe he would tell the truth in the matter—I can't think that anything could have happened which I did not see while I was reading the summons—I was not in the public-house three minutes before Abrahams came in—he was a carpenter and joiner—I had not seen him since the Sunday before this—when I went into the public house with the prisoner, I did not see Abrahams—I should think the public-house is a mile from the Police Courts—the prisoner did not say a word to me about Abrahams before he made his appearance—I can't say that he knew any<lb/>thing about Abrahams being about to come there, he had not mentioned it to me—Abrahams was a man very prone to <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi>, and when he was the worse for liquor he was very irritating and insulting—he did not speak in that style to the prisoner that day—he said "Halloa, Joe, you haw beaten me to day," in a sort of light-hearted manner, not in a <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> way—I can't call it <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi>—I was not reading the summons when Welsh pushed towards Abrahams with his two hands—Phillips was standing at the side of the bar—Welsh touched Abrahams and pushed him back—he pushed towards him, and Abrahams came back with the push he received—Abrahams was not advancing towards him—he was very near him, and he put one hand close up to Welsh's face, so—it was his left hand, I am quite sure of that, and it was open—he put it within 6 in. or 8 in. of his face—it was after that I commenced to read the summons, and it was while I was reading it, that I saw Welsh force Abrahams on to the seat underneath the window—I could see what occurred immediately before that, although I was reading the summons; they were at the side of me, and I could see what was going on; if I am looking fit you I can see my lord at the same time—nothing happened before but what I have repeated—I should imagine a scuffle to be, two men struggling together—I did not see any<lb/>thing of that sort.</p>

               <p>Lister say to Swift, "You talk about my wife," and he struck him in the face, and knocked him down by the strap wheel of the machine—he got up again and Lister knocked him down again across the horse-track—he got up again and Lister knocked him down again by the smoke hole—Swift got up and said, "Have mercy on an old man"—I said to him, "Charley, go home"—he was coming past the filling machine to get out into the arch-way, when Mr. Lister picked him up and threw him into the copper—the copper was about three yards from the filling machine—Swift was going out, and Lister picked him up by the trowsers and threw him into the copper with his face downwards—head formost—the copper was three parts full of water, and about three parts boiling—it was a fifty-five gallon copper—as he was thrown in, his legs were sticking out—I was about two yards away from him at the time—I did not interfere to save the man, it was done momentarily—my brother was there, and Mr. Lister's brother, I believe—I did not see the traveller there, I believe he ran away—I gave information to the police—previous to doing so I assisted the prisoner in picking Swift out of the copper—I said to him "You have done something, now help me to pick him out," and he did so—he caught hold of him on one side, and I the other—I went for a doctor first—I brought a policeman, and somebody said that Swift had fallen in—Swift said, "I was picked up bodily and thrown in"—the prisoner made no reply to that—I was not related to Swift.</p>

He was very dull about the, eyes, and appeared to be hardly sober then. He went to his work till breakfast time, when he asked for money. I refused him, as I told him he was half drunk then. He pulled down his sleeves, and went backwards, and said he would do no more work till he got some money. I went to market, and left him there. When I came back, he came rolling across the place very drunk, and I begged him to go away and come again the next morning, when he was sober. He threw down his hat, and said he was an Irish Cockney, and he must fight it out with me He had a potatoes and some ribbons hinging to his hat, and he came up to me with his fists up, and said ho would have it out there. I pushed him away, and pushed him down twice, and told him to go away, but he would not I caught hold of him, and said, "Now you shall go." I caught him round the waist. When he got to the side of the copper, he caught his foot, either against the copper or the bench, and acci<lb/>dently went into the copper. He was no sooner in than I pulled him out, not knowing whether there was any water in it, or whether it was hot or not His shirt was taken off, and some oil and floor put on him, and after that he said again he was an Irish Cockney, and would have it out. I told him to go to the hospital, and by that time the doctor and the police came."</p>

               <p>he left it to me to select the patterns"—he selected sixty-eight pieces of paper—he said, "Never mind the invoice, send it with the goods, and the money will be paid"—the address he gave me was 98, Kennington Road—I sent them on the Monday following, by Michael Meyers, and gave him instructions not to leave them without the money—Meyers brought the goods back, and not the money—in consequence of what he told me I sent him again, next day, with them—he came back then without the goods, and without to money—he brought this card with him—in consequence of what I read upon that card, I went to Grimscote Street, Bermondsey, and made inquiries for a Mr. J. Perry, but could find no such person there on the following day, Wednesday, I went to 98, Kennington Park Road, and saw Green—I asked him why he took the goods away from the boy—he said, "The money is all right"—I said, "As a man of business, you ought to know better; he told you he was not to leave the goods without the money"—he said I should have the money by 4 o'clock, when he would see Mr. Perry—I left him—he called on me the same evening—he said Mr. Perry had not been to the place, and I should have the money early in the morning—he did not come again—I went to 98, Kennington Park Road again, and saw Perry—I asked him who took the goods in, and he said he did—I said I thought it was Green, and he said, "No, I did"—I told him I had called about the money, and he said he would see Mr. Perry about it—I asked Mr. Perry's address; but he said he could not give it me—I asked for his address, and he said, "You will always find me here, I am employed by Mr. Perry"—I asked him his name, and after some time he said his name was Smith—I asked him who the man was who had ordered the goods; at first he said he was a stranger to him, and then, before I left, he said his name was Green—he did not know where he lived, or any<lb/>thing about him—I said, "Possibly Mr. Perry is a myth, and there is no such person"—he said, "Oh, yes there is, I get my money from him, and see him every night"—it was quite contrary to my orders that the goods were parted with without the money—I went to 7, Lambeth Walk, a week or so after, and saw some of my goods there—there were ten pieces of paper—part of the quantity I had sent by Meyers to 98, Kennington Park Boad—about 100 yards altogether—the sixty-eight pieces, altogether, would be about 700 yards.</p>

"You are picking my pocket," and struck him, but not to mark him"—he cried out "Oh! and Buras, who was there, struck me a violent blow on the nose—I put my coat to and escaped out at the door, and Burns gave me another blow in the same place—I then got outside, and they both came out and seized me and knocked me about, and I called out—I was smothered with blood—it was dart, and I could not see—I went to the bar, and the people there wiped the blood from my face, end then I missed my watch and chain, which I had handled a minute before I went in for my coat, and I believe I looked at the time—I also missed a pocket-book, a pipe, and some tobacco—not a thing was left in my pockets—the waiter came up to me when I cried out, and as soon as the prisoners saw him they escaped up the yard—I am sure these are the men—I had had no drink to hurt; no more than usual; three or four glasses—one man struck me in the place, but I do not know how many struck me outside—I only saw the prisoner in the place, bat there may have been another man—I went there between 6 and 7 o'clock, but only sat down and watched—they all seemed very respectable.</p>

Q.</hi> Where had you been to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only had a walk—I was watching these people play from 6 or 7 o'clock to between 11 and 12 o'clock—I do not know that I had more than three glasses of ale, and no spirits—I did play at skittles—there were a dozen persons in the skittle</p>

               <p>ground at one time or another, but <hi rend="italic">only</hi> these to when I went in for my coat—the others had gone when I returned from washing my hands—I looked at my watch after I had washed my hands—I passed nobody else.—Billington remained in the skittle-alley after I told him he was picking my pocket—I was blind, and cannot say whether he came up to mo again—the prisoners were the only two who I saw follow me out; if there were any others they must have been concealed—I did not see either of them touch my waistcoat—my watch was in my waistcoat pocket—it was dark, and I do not know which of them took my watch—Burns came into the skittte. ground a little before this happened—he was there when I went in for my coat—there arc two skittle-alleys, but I did not know of the other one—the prisoners were both where my coat was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the skittle-ground open to the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They can go in from the road, or from the bar—I played at skittles for half an hour, and my coat was hanging up the whole time I was playing—I swear that nobody struck me but the two prisoners—they took the watch and chain outside—I put my coat on before I struck Billington, and then found that I had nothing in my pockets, but my watch was in my waistcoat—when I found I had lost everything, I struck Billington—I did not call the waiter then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LINGFOBD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In order to reach the skittle-alley, have you to go up a garden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there is a back door at the top of the garden, leading to the bar—I only saw the two prisoners about me after I was struck. <hi rend="italic">Billington.</hi> My coat was hanging by the side of yours, and when I put it on you came and laid hold of me, and said, "I accuse you of putting your hand in my pocket" I said if you think so, search me," and you tore the sleeve out of my coat, and struck me on the nose, and nearly knocked me senseless. I had my hat knocked off, and somebody, I believe it was Charles, the waiter, said, "Whose hat is this?" I said, "It is mine." He said, "Where is that gentleman's hat?—I said, "I don't know, I be<lb/>lieve I threw it somewhere." Anybody can go into this ground. It began to rain, and I went home to bed. I went into the City so see for employ<lb/>ment, and pasted the police-station two or three times, and the policeman took me in charge. You were washing yourself against the kitchen door, where there were half-a-dozen round you. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, that was after I had lost my watch, I was washing the blood off.</p>

                  </hi>, I am waiter at the White Bear—the skittle ground is about thirty yards from the road—on Saturday night, 11th September, between 4 and 8 o'clock, Mr. Roberts came in and played at skittles occasionally till 11.30—Burns came in about 10.45—I had never seen him before—about 11.30 or 11.40 I heard cries for help, and a dog barking, and I saw the prisoner and Billington engaged in a scuffle, and as I came out Burns ran down the path—after that I picked up a hat—Burns then came back, up the yard, and passed through the bar—he pushed his way through everybody, and Mr. Roberts happened to stand first—that was while Roberts was having the blood washed off his fuel—I gave bock the hat to Billington, and Billington picked up Mr. Roberts' hat, which was a sort of alpaca one—nobody was running away—I called the potman, and told him to stop that man (<hi rend="italic">Billington</hi>) as he had got Mr. Roberts' hat—he had his own hat then, he had pitched it behind, in the water-butt—I have known Billington three years—I thought he was going to steal the hat, because he had his own at the same time, and therefore he knew it was not his—Roberts appeared sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose there were several people in the skittle-ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know, I think not—I was called by Roberta' ones; but did not go into the skittle-ground, only to the door—it was dark, 11.30—this was in the pathway leading to the back premises—I saw no one with Roberts but Billington; but Burns was just leaving him—he went towards the back premises—I saw his face, he passed close to me, and ran away from me, from the back door towards the back premises—he came back after—that was when he scuffled up against Roberts, when I heard the cry, and saw Roberts and Billington and a man running away—that man's back was towards me—about the time that Roberts went into the public-house, to wash his face, Burns passed—I feed sure that Roberts was not the worse for drink; if he was, it was not perceptitle—I said before the Magistrate that if he was the worse for drink it was slight—he had beer during the six hours he was at our house; but there were several others to drink it—I did not serve him—I only judge from His manner, when he had the blow.</p>
