I am a solicitor, carrying on business at 19, Coleman-street, City—I know the defendant—he called at my office about the middle of January last in reference to an action that had been brought against him by my firm—on that occasion he told me he had established in London a horse register which promised to be very successful, and from that he hoped to have money to pay the debt for which we had sued him—he said he would send me some of the registers to look at—he then left—he sent me three copies of his registers—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he called on me again a few days after that—these registers were lying on my table by my side—I told him that I had received them, and it happened that a friend of mine had just come to town who was in immediate want of a pair of carriage horses—he asked me to give him the particulars of the kind of horses that he wanted, which I did—he made a note of it in a memorandum book, and said he thought he might be able to assist me—I don't think he said anything further at that time—I received a letter from him a day or two afterwards, dated 22d January—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I forwarded that letter to Mr. Hackblock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, York-place, Portman-square, at present; I reside near Reigate—I received this letter, dated 22d January, from Mr. Cox—I did not receive it till the Thursday night—the appointment was made for Wednesday—that was too late for me to see the horses—I read the letter, and sent to make another appointment—I afterwards got an order to see the horses—the letter came by post—I went with that letter on the 28th, to Knightsbridge, to the Swan-yard—I had the piece of paper with me, which I showed at the stables, and I was shown a pair of carriage horses—I thought at the time that the man who showed me the horses was Smith, the proprietor, but it turned out afterwards to be the witness Smart—I thought they were horses that would suit me—when I left Knightsbridge I went to 22, Parliament-street, the address on the letter, to see the prisoner—he was not there—his clerk gave me, on the back of an envelope, his address at Warrington stables, Edge ware-road—I went there and saw the prisoner—that was the first time I had seen him—I inquired for him—he told me his name was Hunt—I said I had been to see a pair of horses at Knightsbridge—he immediately said, "Oh! Mr. Hackblock, I suppose?"—he asked me what I thought of the horses—I said I thought them likely to suit me, but I asked him if he could not get them for something less than 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said not a shilling; he had done his utmost, and he could not get them for anything less, and he then said, "By heavens! if they were my horses, I would not take 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—I rather hesitated, and he praised them very much, and spoke about his mode of doing business—he said he was entirely in the commission way, that he never bought or sold horses on his own account, and he said that he had bought and sold horses to the value of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within the last month—I then said if he could not get them under 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would give it, provided they would pass Mr. Field's examination satisfactorily—he then pressed me very much to forego the examination, and to take Smith's warranty—he called him the proprietor—I said I did not know what Smith's warranty might be worth; he was a stranger to me, and I should prefer Field's examination—he said, "Oh, he is a man of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if you take his warranty you will be able to return them if any thing turns out wrong, but if you take Field's examination it must be final"—I then said I would consider it, and let him know in the morning—that evening I took the advice of Mr. Cox, my friend, and he advised me to have Mr. Field's examination, and I wrote a note, which I sent the next morning—my coachman had the order to see the horses—I can't say whether I saw it or not—this is the note I sent to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated 29th January—I sent it on the morning of the 29th by post, I believe, and in consequence of that note the horses were sent to Mr. Field—I did not put it in the post—I saw it produced before the magistrate by the prisoner's counsel—I had no copy of it—I got a certificate from Mr. Field—on the afternoon of the 29th the prisoner called at my house in York-place to know the result—I had at that time received the certificate—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner read it partly through, and said, "Oh, that is sufficient for me l"—(<hi rend="italic">This was a certificate signed William Field, stating that he had examined two bay geldings, and was not aware of any unsoundness about them</hi>)—when the prisoner read the first part of it which said there was no unsoundness, he said, "That is sufficient; of course you will take them"—I said, "Well, I think I will," and I gave him the money—something was said about a mare—I asked him whether Smith would feel disposed to take a mare I had, what he would give me for it, whether he would take the mare for the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a</p>

               <p>100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could not tell—he went with me and saw the mare, and he then went off to Smith's, at Knightsbridge—he came back and said Smith would take the mare at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would give 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the mare for the horses—I refused—I said I considered the mare worth a great deal more money, and I would sooner give him the 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and keep the mare—I then paid him the money—I gave him 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes—this is the receipt that he gave me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he wrote it in my presence—I gave him a pen to write it with—I gave him 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">receipt read</hi>)"Received from John Hackblock Esq., 34, York-place, the sum of 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission on a pair of carriage horses, passed by Mr. Field, V.S.—V.

I am not doing anything at present—I was acting as clerk to Captain Hunt on 11th February—both these letters produced are in my handwriting—I really cannot say by whose direction I wrote them—I copied a letter of Captain Hunt's in his handwriting—I fancy Captain Hunt gave me that letter to copy, but I cannot swear to it—I wrote both the letters by Captain Hunt's direction—the first one I wrote from a copy of Captain Hunt's—I cannot remember who gave it me to copy; Captain Hunt was in the office at the time—I merely received the letter to copy, and I copied it—I don't know whether I received it from Captain Hunt, or either of his partners—I don't know what was done with the letters I copied—I returned them back into the office, and laid them on the table—I did not return them to anybody in particular—Captain Hunt Had three partners, Mr. Henry Eicke, called Captain Eicke, and Mr. Farquharson; he is not called Logan—I have told you three or four times, that I do not remember who gave me the letter to copy—this is one of our office headings—I do not know who posted it—I merely had the copying of the letters—I have copied letters written by the partners, and I have also written letters on my own account in answer to business letters—this other letter is dated February 11th—that is in my handwriting—that was done from a copy of Captain Hunt's—I do not remember who gave me the letter, or to whom I gave it; I took it into the office in the usual way—that is written on plain paper—it was the practice in the office to give out letters to me to be copied—that was frequently done by one of the partners, not always; sometimes the principals wrote letters themselves, and posted them—I do not think I spoke to Captain Hunt at all about this transaction at the time—I have spoken to him of it since, but I don't believe I saw him in the transaction—I never mentioned the transaction to him at the time I copied the letters—I have done so since—I did not say anything about the letters—I said nothing about having copied them—am I obliged to say what I did say to him?</p>

I asked him what he was going to do with it; he told me to mind my own business, and told me not to say anything about it, as he had bought it at half-price. I met him again in the evening and he brought the barrel with him; he said he would give me two or three shillings to sell it. I asked him if it was his own; he said "Yes," and if I said anything about it he would put a knife into me. Mr. Shea bought the first, and the last one I took he</p>

On Saturday, 12th March, about twenty minutes past 6, I was on duty in Wellington-street, Strand, and saw the prisoner there, with a bundle at his back—I followed him into White-Hart-street, and asked what he had there—he said, "Some desks"—I asked where he got them from—he said he picked them up in the Strand—I then took him into custody—I looked in one of the desks and found an envelope there, directed to 14, Craven-street—I went down there and found the property had been stolen from there—I saw Mrs. Gresham, and took her to the police-station, where she identified the property—the prisoner was present.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Craven-street, Strand, at the time of the robbery, with my mother, who occupied the drawing-room floor—on the night of 12th March, I heard a noise—I got up and went into the drawing-room—I saw that the table-cover was gone from the table, and a box, and two writing-desks, and three pairs of boots were also gone—I then aroused the inmates of the house—as soon as I had done that, I heard the hall-door shut down stairs—it had struck a quarter-past 6 by the Westminster clock about three minutes after the man had left the house—I went down to the door, and soon after the policeman came to the house—he gave me informa<lb/>tion, and I went to the station and saw the property there—the prisoner was there at the time—this desk is my property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were also two pairs of the boots belonging to me, which were returned by order of the magistrate—all this property belongs to me or my sister, Kathleen—the clock had struck 6 just before I heard the noise—the noise was the door creaking on the hinge—that was the first sound I heard—it was about five minutes past 6 then—I did not see how the man had come in—he must have entered with a skeleton-key; there was no breakage, the door was left on the latch—the first noise I heard was the creaking of the drawing-room door.</p>

She said, "I think this is a bad half-crown." I said, "I don't think it is." She took up another one from somewhere, I don't know where, and said, "You have given me another before to-day; I will give you in charge of the police." I said I was not aware that I had done anything wrong, but if I had I would rectify it I do not get my living by passing bad money; if I did I should go further from home.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 5, Elder-street, Finsbury, and am coachman to Mr. Norbury—I was walking up Bishopsgate-street on 11th March, about 9 o'clock, or a quarter past—I saw a van with a pair of horses abreast coming down Liverpool-street from Bishopsgate-street, at full rate; I should judge ten or eleven miles an hour—the prisoner was on the box driving—I saw the watchman standing on the off side, doing something to the lantern, I do not know what—the pole of the van ran against the bar that goes across the street; of course it was the coachman's fault, there was plenty of room for him to have turned round and gone into Broad-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger at 162, Drury-lane—about a quarter-past 1 on the morning of 17th March I was going home through Long-acre—I was at the corner, at the Queen-street end, and I went into a cigar shop—just before going in I saw the prisoners and two others outside the door—I bought a cigar, paid three halfpence for it with a shilling, and put the change, 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, and the cigar in my mouth—as I came out of the shop I heard one of them, I cannot tell which, say, "Put it on him," and Williams put his arm round my neck, and lifted me up on his belly—I felt the violence at my throat choking me—he said, "Kick him in the guts"—then he and three others threw me on my. back, and Webb put his hand in my right pocket, and tore my trousers from top to bottom—that was in the struggle—I struggled with them—I did not cry "Police;" my wife did—she was not with me at the time, but being opposite the house where I live, she heard my voice, and came out, hearing a disturbance—nothing further happened to me—as soon as I got released I cried "Police," and when the police came they wished to make off, but I detained Williams—I was bruised from head to foot—I could not tell who kicked me; I received so many—I held Williams, but was obliged to let him go—that was after the kicks—he was so violent, I could hold him no longer—I did not know either of the men before; they were perfect strangers to me—after I was kicked they made off—Williams made off after I let him go—I lost my cap and handkerchief—I could not swear they took them—I do not know that they robbed me of anything.</p>

               <p>behind them when they were stopped—I pursued—I saw the other two ran down Wild-street, and these two kept on in Queen-street—I chased them—there were some women there—they were not running likewise—there were not two women running, and calling "Police," to my knowledge—there were some women there, not calling out "Police"—I heard "Police" being cried the whole time I was on my back, but I do not know whether it was by women or men—when Webb was stopped, I said to the constable, "Bring him with you"—I charged him with being one of the men who had assaulted me—he said in reply, "I had nothing at all do with it"—I have since made inquiries as to Webb—I believe him to be under control by Williams—I believe him to be of very respectable parents, and has borne in good character up to the time he was taken in custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence</hi>. I had nothing whatever to do with the letter. There is a desk between the Temple walk and the Paternoster-row walk, and two rows of men, and there are two walks nearer to the pigeon-holes than the Temple walk, so that I had no means of getting at it in that way. It might have been mis-sorted to any one of the 150 men in the office. I found the nine 501. notes. Having occasion to go into the City on Monday, 28th January, for some money that was owing to me the previous week, and passing through Lothbury, I found the bundle of notes. I put them in my pocket and kept them till 25th March; then I did try to purchase a watch and chain with one, I must own. The others I gave to Mr. Russell, except the one I gave to the landlady at 29, Euston-square. The gentleman says that he gave a description of the person presenting the cheque; it varied very much from me. He said it was a person twenty-five years old, I am twenty-two; of sallow complexion, mine is fair; with blotches, I have not got any; 5 feet 8 inches, I am 5 feet 10 inches; brown hair, that would do certainly, but then anybody can perceive that I have curls, which would have been put down if they had been perceived. I know nothing whatever about the cheque or the notes presented at the Bank of England. I read the account in the paper, and it stated they were presented by a man of fashionable appearance. The gentleman from Glyn's says it was the personal appearance of the man that made him suspect. I know nothing about the letter stolen, the cheque, or the notes presented at the Bank. The only thing I know about is the nine notes; those I found and have given up, and I am very sorry that I did find them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 129). On Friday, 22d March, I went with two constables to the prisoner's shop—he was standing at the front door—we requested him to come into the back parlour with us, and I said, "Mr. Cohen, I have come to speak to you respecting a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that you gave to Mr. George, or one of his men, the landlord of the Blue Peter; but, before we go any further, you need not say anything to the questions I ask unless you like, for it is most likely I shall use it against you as evidence, for it is most likely you will be charged for this thing; did you pass a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Mr. George, or one of his men, on last Saturday week, the 9th of the month?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "And that note has been returned to you?"—he said, "Yes j it has"—I asked him where it was—he said that he had destroyed it—I said, "What did you do that for?"—he said because he did not like to have a note, with "Forgery" marked on it in his possession—I said, "Did you change a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the same day at Mr. Skipper's?"—he paid, "Yes"—I said, "Did you also change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at Mr. Jones's on the same day?"—he said, "Yes, I did; oh, Mr. Dunnaway, I have been drawn into this: I am as innocent' as a new-born babe: the notes were brought round to me by Mr. Moss, who keeps a coffee-shop in Church-lane, with some men, for some money and clothes, and the men ran away"—(I was examined before the magistrate as to this conversation before Moss was put into the box)—I said, "Mr. Cohen, have you got any more of those forged notes about you in the house?"—he said, "No; I have not"—I said, "If you have, give them up, because I shall search you, and also search your house before I take you"—I then saw him fumbling about in his right-hand waistcoat pocket, from which he took out a piece of waste paper—I said, "What have you got there?"—he opened the paper and gave me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), saying that that was another of the notes—I said, "Have you any more?"—he called out to his wife, "Bring them other notes down there"—she brought a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and gave them to me in the prisoner's presence—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Well, Cohen, what, about these?"—he said, "They were brought to me by my next door neigh<lb/>bour, a man who keeps a fish-shop two doors off, of the name of Warwick, last Saturday night; I saw they were bad, and I called my man to hold the men, and he let them run away; I have kept the notes, thinking to catch the thieves"—I said, "Have you given any information to the police of this affair, or given any description of the men?"—he said, "No"—I said, "That would have been your most proper course to have taken; you must con<lb/>sider yourself in custody, and go with me to the station."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Nelson-terrace, Stoke Newington—I was called to the house of the last witness on 18th January, about half-past 10 in the morning—I found the prisoner there in bed—she was flooding frightfully; the after-birth had not been removed—I first attended to her, and was then shown the child's body in a pie-dish in the box—it was dead—it was a full-grown child—I found a scar on the forehead, an abrasion of the skin—it was a recent one—it was a tearing of the skin, about the size of a shilling, as if it had been rubbed against something, or as if it had fallen on the ground—I discovered that the throat was cut—it was a superficial cut on the left side, and deep on the right side, cutting even into the bone—it cut through the windpipe and gullet—those were the only marks I saw—next day I made a post-mortem examination with the assistance of Dr. Horner—the lungs were fully inflated—I should say the child was born alive—I judged sp from the lungs being inflated—I found no blood in the body; it was perfectly bloodless—the umbilical cord or navel string had not been tied—I should imagine the child had been born a few hours; the after-birth was still attached to the woman—the umbilical cord not being tied, there would be hemorrhage from that, from the child—supposing the umbilical cord to continue untied for some little time, the flow of blood would be quite sufficient to cause the child's death—the throat being cut might also have caused death—it would be quite sufficient to account for death—I cannot say from which of those two causes death ensued.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother—I reside at 33, Wells-street, Mile-end New-town—about the middle of March last, I went into one of my bed-rooms and saw some blood on the floor—I spoke to my daughter about it—she did not say anything about it—I afterwards saw under my table a pail with some clothes in it, stained with blood—I spoke to my daughter about it—she said, "Mother, I will wash them"—on 19th March, I went upstairs with my sister to one of the bed-rooms to look for a cape, and put my fingers on the body of a child in a box—I sent for Dr. Champney—he did not come, and I sent for Dr. Edmunds—I then spoke to my daughter, and said, "Emma, what does this mean?—she said, "Don't ask me, mother"—my daughter is nineteen years old on 5th November next.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a book called the ren<lb/>tal book which the Company kept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were four rent-books—the aver<lb/>age amount that he had to receive was, I should think, about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I cannot say that it did not amount to more—there was a book be<lb/>tween the prisoner and the Company, in which he was debited with the whole of these rents in bulk—he kept the little books himself; they are here—they form part of the system—they were not his private property—he was not debited with all the rents of the Company—I believe there was also a ledger in which each individual is debited by name—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the rent books, with the names of the tenants according to the district—I have seen no book between the Company and the prisoner in which he is debited with all the rentals as a private individual, in which he wrote off from time to time from the rate-book by order of the Company those that were not received—I know what you mean, and I have not seen such a book—it does not follow that I should see it in the course of business—it ought to be laid before the Directors if there was such a book in existence, and the auditors would see it if they called for it—if there was such a book the accountant would know—I cannot be supposed to know one half of the books that are kept—a balance-sheet was drawn up each half-quarter—the prisoner was not debited as an individual with the arrears—there must be more books, which I have not seen or heard of—if the prisoner constantly paid rates out of the money of the Company, he had no right to do so—I never heard a single instance of his having paid claims made on the Company for rates and taxes, out of the monies received by him on account of rents—I am always present at the Board of Directors—it is part of my duty—I have no recollection of being present when the prisoner's accounts have been discussed; and when receipts have been produced in his behalf for rates, they have been allowed him by the Company—I have no recollection of any amount of payments made by the prisoner out of money received for the Company, or of the amounts being connected and initialed by the Directors, and it could not be done without a minute—I have never known a single instance of its being done—this first entry, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., may be-allowance for water rate, but I do not read it so—the column is headed "Arrears due, Christmas, 1859, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is a blank space, and in that is "Allowance for water rate"—the construction I put upon that is, that when the person who is debited, pays the arrears a certain allowance has to be made for the water rate—I can only take the thing as it stands—every column is headed except the last, which is for memoranda.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the column, "Allowance for sewers' rate," are you aware that that is a landlord's tax? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume that the landlord would deduct it if the tenant produced his receipts—the first memorandum here is "John Bentley, occupier of 3, Bishopsgate-yard"—in the first place here is put the annual rent, and as the rents fall due at the different quarters he is debited with every quarter, and any cash which may be paid he appears to have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186104080056"/>
               <p>credit for; in this blank column the entry is from 25th March, 1860; my construction is that John Bentley took possession on 25th March, 1860, although the book began at Christmas, 1859—I presume, therefore, that there was a tenant prior to the property coming into his possession—here is "Allowance for sewers' rate, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that I understand to mean that when the rents are paid by the tenant if he produces his receipt for the sewers' rate it would be allowed—I never heard of the prisoner having paid rates out of the monies he received for the Company—I do not know whether he has or has not paid insurances out of the monies he received from the Company—I do not know whether the cashier would know better than I—if the prisoner paid insurances in that way, he had no right to do it—I cannot say, without referring to the book, whether the amount insured is 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not his duty to pay compensation at times for accidents that happened on the line—I believe it is very likely that he has on one or two occasions settled claims which have been made against the Company for accidents to cattle, or some other claims which occurred in the country; but in those cases he has not been authorised to pay it out of the monies received—the money has been given to him for the purpose—I know of no such in<lb/>stance authorised or unauthorised—he used not to pay money to the accountant, but to the cashier—he paid to nobody else—before the appoint<lb/>ment of a cashier there was a treasurer, which was tantamount to the' same office—he used to pay monies to the treasurer, and when the treasurer's office was dispensed with, the cashier's office became tantamount to the same thing—he did not pay money to the accountant, or to the accountant's department, to my knowledge—this "Received by permanent way" means that he has debited himself with a rental which he was not justified in doing, belonging to another department—all these items of rent in these books are debited to him—I do not know whether there are other entries, I have not examined the books to see—these are the books from which he collected the rents—he, or a clerk in his office prepares the forms—he must release himself from his debits, either by cash which he pays, or by showing that some other department has received the money—I do not know what this "Account department" means; it is a memorandum—this 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not go to the account department—I cannot tell you the meaning of an entry which I have not made myself—I do not see how the account could explain it—I should think the party who made the entry would be the best party to explain it—I do not know who made it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner, in the course of business, write under the column head-" Cash" the cash he had received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not in his writing—I do not know whose writing it is in—it was his clerk's duty to keep that book—it would be written in the land agent's office of which he was head—it appears to be after Midsummer, 1857—the cash-book is kept by him with the excep<lb/>tion of one or two entries—there is no entry in the cash-book of this 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If such a memorandum as that was there, would that exclude it from his cash-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: in this very instance he debits himself with having received this money—here are two other items on this page, of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no mark of date—the persons who keep these books are the Company's servants—I cannot say that I know what this charge to the account department means—I should say that the account department has not received the money, because the accountant is not an authorized person to receive the money—I cannot undertake to say that the accountant did not receive it, whether he was authorised to do so or not; but it is no part of the accountant's duty to receive money—Mr. Wadely is the accountant—he has been so many years—he was accountant at the time we are speaking of.</p>

I wag with the last witness on 7th February—after Blackmore had been taken in custody, and when he was with me, he made a statement to me—we were walking along to Bethnal-green to get a cab—Mr. Foulger and the two Mr. Myers' were in front; we were talking about the silk, and Blackmore said that Mr. Myers knew it was wrong as well as he did—he said, "Did he tell you how much he gave me a pound for it?"—I said, "Yes, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "That's right"—he said, "How much is it worth?"—I said, "From 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a pound"—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "From a man in the Lane, as Myers would not buy it, only through another person"—on 9th February, I went to Herbert-street, Cambridge-road, Hackney, and there saw a person named Freaks—I had some conversation with Freaks, took him into custody, and took him to the prosecutor's premises in Newgate-street, in company with Foulger—Haddon was brought into the private office by Foulger, in the presence of Freaks, myself and another gentleman—Black-more was in custody, but was not there—as soon as Foulger came into the office with Haddon, he said to Freaks, "Is this the man who brought out the silk to you?"—he said, "Yes"—Foulger said, "Are you certain?"—he said, "I am certain"—Haddon said, "Silk! me! I know nothing at all about any silk"—we then took him into custody—I took Freaks to the station-house, and then we went to Haddon's lodgings with him, at 20, King-street, Clerkenwell—we searched the room, and found a bundle of things which were not identified—when we were about leaving the place, Haddon asked for one of us to go out first—he said it might be noticed by the neighbours, all three of us going out together—Foulger went out first with the bundle—Haddon then turned to his wife who was sitting in the chair, and was about to whisper to her—I said I could not allow that; what he said, I must hear—she said, "What is the meaning of all this, George?"—he said, "Say nothing, and know nothing"—I then took him to the station, where he was searched—nothing was found on him relative to this charge—he was then charged—on the second examination of Blackmore I went down into the cell, and he called me to him—he said, "I received the silk from Freaks, but I did not like to say anything about it, because he was my father-in-law"—I got this blue bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from 16, Luke-street, the residence of Freaks, who occupied a cellar there—he had got a few bundles of twigs or osiers there, to make baskets of; he seemed in a very poor state.</p>

I reside at Willow-walk, Bermondsey, and am a ware houseman in the prosecutors' employ—Haddon was in their service as packer—he had been in their employment between five and six years—as packer, he had to attend to the packing-room—he had, among other things, to sweep out the silk department—he commenced sweeping about twenty minutes past 8 in the morning—he would ordinarily finish about twenty-five minutes to 9—in that silk-room there was a large quantity of silk in drawers, which were unlocked—nobody would be in that room at that time—during that time he would have access to those drawers in which the silk was—the silk kept in that room is similar, in every respect, to that which I saw at the police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the collectors and meat inspectors appointed by the Commissioners of Sewers, for Newgate-market—I have performed those duties for twelve years and upwards—on 16th February, my attention was called by Mr. Greatrex to four quarters of cow beef, which were lying at his place—they were in a hamper when I saw them—on exposing the meat, and examining it, I found it to be in a very bad state—the flesh was quite wet, which is always a sure indication that the animal was diseased—what ought to be fat was a serum, not fat at all, watery—the meat was totally unfit for human food—that was obvious to me immediately upon looking at it—there is no doubt that it was diseased and unfit for human</p>

               <p>food when it came by its death—it was in no worse condition, in my opinion when it arrived in London, than when it was sent from the country.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it have been unwholesome food when it was fresh killed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far is Hitchin from London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About thirty-four miles—I took the meat before one of the Aldermen of the City, and he ordered it to be condemned and destroyed—I went down to Hitchin to make inquiries about this matter—I called upon the defendant, and saw him—he is a fishmonger, I believe, living in Hitchin—I saw him in the street—I told him that I had come respecting some meat that had been sent up to Newgate-market in his name—he said that he had sent four quarters of beef, but he was employed by Mr. Peck; that the meat did not belong to himself—that was the substance of the conversation—in the course of it, he said that it was not bad—I said that I had seized it, and that it was very bad—he said he was very sorry that he had sent it in his name, and he hoped nothing would come of it—he said, "I shall not get anything by it; I have merely sent it for Mr. Peck"—he did not say anything as to who had packed it up, or dressed it, or killed it—it was cow beef—he did not tell me who slaughtered it—I made a written memorandum of the substance of the conversation—it might have been the next day that I made it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing—he did say that he had killed and dressed the cow for Mr. Peck, and sent it up for him—I had forgotten that—I did not weigh the meat in the market in London—it was so very bad that the men objected to weigh it—we did not take it all out of the hamper—it weighed about 3 1/2 cwt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it possible that any person could have killed and dressed that meat without observing that it was in a diseased and unfit state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were the appearances which, to an unpractised eye, it would exhibit of not being fit for food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The flesh was wet and flabby, and very different to the flesh of good meat, and the fat had turned to serum—the difference between fat and serum is that one is solid and the other a fluid—it was in a fluid state when it was exhibited for sale—the fat of a diseased animal would be so—if you took up this animal, the fat would flow from it like water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the meat inspectors of Newgate-market—I saw the four quarters of cow beef, about which Mr. Fisher has now been giving his evidence—it has been my duty about seven years altogether to inspect meat—I think this was the worst I ever saw—it was very bad, and decidedly unfit for human food—in my judgment, that must have been apparent to the person who slaughtered and dressed it—no one who was any judge at all, could have dressed it without seeing that—it appeared to have been slaughtered and dressed by a person accustomed to do such work—it was cut up properly, as if done by a butcher—it had the appearance of having been dressed by a person accustomed to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are quite sure that it was cut up as a butcher would cut it up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—any man that had common sense would know the difference between that and good meat—I believe a man that was a fish-monger and not a butcher could, by just looking at it, have seen that it was unfit for human food—I do not know whether meat is generally sent in cloths—sometimes I dare say it is, and sometimes not—there was no cloth on these when they came up—they come in quarters or sides, not in whole carcases—these were not in cloths—I saw them in the hamper—they had not been unpacked.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man who was a fishmonger and not a butcher had dressed this meat, what were the signs that it would bear which would indicate to him that the meat was unfit for human food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he opened the animal, he would find the whole of the tissues a mass of water, and the meat would present a different colour from the ordinary colour—the lungs, I have no doubt, were double the usual size—I formed an opinion of what disease the animal died; it was pleura pneumonia—it was suffering from lung disease very severely—it would present those indications to the person who dressed it—the lungs would be formed of a hard callous matter, instead of the usual spongy appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to a man who did not dress it, what indications would it present to him, if he was not a butcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The colour of the meat any unpractised eye would see in a minute—a man I mean, not a butcher—it would principally be the colour of it, and the appearance of the fat—it was more the colour of mahogany than good beef—the fat was merely a thin skin of fat, hanging where the fat ought to be—we did not pull it about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there an invoice in the hamper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not—it was addressed to Larner and Greatrex—that is printed on the label—I was in partnership with Mr. Larner—we are large salesmen—it makes a good deal of difference in meat whether it is packed immediately after it is dressed—it generally arrives in very bad order if it is packed hot—I did not examine it sufficiently to see whether it was slaughtered by a butcher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might it on being dressed and given to a man merely to pack up, that man being merely a fishmonger, have passed his eye as being common meat to send up to market? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Really I cannot tell that—I cannot tell whether it might not have appeared fit for human food to a man not a butcher merely putting it into the hamper; I mean a man who did not examine it—I have seen meat that was packed pretty good, look much the worse for the journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that apply to diseased meat as well as to Bound meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it would not make that difference—it would make some difference—if diseased meat was packed immediately after the animal was killed, its bad condition would be increased by that—it would not look so well as if it was packed cold, even though it was diseased.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having reference to the state in which you saw this meat, in your judgment must it have appeared to have been diseased and unfit for food when it was packed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot tell, for I did not pay that attention to it—I saw it was in a very bad state and called in the inspectors—I cannot say how it looked when it was slaughtered—if it had been slaughtered a few hours previously, it must have presented a bad appearance then—if it was diseased it would have presented so bad an appearance as to indicate that it was unfit for human food—it would have done so to the eye of any ordinary person, as well as to the eye of a butcher—it arrived packed in a hamper and cloths—there were cloths over it—the four quarters were not in separate cloths; they were packed altogether, and the cloths were all round them—there were two cloths in the hamper, I think, one underneath and one over—the top one must have been added after the meat was put into the hamper.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Greatrex—I cut the hamper open when it arrived on 16th February—I have been in the trade all my life—in my judgment that meat was certainly not fit for human food—it was in a bad state—it was diseased meat, the meat of a diseased animal—I pulled the cloth from the top, and as soon as I saw the meat I put it down again—I should say that it could be seen to be in an unfit state for human food by anybody, whether he was a butcher or not—anybody could tell that it was in so bad a state as to be unfit to be eaten.</p>

COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you help to put this meat into the hamper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Spencer helped me—I quartered it about half-past 4 the same day—the meat was not quite cold when I put it into the hamper—it had then every appearance of being good and fit for human food—I saw nothing wrong about it—it appeared very good—the fat did not appear to be running serum—it was not quite dry—it had not had time enough to be dry; it had not been killed long enough, but there was nothing amiss—the meat was a very good colour, as bright as any in the market—I should not have minded eating a sirloin of it—a butcher, named Gascoigne, saw it in the afternoon, just before it was packed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you had the heart for dinner; I suppose it was highly seasoned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very good—this was as fine and healthy an animal as ever I slaughtered—it did not appear to have anything at all the matter with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked whether there was any appearance of serum about the fat, and you said no; pray what is serum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it is bad meat—this was good meat; there is no better meat killed—I don't understand your language—it was good meat; I don't know what you may call it; you may call it what you like—I know good meat from bad—I saw the broken rib; it was the first short rib; it was broken short in two—there is only one short rib—I examined the place—there was no appearance of disease about it, only where it was broken; no other disease except that—that was all the disease there was about it—the flesh was not inflamed where it was broken; not at all—it did not present any unusual appearance—the meat was not so sound and healthy exactly on the bone where it was broken—it was inflamed round about where it was broken, nowhere else—it was a little place about as big as a half-crown—the rib was broken in two—I first saw Mr. Peck about this matter down at his house; he sent for me—Spencer was with me then; he came down there and I asked him to help me—he was not with me the first time I was talking to Mr. Peck about slaughtering this beast—that was the morning I slaughtered her—I did not slaughter her about 9 in the morning; it was between 5 and 6—he had talked a day or two before about having it killed—he had not said anything to me about killing it till he sent for me that morning—the man came for me between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning—that was the first I heard about slaughtering the cow—I had never heard of it before then—Mr. Peck had never said any-thing to me about slaughtering her before that—I pledge my oath of that—I went up and asked Spencer to help me fetch it away from Mr. Peck's house to the slaughter-house—Mr. Peck sent for him—he came a little before 6—that was the first I saw of Spencer—I had not slaughtered her at that time—Spencer was there, and assisted me to slaughter her—I never tried to get her up—she lay down when she was killed, and Spencer hit her with the pole-axe, and I stuck her while she was lying on the ground—a great many beasts are slaughtered down like that—they often get down in the truck, and get hurt—if she had been in a condition to rise, I should have adopted the ordinary plan of pulling her up to the bull-ring—I did not kill her in the usual way, because I could not get her up—I did not see</p>

               <p>anything she matter with her, only that—I had seen her three or four days before that—she was always lying down when I saw her—I cannot tell the first time I saw her—I dare say it was two or three days before I slaughtered her—she was in calf—she was removed from Mr. Peck's down to my slaughter-house to be dressed—Spencer assisted to do that, and assisted me to dress her, and pack her—he did all that he could do.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he assist you to skin her and get her dressed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did her head; that was all—I said so before—he did not help me dress her—he did nothing more than the head—from the time the animal was taken to the slaughter-house until she was sent off to market, he gave me no further assistance—he did not do more than help me load her into the cart, and put her into the hamper—I do not know many meat salesmen in London—I know nothing about London men—I had nothing to do with sending her to London—I did not know anything about sending her to London—Mr. Peck said nothing to me about what we were to do with her—he did not say what was to become of the meat; he did not say we were to sell it—I had nothing to do with it but slaughtering it—I had nothing to do with selling the meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not Mr. Peck tell you to do the best you could with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he never did; nor asked me what I could do with it—I was to have 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for slaughtering it—I was paid that for my job—that was all the money I was to have in the matter—that was all I had, and I was not to have any more—I did not go with it to the station—I helped to dress it and put it in the hamper, and that was the last I saw of it—that was at my slaughter-house, on the Friday night—it was then taken away by Spencer, in a cart—I do not know who brought the cloths and hamper to the slaughter-house—they were there when I came home—I had gone to kill a pig, and when I came back they were there—the weather was not cold weather at that time—it was a very bad morning, a wet morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you right, you saw this animal a day or two before you slaughtered it, at Mr. Peck's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Peck had no conversation with me about it then, that I recollect—I am sure I cannot say—he said he had been buying it of Mr. Partridge—he did not say anything more, to my knowledge—he told me he thought there was something broke in her loins, or something—he did not say anything then about what he should do with her—I do not recollect that he did; he may have done so, but I cannot say whether he did or not—I cannot tell you how the cow came to be sent to London—I do not know anything about that—I recollect Mr. Peck coming down to the slaughter-house and seeing the cow after it was dressed—Spencer was there then—I do not recollect his saying anything then, as to how the cow was to be disposed of—I do not recollect anything passing between Spencer and him, at that time, about its going to London—there might be some conversation between them, but I cannot recollect—I know that fishmongers come up to London to purchase their fish—Spencer comes up to London to purchase fish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and have been so all my life—my father was a butcher before me—I live in Back-street, Hitchin—I saw this cow of Mr. Peck's about two hours after it was slaughtered—it was not good cow beef; it was thin, still it was fit for market when I saw it; stiff, and fit for market—it was light-run a little, which is prevalent among animals—the lights had grown to the side—that is often the case—I saw nothing in</p>

               <p>the meat to render it unfit for market when I saw it, or unfit for human food—in such cases, the fat is generally skin instead of fat; it is not solid fat—it is my belief, if it bad not had a broken rib, it would have got over it; I mean it would have got over the accident, and would have lived—I dare say there was excruciating pain—I did not see anything that I should call disease in the animal; nothing to render it unfit for market; only at that time it had been raining for some considerable time, and very likely the hamper was exposed out in the air, and so it <hi rend="italic">got</hi> wet—that would certainly make a difference with the meat afterwards—of course, anybody could tell that it was good meat as I saw it, hanging up by the body'—they oil it a body of beef when it hangs up—if it appeared good meat to me, who am a butcher, it would most decidedly appear as good to a fishmonger.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am assistant to Mr. Powles, a hosier, of Fleet-street—on 26th February, the prisoners came—I was at the other end of the shop, and saw Mr. Powles serve them with twelve cambric handkerchiefs, two silk scarfs, six pairs of kid gloves, one silk mantle, three flannel shirts, and thirty-six yards of Irish linen—they selected them between them—they came to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they ordered them to be sent to 17, Margaret-street, at 7 o'clock—I took them there, and was answered by a maid-servant—I said that there was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay—she said, "Mr. Carri is out, but will be in in half an hour—I remained in the hall, and the servant went up stairs—a man with a cap came in, asked for Mr. Carri, and went up stairs—I had remained there twenty minutes or half an hour when Carri came in and went up stairs—I remained a few minutes and the man with the cap came down and went out, and afterwards Carri went out—I stood up to speak to him, but did not as I thought he had perhaps gone out to get change—in consequence of something the maid said, I went upstairs and found Paul and Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, as I understood them to be—I demanded my goods of Paul, or else the money—he said that he had not got them; Mr. Carri had gone out and had taken them with him—he spoke to Mr. Robinson in their own language, and then he took his hat and said he would take me to a friend's house where he thought we should find Mr. Carri—they can both speak English—I know that Carri can, because he spoke to me, and he spoke at the police-court—it was broken English, but such as you could understand—I went out with Paul to Oxford-market, and in Soho-square I ran up against Carri, and the man with a cap on—I asked Carri for my parcel or the money—he said that I was to go home, and he would call again to-morrow—Paul was within hearing; they were all three conversing together—I said, "I must have either the parcel or the money, or I will send for a police-constable—we all four went to the house in Margaret-street; one of them knocked at the door, and the man with the cap on turned and went away—the two prisoners went in, and I followed them, and asked the man to run for a policeman—the landlady spoke to the prisoners about my parcel; they said that they had not got it—I was asked to follow them up stairs to the first floor—Carri slipped into another room, and Paul said, "Come along here," or "Follow me up here," trying to induce me to follow him up higher—I said, "I shall not go up, for I know Mr. Carri is gone"—the landlady said,(You had better lock the front door," which I did, and put the key in my pocket—shortly afterwards a policeman, Barber, came, and I told him what had happened—Paul, who had followed me down to the hall, spoke to him—we then went up to the second floor, front, and found Carri smoking a pipe—the policeman demanded the parcel or the money—Carri said that he had not got it; it was locked up in the other room, and Mr. Robinson had got the key—he wanted me to go home, and to write something on a paper for me to take and show to Mr.</p>

               <p>Powles, but I would not have it—shortly afterwards Paul went into the other room and produced six pairs of kid gloves and two silk scarfs—they were jumping about like mad men because I would not go without the goods, and Paul got a poker and advanced to me and the constable, and another constable was sent for—they said that we had better take them to the station to have it settled—they would not produce the other articles—Carri asked me if I would be good and kind if he showed, me where the parcel was—I said, "Yes, all I want is the other portion of the parcel"—we all went out together with the constable, and, they took us to the ice-shop in Oxford-street, where I saw the other portion of the parcel lying on the table all untied—I got my articles and saw that they were all right—one of the policeman asked the ice-man, in the prisoners' presence, who had brought them—he said that Carri had brought them and wished him to let him put them under the counter, but he would not, and he put them on the table—I then gave them both in charge—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my master's property.</p>

I am a detective—the prisoner Whiter lived at 20, Great Mitchell-street, Brick-lane, St. Luke's—the prisoners were acquainted—I have not seen them together—I have seen Sturt go to her house many times—I had seen him go there about 3 or 4 months previous to his apprehension—the last time was about a week before—on 9th March, about 1 o'clock in the day, I and Foulger were in Wood-street, and Sturt passed us, carrying this bag, with something in it, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) over his shoulder—we followed him to No. 20, Great Mitchell-street, Winter's house—he remained there about three-quarters of an hour, and then came out with the bag over his shoulder, apparently empty, and went down Mitchell-street, into Brick-lane, towards Old-street; Foulger and I followed him—Foulger called him by name, and said, "Sturt, we are officers"—I said, "You have been into 20, Great Mitchell-street"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "You have left a parcel there"—he said, "I have left no parcel there"—I think Foulger an I spoke at the same time; I said, "Do you live there?—he said, "No, I do not"—he was very much confused—we took him to 20, Great Mitchell-street; I made inquiries of a woman who was cleaning in the passage, at the bottom of the stairs, whether the prisoner had been up stairs, and she said that he had not—I opened the parlour door and saw—Winter in the front room—I asked her whether she knew who Sturt was, and whether he had been in there—she said she did not know him, and he had not been in there—I turned to Foulger and Sturt, with my back to the female prisoner, and as I turned again, I saw her with her back to me, and her face to the sideboard; she then went towards the back room—it is divided by a partition, with a door in the centre—I caught hold of her, and said, "What have you there? we are officers"—she had these 2 watches and this chain in her hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took them from her—I found these 6 duplicates in this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a drawer in the front room</p>

               <p>—after finding these, I said to her, "Sturt has brought a parcel here"—she said, "He has not"—I said that he had just left, and she denied it, and continued to deny it all the time we ware there—we searched the place, and found a great quantity of Berlin wool, worsted, netted handkerchiefs, neckties, beads, and about 50 bundles of coloured wool—we found these two parasols (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging up in the front parlour—I examined a box, and found some more duplicates—some of them are made out in Winter's name—they relate to new dresses and new shawls—Winter said that a man left them there—I told her that I should take her into custody—I asked her whether she occupied those two rooms—she said that she did—I asked her whether she knew Sturt—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know that he worked at Hutton's, in Newgate-street?"—she said, "Yes, I know that Mr. Sturt worked there"—she made no statement about how she became possessed of the property till after the examination—I asked her her occupation, and she said she was a charwoman, and took in washing—I said, "How long is it since you have done any charing?"—she said, "Twelve months ago"—I asked her how long ago it was she had done washing—she said she had washed 6 shirts for Sturt's boys—while we were in the house, I took from her a savings' bank book—she went into the back room, and I followed her—I saw her put her hand in her pocket—I took her hand from her pocket, and she had a savings' bank book—it showed a deposit in her favour of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not got it here; it was given up to Mr. Wontner, on application of the prisoner Winter, by order of the Magistrate—I afterwards took the female prisoner to Clerkenwell police-court—she made a statement to me on the way, and had done so previous to that—I did not say anything to her first—it was after she had been examined before the Magistrate—after the final hearing of this case, and before the other case came on at Clerkenwell (her premises were robbed while she was in prison), she said, "I wish I had told the truth"—I said, "You may say what you like;" and she said, "You brought three parcels from my place, how is it you have only brought two here"—I said, "Because we could only identify two"—she said, "One I bought myself, and the other two Sturt brought to me" and she said, "On the Saturday that you took us, he brought five bundles of worsted"—these large hanks—I said, "How did he bring the Berlin wool? you need not answer the question unless you like"—she said, "Two or three bundles at a time"—I said, "How did he bring the silk braid?"—she said, "Wrapped up in his handkerchief"—I said, "Your father says this has been going on for some time, and that you were about to be married, and keep a little shop"—she said, "Yes;" and she repeated many times, "I wish I had told the truth."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Moses, Son, and Davis, clothiers in Aldgate—the prisoner was in the shirt department there—his salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; a week of not more than 5 days—Saturdays he had almost at his own command—it was part of his duty to make contracts with the workpeople—his other duties were very general in his department—he had the entire superintendence; engaging the shirt-cutters and arranging their wages—he had no authority to receive back any portion of the wages which be agreed to pay to any particular workman—it was all piece-work—we derived no benefit from any portion of returned money—his duty with regard to the vouchers was to take a blank voucher and enter upon it, in columns described there, the work given up and brought in, and the price to be paid for that work—the true cost of the work—a workman so receiving that voucher would take it to the ledger-keeper for examination—he would enter it in his ledger, return the voucher to the workman with his initial, and the workman would then take it to the cashier for payment—he would receive in payment whatever the voucher represented in point of value—the voucher would be returned by the cashier—I have some of them here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the figuring is in the prisoner's writing, and the initial in the ledger-keeper's—the other parts carry on them the name of Upton—they are vouchers in favour of him—we have in our different establishments 2,000 employés, directly and indirectly, in and out the houses.</p>

               <p>we are subject to that sort of thing occasionally—they do not often run away from our place, they do sometimes—we should not blame the prisoner for that—it is impossible for me to say how many persons he would have to engage and to give out shirts to in the ordinary course of business—we are not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Moses and Son; we are Moses, Son, and Davis—I should think he would have more than 100 persons during the week to engage and give out shirts to—it is he that has to give the work out to them—he takes their names and addresses down—he would not do that every time they came—sometimes they are dilatory in bringing back the work—he would not have to look after them then; we keep boys for that purpose—it is not the prisoner's duty to do that—he ought not to have done it—it was against the rule of the house to have any communication with the workpeople, out of doors, or at their own homes—he knew that—it was generally known—that rule was not in writing—I do not think I ever told him of such a rule—it did not require that he should be told—when the work was brought home, it was the prisoner's duty to check it and see that it was correct; and then he passed on the voucher.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living at 39, Freeling-street, Caledonian-road, Islington—I know the prisoner—he was in the shirt department of Messrs. Moses, Son, and Davis—I went there on 25th April, last year, and applied for work—I saw the prisoner, and asked him if he was in want of a shirt stitcher for shirt trimming, as his brother said that he was—he said that he was not very busy, and said, "Did my brother send you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I shall be out at 7 o'clock to night; meet me outside"—I did so—in the course of the evening we went to a public-house at the corner of Vine-street, Minories—he asked me what I could do white and fancy shirt trimmings for—I said, "I am receiving 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and produced a book from another house at the same time—the book was given to Mr. Lewis—he then asked me what I could do twill trimmings for—that is a commoner class of trimming—I said, "6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per gross," being the same as was in my book, and which I was then receiving elsewhere—he said, "Well, Upton, you know I have the sole control of Messrs. Moses, Son, and Davis; I can give you work, and I can give you 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per gross for white and fancy, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for twill, and you know these are prices which are not paid elsewhere, but the difference you must return to me, and as long as you do that you shall have plenty of work"—from that time I had work—I received payments at those rates, and returned him the difference.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you seen the prisoner before that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was a perfect stranger to me—I saw him first at the warehouse—I saw clerks there, and a number of workpeople—I saw him in the presence of all the people—I saw him there on 25th—I cannot recollect the day of the week—I saw him at the Vine public-house the same day—I am sure it was on 25th—we were in the parlour at the public-house—there were other people in the room—I don't know who they were—we might have been there about an hour—we had a glass of something to drink—"16/11/60" on this receipt means the month of the year—I believe the 1,127 is the number of my book which I have my work entered out in—the solicitor has that book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—1,127 is the number of this book; it was given to me by the clerk—this large book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) comes first—I received the large book</p>

Y." are put to it when I return the work—I don't know why I changed the books; probably I might have left the other one behind—I cannot state the reason—the prisoner's writing is in that book as well—it was white shirt trimming that I received 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross for—the trimming means the front, the two wristbands, and the collar—that would count as one shirt; twelve of them a dozen, and twelve dozen a gross—they were given out to me sometimes five or six dozen at a time; sometimes more, and sometimes less—I cannot say whether I have received a gross at any time—there was a time given us all to work, according to the time they wanted the work—a time was always fixed, but not always the same time—I have had half a gross out for a fortnight—that was regular—I was not found fault with for keeping it out—I have been found fault with for keeping work out longer than the fixed time, but not frequently, and not by the prisoner; by persons who were there, shirt hands—I can't give you their names—the prisoner found fault with me—I have been found fault with by the shirt hands—I say that the prisoner never found fault with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and am the father of Alfred Upton—I know the prisoner—I have seen him from time to time with my son—I have seen money pass from my son to the prisoner on three occasions; once, from 10th to 15th of July, in Gracechurch-street—I cannot positively swear whether it was a half-sovereign or a sovereign, but it was gold—I was not near enough to distinguish which of the two it was—the second occasion was at a public-house in Fenchurch-street, somewhere about the latter end of August—I think it was a sovereign then, but I could not positively say—it was gold—the third occasion was on 24th December, near the London Hospital—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—I did not notice anything particular being said between the prisoner and my son, only a little dissatisfaction—I suppose that from the irritable manner in which the money was received—I judged from the prisoner's manner that he was disappointed with the money, from his tone and gesture.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for some years engaged as a porter and messenger—I live at 15, Exmouth-street, Hampstead-road, and am principally employed in the neighbourhood of King's Cross—I have from time to time been employed by the prisoner to go on errands, and have from time to time been for her to the office of a Mr. Young, a solicitor—I have received several letters from her, but cannot recollect the date—it is most likely I may have received letters from her about the end of January—in the middle of January she came to me at Mr. Costin's public-house, near King's-cross—I cannot exactly say what passed, as she had been there so many times to see me—I remember her making an appointment with me once for the next day—she said she had some money in Mr. Coutts' bank, sent up from Hereford, and could not get at it without a cheque—she asked me whether I would go with her next morning to endeavour to get a cheque or cheque-book—I said that I would—it was arranged that I was to meet her at the Angel at Islington, at 12 o'clock, and I met her a few doors from the Angel (I had, before that, made a communication to Mr. Costin; on the evening of the 15th when I first met her)—she said that she was going about this cheque and that she understood they were to be bought at some stationers' shops; she thought she had seen them in the windows, and would I get one for her—I said I had no objection to go with her, and said, "Mr. Costin says a cheque is not required; a piece of blank paper will do as well"—she said, "I know blank paper will not do; it must be a cheque"—we went to one or two shops—I went in and she waited outside—I could not get any at the shops—we at last went to Gray's-inn-lane—she said that there was a pawnbroker there whom she knew, who, she thought, banked at Messrs. Coutts', and most likely he would be able to give her a cheque—I stopped outside while she went in to the pawnbroker's—it was in Gray's-inn-lane—I forget his name—she stayed there about a quarter of an hour, came back and said that he did bank there some time ago, but did not now, and he had not got</p>

               <p>a blank cheque—(I afterwards pointed out that pawnbroker's to a police<lb/>man)—she said, "Will you go to Mr. Young's? I think he banks at Mr. Coutts', and if he has a blank cheque, he will give me one"—I knew who Mr. Young was—I went part of the way, but did not go because I thought he would not do it—I spoke to one of the porters in Gray's-inn-square, and went back and told the prisoner that the porter told me that a blank cheque was not necessary, that a piece of paper would answer the purpose—she said that she knew a piece of paper would not do; it must be a cheque—I said, "If that is the case, we cannot get the cheque"—she said that she understood that by going to Mr. Coutts', and making application in a person's name who banked there, that they would give it to you—I said, "In that case we had better go to Mr. Coutts' at once"—she said that Mr. Young had been her solicitor, which I knew, and banked there, and if I made use of his name no doubt they would give me a cheque or cheque-book—I said that I did not understand that sort of thing, but hoped that she would not get me into any trouble—she said that I could not get into any trouble by asking a simple question of that sort; and if I was asked what Mr. Young wanted it for, I was to say that he wanted a cheque, and had come out without his book—I had told her some time before that I was in trouble and had got the brokers in my house that morning for rent—she said that if she got her money she would make me a present of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to assist me—I went into Coutts' bank, asked for a cheque-book for Mr. Young, and was detained—I said a few words to Anscombe, the policeman, and he took me outside the hank, into the Strand, to see the prisoner, but could not see her.</p>

               <p>and I said at the moment that I did not know her name, because I was confused—that was the sole reason why I did not mention her name—I did mention it outside the bank—the clerk said, "You know her name"—I was with a policeman then—I do not believe policeman said, "You know the woman's name, and I must have it"—I will not swear he did not—I said that it was Mrs. Palmer—I did not at that time know where she lived—she has not been particularly kind to me; she has never paid me for more than I did—I lay in goal a fortnight—I was not bailed till the session was over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in Gray's-inn-square—I formerly banked at Coutts', but ceased to have an account there at the latter part of last year—I know the prisoner—I have been formerly professionally engaged for her, and have had occasion to give her cheques on Messrs. Coutts' bank—I know Samson as coming on several occasions from Mrs. Palmer—I gave no authority to the prisoner or to Samson to apply at Messrs. Coutts' bank for a cheque-book or cheques in my name—I did not give her a Crossed cheque on Coutts' on 15th February, or on any bank—I was not locked up on 16th February in consequence of this cheque.</p>

On 23d March I was on duty in the Minories, and saw Baker come out of Mr. Goodman's yard, about half-past 3, and go to Hobson's cab—that was about 170 yards from Baker's watch-box—I have known Hobson some time, and know the other prisoners as being in the service of the Dock Company—Hobson was on his stand opposite John-street, inside his cab—he got out and went on to the footpath with Baker—they conversed together for five or six minutes—Baker then went down Goodman's-yard and Hobson stood on the footpath oppo<lb/>site his cab—I expect they saw me; they might have seen me, I passed by with the sergeant at 10 minutes past 4—Baker came up the yard and spoke</p>

               <p>to Hobson on the footpath opposite his cab—they stood talking about two minutes, and Baker then went away down Goodman's-yard—about half-past 4, he came and spoke to Hobson again, for a very short time—he went away and came back at 20 minutes to 5, to Hobson, who was standing on the foot-path, the cab being on the stand—he went away, and Hobson went and stood by the cab—Baker went down the Minories towards the railway-arches—I had seen Wackett once before, but not that same morning—Wackett came up on this morning at the time that Baker passed by, towards the railway-arch—I heard a whistle which I believe came from Wackett's direction, and upon that Hobson got on his cab and drove towards Goodman's-yard—he went down the yard—that would take him past the entrance into the Dock Company's premises—after the whistle and before Hobson got on his cab—Wackett staid there a few seconds, and then went down Goodman's-yard before the cab—I followed the cab, and as I got to the top of Goodman's-yard, or just going down it, Wackett came up and gave another whistle—I still followed the cab—he cut his horse and went much faster; into Mansell-street—when I arrived at the top of the yard the cab was close to the Dock Company's warehouses; that is forty or fifty yards from the top of the yard—when it started off I followed it up Mansell-street, and Swan-street, into the Minories as far as George-street, and then he turned it round and came back to the stand where it was at first—he went away from the stand and turned back again.</p>

               <p>the cab, hearing the cab door shut when If got near the corner of Goodman's-yard, previous to turning into the yard—as I turned into the yard, the cab was close to the warehouse entrance; being driven along—I saw Wackett standing almost where the cab was, and when he saw me going down the yard, he gave a whistle—I continued to run after the cab when he whistled, and when I got nearly opposite to Wackett, he gave another whistle, and Hobson appeared to drive his cab faster—I continued to run after the cab, and over-took it in Goodman's-yard—I caught hold of it, but did not speak; I only followed it—it turned into Mansell-street and Swan-street, and turned to the right instead of turning to the cab-rank—it went 90 or 100 yards to the right—I followed it till it came on to the rank again—I had hold of it all the time—I then watched—Williams went away while I was watching—I had been watching all the time—nothing was put in during that time—I went with Williams towards the cab, and when we got about two strides from it, Hobson opened the door, and said that he had got something put in his cab, and thought he should take it to the station—I ordered the sergeant to drive the cab—I went with it to the station and found a sack of tea in it—I afterwards went to Goodman's-yard and took Baker—he was in the yard; not in the warehouse—he was told that we had got a sack of tea, which was supposed to have been stolen from the warehouse, and that we must take him into custody—we said nothing about the cab—he said that he knew nothing about it, and went with Williams to the station, in custody—I identified him as the person who whistled when I went down the yard with Williams—I took Wackett—he was inside the warehouse, about 20 yards from where the other came from—he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 21st February, I went to Mr. El wood's house and examined the premises—I saw a great number of footmarks in the garden—I examined them and preserved several of them in the event of any persons being taken into custody—I covered them over with pieces of tile and slate, or anything I could get, in order to preserve them—since the apprehension of the prisoners I have compared their boots with those marks, and I find that the two pairs of boots which I have here belonging to the two male prisoners exactly correspond—I apprehended the female prisoner and found on her a pair of gauntlets, claimed by Mrs. Savage—I met her in the Borough-road on the afternoon of 8th March—I was in plain clothes—I told her I was a constable, and should take her in custody—she said she thought I was mistaken—when I told her it was my duty to take her to the station she said she would afford me all the assistance she could—I spoke to her about the parroquet that was taken from Dowler-street—I cautioned her in the usual way—she then told me that the bird she had sold at Mr. Judd's, the bird shop in Newington-butts, on the day previous, which would be the 7th, and that Alfred Abbott was present at the time she received the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Alfred was not present when she said that; he was then in custody.</p>

I am a bricklayer, of 3, Holles-street, Spring-place, Wandsworth-road—I know the prisoner—I was at the Surrey Arms beer-house on Saturday night, 26th January last—the prisoner and I were tossing for a pot of beer, and the penny came against his feet and he kicked it over—I paid for the pot of beer—I left the public-house that night—in cones<lb/>quence of something I was told, I went there again, on the following day, Sunday, at a quarter before 3 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—I went to him and asked him what he had been talking about me, and if he had any<lb/>thing to say to say it before my face, and not to go backbiting me—he said, "I have nothing particular to say but what I have said, I can soon settle that"—I said, Well, that is what I want"—I was stripped at the time, and I went home and put my jacket on, and I then returned—he stood in the street—I went to him and said, "Now, how are you going to settle it?"—he said, "You b----, I will settle you," and then he rushed at me—I pushed him back with my left hand, and he struck me with his left hand, and then drew his right hand from his side in this way; he threw it round me and drove it right into my back, and said, "Take that, you b----"—we both fell together, and a young man, named Burgess, who was by, laid hold of him, and took an open knife out of his hand—the prisoner gave him a violent blow on the cheek—I put my hand to my side, and found that I had a handful of blood—after the prisoner had struck Burgess, I turned round and said, "You vagabond," and struck him a blow, and, I believe, I struck him a second time; I knocked him down—I was obliged to have Mr. Jones, a doctor, to the wound, and to keep my bed eight days—I could not get out—I was not able to do any work for eight weeks—I afterwards went to the hospital—I have recovered now, and am able to go to work.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—on the night of 26th March, about half-past 9 o'clock, I went to 20, Lant-street, Southwark, accompanied by Inspector Moore and other officers—it is a marine-store shop—the shop-door was open—I proceeded through the shop and front-parlour, upstairs to the second-floor back-room—I saw the door ajar, and a light in the room—on entering, the light was put out—we had lamps—Inspector Bryant had a lamp with him—he turned it on—the prisoners were there when we entered the room—the male prisoner was standing by the fire<lb/>place, trampling on some plaster of Paris, metal, and cinders—he was seized by Inspector Moore, and I went towards the female prisoner and took this galvanic battery wire from her hand, wet with solution—I said to the male prisoner, "Well, Tom, we received instructions from the solicitor to the Mint, to pay you a visit; you are suspected of coining—he said "What's the matter? what's the matter?"—I said, "We shall see presently"—I then said to the female prisoner, "Well, Mrs. Freeman, here we meet again"—she said, I don't know what you mean; I never recollect seeing you before"—I said, What, not at Flint-street?"—she said, "That's gone by"—the cinders were steaming hot, but the fire was put out by some offensive liquid, which smelt like acid—I said to Jones, "Is this house yours? have you any ledgers? if so, we have no desire td annoy them, for we have a search-warrant to search the place"—he said "The whole house belongs to me; I have only one lodger, on the first-floor front room"—I then commenced searching, and on a large dish, which I produce, were a number of plaster of Paris moulds in liquid—I found that between the two prisoners—two of the moulds bear the im<lb/>pression of sixpences, partly obliterated through being in the liquid, which smelt to me like urine—I could not say whether it was that colour, because the plaster discoloured it—there were a great number of moulds, some of which had the impressions completely effaced and obliterated—some of the moulds that were at the top, in the urine, were warm and smoking—on the landing, in a coal-scuttle, I found a quantity of white metal, also hot—on the stove, in the adjoining room on the same floor, I found this tea-cup (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with 155 counterfeit sixpences in it, some of them wet with the silver solution—I found an iron saucepan, also hot, containing a little white metal—I found all the other necessary implements for coining, colourings and coating—in a cupboard, under the stairs, I found two galvanic-battery plates, and three counterfeit sixpences (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the officers, who were with me, found other things—I saw them searching.</p>

               <p>room after we had searched—the blinds were not up—I put them up—I am positive they were not up at the time—the wire was wet with solution when I took it out of the female's hands—I know what solution it was, because I tasted it—Jones did not say anything about any lodgers having recently left—he said that he had a lodger in the front room of the first floor—I am quite clear that he did not say anything about a lodger having recently left his house, and having occupied those rooms—I know a man named Wright, and I believe he formerly lodged there—he is under charge here to-day, and has confessed his guilt (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>)—the sixpences which I produce were found in the next room, in a tea-cup—I can only state that I believe the liquid was a mixture of the solution that they had been using for coating, for I had the curiosity to taste it.</p>

               <p>this is a catalogue of the things in the order in which I am going to speak to them, made at the time they were brought to me—here are 2 double moulds for sixpences, but so much destroyed that I cannot speak to any of the coins having been cast by them—urine will destroy a mould if the mould is thrown into it in a hot state; but if thrown into it in a cold state, it rather tends to harden it—water will destroy it very much quicker—I have examined 155 sixpences produced by Mr. Brannan, and found them all to be bad—I only selected 6 from each, of the dates 1858, 1859, and 1860, to prove that they were from one mould—these produced by Inspector Bryant are 5 counterfeit sixpences of 1859, 1 of 1860, from the same moulds as the others—there are 5 shillings of 1859, and 2 florins of 1859, from one mould—the next are those produced by Inspector Moore—here is a sixpence of 1857; 2 of 1858, from one mould; 5 of 1859, from the same mould as the others of 1859; and 3 of 1860, from the same mould as the other of 1860; and 4 florins of 1859, from the same mould as the 2 produced by Inspector Bryant—here is a wire and a galvanic battery—when I first saw it there were several shillings in it, one above the other—they were placed there—whether they were found in that state I do not know—here is a part of another double mould; simply the channels are made—I will not venture to say whether it has been used—both the moulds produced, found in the urine, are double moulds for sixpences.</p>

I am a bootmaker of 68, Wesson-street, Bermondsey—on Saturday, 2d March, the prisoner came there and asked me what I charged for heeling and clumping Wellington boots—I told him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he wanted them done in a very great hurry—I told him I could not do them that night, and he said, "To-morrow?"—I said, "I do not work on a Sunday"—he asked me when I could do them and I said not before Tuesday, at dinner-time, if ho would let me have them by Monday—he then said, "To make sure I will not disappoint you in bringing the boots I will give you a shilling on account"—he gave me a florin, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—it was either George the 4th or 6th—he then said, "Now, I have got to give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when you have done the job"—I said, "No, you have to give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "I have made a mistake; I am very sorry, but I really can<lb/>not afford it; if you return me my 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece back again, I will give you your shilling," and I immediately gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and received, as I supposed, my own shilling back again—I put the shilling he gave me aside; he left shortly afterwards—about a quarter of an hour after he was gone, I looked at the shilling and found it was bad—it was a Victoria one—I put it on one side, and afterwards, when he was apprehended, gave it to the police-constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at Park-lodge, Sydenham—on Thursday, 13th March, about half-past 12 in the day, I was sitting at the kitchen window in front of the house at work—the prisoner came up the garden to the window—she had a basket with some small mats in it, which she asked me to buy—I said, "No"—she stopped at the window for some time, and said, "Will you have your fortune told I"—I said, "No"—she said she would tell me a great many things—I asked her how much it was, and she said sixpence—I opened the window—she asked if I had a sixpence—I took out of my pocket three half-crowns—she said, "I can give you change, but hold that in your hand"—she then said, "Allow me to cross your hand with this silver," and she took up the three half-crowns and crossed my hand with them, and then commenced saying some words—she mentioned four letters, a "J," a "W," an "L," and an S, "I think, and asked which would I have?—I said I would have a "J"—she asked if it was for James or John—I said, "For John"—she said, "Well, that is true"—she put the silver in my hand, and then took it out a second time, and said, "You must lend me this for half an hour"—I said I would do no such thing—she said, "You must for a quarter of an hour"—I said I would not—she said, "You must for ten minutes, or what you propose will not come true"—she then hastened away from the window—I got up and went through the house into the garden, but she was gone—I saw no more of her till she was brought back by the policeman, in about half an hour—I am sure she is the same woman—I had plenty of time to see her features—I identified her at once—there was a little child selling mats next door when I went out to look after her, and she was kept till the policeman came.</p>

I received information from the last witness, in consequence of which I went in pursuit and met the prisoner at Sydenham-park, nearly half a mile from the house—I told her that I believed, by a description that I had received from a servant-girl, that she was the person who had been telling a fortune to her, and had taken three half-crowns from her, and she must go back to the girl to see if she was the person—she denied being the person, and went back with me—she had a basket in her hand with three mats in it, and some food—she was searched,</p>
