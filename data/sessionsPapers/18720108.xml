I am now living at New Cross—I am twenty years of age—I was in the service of the prisoner and his wife not quite three years—while I was there a sister of mine was in the service as well—she left last Christmas twelve months, 1870—from that time I was the only servant there—no one lived in the house but I and my master and mistress—he was formerly head-master of the Stockwell Grammar School; he ceased to be so some where about the time my sister left—my master and mistress used at first to occupy the same bedroom; that was the front bed-room on the first floor—they ceased to occupy the same bedroom at the commencement of the hot weather in last year—my mistress then slept in the room behind the library, on the first floor—she dressed in the room that Mr. Watson slept in, the front bedroom—at the back of that bedroom there is a dressing-room; there is also a room called the library on that same floor—I used to attend to all the rooms on that floor, excepting the one that Mrs. Watson slept in—She attended to that herself—I only went</p>

               <p>into it once or twice during the two or three months she slept there—I don't remember how recently before Sunday, 8th October, I had been in it—on Sunday morning, 8th October, my master and mistress went out together rather earlier than the usual church time—they came back rather later than usual—I should think it was about 1.45 o'clock—that was their dinner hour at that time—I had prepared dinner in the dining-room on the ground floor; that is the room on the right, as you come into the house—Mrs. Watson took off her bonnet and things, and they sat down to dinner—I attended to them—they had no wine for dinner, they had some after dinner—I am not certain what wine it was—after dinner they went up stairs into the library; the wine was up there, and they had some dessert—I do not remember seeing them again—it was between 2 and 3 o'clock when I left them in the library—up to that time I had not noticed any<lb/>thing in their manner or demeanour to attract my attention—they usually lived on very friendly terms, they were generally very quiet—I went out that afternoon, about 4 o'clock—I let myself out—before I went out I had prepared the tea in the dining-room—5.45 was their usual time for taking tea—when I returned, at 9 o'clock, I knocked at the door, and Mr. Watson let me in, and he said my mistress had gone out of town and would not be home till to-morrow—I don't remember his saying any<lb/>thing more then—I went into the dining-room, and he came in with me—I noticed that the tea things had not been touched; I looked at them, and he said "We have not taken tea"—he said nothing more—I passed some remark, a word or two—I forget now what it was—I asked him if he would take some supper, and he said yes, he would take a little bread and cheese—it was usual for him to take supper—he then went up stairs into the library—I went down to the kitchen and took off my things, and took some bread and cheese up into the dining-room—I then went up stairs to settle the bedrooms as usual—I went into Mr. Watson's bedroom—I don't remember going into the library that night—I did not notice anything about the bedroom different to what I had left it—that was the front bed-room—I did not sec Mr. Watson then, he was taking his bread and cheese in the dining-room—I had told him it was ready, and he went down stairs and had his supper in the dining-room—I saw him again at 10 o'clock that night, he came out of the library as I was going up to bed, he opened the door and said "This stain on the floor is port wine your mistress has spilt, in case you might wonder what it was I have told you"—I could not see any. stain then, it was under the carpet as you are walking into the library, at the side of the door, under the door—he also pointed to the next room door, the small bedroom at the back of the library, and said "Do not go to that door, your mistress has locked it"—I said "No," and went up to bed—that was all I saw that night—I looked at the door as he spoke, and I did see no key in the door; there was usually a key in that door, outside, I think—I did not expect my mistress was going out of town—on the following morning, Monday, I got my master's breakfast in the dining-room—I am not certain if it was that day or on the Tuesday that he said my mistress would not be home for a day or two—I don't know how he came to say that—I did not ask him any question—I wanted some candles, and I said to him, if she would not be home till dark I should want some candles out, and it was upon that he said that she would not be home for two or three days—he did not say where she had gone—my master went out on the Monday, and he had his meals as usual—he went out on</p>

               <p>the Tuesday—I almost forget, now, the times at which he went out—he said on the Tuesday that he was going out, and would not be home all night—it was after dinner that he said that—he had been out before dinner—he went out after he had said that—he went out about three times after that—I went out in the afternoon to try to find somebody to sleep there; but I was not able to get anyone—I told him at night that I was unable to get anybody, and he said that I should have to remain by myself—I went down stairs, and waited to see if he would go out, but he did not go; I re<lb/>mained up till about 11 o'clock, when he called me over the stairs—he was standing on the staircase, the first flight from the hall—he said "If you should find anything wrong with me in the morning, step for Dr. Rugg"—I said "Are you ill, sir?"—he said "I may require medicine in the morning;" nothing further took place—I went down stairs, and he went up stairs, to bed, as I supposed; I did not see him after he went from the stairs; it must have been after 11 o'clock when he went to bed—on the Wednesday morning I came down about 6.45—near 8 o'clock I went to the door of his room; I knocked at the door, and Mr. Watson answered me; he was dressing himself, I could hear—it was not quite 8.30 when he came down stairs—he went out, before breakfast, for about ten minutes; he breakfasted as soon as he came in—after breakfast he went out again, between 10 and 11 o'clock—he came back about 11 o'clock; I think he went up to the library; I don't remember his passing any remark at that time—between 11 and 12 o'clock he called me, I saw him in the hall; he said "If I should be ill before dinner, go for the dinner"—I said "Yes"—he said nothing more; he went up stairs—some time after, I heard a groaning—I should not think it was an hour after, about half an hour, or more, I should think—I was in the drawing-room and the groaning came from overhead, in the front bed room—I went up to my master's bedroom, he was lying in bed, undressed—I spoke to him, but he was unconscious, he did not know me—I went for the doctor at once—I left him in the house by himself—before I went for the doctor, I noticed three papers in the chair, and a small phial on the drawers, and there was a glass on the chair by the side of the bed—I took up one of the papers, this is it; I took it up, thinking it might be some message for the doctor, and read it—it is in my master's writing (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> For the servant, Ellen Pyne, exclusive of her wages. Let no suspicion fall on the servant, whom I believe to be a good girl.") That was sealed; a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was enclosed in it—I don't think the "No. 3" was on it when I opened it; I don't remem<lb/>ber seeing it, it might have been there—I went out and fetched Dr. Rugg—I had known him before, he had been to the house before to attend my sister, who was ill—he went into my master's bedroom, and he after<lb/>wards went out and fetched the police—I went into the room afterwards, and spoke to my master; I spoke to him once or twice before he answered me; then I asked him if he was cold—he said "Yes," and I put something more on the bed—when the police came I went into the library with them—I showed them some marks there; there were some splashes about the window, which I supposed to be wine that had been splashed about, I mean on the library window—I think I first noticed those marks on the Tuesday, I had cleaned the window—the marks were by the side of the skirting; I did not touch them; I don't remember any being on the glass—I did not see any other marks in that room—I did not notice the furniture; I did not notice the chair—I had not done anything to the carpet before that, I</p>

I asked my master whether he was cold, and he answered me, he said "Yes," and J put something on the bed; that was some time after I had seen him in a state of uncon<lb/>sciousness, when he could not answer me—the doctor had then been and seen Mr. Watson; it was about an hour after—I never saw any pistols in my master's possession, I never saw them till they were found by the police—I was the first that went to the drawer and saw them there—I think somebody told me they had been found in the drawer, and I went and saw them; I am not certain, but I think I was the first person that found them—I called the attention of one of the policemen to the fact that I bad seen some pistols in that drawer—it was in Mr. Watson's dressing-room, the drawer of a chest of drawers—it was shut; it was unlocked, I could open it easily and look—there was nothing to prevent anyone opening the drawer and looking into it—I had been in the habit of attending to my master's dressing-room, putting it to rights in the morning; that was a part of my duty—I had access to it constantly; if I had been curious I might at any time have seen these pistols, but I never opened the drawer till that day—this Latin paper was left on the library table, the corner of it was put under a book, I think, or something was across it—it was placed so that you could read the writing; it was open—I noticed it, and looked at it, but I could not read it—that was on the Tuesday morning—I had never noticed it there before—this is a large house—the school-room is a good-sized room, not very large—I was in Mr. Watson's service when they had boarders, two young gentlemen, two years ago—I think they left just before he left the grammar school, that must have been as far back as Christmas, 1870—I knew that he had then ceased to be master of the grammar school; before that he used to go to the school every day—up to that time they had kept two servants—my sister left on account of illness, and they had only one servant afterwards, that was myself, I was the only servant—I was in the habit of attending upon my master and mistress at their meals, breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper—latterly I did all the work of the house, except my mistress's bedroom—it was in the hot weather that they first ceased to sleep together, about July—the reason of their ceasing to sleep together was the hot weather, and then my mistress attended to her own bedroom; she said I had enough to do, and she would help me—sometimes she would behave to me with great kindness, some<lb/>times she was hasty—my master always behaved to me with great kindness; I considered him to be a kind-hearted gentleman—I never noticed any quarrel<lb/>ling, or any angry feeling between them, while I was attending upon them—they always appeared to me to live happily and comfortably together—Mrs. Watson always seemed to have her own way, that is all I know—they</p>

               <p>always appeared to live happily and comfortably together—my master was a very reserved man; I may have noticed it more by their being so quiet, by their not having much company; there was no company at all—after their meals they used to sit together in the library; that was their common practice—when I went up there Mr. Watson was always either reading or writing—I did not observe that more latterly, after he left the school; his habits were always of a studious character—I always thought him very industrious in his writing and reading—he used to sit up till 11o'clook—there was a good deal of method in the house, everything was very punc<lb/>tual—I think he was generally in the habit of writing or reading up to the time that he went to bed—they went to church on Sunday, 8th October; they went earlier than they used to go—I did not hear them say where they went to church—I know Emmanuel Church—that is not their usual church—I think it is rather further from the house than their usual church; that might account for their going a little earlier—Mr. Watson was sometimes absent on a Sunday, doing duty—when he was at home on Sunday he was always in the habit of going to church with his wife; they used to go together, once a day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, living and practising at Stockwell Villas, Clapham Road—I know Mr. Watson—I have known him for years as the head master of the Grammar School, at Stockwell—I have not attended him professionally, but on one occasion I attended the sister of the last witness, who was a servant with her, and who left at Christmas—I have an impression that the last time I saw Mr. Watson was the day before the transaction in question—I did not speak to him—I was on the opposite side of the way—whether it was that day or two days before, I don't know, but I saw him that week—on Wednesday, 11th October, I was called to Mr. Watson's house, about 11.30—I was fetched by the servant Payne—when I got there I found the prisoner in bed; he was unconscious, breathing heavily, with difficulty—his eyes were turned up, there was a cold clammy perspiration on him, and he had a weak, soft, compressible pulse, an intermittent pulse—I thought he was labouring under an attack of epilepsy first—he was probably a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes in that unconscious state—Pyne put three letters into my hand—one was addressed "For the surgeon"—it was sealed with an adhesive envelope, this is it.

I know not if I have any other surviving relatives. One quarter's wages will soon be due to my servant, and I should wish the sum to be more than doubled for her, on account of the trouble which she will have at the present time, and the patience with which she has borne other troubles.

The books are a very useful collection for a literary man. The two thick quarto MS. books, marked P and Q, might be sent to the British Museum, or might possibly find some purchaser among literary men, for whom they contain many valuable notes and hints. Among the other MS. is a complete translation of "Valerius Flaccus" in verse, which I think deserves to be published. Messrs. Longman and Co. also have in their hands for inspection 4 vols. of manuscript, containing a complete history of the Popes from the foundation of the Papal power to the Reformation. There is also ready for the press a tale entitled "Hercules." I leave, too, in the bookcase, several books of extracts and observations marked with the letters of the alphabet, the oldest being that I believe marked M, and the most recent that marked There is an annotated copy of the "Life of Porson," with a book of addenda and a copy of the "Life of Warburton," with a few annotations and a book of addenda. There will be found, in loose sheets, in the press at the side of the fireplace in the library, a complete translation of Beranger's songs, with the exception of "Mes Derniers Chansons." Some of these have been printed. The house is to be vacated at the half-quarter. For the rent to Michaelmas I have sent a cheque to-day. There will be some small bills, but when all claims are satisfied there will be a considerable sum left, besides what will arise from the sale of books and furniture. I have made my way, in the world so far as it has been made, by my own efforts. My great fault has been too much self-dependence, and too little regard for others. Whatever I have done I have endeavoured to do to the best of my ability, and have been fortunate, I may say, generally, but with one great exception. In the paper-cases lying about and elsewhere will be found some MSS. which have been used, and others intended for literary purposes.") I found out Mrs. Watson's room from the servant—I opened the door with the key and went in—it was the bedroom at the back of the library—I found Mrs. Watson dead, huddled up in one corner of the room—she was covered over with a blanket—I examined her, to see what was the cause of death, and I found several wounds on the scalp, and a fracture of the bone—there was blood on the floor, and her gown was covered with blood, saturated with blood—there was a good deal on the floor—I can't</p>

               <p>say how much, it was congealed, and the clothes all saturated—the body was stiff—she must have been dead a day or two at least, on account of the congealed blood and the stiffness of the body—death was no doubt caused by the fracture of the skull by some blunt kind of instrument—a horse-pistol was shown to me the next day at the station—the wounds I saw were most likely to have been produced by such an instrument as that—the body was dressed in the ordinary female dress, she had a gown on—I saw six wounds at that time—subsequently, at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, we discovered eight on the scalp—there was one large fissure of the skull—I did not notice the hands, or the arms, or the legs at that time—I did not disturb her—I knew there would be a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination, therefore I deferred it till then—on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination we round eight wounds on the scalp, there was a fissure of the skull which extended from the top of the skull right to the base; the bones of the skull were all loosened, and there were several other abrasions and slighter wounds about the body, there was extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, and there was also an extravasation of blood into the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi> from a vessel there—there were no other marks that were likely to arise from the injury—there were several marks on the arms and hands, they were mostly abrasions—I could hardly think they could be caused by a struggle—I could hardly perceive that—there were no marks on the legs—there was a mark on the hip—there were slight marks about that portion of the body—the principal were on the scalp—I afterwards returned to Mr. Watson's room, where I found a glass of this description and a bottle, which were on a chair beside his bed—this phial was on the chest of drawers, it was half full—it holds two drachms; there was a slight drain in the glass, scarcely a drain, apparently the same kind of liquid that there was in the bottle—I did not examine it then—I could only tell by sense of smell at that time, and I had a very severe cold, therefore I went to the chemist's to discover whether he had purchased poison, and he smelt it for me—that was Mr. Lewis, another chemist—I found it to be prussic acid—I was away about five minutes when I went to Mr. Lewis—I then came back again, and went into Mr. Watson's room, he was recovering his consciousness, but he was talking in an inco<lb/>herent way—I spoke to him—I told him that I knew he had taken poison, and I also knew it was prussic acid, and that he had been to the chemist's that morning to purchase some—he did not make any remark at that time, that I remember—I asked him where he had purchased the prussic acid, and he told me then privately, he said he did not wish anyone to know it, he said he did not wish to get the chemist into trouble, and he told me where he had purchased it—I sent for a policeman, and I told him what I had done—I told him there was a policeman in the next room, that he would be given into charge, that he must be aware what it was for—he did not make any reply to that, he simply put up his arms and made an exclamation of that sort, "Ah," but he did not make any remark—I left him then in charge of the police—I returned afterwards—I thought he was not in a fit state to be re<lb/>moved at that time, he had scarcely got over the dose of poison—I returned afterwards; at least I was sent for by the police—the police sur<lb/>geon was there; he wished to see me, to know if he was in a fit state to be removed—we examined the flooring and the spots of blood, in company with the police, the chair in the library, and the woodwork about the window—the window frames were spattered with blood—the prisoner told</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Mr. Watson for many years as head master of the Grammar School at Stockwell—he bore the character of being a gentleman of great learning and classical attainments, and of being a kind and humane man—I always understood that he was very punctual in the performance of his duties as head master of the school—I had never attended him, or had much personal intercourse with him; he has not had much illness, I believe—I had often met him in the street, and three or four months previously I met him at a luncheon, at King's College distri<lb/>bution of prizes—he did not know me at first, he was very absent—he was a very reserved man, and very self-absorbed—when I was called in to see him in this unconscious state, I have no doubt that he had taken poison for the purpose of committing suicide—in my opinion he had taken a dose that might have proved fatal—his skin was clammy, he had the appearance of a man who was seriously suffering from the effects of prussic acid—he was unconscious quite a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I saw him—that would be an effect producible by prussic acid—it has not a narcotic effect; in such a case we arouse the patient, if possible—I did my utmost to call him back to life—he told me that he had taken prussic acid the evening before—he told me that he intended to commit suicide, but there was not enough of it, and he had purchased more that very</p>

               <p>morning, in order to carry out his intention of suicide—if he had purchased prussic acid ten or twelve months before, it would lose its strength, it is highly volatile, the strength evaporates; if he had purchased Scheele's acid twelve months before, and then taken it, it would not have had its effect, it would lose its effect in that time—when I found him returning to consciousness I made inquiries, and found that he had taken prussic acid, when I found him able to understand what I said to him—I really can scarcely recollect what I first said to him, except that I asked him what he had taken—I told him I knew what he had taken—I did not, at that time, tell him that he would he arrested on this charge, not till the policemen came; I told him that they were there—I told him that I knew he had taken prussic acid, before he told me—I told him the police were there to take him, and he knew what the occasion of it was, and he threw up his arms and said "Ah!" or something to that effect—it was just about that time that I suggested to him about a solicitor—his answer was "The deed is done"—he seemed perfectly indifferent—I asked him whether there was any insanity in his family; that was afterwards, at the police—station, in the evening—he said no, he could not say much, for his father and brother were the only two members—he said "My brother was quite sane, but I can't say so much for my father"—at the time he called my attention to the oyster-shell he knew that he was charged with murder, and that the police were in his house; he was getting ready to go—he was particular about brushing his hair and putting on particular boots—at that time he seemed perfectly oblivious to the crime he had committed; he did not allude to it; he conducted him<lb/>self as if nothing of the sort had occurred—he wanted to shave himself; he said, to the police—officer, why could not he shave—the officer did not allow him to do it—the policemen were in the room at the time—I don't know that I can recollect the exact language he used about the oyster, he simply drew my attention to it as a great curiosity, and I examined it—he did not tell me how he bad got it; I rather avoided speaking to him at that time—I asked him afterwards, at the police—station, in the evening, if he had had anything on his mind particularly, and if his means were bad or limited—he said he had sufficient, but that his means were getting exhausted—he said that losing the grammar school had affected him very much, that he had become very much depressed and despondent; that he had been promised another appointment, but it had fallen to the ground—I don't quite remember the expression that he was afraid, at his age, he should not be able to get any appointment—those remarks seemed perfectly genuine, as really exhibiting the state of his mind, owing to the loss of the school—his age is sixty—seven, I understand—most of the wounds on the scalp of the deceased were severe wounds; they indicated very great violence—the other marks on her person were recent—they might be the result of blo<hi rend="italic">Q.;</hi> they were abrasions, or scratches, not the same character as those on the skull—the eight on the scalp were those that were important; they indicated extreme and unusual violence, almost the ferocity of violence—in the course of my experience the disease of insanity has come under my study, with other diseases—insanity is as much a disease as any other known to me as a professional man—it is always treated as a disease, to be cured if possible, and if not to be cured, the patient to be prevented from doing harm if he is liable to do so—there is a well-defined form of insanity called <hi rend="italic">melancholia</hi>—I should say it was rocog<lb/>nised</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201080012"/>
               <p>by every medical man—a sudden shock or calamity falling upon a man would most certainly have a tendency to produce despondency and depression, which might ultimately result in <hi rend="italic">melancholia</hi>—a person suffering under that disease is liable to sudden outbursts and paroxysms of madness—in such a condition he has not the reasoning power which would enable him to distinguish right from wrong, or to understand the nature and quality of the act that he commits, at the time that he commits it; that is my judgment—it is consistent with my experience that after the fit of madness is over they may resume almost their normal state—it is similar to a case of epilepsy; a person may be perfectly well after an attack of epilepsy—I thought Mr. Watson was suffering from epilepsy at the time I saw him—homicidal mania and suicidal mania are recognisable diseases, they very frequently go together; an insane desire to destroy either one's self or somebody else—I have not the slightest doubt that this gentleman attempted to commit suicide by poisoning himself—in forming a judgment as to whether a person was labouring under insanity or no, an attempt to commit suicide would be a fact that I should take into consideration, and in forming a judgment whether a patient were a homicidal maniac or no, the fact of attempting to commit suicide would be an element in my con<lb/>sideration—I have seen the prisoner since; I saw him in Horsemonger Lane Gaol—he then complained to me of having suffered from despondency since he had lost his school and could not obtain employment elsewhere—I don't recollect his saying that at his great age it was almost hopeless to expect that he could ever get any other appointment; he complained that he had been in a despondent state—he said "I wish I had consulted you before"—there are many cases on record of insane persons having sought a lunatic asylum themselves; from my reading I have known of several such instances—the prisoner did not make any allusion to suicide when I saw him at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, he did at the Police Court, previously; he told me that he had contemplated suicide twelve months ago, or rather, I asked him did he contemplate suicide when he purchased the prussic acid, twelve months ago—he did not give me a direct answer—he said he was always of a desponding temperament; he thought he might require it; that was the first that he had taken, the day preceding that on which I saw him, and which he had kept by him for twelve months—the ferocity and violence with which a murder is committed would be a very important element in considering the state of mind of the patient—from what I observed on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, the wounds must have been committed with great ferocity—I have heard the whole of the evidence up to this point.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">proposed, upon this, to ask the witness his opinion of the prisoner's state of mind at the time he committed the act. The question was objected to by the learned Judge, and after being modified in its form, was ultimately put as follo Q.: "From what you have observed in this case, and from the intervie Q. and conversations you had with the prisoner, and from the facts that have come to your own knowledge in the case, are you or are you not of opinion that at the time he committed this act he was in a sound or unsound state of mind</hi>?" <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DENMAN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the question could not be put, it referred to the state of the prisoner's mind at a time when the witness was not present, and in order to ascertain what it was at that time, the witness must necessarily direct his mind, not only to the effect of the intervie Q. he himself had, but to other circumstances deposed to by other witnesses, and thus he would he asked to give his opinions upon the very point which it was the province of the Jury to decide.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BYLES</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">decided that the question could not be put</hi>). In my judgment the prisoner was labouring under great mental de<lb/>pression before he committed this act—after my intervie<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> and conversations with the prisoner, my opinion was, at the time I saw him, that he was suffering from simple melancholia with maniacal excitement—at the time I saw him on the Wednesday, when he was arrested, I believe that he was suffering from the same complaint, simple melancholia with a tendency to maniacal excitement—from my intervie<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> with him, and my own observa<lb/>tion, I believe now that he is not in a sound state of mind—I have no doubt that the loss of his appointment was the principal cause of the melancholy and depression, although I should imagine that he had always been of a melancholic temperament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The last time I examined him, was at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, about six weeks ago, or it might be more, before he came to Newgate—I believe he was then under the medical care of Dr. Waterworth—I did not see him in the presence of Dr. Waterworth—I saw him on every occasion at the Police Court, three times, and once at Horsemonger Lane; except when I saw him at King's College, I had not spoken to him for a year, beyond meeting him in the street and saying "How do you do?"—when I saw him on 11th October, we had some conversation—there was no question that I asked him then to which he did not give a rational answer, he was rational then—he was very morose, he scarcely would answer a question—he said he had prepared a statement for me and he hesitated whether he should give it me or not—I had noticed on previous occasions that he was a person of a somewhat morose demeanour—there was nothing on any of the occasions to show that he did not appreciate and understand the nature of what was going on, in the way of questions put to him, or the business that was then going on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the facts upon which you rely at these intervie<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> thattook place, to induce you to suppose that he was labouring under any form of insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His manner altogether was pecu<lb/>liar, he would scarcely answer a question—he did not answer a question directly—he seemed desponding, and there was that sort of man<lb/>ner about him which is common in melancholia—I do not remember any question in particular that I asked him which he was unwilling to answer—there was a general unwillingness to answer questions—that applies to the occasion of 11th October as well as the subsequent intervie<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>—he did not volunteer the remarks about his means being gradually exhausted, and his loss of the grammar school, and so on, they were simply answers to my questions—it was not given as a continuous statement, but in answer to several questions put by me—he showed no difficulty in understanding the questions themselves, or in bringing his memory to remember the facts—I think that an attempt to commit suicide is of itself evidence of insanity—I do not mean that every person that attempts to commit suicide is insane, nor would I say that every despondency or depression is a token of unsoundness—many persons are despondent and depressed to a very considerable extent, without there being any insanity about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you say that any murder committed with ferocity was an evi<lb/>dence of insanity on the part of the person who committed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend entirely on the extent of the ferocity; I should take that in connection with other things, not of itself, certainly not—it very often is an evidence of insanity, but I would not say it was in every case—I knew</p>

               <p>on the 11th that he was charged with committing this murder—I had seen the body—in the opinion I give, as to his having been insane at the time I saw him, I do not take into account as the principal fact, the murder itself—if there had been no murder I should not have said there were indications from which I should pronounce clearly that he was insane on the 11th—it is a very difficult question to answer—I could not reply to that question quite, because his manner was certainly very peculiar, if he had not com<lb/>mitted a murder I still should have thought his behaviour very strange indeed—my remark has nothing to do with the prussic acid—I speak with<lb/>out the prussic acid, because he was talking incoherently from the effects of the prussic acid before he recovered his senses—I attribute that incoherency to the prussic acid at that time, within half-an-hour after I saw him—I found my opinion of his insanity at that time upon his general manner—I really cannot recall any particular thing he said or did; it was his general manner altogether—I think his saying that he had done the deed showed that he was perfectly callous—hi did not wish to have anyone to defend him—I think that was a sign that he was not in his right senses—he seemed to be perfectly indifferent what would be the result of it to him—that of itself did not strike me as an indication of insanity, but that, with other things, I think, would show that he was not quite sound—from his general demeanour, the whole facts that I have mentioned, taken together, I did not consider him in his right mind at the time—I did not then consider him so—the prussic acid would be one fact—the simple statement that he had done the deed would not be one, but the manner in which it was said—he seemed to be perfectly indifferent—I should lay stress upon the fact of his calling attention to the oyster shell as proof of his indifference—I can<lb/>not recall anything else at present—in the evening, at the police-station, we had a conversation about his having lost the school—that conversation would not indicate insanity, but the fact of his having lost the school, and the circumstances in which he was placed, would form my opinion as to his state of mind—it would make it probable that he would have that state of depression which I believe existed—I had no reason to doubt that he was accurately stating the facts—I think he would be quite capable of doing any act of business down to the time when he committed the act—persons subject to melancholia are at other times quite intellectual—it does not interfere with the intellectual qualities.</p>

I am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">W</hi> division of the police—on Wed<lb/>nesday, 11th October, I went to 28, St. Martin's Road, Stockwell—I found Inspector Davis there—I went up into the prisoner's bedroom—I found him there in bed—Dr. Rugg had been there before me—I asked the prisoner how he felt now—he said better than he hoped or expected to be—I sent for Dr. Rugg, and then went into the room in which the dead body was—I found it in the crouching, huddled up position which has been described—I have this morning had pointed out to me a deal box, which is in Court—I think, with a little compression, the body could have been stowed away in that box—Dr. Rugg and I went together into the room, and examined the glass that was there—I mean the glass that had been drunk from—I waited there until I formed an opinion that he was fit to be moved, and I then authorised Inspector Davis to remove him—Davis said he should apprehend him on a charge of murder, and after doing so I asked him if he would tell him where the coat was which he had worn on that day, as he wished to have it—Mr. Watson objected at first to say where the coat was—he said he did not wish an exhibition made of it—he said "What do you want it for?"—I can't say the exact words—that was the purport of what he said—I left the room almost immediately after that—I afterwards saw him at the station—I heard what passed about his wife's name, and so on, which has been spoken of by the witness—the charge was read over to him—he made no reply—during the whole of that time I saw nothing which led me to come to the conclusion that he was a person of unsound mind—I saw him in the cell that same evening—I then had a conversation with him—I asked him if he required anything, if he had been attended to—he said he had had a cup of tea, that he wanted something to eat—on that occasion I did not notice anything at all about him which indicated that he was of unsound mind—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination with Dr. Rugg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Those were the only times I saw him—when he said "If you wish to make an exhibition of the coat I decline to tell you," I understood him to mean an exhibition before the public—I don't think he meant Madame Tussaud's, or anything of that kind—perhaps it was an odd phrase to use—it did not strike me as particularly odd—I consider he understood the reason the coat was required for, that it was required for the purpose—I have heard that the coat was found hanging up in the dressing-room—I was not aware of that fact when he said that—my opinion now and then would be different—it was a frivolous objection, a stupid sort of thing certainly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am director of the South London School of Chemistry and Pharmacy in Kennington Road—on 20th October I received from Dr. Rugg, in presence of Inspector Davis, two bottles and a glass—this is one of the bottles, and this is the glass—I examined them—the bottle was about half full, it contained a drachm of hydrocyanic acid or prussic acid—this other bottle also contained a small quantity—one bottle was about half full of prussic acid, its strength was 1.08, and a further</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201080018"/>
               <p>fraction, or 1.09 percent.—that is not Scheele's strength—Scheele's acid is variable, it spoils by keeping, it is generally supposed to be twice the strength, it has been known from 3 to 5 percent., it is an uncertain pre<lb/>paration—the bottle was marked "Hydrocyanic acid of Scheele's strength, minimum dose"—they were both alike in strength—there was no chemist's name on the label—in the glass I found no trace of anything; it was not tobe expected on the 20th, on account of the volatile nature of the poison—I received some clothes from Inspector Davis—I examined the coat, it had 132 stains of blood on the outside, chiefly on the left arm and left breast, and twelve stains on the inside—the arm appeared to have been wiped, but in some places there was a clot—there were ninety-five stains of blood on the trousers, and four stains on the drawers—the shirt had very few stains—the wristbands had been cut off—the sleeves had been washed, and when I applied a very delicate test to the place, I found a trace of blood—the waistcoat had about twenty—six stains—they were all round the buttons, and it seemed as if it had been wiped down; but in one direction the stains were just as they had fallen—I found on the sponge, human hair and colored matter, and woollen red and blue, which might have come from a carpet—the sponge was saturated with blood—the longest hair was 9 3/4 in long, light colored, some of it approaching grey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Prussic acid is highly volatile; if opened for a short time the strength goes away to some extent, and if it is exposed to light even it goes away, even with a cork—I made the analysis two days after the 20th—I received it from Inspector Davis and Dr. Rugg; they were both together—the minimum dose of Scheele's acid, and which would produce death, would depend upon its strength, it is such an uncertain preparation—I never knew a sample bought at a druggist's shop to be of full strength—if this had been of full strength, I should not have liked to take a drachm of it—the bottle contained two drachms—supposing it to be of full quality, a drachm would be fatal, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> A drachm of the proper strength would be fatal, but this is only one point, 9, which is less than the pharmacopoeia—it causes death by acting on the heart; it stops the action of the heart, and it is a poison acting both on brain and heart, but principally on the heart—I never saw a person suffering under it; I am an analytical chemist.</p>

I am a trunk—maker, of 219, Clapham Road—on Monday, 9th October, about 12.45, the prisoner came and said he wished to see some trunks—I showed him some—he said they were not quite the thing, he wanted more of a packing—case—I said we could make him one—he was anxious to have it immediately, and asked me how long it would take—he wanted it made 2 ft. 9 in. long, 2 ft. 3 in. wide, and 1 ft. 9 in. deep—he did not, at that time, actually order it, but he was so anxious to have it directly that I thought he was going to try elsewhere, and I sug<lb/>gested that if he let me know by 2 o'clock, I would let him have it next day by that time—he went away, and came back the same day at 1.45, and said he had decided to have the case made—I took the size from him down on paper as he gave it to me, and said "This will be a very large size, Sir; have you any idea of the size it will be?"—he said "Yes, that must be the size"—I suggested whether it would not be better for him to put the matter together that he wished to put into it, and let me measure it, as it was possible I could get it into a lesser space; but he said "No, that must be the size"—I made the case, but did not send it home—this is it</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he came on Tuesday, about 2 o'clock, and said "Do not send me that case in, but I will pay for it"—he handed me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, from which I took 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the value of the case, and handed him the change, or rather I laid it down on the counter and he picked it up, with very great indifference, as it struck me at the time—I said "Do I understand that I am to hold the case until I hear further from you?"—he said something in reply which I could not understand, but I inferred that he meant yes—the case was in my shop at the time the police inquiry took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I noticed a great change in his appearance from Mon<lb/>day, he appeared as a person would who had suddenly fallen into some trouble—I have known him as a customer for several years past—I live very close to him—he had been a customer on several occasions—I did not notice his depression, except on the Tuesday when he came, about 2 o'clock—I knew of his character in the neighbourhood as head master of that school, that it stood very high indeed, and that he was a gentleman of very considerable intellectual attainments—I know that he was dismissed; I understood that the school was broken up—he bore a character generally such as a gentleman bears in the neighbourhood where he is living, not merely for talent, but for humanity and kindness—I had not a son at his school.</p>

I am a chemist, carrying on business at 89, Clapham Park Road—I have known the prisoner twenty years—on Wednesday morning, 11th October, nearer 11 o'clock than 10, I think, the prisoner came in and said he required some prussic acid, and that he should prefer it strong, Scheele's kind—he said he wanted it for medicinal purposes—I advised him not to have Scheele's acid at all, because of its very variable strength, it was not to be depended on—he said he should prefer Scheele's, and I let him have two drachms in a phial like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a two-drachm phial—this other is the original bottle from which it was taken—on 3rd September, 1870, I sold him the same quantity, two drachms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Scheele's acid has been very much prescribed by medical men, but there is a growing decrease; it is not so much prescribed as it used to be, on account of its varying strength—Scheele's prussic acid is supposed to be a strong acid; it should be five percent., but is seldom more than four, sometimes only two—I have known the prisoner twenty years—this purchase was made on Wednesday, 11th October, about 10.30 in the morning—he had not come to me before that morning when he went out before breakfast—I had sold him some on 3rd September, twelve months before—I have got the date in my pocket-book—the impression on my mind is that Mrs. Watson came with him, but I cannot speak positively on that point—I have never heard him spoken of but with the utmost deference and respect—I have always heard of his character as that of a humane and kindly—disposed man, and I always found him spoken of with great esteem as a scholar and a gentleman.</p>

I said—she said "Yes"—Mr. Watson was at the door at that time—he came into the room, and sat on the same side of the drawing—room as I was, opposite Mrs. Watson, and he asked me how my husband was, and how we were getting on—I said we were quite well, and my husband was doing very well—he said "Have Johnson &amp; Son got as many hands on as they gene<lb/>rally have?" (they are my employers; it is a large firm, they have dif<lb/>ferent branches)—I said "Yes, Sir, they are at work day and night, by times; they give a large salary to clever writers"—I told him that they had a part portion taken at the Exhibition, and a great many page boys and young women in the business, selling catalogues—he was very pleased about Johnson &amp; Son's doing well—I forgot to mention the first words, that he was very cross; I thought, when I first came to the door, that he would not ask me in—after the conversation he seemed pleased—I could see a deal in his manner from what he had been towards me, but during the conversation his manner was what it had usually been—I thought he was very fidgetty, sitting—I heard nothing more of the slightest importance said by him while I was in the room—I got up to go, and made my obedience to Mr. and Mrs. Watson, and thanked them for past favours to me and my husband, and he got up and returned it in the most kind and polite manner, and said they would be always glad to hear of our welfare; that is, my husband and I, I believe—I went out into the hall, and Mr. Watson went out—I said "Pray don't come to the door, Sir," as I did not want to give him trouble; so he stood close to the dining-room and drawing-room, and as I turned on the step to close the door I made my <hi rend="italic">obedience</hi> to him, and he returned it with a very cross face—he made a bow as I was on the step—as near as I can tell you, I</p>

Still, not being decided as to leaving at Midsummer, I should ask, if I could stay beyond that time, would you allow me to go on another quarter? Please understand that I may leave at Midsummer or not, but it will be a convenience to know that I can stay another quarter if I have occasion to."—I answered that letter, and gave my consent to his leaving at any time at a quarter's notice—on 23rd May, I received this letter—"May 23rd, 1871.

Under these circum<lb/>stances I was going to ask of you to show us an indulgence for a time. It has occurred to me that, as the house must be unoccupied for a quarter to be done up, you would not be particular as to our staying a little beyond the stated time.

               <p>answer to that in return, dated 17th October, which I handed to Mr. Fraser—it was written some time after the notice, because he knew that there would be a meeting of the committee immediately after the 17th, and he wrote accordingly—it is a representation on his part to be laid before the committee—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 1870, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to the committee of the school, stating that their resolution had taken him greatly by surprise, as he thought that, considering the long time he had conducted the school, and the way in which he had endeavoured to maintain, its cha<lb/>racter and excellence, the committee would have allowed him some communica<lb/>tion with them, after which he might, if necessary, have tendered his resigna<lb/>tion; he complained that the notice was accompanied by no expressions of concern, or any single word to soften it, and stated that, so far from any accusation having been brought against him, the committee had in the pre<lb/>vious July congratulated the proprietors on the "untiring exertions of the highly talented head master.". He enquired what he had done during the last few months to cause the committee to withhold all confidence from him, and requested to be allowed to tender his resignation</hi>,)—The parts of that letter which are underscored were so when it was written—he was in the habit of underscoring his letters—that is, the part about the untiring exer<lb/>tions of the highly-talented head-master—no accusation of misconduct had been brought against him in any way—during the time of his being head<lb/>master of the school a few complaints have been made against him—a com<lb/>plaint is an accusation in one sense—there has been no accusation what<lb/>ever made against him by the committee—as secretary, I had constant opportunities of observing the general manner and demeanour of the man—there was nothing to distinguish him from other people in regard to his general demeanour—he was rather more reserved than some people, but nothing remarkable. I have seen appearances of ebullition of temper, but I never saw an outbreak of temper. I saw him within about a fortnight of the time this event occurred, within a few days, more or less—I casually met him in an omnibus, and conversed with him for half-an-hour nearly; we rode together—I noticed then nothing in his demeanour from what I noticed when he was master of the grammar school, but it struck me that he had aged a great deal since he had left the school.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated November</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to the proprietors of the school, in which he very fully reviewed the state of its finances, and proposed that the proprietors might relieve themselves from all existing and future liabilities by allowing the school to pass into other hands, and offered to negociate for the lease of the premises, for the sum at which it was valued in the late</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Report of the Committee to the Proprietors" and to relieve the proprietors from all liability from the next Christmas.</hi>) That negociation fell through, it was not responded to by the committee; they thought the amount he offered was not large enough—they did not absolutely repudiate it, but considered that the terms were not good enough for them to accept—the prisoner was permitted by the committee to take boarders, who were pupils at the school—in 1867 the pupils pre<lb/>sented him with a silver salver, I think it was in July, after he left the school—this address (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was presented to him by the pupils, and a purse of guineas, to which I gave something, but I never saw the result of the collection—at that time the school was in a very flourishing condition indeed—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing.</p>

               <p>

I am solicitor to Mr. Watson—I produce a certificate of his baptism, showing that he was baptized in Crayford Church, in the year 1804—I produce also his marriage certificate, at St. Mark's Church, Dublin, on 2nd January, 1856, to Annie Armstrong—I also produce a gold medal—he was gold medallist of the Dublin University—I also pro<lb/>duce certain letters written by Mr. Watson to Miss Armstrong before the marriage—the first letter is December 4th, 1844—there are five or six—I found these letters in Mrs. Watson's bedroom, tied up in her satin gown—(<hi rend="italic">The letters were read as follo Q.:</hi>—" 12, New Park Road, Stockwell, Surrey, Wednesday, December 4th. Madam. I must entreat you to pardon the liberty which I take in addressing to you this note. You have known me only from having seen me some years ago at Mrs. Curran's, in Marlborough Street, when I was attending the College; you may, perhaps, have for<lb/>gotten me, but I still recollect you. I am now in orders, and head master of the Proprietary Grammar School here. When I know that you have received this I should wish to say something more, if you will allow me to write to you a second time. I need not beg of you to favour me with an immediate reply, for I am sure you will have the kindness and politeness to do so. I have the honour to be, Madam, with the highest esteem and respect, your very obedient servant, J. S. Watson. To Miss Armstrong."—" Decem<lb/>ber 9th. Madam, I have to thank you for your obliging letter, which I received this morning. I knew nothing of you when I saw you at Mrs. Curran's, but that you were a lady who had lost her fortune. That you have since been doing what you mention I was aware. You were always re<lb/>garded by me as a lady of great excellence. Had I been able soon after leaving college to establish myself as I wished, I had it in my mind to make you a proposal of marriage. It may now be too late. Nor should I, however you may receive this intimation, wish you to consider that I have done so until we have again met. In the meantime, I may give you some little notion how I am situated here. Though I have the title of head master, I cannot say that I have all the emolument which J could desire attendant on it. My income is something more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but without a house. I may perhaps in time find some means of increasing it a little. Boarders, by the condition of my appointment, I am not allowed at present to take; but that is a restriction which I may possibly get removed at length. The neighbourhood of London I like, and there are greater facilities for adding to income near town than in the country. I am of very humble birth, and have been obliged to make my way in the world by my own efforts. I have a few relatives living in an humble station, but none that would in<lb/>terfere with my domestic affairs. This is sufficient for me to say at present. I have to beg your indulgence for having said so much. Whatever you think of this, you will, I am sure, oblige me at once with the straight for<lb/>ward</p>

               <p>answer of a woman of sense. Believe me to be, Madam, with the most perfect esteem, your very obedient servant, J. S. Watson.")—"Decem<lb/>ber 13. Madam. I had the pleasure of receiving your very sensi<lb/>ble letter just now. I have only time to write a few lines in reply. As you do not discourage me, I will say that I think it possible that I may cross over to Dublin about Christmas for a few days. I shall have but a fortnight at my disposal, and should not be able to leave this place before to-morrow week. Will you have the kindness to write on the receipt of this, and say whether, in the event of my coming, I might be allowed to see you where you are now residing? I am certain that I can have but little personal attraction in your eyes, and perhaps you will think that any altera<lb/>tions which may have taken place in my appearance since you saw me has not been for the better. You do not appear displeased with my prospects, but when I reflect that there is nothing—or very little—but prospect (for I have not been settled here long enough to lay by anything, having received my appointment only last July), I am almost afraid to venture. I am liv<lb/>ing in apartments, because I cannot afford to take a house; and yet I can<lb/>not but think that, with a person of your (as I judge) staid, quiet, and domestic habits, there would be no fear. Believe me to be, Madam, very faithfully and obediently yours, J. S. Watson." "Saturday. Madam I have just received your second (that is, third) letter. Pray write to me as often as you please, without entreating my pardon for doing so. To what I said yesterday I would just add that I write to you as if you were pretty much your own mistress, as at your age and with the travels which you have experienced through the world, it may be expected that you are. I believe that you are residing with a relation, but whether you have any relations in England, especially in London, with whom it would be to any purpose for me to communicate, I have not the least notion. I think it well to say that my mother is alive, and (with a sister) will probably for some time look to me for a little assistance. I have also two brothers in 'the valleys of life,' but, having been early separated from my parents, and brought up by a grandfather, and put into quite a different track in the world, I maintain but little connections with my relatives except by occa<lb/>sional letters. All that I should deduct from my own income would not be more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which would still leave, if the school continues to flourish, more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a consort and myself. My fixed salary is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with 4 guineas a year on every boy above 71, and there have been 90 in the school this quarter. It is a very populous and increasing neigh<lb/>bourhood, and a school of the kind is much wanted in it, so that I trust all will go on well. They are all at present day boys. My hours of work are from nine till twelve, and from two till five, with one or two half-holi<lb/>days in the week, and a month of freedom at Midsummer. This Christmas I hoped to get three weeks, but I can only get a fortnight. I do not know whether you have any conception what a proprietary grammar school is, but the management of the funds and so on is in the hands of a committee of proprietors, who have a control over me so far as to see that I do not break the rules. I should conceive that your parents are both dead, and that you have no brothers or sisters, or that, if you have any, they are at a distance from you. I have not forgotten the game at draughts, in which you did me the honour of beating me. Believe me to be, very faithfully and obediently yours, John Selby Watson." "Wednesday. Dear Madam. I have just had the pleasure of receiving your letter of Monday.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201080032"/>
               <p>I have written so much in the last note which I sent, but which you had probably not received when you wrote, that I need only, I think, be brief at present. I do not know Dr. Connor, nor would it, perhaps, be of any use for me to say anything to him until we have met, after which I may be happy to make his acquaintance. Do not think that you need to say much about your family to me, who am of no family. I hope to be in Dublin by Sunday or Monday next, but a fortnight's absence from home is the utmost that I can command. What you say concerning your taking lodgings makes me believe that you must have much of that independence of spirit which I always supposed you to possess. You have told me that your hand shook, but not why. Trusting that I shall find you well when I have the pleasure of seeing you, yours, I remain, most sincerely, John Selby Watson." Friday. Dear Madam. As to being 'angry' with you, as your humour is to express it, that, I trust can never happen. I am very glad that you have written so often. I do not see what purpose it would serve to write to your aunt, as I said before, with respect to your cousins, until we have seen each other. You say that you have something to communicate to me, personally, more fully than you think proper to write, and it had struck me that in your last letter—to say nothing of what you have expressed before—you speak with much emphasis of having had much to annoy you, and of being of great anxiety of mind. Now I earnestly beg of you, that if you have had anything more particularly than mere labour for a subsistence to trouble you—if anything has happened to you to lie heavy upon your mind—if anything has been either done by yourself, or said or done by others, to cause you vexation and throw you into despondency, you will when we meet tell me honestly and fully what it is. It is long since I saw you, certainly more than seven years, and I know not, at least know but im<lb/>perfectly, how, during that period, your time has been passed. It will be difficult to make me believe that it has been spent otherwise than honourably to yourself, and I should have hoped that the result would have been self-satisfaction and cheerfulness of mind. Forgive me, dear Miss Armstrong, that I write this; you have only to burn it, and give me an answer when I have the happiness of meeting you, for it will be a happiness to me, what-ever you say to me, to see once more that dear face which I once so much admired, and which I thought—and think now—far above anything to which I had or have any personal pretensions to aspire. I have no right, in the present stage of our acquaintance, to write thus freely to you, but you must pardon me. I know something of the world, and I know what unpleasant things you, as you have been living, may have been exposed to; but I again say to you that I entreat you not to conceal anything from me, but to tell me any which you have to tell as freely and as fully as you would tell the friend in whom you most trust either of your own sex or the opposite. Of anything which you may have to tell you will find me a most lenient judge, for I have too many faults of my own not to be an easy censor of those of others. I said that I admired you, yet I have been un<lb/>faithful to your image in my memory. I will tell you when we see each other. This will be another thing which you will have to forgive. 'From the sublime to the ridiculous there is but one step.' A fool of a hairdresser has cut my hair too short. You must guess why I care about this. Believe me that all the liberties which I have taken in writing thus to you have been taken with the warmest regard to yourself, a regard which, I hope, will never be diminished, but that I shall still be always yours sincerely,</p>

I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and rector of Chatsfield, Kent—in September last my curate was absent temporarily, and I communicated with Mr. Ingram, who keeps a register of clergymen to do temporary duty, to get a clergyman to take my curate's place—I was not in very good health then, and not equal to duty at all; certainly not to doing whole duty, two full services—Mr. Watson was recom<lb/>mended to me, and I communicated with him, and received a letter from him, stating that he would come and take part of my duty—the letter is lost—it was in September, 1871, just one month before the murder was committed—I had not known or heard of Mr. Watson before—the duty I intended him to perform was very likely none at all; it would depend upon how I felt on Sunday morning—he came down on Sunday morning, and I had not then made up my mind what part of the service I would ask him to take—he was rather nervous when I met him in the vestry, but nothing to remark particularly—nothing occurred in church which would throw any light upon his state of mind—he said one prayer in the morning-service, which is not generally used; a prayer for all sorts and conditions of men, but it was a mistake, which might occur to any man—he was very weak and weary, and listless—I should have asked him to take part in the Com<lb/>munion service, but his voice was so dreary and listless that I preferred taking the whole myself, though it was Sacrament Sunday—at the conclu<lb/>sion of the service I walked home with him—my house is about a quarter of a mile from the church—I soon found that he was labouring from extreme depression of mind or body, or both, which showed itself in a gloomy silence, which continued throughout the day, and a total want of interest in any subject whatever, or in anything which was going on about him—I endeavoured during lunch to interest him in conversation; both I and my wife endeavoured to try to get him to talk, but I do not think he originated a single observation himself, and in answer to any remark or question of mine he replied wholly in monosyllables, "Yes," or "No"—this depression of manner continued during the day—it seemed to me that it was an effort for him to speak—there was no afternoon service; an evening service at 6.30, I think, or 6 o'clock—in consequence of what I observed in Mr. Watson, his depression and listlessness, I told him, after luncheon, that I thought that I was quite as equal as he was to preaching, and therefore I would take the sermon myself, and I did—he read the prayers—I observed the same weakness of voice—after the evening service, he returned to the rectory and dined with us—there was no change at all</p>

                  </hi>. I am vicar of St. Andrew's, Stockwell—the prisoner and his wife have had sittings at my church for about the three last years—I have known the prisoner more than ten years, and saw him very frequently to speak to—no man could have a higher character for kindness and humanity—on 3rd November I visited him in Horsemonger Gaol—he asked me to go—I had been before—I did not communicate with his advisers—I was with him about three-quarters of an hour—I first of all observed that he had quite forgotten that he had sent for me, and when he did begin to talk it seemed to me that his conversation was in intelligence very unlike what I had heard from him before; as, for instance, at the beginning he said that he thought if he had opened his mind to me before, perhaps he might have taken a different course—I observed also that he did not continue long talking on one subject, which was very unlike what had been usual with him; he passed rapidly from one subject to another without much connection—that was not his habit at all, formerly—as an illustration, he spoke about the inquest, "that horrible inquest," and in the middle of the conversation about it he said "They won't let me shave here"—I observed also what struck me as a singular absence of remorse for his fault, for his crime, which was strange in a man of religious habits; he was full of anxiety and trouble, but it was all about the dismantling of his house, so that he should have no place to go back to, and the sale of his library—he said that he was very hardly dealt with—I mentioned that the Bishop had highly commended a Latin letter which he had written to him, and he said "Here is a man who the Bishop of Winchester can highly commend, and they have shut him up in a place like this"—he was laying out a plan for writing an essay on the union of Church and State, and he did not know how he should do it without his books, and he hoped the authorities of the gaol would help him in the matter—it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am M.D. of the University of London—I have paid great attention to the disease of insanity, and have written a work on the physiology and pathology of mind—I was lecturer at St. Mary's Hos<lb/>pital, on the subject of insanity—I was at one time resident physician of a lunatic asylum at Manchester, where there were usually 100 patients of the middle classes—I visited the prisoner first on 27th November, for the purpose of ascertaining, if I could, the state of his mind—I was with him for an hour, and conversed with him during that time, and at the end of the interview formed the opinion that he was not of sound mind—that was the conclusion I came to—I believe he is suffering from melancholia, the symp<lb/>toms I observed in him were such as in my opinion would follow an attack of melancholia—I found that his age was sixty-seven or sixty-eight, and in a person of that age melancholia would have greater effect and force than in a younger person—I heard Dr. Shepherd examined, and I agree with him in the main in the description he gives of melancholia, but there were certain other points—a person suffering from melancholia is liable to outbursts of mad violence, and while those outbursts prevail his mind is diseased; gone; his reason is in abeyance, and he is nearly unconscious of what he is doing; his mind decidedly deranged—after such an attack of disease the mind sometimes regains comparatively its tone; that is a matter in which I agree with Dr. Shepherd entirely—the mind may be restored within an hour after such an attack, decidedly in some cases, and before the very act itself he might appear calm and comparatively rational—I mean by comparatively, that his conversation would be coherent and rational—in the course of my experience I have known patients suffering from this disease, and who have exhibited violence under it—it is a disease accompanied by dangerous pro<lb/>pensities; it is not so much homicidal as suicidal—I concur with Dr. Shepherd; if I was called to a patient who had exhibited both homicidal and suicidal propensities, that would form a very strong element, in my judgment, that he was of unsound mind—supposing a person is labouring under melancholia, a slight provocation, or a provocation of any kind, will have a powerful effect in exciting the disease within him—I know that, as a cause of melancholia, a violent shock to the mind, owing to a sudden calamity, has occurred, no doubt; melancholia makes a</p>

               <p>progress to its height, and then it may decline—it is months lurking in the brain—it usually comes on gradually—supposing a patient exhibits great depression immediately after sustaining some loss, and the depression con<lb/>tinued, that would be an element in my judgment that his mind was gradually getting unsound—the length of time would vary very much in different cases and different temperaments—old age would decidedly be less likely to combat such depression—one of the symptoms of melancholia is self-absorption—a patient may be in his right mind both before and after an attack of madness—after the paroxysm of violence was over he might appear sane, and he might be so—melancholia is a disease which yields to curable treatment; it depends very much on the age of the patient; I take the element of great age into account—callousness, and apparent indiffer<lb/>ence to the nature of the crime committed by a patient labouring under melancholia is a thing upon which I should form a judgment; it is very common after an act of violence done in a state of insanity—the prisoner exhibited callousness and indifference in the interview I had with him—it frequently happens that an act of violence committed by a person of un<lb/>sound mind is much more extreme than it would be if he were a sane person—in judging whether a person is of sound mind or not, I should take into consideration the nature of the act committed, and the circumstances under which it was committed—I should form a regular diagnosis of the disease, as I should in any other, and inquire into the history of the pa<lb/>tient, the circumstances under which he had lived, and so on—if he had never exhibited any symptoms of violence, unkindness, and inhumanity before, that would be an element of consideration—I remember the ques<lb/>tions you put to Dr. Shepherd with reference to suicidal acts on the part of patients labouring under melancholia—I don't agree with him in the answers which he gave—suicide by an insane person may be entirely im<lb/>pulsive, as well as crafty—I understood Dr. Shepherd to say it was not so in such cases—persons suffering from melancholia are sometimes aware that they are liable to homicidal and suicidal propensities—I have had experi<lb/>ence of it in some cases—I had a patient of my own who told me that he would do it unless we took care of him, and it ended by his doing it—he was under certificate as an insane person, and under the charge of attend<lb/>ants—the instance of Charles Lamb and his sister is a well-known instance—that was homicidal madness, Miss Lamb killed her father—method and design is very commonly exhibited by the insane, and the concealment of an act is very frequent; I mean of an act committed whilst in a state of insanity—he employs means of concealment which he imagines will have the effect—I was very much impressed, at my interview with the prisoner, at the entire indifference which he displayed with regard to the crime, and the position in which he was placed.</p>

I am sorry to say there are a great many omissions in my work which has been referred to—melancholia is a form of madness distinct from melancholy in the ordinary sense of the word—it is a morbid, that is to say, a diseased state of mind, which is a morbid aggravation of ordinary melancholy—I should not call simple depression of itself a diseased state of mind; to a great extent, it certainly might be melancholia—the characteristic of melancholia, by which I mean the disease melancholia, is in its early stage profound depression, without anything more, as far as the mental symptoms are concerned—in judging whether depression amounted to melancholia, the fact of whether it was</p>

               <p>founded on reasonable grounds or not should be taken into consideration—a person who had suffered great disappointment or loss might be very greatly depressed, and that might be a cause of melancholia—my experience is in all the cases that have come under my personal observation, I have always found some evidences of insanity before the crime or the violence, but I wish to qualify that observation by saying that there are cases recorded by the highest authorities in which no such symptoms are to have been observed—the homicidal impulse must have preceded the homicidal act—I object to adopting the term homicidal impulse as a disease by itself—I hold it to be but a symptom of the disease, like other symptoms—I adopt the expression "impulsive insanity" as a subdivision of the general term of what we call "affective insanity," affecting the passions, feelings, and propensities—a sudden offence of a homicidal character committed under the influence of melancholia would not fall under the head of impulsive insanity—I believe you are examining me from my book, so, perhaps, I may be allowed to explain that it would fall under the division in that book of "melancholia simplex"—that is one of the varieties of affective insanity—" melancholia simplex "might exist without any act of homicidal violence, but it is exactly in that form of mental disease which we call melancholia sim<lb/>plex that homicidal and suicidal acts are especially apt to occur—I have already said that in my experience I have never known a case without pre<lb/>monitory symptoms, but that cases have been recorded—the case of Miss Lamb, I think, was an exceedingly sudden case—it was after the murder that she desired to be restrained—the murder was done suddenly, at the first outbreak of her insanity—she had several subsequent attacks during the rest of her life, and it was during those subsequent attacks that that occurred to which Mr. Sergeant Parry has alluded—I would not undertake to say that there was no evidence of insanity in her case before—I am not sufficiently familiar with the case to know whether there were premonitory symptoms or not—I think at the time I saw Mr. Watson in Newgate, if I had put the question to him whether the act which he had committed was wrong, he would have said it was a wrong act—I believe that he was perfectly conscious that he had done a wrong act—that was the only occa<lb/>sion on which I saw him, on 27th November—the interview lasted about an hour—I have not said that the homicidal tendency from melancholia usually comes on gradually—the melancholia comes on gradually, the homi<lb/>cidal impulse is a sudden act, very much like a convulsion—the depression leading to melancholia, I think, does come on gradually generally, and it increases gradually, if the disease is increasing—it goes on in intensity until some outburst—it varies very much—a melancholic patient may be one day comparatively well, and next day he may be deeply depressed, and so week by week there are variations—it may vary according to the bodily state of health—when I say the prisoner appeared indifferent, I mean that he really did not seem to realise the quality of the act, and the terrible nature of the position in which he was placed in con<lb/>sequence—I pointed out to him the nature of the act, and what it really implied, and its possible consequence; he knew that perfectly well, but his tone and manner was one of such indifference that a man might have had if he had been speaking of an act that really did not seriously concern him—he did not say anything to me about wishing he had sent for a medical man before—he spoke about his wife—I asked him about the events that had immediately preceded the crime, and he said very much as</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians—I have, for about sixteen or seventeen years, entirely devoted my time and attention to the study of insanity—I have written a book upon "insanity and its treatment"—I am lecturer on psychological medicine at the school of St. George's Hospital, I am also visiting physician at Blackland's and Otto House lunatic asylums, private asylums of the late Dr. Sutherland, one is for ladies the other for gentlemen—I have, in company with Dr. Maudsley, examined Mr. Watson—I agree with Dr. Maudsley that there is a well known form of insanity called melancholia—when a person of advanced age becomes insane, that is, very often, the form of insanity which attacks him, more often perhaps than any other form—when a very self-absorbed and reserved man becomes insane, that may be the form of madness which it takes—a sudden shock, such as loss of fortune, or position, may bring it on; it has a particular tendency towards suicide, and also in a certain number of cases combines homicide, suicide in the majority of cases—persistent attempts at suicide would be an element in considering whether a patient was insane or not—the first symptom of melancholia is an alteration in the general demeanour and character, and appearance very often, of the individual, that alteration being, generally speaking, accompanied with marks of depression, both mental and bodily—an alteration to any extent after a considerable shock, the person ageing considerably, would arouse suspicions and cause consideration of the person's condition, in the mind of a medical man; I mean an alteration, not only in appearance, but in the general bearing and mental condition—there is very often a stage of alteration before there is anything which one could call absolute insanity—sleeplessness is one of the symptoms of disturbed brain in almost all forms of insanity—if I found that sleeplessness did not yield to treatment by morphia, and continued for weeks, I should think it a very serious symptom—in such a disease I think one ought to gain every possible infor<lb/>mation that one can concerning a patient, the antecedents of his own, life, and the antecedents of his family—if he developed homicidal tendencies, the mode in which the act was committed, and the amount of violence</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said that suicide is an indication of insanity; would an attempt at suicide after a homicide be as strong an indication of insanity as an attempt at suicide without any attempt at homicide? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think one must look at the whole of the facts of the case before one could give an opinion upon it; so far as I can <hi rend="italic">give</hi> a medical opinion upon it, I don't think it would make any difference, it is really a question I can hardly answer—in the case of an ordinary individual who had committed a murder there might of course be a motive for suicide, which would not exist in the case of a person who had not committed a murder; I did not know whether you were putting the question to me in connexion with insanity, that was my difficulty in answering—in the case of an ordinary individual committing suicide, it would depend to a considerable extent upon whether there had or had not been a homicide previously committed—when I gave the original answer as to suicide, I was thinking of insane patients—I said that suicide would be an element in forming a judgment whether a person was insane or not—I don't know whether I spoke of the absence of remorse for a crime especially in connexion with melancholia, it is a sign in insanity generally, they very often seem perfectly indifferent to having committed it—there was a good deal said in the conversation with the prisoner with reference to the crime—his whole manner indicated anything but sorrow for it—the impression that he gave me was that he regretted that the whole circum<lb/>stance had occurred, but he did not appear to exhibit anything like remorse for it—I am not sure whether I asked the question—I think something was said about the act, whether the exact expression was, whether he was sorry for it or not, I am not quite certain; I think something was said to that effect, I can't recollect the exact words of his answer, but the impression he gave me was, as I have said, that he regretted that the whole occurrence had happened, but he seemed indifferent to it as regards any special feeling of remorse; he did not burst into tears or anything of that sort, very far from it; there was a degree of one might almost say cheerfulness about the way in which he talked of it, which struck me particularly—I should imagine that he knew the object of our visit—I am not certain whether he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187201080043"/>
               <p>knew that I came at Mr. Fraser's instigation—Mr. Fraser was not present—I won't be positive whether I told him so or not, or whether Dr. Maudsley did—I don't think I did—Dr. Maudsley and I are well acquainted—I assisted him in the book that has been referred to, I looked over some of the sheets—I have written a book on the same subject—I have expressed dissatisfaction with the law as laid down by the Judges on the question of the knowledge of right and wrong—I have said "Such questions are totally irrelevant and beside the issue, which is, was he of unsound mind when he committed it?"—I agree that in cases of homicidal impulse under melan<lb/>cholia, or any form of madness, there is almost always, if not quite always, evidence of general mental derangement before the act, but I would add "supposing there are opportunities for observing it," because it very often happens that insanity may have existed, but there may have been no op<lb/>portunities of recognising it by those who are capable of recognising it—I think I state that also in my book—it would be true to say that of fifty-two cases referred to by an emminent authority, Dr. Gray, there was manifest insanity in all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By manifest insanity you mean evidence of insanity, in<lb/>dependent of the act and prior to the act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I don't know whether Dr. Gray says: "prior to the act," I don't think he does—he had them under his observation in the asylum.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DENMAN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read the passage, in case you may wish to qualify it: "On examining the recorded examples of homicidal impulse with all the cases to which the theories of impulsive insanity are cheifly applied, we shall find that in almost all that are reported in such detail as to be worthy of notice; and many are not, there was or had been general mental derangement; of the fifty-two cases reported by Dr. Gray, there was manifest insanity in all. I quote from Caspar. Marc has collected eight cases of so<lb/>called homicidal mania; there is however not one among them in which general mental disease did not indubitably exist"—There is a good deal more to the same effect, and you end by saying: "In many cases there would be no need to have recourse to the theory of impulsive insanity, many cases so called are cases of patients suffering from melancholia." Do you wish to qualify that passage in any way? I have read it in order that you may see I am not quoting it against yourself. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think I have anything to qualify in it—I do not consider this is a case of impulsive, insanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There is nothing there that shakes the opinion that I have given to-day in this case—<hi rend="italic">The following passage was read to the witness</hi>:—" But in a Crown case you are asked if the prisoner knew what he was doing when he committed the crime, and if he knew right from wrong, and such questions, which are totally irrelevant and beside the issue, which is, was he of sound mind when he committed it; I shall have to refer to this again, but I mention it here in as much as the proof of insanity in criminal cases must be stronger than in others, and this must be borne in mind by all of us who may be called upon to give evidence." I have borne that in mind in giving my evidence to-day.</p>

I am a physician, of Scotland, a member of the College of Surgeons, and of the Apothecaries' Company—I have been in the profession nearly thirty years—I was for twelve years in charge of the infir<lb/>mary of the Strand Union—in the course of my practice I have made insanity a study, and made myself acquainted with it—I have seen a great many cases, and certified to a great many insane persons before the Magis<lb/>trate—that was a part of my duty; they have been persons who came into the hands of the police for some criminal offence—I have had the oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing the prisoner five times; once in Horsemonger Lane Gaol, and four times in Newgate—I agree with what Dr. Maudsley and Dr. Blandford have stated—from my observation of the prisoner at those five visits I believe him to be of unsound mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. The form of insanity he is suffering under is melancholia—I first saw him on 11th November—Mr. Fraser, the prisoner's solicitor, requested me to go and see him—I have known Mr. Fraser since he was a child—I practice in Dean Street, Soho, and Mr. Fraser lives opposite to me—he asked me to go and see Mr. Watson, knowing from my previous position that I had seen a great deal of insanity—he was suffering from melancholia—that is very different to low spirits—a person may be low-spirited and yet in sound health—a person who has melancholia has something the matter with his brain, in addition—the prisoner had not any delusions that I noticed—it would be a difficult thing to describe the difference between extreme low spirits and melancholia, because in melancholia you have an exaggeration of extreme low spirits—a man who is low-spirited may pass on into melancholia, and he may pass out of it—the difference between melancholia and low spirits is as I tell you; low spirits may arise from a transient affection of the mind, perhaps arising from a disordered state of body, or a transient trouble, which the mind is strong enough to resist; but melancholia is a disease where the mind has given way; there is some defect of the brain structure, or some<lb/>thing of that kind—the first thing that I noticed about the prisoner was this, I put him in a good light, in the cell at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, and I watched his countenance while talking to him, and I noticed that he had a dazed appearance of the eye when his countenance was at rest—he was lost—there was an expressionless appearance about his countenance, a lost look about the face when the countenance was at rest—he showed, as the other wit<lb/>nesses have said, great indifference to the condition of things, a singular indifference—I don't mean that he was hopeless as to the result of the trial—I will give you an instance of what I mean—I was talking to him about the affair generally, with a view of leading him on to make some remarks, and in the midst of it he saw a piece of flue on his trousers, or something, and he put his hand and picked it off, and jumped up and gave himself a shake down in a manner that struck me as very singular in a man I was talking to—I should have looked at it as a piece of rudeness in an ordinary individual, but in his particular case I looked at it as really evidence of a want of mind—he was guilty of what I considered irrational conduct in that one act that I have spoken of—then there was another thing, he told me he thought he was entitled to consideration for what he had done in the past, which certainly appeared to me to be a very irrational thing, seeing that he had only kept a school—my treatment for melancholia would be to</p>

               <p>send the patient away from the place where he had become the subject of it; to make a radical change in his habits; to give him an opportunity of amusement, if it were a lady I should encourage her to dance, if a gentle<lb/>man I should try to give him some musical amusement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a man were suffering from low spirits or melancholia, from loss of employment, in consequence of the badness of trade, for instance, would not the best treatment be to find him a situation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend on the condition into which he had merged—if he had become a decided melancholic, you must get him well before you put him into a situation, or he would bring you into discredit—I referred to the crime itself—he said that something was said to him and he became angry, and did what he did—he did not say what it was that was said to him; something was said to him by his wife which made him angry, and then he did the deed, I think it was he said—I subsequently heard what he did it with—I can't tell whether he told me before—I was present at three examinations, where it came out, and therefore, whether it came to me direct or not I can't say—it was not at that examination, certainly—I did not ask him where he got the pistol from, but it was asked in my presence, and the remark was made that it had belonged to his grandfather—he did not say where he had fetched it from, or how he had got it—I saw him four times in Newgate—Mr. Gibson, the surgeon, was present each time, and the third time I saw him Dr. Shepherd drew my particular attention to the difficulty he had in collecting his thoughts—he did not tell me anything of the circumstances that occurred after he had committed the deed—in a light and frivolous manner he told me, at Newgate, how he attempted to commit suicide in Horsemonger Lane Gaol; and it so struck me, the light and frivolous way in which he told me the story, as if it in no way referred to himself, that I put to him what appeared to me this crucial question: "How could you, as a Christian minister, dare to rush into the presence of your God, unpre<lb/>pared," and he said, "There is no prohibition against suicide, the law only applies to murder"—I thought that, coming from a clergyman, was not an evidence of sanity, quite the reverse—I did not auk him what it was his wife had done or said that made him angry; it was asked in my presence, and he made no answer—I believe he shook his head; I am not certain—he may have said "I can't say"—I think he said something of this kind, that she had provoked him on previous occasions, and that they had had quarrels—he stated that in his paper—I am in a difficulty about whether he said it then or not, because I saw him so many times; whether he said it to me, or in my hearing, I can't say—I heard a remark of the kind, certainly—I forget the exact words—it was something to the effect that she had irritated him at various times, and he had restrained himself; he said he had lost control over himself on this occasion—he may have said he was in a passion; I don't recollect that he made use of that word—he did not say that at first, after the committal of the deed, he did not know what to do—I did not refer to his attempting to commit suicide on the Tuesday night—I never once referred to it, that I am aware of; there was no conversation about it—I was leading on to that, to ask him about it—I don't remember a separate conversation with reference to the suicidal attempt on the Tuesday night—yes, by-the-bye, now I do remember that some questions were put by Mr. Gibson with reference to the prussic acid he had taken, and he said that he thought that prussic acid was so strong that any dose of it would kill him—I don't remember that anything was said in my</p>

               <p>presence by him as to his attempt at suicide on the Tuesday night—I did ask him a question about the box—I think I said "What did you want the box for?" or "How did you come to order the box?" and he shrugged his shoulders and said something to the effect that it was not for the purpose that was assumed—I did not speak to him about his trial—I said nothing to him individually as to whether he was to be defended on the ground of insanity—the two Crown physicians, when they attended at Newgate, inti<lb/>mated to him the purpose for which they had come—he made an observa<lb/>tion to me about Broadmoor, at Newington—I asked him what put that idea into his head—I forget the exact purport of the observation, but he made some observation about Broadmoor—he told me voluntarily, I believe, that the chaplain over there had mentioned something to him about being sent to Broadmoor—the idea never crossed my mind—nothing further was said about it—I dropped the question—I thought it was not a proper one—the prisoner did not say anything about his being confined in the asylum at Broadmoor, if he was acquitted on the ground of insanity—I tell you I dropped the conversation, I thought it was improper—he never said a word to me about his trial, that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>

I am a labourer, and live at Ruislip—I have known the prisoner for some years—on the night of 18th December, about 10 o'clock, I was in the parlour of the White Bear, kept by Mrs. Weedon—there was some conversation about taking her cart to Uxbridge—the prisoner was too tipsy to go with it—he was <hi rend="italic">chaffed</hi> about it afterwards—I began joking him about it; he got angry and went into the tap-room and sat down—I went into the tap-room, and he said "You b—, you want to black my face"—many of us have blacked his face sometimes when he has been tipsy; I have not—he said he would fetch a stick, and dash my brains out—he went out directly—I followed him, and came up to him about ten or twelve yards off, and I pretended to black his face—I had got no black—I just rubbed my hand over his face—he objected to that—we had a little scuffle, and in the scuffle my hat fell off—I then went back to the house without my hat—I came back again in about ten minutes or quarter of an hour—the prisoner had then got my hat on his head, and a stick in his right hand—I went up to him as quickly as I could, and got hold of him by the collar, and caught hold of his right hand to prevent his hitting me with the stick—he had not made any gesture to strike me—as I took my hat off his head, and put it on my own I felt some sharp instru<lb/>ment come down the collar, and my waistcoat, and right down my arm—it did not cut my neck, it caught me on my arm and on my wrist-bone, just as I was drawing my hand away—both my arm and wrist bled a good deal—I got very faint, and Mrs. Weedon let me in—it was about 11.50.</p>

Lebeau received from Hewlett was not made out at that time—I found a number marked on each bale, with the exception of four bales, where the marks had been torn off—the number of coats in each bale were marked outside.</p>

Lebeau as he had some engagement, and could not stay—Hewlett said "Very well, all right"—he called a lad, who came with a book, and attended the scale, counted the coats, and took an account of them—after some four or five bales had been weighed and examined, I observed to Hewlett that it was a most extraordinary robbery, that the whole of my</p>

Lebeau had not carried out the contract with me, and had entered my goods as rags when they were paid for as merchandize—Hewlett said "You are quite correct, we have had a great deal of difficulty about these coats, they were entered here as rags, and we have had some bother with the Customs, and we have also had the Insurance Company down here about them"—as we went on, I said it was a most disgraceful affair, and I was sure it could not have occurred in London—I did not think there could be facility enough to open and repack 124 bales of goods-Hewett said if they were carried as rags Lebeau would have to pay me—Mr. Watkins came down to the scale on the first or second day, and I told him I was convinced that the bales had been opened and plundered—I spoke to them both about it more than once—I don't recollect Watkins making any remark at all—neither Hewlett or Watkins said anything about an extra bale or any loose coats, or about selling coats and receiving the money, or anything of the kind—I have seen the coats that were found at Meyer's establishment—they were some of the coats I bought—there were several sorts, mixed French uniforms—I told both Hewlett and Watkins that I thought there would be something like 500 or 600 short.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief wharf-clerk to Lebeau &amp; Co.—on 28th November, I went with Reed to Hewlett's house—I have heard what Reed has said—it is correct—on the way to the station, Hewlett said "I should like to tell you all about it, as I don't see why I should bear the blame myself, when I was only carrying out my employer's instructions; I should not like to bring the matter forward, accusing my master of it, as I should</p>

               <p>lose a good situation by so doing"—he then said, "I got a market for the coats through Finden, who sold them by the help of Lovell; Lovell had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his trouble, Finden 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I had 10 per cent, on the whole amount, and the surplus was handed over to Mr. Watkins, in Bank of England notes, and the very same notes were placed to my master's credit at the bank, which he could prove by his books"—I also went with Reed when he took Wat<lb/>kins—at the station, when he was brought in contact with Hewlett, he told Mr. Watkins that he had mentioned to the people present that he gave instructions to dispose of the coats—Watkins hesitated for a moment or two, and raised his head again, and said "Yes"—Hewlett said "You had better settle the matter with Messrs. Lebeau &amp; Co."—Mr. Watkins then asked me what was the claim for the coats—I told him I could not answer that question—he then came round to me at the other side of the station, and asked me to do what I could to settle the matter, as he did not want it to come before the court-house that morning—I told him I could do nothing of the kind, and that was all that passed.</p>

I am a general merchant—I disposed of 302 of the coats in question, through Lovell—I believe the coats found at Meyers, are the same—I can't recognise them—Mr. Hewlett sent a sample up to my house—I handed it over to Lovell—I told Hewlett it was out of my line, I could not sell them myself, and I handed the sample over to Lovell—he got an offer for the coats—I told Hewlett and he supplied the quantity—he was at the wharf then—I think it was on Wednesday, as I had the coat on the Monday—I don't know the day of the month—I received the coat on the Monday—I saw Hewlett on the Wednesday, and handed the money over on the Friday—I told him on Wednesday that I had had an offer, and he accepted it—Lovell gave me the order and told me where to send them to—I gave it to Hewlett and he sent them—the offer was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—Hewlett went away, and when he came back he accepted the offer—the bulk was sent in a cart to Houndsditch—I saw Hewlett again on the Friday morning, when I gave him the money—I think it was 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as near as I can say, in Bank of England notes and cash—they were the same notes I re<lb/>ceived from Lovell—Hewlett was the only one I saw in the transaction—I never saw the bulk—he merely sent the sample to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eight years old, and live with my mother at 41, Flask Street, Hampstead—on a Wednesday, some time ago, my mother came into the bedroom, my sister Mary was there—my mother took off my frock and got a razor from the clock, and cut my arm across three times, once up here, and once down here, and one across here—it bled—she did not say anything—we had our dinner—we dine at 12 o'clock—she then did the same thing to my sister, but she did not take off her frock, because her sleeves were short—mine were long—she said nothing when she cut my sister's arm—I said "Mother, are you sorry for what you have done?"—she said "Yes," and kissed us both, and said "Now I am going to see Mr. Winter, and tell him"—he is a doctor—she then went out, and I did not see anything more of her till she came back with a policeman—my sister and I were taken to the hospital that afternoon—when my mother had gone out I stopped the bleeding because I <hi rend="italic">bounded</hi> my arm up with mother's apron, and my sister with mother's handkerchief, and directly I took the apron off my arm it begun bleeding directly—my mother has always been very kind indeed—she saw me in the hospital, and I said "Mother, when I come home you promise me you will never do it again"—and she said she did not think she had done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Middlesex Hospital—the girl Sarah Harris was brought there on 27th September with three incised wounds round the lower part of her left arm, one of them penetrating to the bone—they were each about three inches long, and she had evidently lost a great deal of blood—it was necessary to ligature one, and to secure the other by torsion—the principal wound was very near the principal artery running down the arm—if it had touched that it would have been fatal without medical assistance, and amputation would have been rendered necessary—she was in the hospital about six weeks, and left on 13th November—she has not recovered yet—the lower wound divided a muscle which causes paralysis of the fore-arm—she will not lose the use of her wrist permanently, but it will take many months before she regains it, and it must permanently interfere with the muscles of the fore-arm, which have been divided, and their power is impaired, but she will regain perfect use of her fore-arm—the wounds on the other child were of the same nature, and nearly in the same places.</p>

I live at 58, High Street, Hampstead—I had attended the prisoner for six years before this happened, and had been in pretty constant attendance on the eldest girl for about two months before this occurrence—she had gastric fever, which required constant watching night and day for two months—the mother alone did the nursing; there was no servant, and no other person there—she must have been up pretty con<lb/>stantly night and day—I know that she had a miscarriage the Saturday before—I attended her, and saw her every day between that Saturday and the Wednesday, and I had seen her on the Wednesday at 1 o'clock, and noticed irritability and weakness from the miscarriage, but I noticed nothing particular about her mind—I attribute the miscarriage to the anxiety and want of sleep in the watching of the eldest girl—I have never noticed any<lb/>thing peculiar in the prisoner's state of mind.</p>

               <p>and the prisoner quarrelling about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which one had borrowed of the other—I told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves, and left them all quiet, smoking their pipes—I went to the bar and Fellows came there in about a minute and asked me for a pint of beer—Mrs. Harris came in while he was at the bar—I asked him if he had done with that bother because I would not draw him any more beer if he had not—he said yes he had come away on purpose and he wanted no more of it—I was going to draw him the beer when Carter came out of the tap-room and called him "A b—y sod" and said, "You b—y pig, I will double you up, "and he up with his fist to hit him as I thought, but he did not, because the prisoner struck him first and he went up against the wall but recovered himself a little, and slipped down—he got up again, and received another blow and went down again—he got up again, and I unbolted my bar door and slipped out and got between them and stopped the fight, and opened my front door and ordered them out—Carter went out first—Mrs. Harm rushed in when I went out of the bar—if she looked through the window she would see them—when Carter went out he said to Saunders "<hi rend="italic">Prinny</hi>," which is a nickname for him, "Will you come and pick me up?"—he said "No, pick yourself up"—I am sure Carter walked out and was not carried out—he was not much in advance of the prisoner, because the bar is only two yards square—there was no one near Carter—he was afterwards brought in again—his nose was bleeding a little, and he was not sensible—he remained in that state about two minutes—I sent for some warm water and got him bathed and he stopped in the tap-room three quarters of an hour. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that he walked deliberately out of the house—when Carter slipped down, he did so intentionally, to avoid receiving a blow; it is a pugilistic trick which is common in a fight, I should do so—Mrs. Harris seemed to be out of her mind—she said that I was not there at all, but I stopped the fight—when she says that two men carried him out she is wrong—I should not allow that—he came to my house every night till the day of his death, smoking and drinking as usual.</p>

               <p>sister—I did not know him before—he was unable to speak—he made a few noises, but could not say what was the matter—his sister told me that he had been fighting some time previously, and that he had had fits—his eyes were black, and there was a mark on his nose—I told him to go home and remain quiet—I went down to see him again at his sister's the same even<lb/>ing, but he had gone home and as I was told, to bed—I went to see him next morning, and found him in a semi-conscious state, having had several fits during the night and he afterwards died—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination, and found marks of bruises on his face and scalp—on taking off the skin of the head I found a large bruise, and on removing the skull-cap, I found a fracture of the skull at the back, or rather the side, and a clot of blood on the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, which was no doubt the cause of the fits—they were caused by pressure on the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>—the clot would be caused by the rupture of a small vessel by a blow or a fall—that would be consistent with the fact of his receiving the injury several days before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think his skull might have been fractured on the Tuesday week before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but the mischief was not developed; the clot of blood was beginning to be organised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The fracture of itself caused no pressure, the pressure was caused by the blood thrown out pressing upon the brain—it does oocur from other causes, no doubt, besides fracture—I examined him on Monday night, but should not be inclined to attribute the clot of blood at that interval of time to other causes than the fracture—they had told me that he had had fits before, but I do not know what caused them—it may have been congestion, from drinking too much—he seems to have got over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man, predisposed to fits, receiving a fracture, and going about smoking and drinking as usual, and you find him on the Monday in the state which you describe, is it not quite consistent that the blood which pressed upon the brain may have been entirely independent of the frac<lb/>ture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, because the blood was between the skull and the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, not between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the brain, and therefore it did not come from the internal part of the head, but from one of the vessels broken by the fracture—it pressed upon the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> pressed upon the brain—if a man received a fracture of the skull, I should not expect to find him walking about, and drinking as usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is, all this might have happened from the mischief which occurred a week before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do not say more than a week, I should expect it to come on rapidly, but evidently it did not; the mis<lb/>chief which produced that clot of blood might have happened very re<lb/>cently; it might have been hours, and it might have been days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it be much more likely to be a few hours than a few days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the condition in which the man was, the blood was beginning to be re-absorbed, beginning to become living flesh again, and if the re-absorption had taken place, he might probably have recovered—congestion of the brain arises from drinking, and from many causes—a man who has had fits is pre-disposed to fits, and to congestion; but there may be no congestion, and yet he may have fits—congestion may be caused by over-drinking—in a man who had received an injury of this sort, drink<lb/>ing would be likely to bring on the congestion from which he had suffered—he died on the Wednesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think drinking alone would have caused it, but it would assist—congestion of the brain was the cause of death—that was connected with the fracture of the skull—there was nothing but healthy structure in the brain, there were no marks of epileptic scars—blood rush<lb/>ing into the brain is sometimes re-absorbed, and a scar is formed—I saw a trace of that, but I did not examine for that.</p>

Taylor, Justice of the Peace, W. F. Calvert, Thomas Calvert, A.

Featherstone, Vicar of Accrington—for anything I know he is a highly respectable man, he is the clergyman there—I have seen him here since I have been up—I don't know that those men have signed a memorial expressing their high opinion of the prisoner; if they have done so I believe that they believe it—I am not anxious that the prisoner should not go back and officiate as incumbent—anxious is hardly the word, I would rather he did not—it is not a thing of anxiety to me, I would rather he did not, that is all—I have taken steps with others where—by he might get a portion of his living, and not go back—there was a meeting, and a resolution passed agreeing that if he could take advantage of the new Act of Parliament we were desirous he should, so that he should decline to go back to his incumbency, and have a third of the living dur<lb/>ing his life—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my handwriting, and signed by me—(<hi rend="italic">This was a letter to Mr. John Mercer, staling that the witness would call on him to see if he would forward the arrangement, that Mr. Wood should give up the living, and receive one-third of the income during his life.</hi>)—I did not communicate with the Treasury regarding this prosecution—there was not a great deal of feeling on the part of the people against the prisoner, only that he had done things that he ought not to have done, and we did not want him—I know of my own knowledge that alterations were made in 1857, and the money came through the prisoner—the grant in question was not made till after that—I should think something like 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. passed through his hands—I will swear to the best of my belief he is not popular down there with the great mass of the people—I know</p>

I live at 115, Lancaster Road, Notting Hill—between 3 and 4 o'clock, on the morning of 18th December, I heard a noise, but where it proceeded from I could not say—I got up, and turned up the gas, and I heard nothing more—soon afterwards my servant came and spoke to me, and I went down to the dining-room—I found that two desks had been broken open—I lost a great coat, a rug, and a hat-brush, 250 cigars, a biscuit-dish, au opera-glass, three scarves, three pipes, two cigar-holders, a knife, a pencil-case, a pen-holder, or the silver of one—the cigars were of peculiar manufacture—one lot was a Manilla kind of cigar, as distin<lb/>guished</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 40, Ann Street, Mile End—I am a cabinet maker, in the employ of John Price, at 1, Singleton Street—the prisoner also worked there—on 7th December I was in the workshop about 9.30 in the evening—I saw him with a piece of lighted wood in his hand, which he placed deliberately behind a box which we use for colours—there were some shavings behind the box—I took no notice of it at the time—I called to a shopmate named O'Neil, and said "I shall leave off'—I walked down the shop to O'Neil's bench, and stood a little to see if the smoke would come up—Green went and smothered it with some sawdust or trod on it—I then left the shop with O'Neil, leaving the prisonor and a man named Gammon there—we merely went down stairs—we did not go away—I should think we remained down stairs five or ten minutes, and then we went round to the back of the premises to see if we could see anything further—I went up stairs by the back entrance, and looked through a hole in the door, leaving O'Neil down stairs—I saw smoke coming up in another place, but close to where the lighted wood had been laid—Green was standing at the further end of the shop—I saw him pick something up from the bench, put it under his arm, and walk out—as he shifted from the bench I lost sight of him, but I heard the door shut and locked, and he went down stairs and turned the gas off at the metre in the yard—I called O'Neil up, and we entered the shop together—as we went in where we saw the smoke it burst into a flame, from the draught of the door or something—I left O'Neil in the shop and went and fetched Mr. Dowsett, who was close by—when we came back the shavings were partly burnt out—there were shavings from the fire-place where the little heap was burning, and a train of shavings ran from there to two or three benches in the shop—we put the fire out And went away—the piece of wood which I saw him take from the fire had evidently been trodden on—it was broken, but I think two or three pieces were still alight when I left with O'Neil, leaving the prisoner and Gammon there—Gammon left before the prisoner—the train of shavings which I after<lb/>wards saw is not always in the shop—that communicated to two or three different benches.</p>

I live at Oxford Terrace, St. John's Hill—on Saturday evening, 23rd December, Tickner came in, about 7 o'clock, and bought two cakes for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-sovereign—I gave her change, and put it in my pocket—I had no other half-sovereign there—the two prisoners were afterwards brought in, and I examined the half-sovereign, and found it was bad—Tickner seemed to be very much surprised about it—I can't say what she said—I marked the coin, and gave it to V 117—Hanmore had the cakes under his arm, when the two prisoners were brought into the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 117). On Saturday evening, 23rd December, Whitley spoke to me, and I saw Tickner come out of Mr. Dil<lb/>cher's—I saw Hanmore further on, walking along the pavement—when she came out of Mr. Dilcher's she followed Hanmore, and went up close to him—I heard her say "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>," and saw her hand him the cakes, which I produce here—I went up and said "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—he answered to that name—I said "Here is a mistake about some things you bought down the road; would you mind going back to see what it is?"—he said "I have not bought any<lb/>thing"—"I said "Your <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> did"—he said "She is no <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> of mine; I know nothing of her"—" Well," I said, "You had better come back"—the female prisoner said "I will go back"—he said "Then there will be no occa<lb/>sion for me to go?"—I said "Yes, you had better go back as well"—at that time the other constable came up, and we went back to Mr. Dilcher's shop—I asked Mr. Dilcher whether he had changed any money for either of them—he said "Yes, I have just changed a half-sovereign for the woman"—I asked him if it was a good one—he said "I don't know, it is in my pocket," and he pulled it out, with two or three sovereigns—he said "That is the half-sovereign I changed"—I tried it, and found it was bad—the woman said she was surprised it was bad, she had just received it as a part of her husband's wages, that he had been at work on the London Brighton and South Coast Railway for above twenty years—she said to Hanmore "You go down to the station, and ask the station-master to come up"—I declined to let him go—I said she would be charged with uttering a coun<lb/>terfeit half-sovereign, and he would be charged with being concerned"—she said to Hanmore "You hold your tongue, and say nothing; leave it all to me"—I sent for a cab, and conveyed them to the station—she repeated the same words in the cab—I searched the cab afterwards, and as I raised the cushion a florin fell to the bottom of the cab, which I found was bad—I showed it to them, and Tickner said "If that was found in the cab, I know nothing about it, someone else must have left it there"—I searched Han<lb/>more, and found in his possession 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, which consisted of three half-crowns, fifteen florins, twenty-two shillings, ten sixpences, one fourpenny-piece, and two threepenny-pieces, and I think, a shilling's-worth of coppers—I also found this church-service, a purse, a piece of net, a packet of pins, and a bill—I showed the bill to Mr. Rapley, and he identified the handwriting as his own—I also found a packet of tea, a piece of suet, and a piece of cheese—I found this address, in pencil, in Hanmore's pocket: "Elizabeth Tickner, Blackfriars Road," where she was residing—Tickner gave her address "12, Church Street, Battersea"—the man gave his proper name and address, and she said "Oh, you fool, you must be a fool to give your right name"—I did not see the woman searched, but I received from the female searcher a latch-key, and a reel of cotton—I produce a half-sovereign, which I received from James Morris, one from Mr. Rapley, one from Mr. Russell, one from Mr. Dilcher—I also produce a florin I received</p>

                  </hi>, I am a general dealer, at 4, Eltham Street, Walworth—I went with Roberts to Collett's house, about 10.30—we found Mrs. Thomas there—Roberts paid for some gin, and we all sat down in the room together—we chatted for an hour or so, and then Collett came in—he had half a leg of mutton with him—Roberts and the deceased got chaffing each other, and then they got sparring together—the deceased hit Roberts two or three times in the face—Mrs. Thomas said she wished Roberts would not come there on a Saturday night, and kick up a row—the deceased and Roberts had a scuffle, and the deceased fell on the ground—he got up and went to the fire-place, as if looking for something—he did not pick up anything, but he ran to where the sword was hanging up, and pulled it down, and Roberts ran out of the room—Mrs. Thomas put her back to the room door—I caught hold of the deceased, and said "For God's sake, don't use that you will do some injury"—he said "Let me go; I will cut the b—'s head off"—Roberts burst the door open and came in—the de<lb/>ceased struggled hard to get away from me, and he ran at Roberts, and went to strike him with the sword, but Roberts caught the sword on his arm, and struggled to get the sword away—it was in the scabbard then—as they were struggling the scabbard came off in Roberts' hand—the deceased had the sword—he made a cut at Roberts with the naked sword, but Roberts knocked it away, flashed it about two or three times, and ran into the street, followed by the deceased—I went out after a few seconds, and saw the deceased coming in rather quick towards the door—Roberts was walking towards the door as well—the police came up, and I heard one of them say "Hallao, Mr. Roberts, what is the matter?"—I did not notice anything the matter with either of them at that time—I went away and went home then—I did not see any blood or any wounds—the deceased came in as if he was half doubled up as he ran to the door—he came in rather sharp—he was drunk.</p>

I live at 17, Elizabeth Place, Waterloo Road—I went to Ash Street, on this Saturday night, at 12 o'clock—I saw Collett turn round to look for the poker; he could not find it, and he took down the sword which hung against the wall—Roberts went to try and get it away from him—he said "What, would you use such a thing as that?" and he tried to get it away from him; the sheath came off in his hand—I said "For God's sake, don't be doing that, you will be killing one another!" and I pushed Roberts out of the door—the deceased wanted to go out after him—the door came open, and the deceased said "There he is, I will cut his head open"—I believe he said that in anger, but they were both in liquor—the deceased went to try and hit him, and it came across my back and Roberts' arm—I was trying to part them—I got a blow on my face, and fell on the bed—they were knocking one another about, and Roberts hit the deceased on the head with the sheath—I saw his head was cut—he still wanted to get at Roberts, and I said "Why don't you be quiet; I should think you have got a cut now," and I seized his arm, and got the sword out of his hand—he did not bleed much—I went with him to the hospital, and saw Mr. Jones, the house-surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital last November—on 26th, the last witness came there with the deceased, about 2.30 in the morning—I found a wound on the right upper portion of the head, running towards the top—it was a clean cut, down to the bone, about three inches long—it had been bleeding a good deal—it was dressed—I did not do it myself, but I was there at the time—I saw him afterwards, as he was passing through the surgery, but I did not examine him there—on 12th December, about 3.30 in the morning, I saw him lying on a stretcher, in the surgery—he was insensible—I looked at his head—the original wound had healed up, but at the side there was a large collection of matter—I let the matter out, put a poultice on his head, gave him some brandy, and left him—he died about two hours after—I made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was blood-poisoning, resulting from the original injury to the head—the bone was yellow, there was a large quantity of pus in the cavity, and the brain was inflamed—the wound was such as would be inflicted by this sheath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I had first seen the man I allowed him to go home—all scalp wounds are serious to a certain extent, not directly serious—it would not be desirable for him to be out till 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning—excessive drinking would not produce the blood poisoning—there was a slight enlargement of the spleen—that is not a sign of indulgence in spirituous liquors—there was no enlargement of the liver, and that is the first indication of hard drinking—the primary cause of blood poisoning was the wound on the scalp.</p>
