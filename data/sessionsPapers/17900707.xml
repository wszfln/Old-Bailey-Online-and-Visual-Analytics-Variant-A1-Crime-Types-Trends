               <p>I am son to Mr. Matthews, a pawnbroker, in the Minories. I received these clothes of the prisoner, on Monday, the 21st of June, about noon; I lent him one pound five shillings upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the value of them? - I would not give any more; I am sure he is the man that brought them; he was in the shop about ten minutes.</p>

               <p>I saw the things about half an hour before they were missed; it was between ten and eleven; I missed them about half past ten; I had been several times to put them away, and was called out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said if I would send him five guineas, he would acquit me; I am innocent; there were several other men at work there.</p>

               <p>Court to Atkins. Is this true; did you offer to make it up? - I did not, my lord, nothing of the sort; I was informed he would bring a person to prove it: a person came to me, and offered me five guineas; and I refused to do any such thing.</p>

Did Highland follow you? - No; he was standing at the corner of Dyot-street; he struck me directly; I gave him no provocation; there was no conversation between the prisoners; they were not in company together; when Highland struck me, he swore very much; the other made the attempt at my pocket, just at the time; I was not knocked down; I received several blows on my arm; I made a retreat into a coal-shed; and he hallooed, blast him, turn him out; I was secure from him.</p>

On the 12th of March, I lost the things in the indictment, out of a three pair of stairs room, where I lodged; I saw them about four in the afternoon; I missed them about seven: I went down stairs, and asked the people below, if they had seen any thing of it? and they said, no; I took no further notice. On the 25th of May, I lost other things; and in searching for them, I found my cloak at the prisoner's apartments; the prisoner told me she took it to pawn for another woman; and afterwards she said she bought it in Rag-fair; it was cut up for a bonnet; I went the next day, the 26th, to her house, and I saw some remnants of silk; she said, that was part of the cloak; I looked at it; and found a place where I had cut it; I took the edging off; it was my own work; and I can swear to it: the prisoner, I understand, was at my house; but I did not see her then; I found nothing else but the cloak.</p>

On the 4th of March I lost four hundred pounds weight of lead from some carcases of houses, in Manchester-square; it was fixed to the houses; it was the middle gutters: information was brought me about the robbery, on the night of the 4th; I found a lad in custody at the watch-house; I saw the lead the next day morning, in the watch-house, and the prisoner was there; it was in the watchman's possession, and I believe he has had it ever since: the lead was compared, and matched exactly: there was no other circumstance but the matching; it fitted exactly: there was only this piece of lead at the watch-house; the other was removed ready.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you go with the people to sell this lead to this woman after it was stolen? - No.</p>

               <p>I was the constable. On the 4th of last March, between nine and ten at night, I was at the Red-lion, and received information of the robbery; and I went and apprehended Merchant in Mr. Adams's house: he was in custody: I went and took Mrs. Cross into custody: I found this lead at Mrs. Cross's; there were Mr. Williams, Mr. Gale, and Mr. Cheeseman present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time did you send him to Cross's with the lead? - He went himself.</p>
               <p>Why, do you mean to say he went without your consent? - By my consent as well as the rest.</p>
               <p>Was not he sent to Cross's in order to lay a trap, and to induce them to buy this, in order to prosecute them? - I beg your pardon; it is wrong; the lead had been already stolen, but not moved from the premises: I never gave him any consent.</p>
               <p>Did you refuse the consent? - No, Sir, I did not: I believe there were half a dozen went with him.</p>
               <p>How long did you allow him to lay the trap before you went down to spring on the game? - I really do not understand your cramp words; I believe it might be half an hour: nobody went in with him: I suppose it might be five minutes before I went in.</p>
               <p>How much was given to this boy to go and sell it there? - Not a farthing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How much was promised him if he would go and sell it, as a trap for somebody? - Nothing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Cross's husband there? - I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Court. What time in the morning was it that you went to take the prisoner? - about a quarter after five in the morning.</p>

             come out of the house; I did not see him come in; I took hold of the boy, and asked Mrs. Cross if she had bought any lead of that boy? she said, no; the boy immediately told her that she had bought it, and put it into the chimney, and gave him two shillings for it; then the prisoner Mrs. Cross, and the two boys endeavoured to get me out of doors: they tried to put me out; and Mr. Kelly, and several more came in; and the boy told them in her presence; then they went to the chimney, and found the lead; the boy marked the lead, and this is the piece.</p>
               <p>At the time you went into the room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070014"/>who did you find in the house? - Mrs. Cross and two lads.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She is a married woman? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Was you at this publick-house with the last honest man and the boy? - The boy never was at a publick-house at all; he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Whose scheme was it to give the boy the lead to carry to Mrs. Cross? - We gave it him to carry: I believe one Mr. Foster, an iron-monger.</p>
               <p>Was it agreed among you all that the boy should take the lead from the place where he left it, and carry it to the prisoner to sell? - I cannot tell whether it was agreed; it was not by me: I did not hear what passed; but I heard Mr. Foster ask him whether he thought Mrs. Cross would buy the lead; and upon that the boy was sent to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, originally the lead was stolen, therefore the person who stole it might be convicted of felony; but the lead actually gets to the possession of the right owner; then there is a scheme, in which this prosecutor is a party, that the lead should be carried to this woman to sell; the lead did not come to her in the character of stolen goods: you must acquit the prisoner: as to her morality, I can say nothing at all to that.</p>

               <p>Where did you live in June last? - In Mark-lane.</p>
               <p>With whom? - Mr. Thornton.</p>
               <p>Who did you live with on the 15th of June last? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Why do not you answer the question, woman; who did you live with on the 15th of June last? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you ever rent a house in your life? - No, Sir; I rented a room at Mr. Murphy's, in Blue Anchor-court.</p>
               <p>Did Murphy live in the house? - She did not live in my house.</p>
               <p>Did she live in any other part of that house? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did she live? - She lived in the top of the court.</p>
               <p>What part of the house was your room in: how many rooms did the house consist of? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. How long had Mrs. Murphy had you out of service? - I had been out of place about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>She received the money you got, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070016"/>furnished you this place to receive men in: we all know Mrs. Murphy very well? - I only paid half-a-crown a week for the room.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you pay her any thing else in the course of the week? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How many houses were there consisting of one room each only? - It was not only one room.</p>
               <p>Who rented the other? - There was no other room in my part, but my room.</p>
               <p>How many rooms were there in the whole? - It was only one.</p>
               <p>Had you a bed in that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you one door or two? - Two doors: there was an entry: my room was on the right hand side, one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you are trying these two prisoners for their lives; the consequence of which is, that if they are convicted there will be eighty pounds reward: I cannot make out that she has any thing like a dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing? - I lost a pair of stays.</p>
               <p>When? - The 15th of last month, which was Tuesday last.</p>
               <p>Where were they taken from? - Out of my room, off the tea table; between eleven and twelve in the night.</p>
               <p>How do you know they were taken at that time? - Because I went to light my candle.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Here is her own information; she says she rents a room of Mrs. Murphy, in Blue Anchor-yard.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you been abed before that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did you come into that house: where had you been? - To see my friends: my stays were on the table: I was back by ten.</p>
               <p>Where were you from ten till eleven? - I sat at the front door, out in the street, at Mrs. Murphy's, at the green stall; that was not in the court.</p>
               <p>Who took your stays away? - I cannot tell who it was; I did not see them; I have seen the stays since; I swore to them at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have been one of Mrs. Murphy's girls about three weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Dawson, the thief-taker? - I did not know any thing of him; but I tried some how or other.</p>
               <p>When did Dawson tell you to swear that you rented a house? - He did not tell me to swear it.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Who told you there would be eighty pounds to be divided among you, if you hanged these girls? - Nobody.</p>

Our house was broke open on Monday, the 14th of June: I went to town about ten in the morning; and I returned again about half after seven in the evening; I keep the whole house; and between seven and eight in the evening, I went up stairs to take my bonnet into the front room, one pair of stairs; and put it into the cupboard; I put down the windows; and the next morning, about half after eleven, I went up, and found the two beads lay on the floor, and the window up, and two flower-pots pushed into the room, a pot of daisies, and a pot of stocks: they had been on the outside, and were there when I left the room, in the evening: when I went up the next morning, I missed the three bonnets, the canary bird and cage, a bed quilt, and the other things in the indictment: I saw the three bonnets at Bow-street, and the canary bird and cage, and a tea-chest; they are all mine: I can swear to the bird cage: my husband had cut off the four bottom knobbs.</p>

               <p>I am a labouring man. Three weeks ago, I was going to my labour between four and five, and I met the three prisoners in Mr. Welling's field, about two hundred yards farther than her house: they were going to where the goods lay, in a ditch: there was three bonnets, a boy's hat, a tea-chest, a bird cage, and a canary in it: they were coming across a field where there was no road. I went to my master's yard, and met Mr. Croker; and I followed the prisoners out of Mr. Welling's yard: I saw them all in the ditch, and come out of the ditch; and I went with Croker, and we met them in the same field where the goods were; and Croker drew his cutlass; and Wall threw away the tea-chest, and I ran after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Wall walking or talking with the rest? - He was about two yards from the other two: I saw Croker stop the other two.

Mr. Croker took the things away in my presence; I carried the bird cage to Bow-street: Croker took the other things home: I was present when the bird cage was shewn to Mrs. Gordon; she said it was her's: I saw the bonnet and hat, and the other things, at Bow-street; they are the same that were taken from the prisoners: Mrs. Gordon said they were her's. I was with Croker all the time while he carried the things; I never left him; I am sure these are the three men.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Were there more persons near you than one? - I cannot say; I did not see; there might be; but I was not aware that there were others; there were a variety of passengers passing.</p>

               <p>Is the handkerchief here? - I have brought a handkerchief, which may be the handkerchief, but I cannot swear it is the handkerchief; but this I can swear, that it is one of the number; for I was not aware that it was necessary to return the particular handkerchief, as thinking I had preserved the mark and number, necessary to ascertain it; when I came home I threw it among the dirty linen; and all those that were bought at that period were all marked with the same number of fourteen; being handkerchiefs of a certain number, therefore I cannot swear that it is the same; but I swear it is one of the same sort.</p>

               <p>I was up two pair of stairs, and I heard the cry of stop thief; and I saw a young man running, and chuck a handkerchief into a house; I am not rightly sure to the young man: it was a red and white handkerchief, to the best of my knowledge; I do not know whether it was a silk one or no; but I believe it was a silk one; I think I saw Mr. Crespigny pick it up himself:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070029"/>a constable took the prisoner away, and a brewer's servant stopped him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was up two pair of stairs, on the other side of the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know the man at all? - No, I cannot swear to him: it was a great deal of red, and a little white.</p>
               <p>A very bright red? - Not so very bright.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

At half after two, on the 4th of June, as I was sitting on a bulk, I saw the prisoner coming through Gilbert's passage; he seemed very much fatigued; says I halloo! he said, I wish I was at home; he had an old jack, which he had picked up in Fleet-street: I took him to the watch-house.</p>

On the 25th of June, a little after five, my husband went out and left me in the tap-room, with the prisoner and another man that had been drinking; a few minutes after that the prisoner went out; I was then sitting in the tap-room, which commanded both the doors: when the prisoner went out I went to the top of the tap-room, to count the pots; I had not been but a very little while before I heard the bar bell ring very softly; upon which I looked up, and saw the prisoner directly at the bar door, which rung; he was very much confused at the sight of me; he paid me two-pence, for a quartern of anniseed, in halfpence: when I went into the bar I observed the till open: the prisoner watched me amazingly; he stared, and looked confused; that I knew he had been doing something, but I did not know what: the prisoner and the other man went away immediately: this was between five and six in the afternoon.</p>

I went to the Coach-office on Monday; and they persuaded me to stay till Friday. On Saturday last, I received a penny-post letter: I described the trunk left in a hackney coach: I went on Tuesday last, where I was desired to go by this letter; it was to Dog-row, Whitechapel. After the prisoners were taken up, I found a pair of my stockings in their apartment, in Whitechapel; this was on Tuesday last: the man prisoner, I think, drove us: I cannot swear positively to him.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Clear brought a bundle to me and asked leave to put it into my drawers, and I gave her leave; on Tuesday morning Mrs. Clear brought another, and an empty trunk, informing me it belonged to a person that had lived well, and was reduced; I asked her no particular questions about them; in the afternoon of the Tuesday, Mrs. Clear came and drank tea with me, and told me there was a person coming at six to buy the property; about six a man and woman came in, and they went into my bed-room, and Mrs. Clear took out the bundle and carried it in; and they went away; I do not know what passed; Mrs. Clear called me in after, and told me they had bid too little money for it; I asked her what things they were; she said, a find of her son George's; a find in the coach; she told me before that they belonged to people who had lived in better circumstances; but then she contradicted herself; I asked her if they had been advertised; she said no; with that her son who was there, went out and fetched the paper, and they were advertised; then the man and the two women came again, and the woman took the things away.</p>
               <p>You do not know particularly what they were? - They were wearing apparel; but I do not know particularly what; I am a mantua-maker; and that same Tuesday morning Mrs. Clear gave me a gown to make; she said she bought it, and I have brought it here; Mrs. Clear took the trunk away herself; when I received the gown it was in a great coat.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brotherton. The coachman had first of all put the trunk into the coach, and there not being room enough, he took it out; I took notice of him, because I thought he seemed rather to wish to put it into the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you at the office, when the driver of No. 206 was there? - Yes, I said he was not the person; but that the prisoner was: the prisoner only came in by accident; I was not quite so clear at that instant; he stood with his side face, and he went soon out of the coach office; and I could not get a full view of him.</p>

On the 9th of June, I was sitting by the bedside; I had just put three guineas and a half into a brown paper, in a box in my pocket; and the prisoner saw me; the prisoner was also one of the poor: Mr. Overton farms several parishes: the prisoner did not belong to the same parish; there was my bed in the room; and the prisoner sat down on the bed, and took me into her lap; I felt something in my pocket; and I put in my hand, and the prisoner's hand was there; and I missed my box directly; and I called out that she had taken my three guineas and a half, box and all; and then the prisoner thumped me on my ribs: I had a new cotton gown on the bed; and the prisoner swore bitterly that she would take that as well as the rest: the prisoner spit upon me, and called me a bitch. The constable has one tin box and one wooden box that the prisoner took out of my pocket at the same time: she took the cotton gown off the bed before my face; she said she would take it; she kept it in defiance; she did not go away; she remained in the house: the prisoner was not employed by Mr. Overton at all; she lodged in the same room with me; she kept the gown in her own custody, and dared me to touch it.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be in possession of three guineas and a half? - I had been at Goldsmith's Hall: I am a <rs id="t17900707-46-viclabel223" type="occupation">settled widow</rs>

                        targets="t17900707-46-victim421 t17900707-46-viclabel223"/>: the parish gives me no clothes: this money supplies me with clothes.</p>
               <p>How long had you received this money, before the woman took it from you? - I believe, a day or two, not longer.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people that lodged in the same room, besides you? - Yes, a good many; seven or eight, or more.</p>
               <p>Were any of them in the room at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask them to help you? - No, Sir; she laid me down in her lap, and took my property; and then she pushed the candle out; it was the 28th of June: I go to bed between seven and eight: I am sure it was candle-light; for she pushed the candle out of my hand; and I screamed out at the instant; and I said, she has got my tin box and my money; she beat me on the hips; so I let it alone; I had no stays on; and she is a great powerful woman.</p>
               <p>So they did not help you at all? - No, Sir; they were afraid of her, she is such a masculine strong woman; I borrowed the tin box of the prisoner; and she knew what money I had.</p>
               <p>After she took this money from you, and the gown, did you tell any body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you went to bed, I suppose, and fell asleep? - I could not sleep.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body the next day? - I did nothing but hear the prisoner abuse me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070036"/>What did she abuse you for? - Because I said she had robbed me.</p>
               <p>When was she taken up? - I cannot say: I wanted some satisfaction for my money: the prisoner always denied that she had it: with the assistance of my friends, who assisted me with money, I did send for a constable; she used me with the best of manners, till she got the money: we lived in the same room four or five weeks.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Overton about it? - Yes, the same week; and he said he could not help it: I ought to take more care.</p>
               <p>Did she ever wear this cotton gown? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - In her custody in the house; and the constable took it out of 
her apartment.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get your money again? - No, not a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you are a great age; you will recollect you are upon your oath: have you ever heard of a reward to people who convict persons of a highway robbery? - No, not I; I am as ignorant of these affairs, as a child unborn; I never was in such an affair before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received three guineas of a gentleman that came out of the country, three weeks before she came into my room.</p>

               <p>I believe it was the 9th or 10th of June, that this woman came up with another woman for a warrant, to the Rotation-office; and I went to execute the warrant there; I saw the prisoner, Mrs. Fell, in the room; being conducted to the room by some of the folks that belonged to the work-house, I told her I had a warrant for her, for robbing the old lady; she said, she had not robbed her at all; says I, I must look in your box and pockets; I found nothing in her pockets; in her box I found this tin box, and this wooden box; she scratched hold of them at first, and put them into her pocket, and I made her take them out again; and in the tin box there was half a guinea in gold, and three shillings and six-pence in silver; I gave her the silver by order of the magistrate, when she was committed; and the half-guinea and the boxes, I produce to you; I asked her also where she had put the old gentlewoman's gown; and she said she had taken that for some money the old woman owed her; where is it, says I; she said, she should keep it; I asked her about the boxes? she said, they were her's, she had lent them to the old gentlewoman to put her money in them: I took her before the magistrate, and the old woman said she had borrowed the boxes: I had Mr. Overton up there, and Mr. Overton said, if they would not be honest they must be punished, he knew nothing about it at all.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Did you borrow both the boxes of her, or only one? - Both the boxes.</p>

               <p>Do you know whose box the tin box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070039"/>was? - It was the prisoner's; but she lent it to the old woman, to put her gold in, and the other to put her silver in.</p>
               <p>At that time you say the old woman called out, she had lost her money? - She called out, oh Lord! I have lost something.</p>

               <p>I am one of the poor, in the same room with Mrs. Keen: on the 28th of May Mrs. Keen went to Goldsmiths-hall and received some money: I know what her money is; she has ten pounds a year; and she received five pounds of it the 28th of May; Mrs. Fell went with her, and hired a coach, and paid for the coach going and coming back: on the Saturday, about one I believe it might be, Mrs. Keen went into Mr. Overton's laundery, and there she staid till I believe it might be eight at night; then she was led in by two; she is so very feeble; she sat down on the bed; but whether she fell down or was pushed down I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was she sat on the other woman's lap? - No; she was not: Mrs. Keen cried out, O Lord! O Lord! Mrs. Fell immediately went to her bed; and I said to Mrs. Keen, why do not you go to bed? she said she had lost something; she called for a candle; I said, we go to bed by daylight, we cannot afford candles; Mrs. Fell got a candle; Mrs. Fell would have Mrs. Overton to come and search us all that night; but Mrs. Overton said, she did not care whether she had lost her money or not; she should not come in to search us till the next morning: the candle was brought, and Mrs. Keen and her bed was searched; but nothing could be found only three shillings and six-pence in the box, and five-pence three farthings in halfpence, which Mrs. Fell took in part of what she owed her; and she took her gown in part of the pay, and hung it up on her bed; Mrs. Overton came the next morning, and searched her bed, and every place in the room, but no money could be found: there had not been a creature out of the house.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Overton search your persons? - Every thing in the world; and all our pockets: Mrs. Fell had lent Mrs. Keen a tin box to put her gold in.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Fell searched? - Every body was searched; and in that search the tin box could not be found.</p>
               <p>If Mrs. Fell had had tin box about her it must have been found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fell went out you say to fetch the candle? - She was not gone many minutes; nobody else went out; she went out of the gate; but she was not gone a minute.</p>
               <p>Did the old woman or not say any thing at the time, when she cried out; about the prisoner taking any thing from her? - She said, she felt the prisoner's hand in her pocket; that was just after, or much about the same time.</p>

               <p>On May twelve-month I received ten guineas of a gentleman; and Mr. Overton knows it; this last May of all I received three guineas, and I received a crown about three weeks before this old woman came into my room; she was always at me to bring her into my room; I said, we have nobody but honest people in our room, and when there is a vacancy I will bring you in; I got her in; I bought two tin boxes: I have always been in power in Mr. Overton's house: the old woman said she wanted some gin, and some tea, and sugar; I lent her some money; five shillings and a few halfpence: I took her to the hall in a coach: the prosecutrix received five guineas, and one shilling: when she got to the coach she abused me; and a gentleman came out and said you are an abusive woman, you will lose your money: the old woman went to the ale-house for an hour; and the woman came out, and said, for God's sake fetch the old woman home, she is so drunk, and the box is always out; they brought her in so tosticated; the ale-house maid brought in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070040"/>liquor, and this old woman still kept calling for gin and strong beer; the old woman called in a boy to change her a guinea: she was some time before she got the guinea out of the tin box which I had lent her: we got her to bed: in the morning I said, Mrs. Keen, says I, I will not come nigh you, you are a sad woman; says she, give me some gin; I said none could be had; but she made use of such speeches, I was frightened; I was making the fire; says she, I will go out to day; and she counted her money, silver and gold, and all; but I never saw the gold at all; she went out with the gold in one box and the silver in another; she went into the wash-house, and the woman is every thing that is bad; I went to the master of the house; Oh, says I, Mr. Overton, that old woman is in the wash-house; she will lose her money; the young gentleman went and swore at them; but she continued in this place; they had gin all the afternoon, and were so drunk that they came supporting this old woman; two or three of us handed her to her bed-side; I said I will have nothing to do with her; I went to bed to my two children, pretty creatures! I am always in power in Mr. Overton's house; and somebody fell down, and the old woman called for a candle: says an old woman, some body has tumbled down, pray go for a candle; I ran out with half my clothes on, and half off; among all the gentlemen and ladies; I said, I am frightened, here is the old woman has been drunk all day, and she is on the floor, and pray come and search about; I am afraid she is a bad woman; says Mrs. Overton, she is a bad woman, if she loses all her money I do not care; I got a candle, and I said, let us all search; there she was laying down; and the wooden box was laying by the side of her. This wooden box when she went out, had four half crowns, and twenty shillings in it; and there was then only one half-crown; I was all of a tremble, I could not speak a plain word; there was a pocket and nothing in it; we searched every where, and could find no box at all; we put her into bed: in the morning she called out for her gin again: oh! you wicked woman, says I, there is no money for you now; you have been among thieves and drunkards: how must I get to my money? You may get it as you can, madam, says she; her hands on her side, in a vulgar manner; her gown was in my possession from the 1st of April, hanging at the head of my bed; says she, I will swear a robbery against you; because I said I would stop her gown for sixteen shillings, she swore a robbery against me; they moved her out of the room, because she abused us so, they could not go on with their work; and her gown lay on the head of my bed as usual; there came a man on Sunday; says he, is this Mrs. Fell? Yes Sir, says I; says he, have not you got a gown and cloak? he said, give me the gown; I turned at him, and looked at him; I thought he looked like a thief; I said, I know nothing of you: then says he, madam, if you will not return the cloak to me, I will make you return it to-morrow: he sent the constable next day. This is what she has done all this for; there is not one word in her mouth that is true; I always had broken gentlefolks under my hands before, while I was at Mr. Overton's; and she lost her box, and all the gold in the wash-house, among thieves; and if she has gin, she will never be sober; and she will swear and unswear.</p>

            . Were you at Goldsmith's-hall on Friday when your godmother received her money? - I waited there; till they came in the coach; then I led her into the hall, till the gentlemen put the money into her hand; I always attend her there, to take care of her, and to see her safe out: she owed me seven shillings; I went home with them in the coach; I saw them safe there, and the old woman said, she wanted a bit of dinner: I let her come; I begged of Mrs. Fell to let her have her way; I let her have it, and after that she wanted to go home with me, knowing that I have a house; and I did not chuse it: I told her she should go Mr. Overton's: she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070041"/>got her dinner at the Bunch of Grapes, on this side of the hospital, just by Mr. Overton's house, not 20 yards from it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, when she left her, was she drunk or sober? - I will tell you what she had, one pint of beer, and one dram; the woman came to fetch her home.</p>
               <p>Was she drunk or sober? - No; she was far from drunk when I led her into Mrs. Fell's room: there was a bottle of gin in the room, which Mrs. Fell herself told me she had bought, and brought it in; I saw the gin in the bottle: says she, I will not send out for any; I have bought some, knowing that the old lady will have some now and then.</p>
               <p>Was it true, that the old lady did drink drams now and then? - She will drink a dram if she can get it:</p>
               <p>Then she is a drunken woman? - No, far from it.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutrix ordered out of court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me honestly and fairly, whether the quantity, whatever it was, had affected her understanding, so as to make her in liquor, drunk? - I can by no means think she was; for she spoke very sensibly when I left her in Mrs. Fell's room; but Mrs. Fell said she had bought a bottle of gin; and I saw it; they all had some of it before I went away: they asked me three times over, if I would drink; but I never drink any such thing.</p>
               <p>But then, when you came into the room, Mrs. Fell drank gin, and Mrs. Keen drank gin? - They all had some.</p>
               <p>Now then, was your god-mother in liquor, or not, when you left her? - No; I cannot think she was in liquor; but I dare say she was not long after; for they were endeavouring to make her so; I perceived it, and I said I would not stay any longer.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of her going to the wash house? - No, my lord; that was after I was gone.</p>

            . Was this old woman drunk or sober? - If I speak the truth, I cannot think she was sober: she certainly is a woman that is adicted very much to liquor indeed; and that every body in Mr. Overton's house, which I suppose there is four hundred people, will say the same; and very troublesome.</p>
               <p>I want to know, whether on the Saturday night, when she made this screaming out, at that time, you can say whether she was drunk or sober? - Upon my oath, she was not sober: she was led in by two people; and before she left our room, she had three glasses of gin, and a pint of porter, indeed.</p>
               <p>Then on the Saturday night, she was drunk, when she made this noise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could she get liquor in the landry? - Yes, they can; they send out for a little gin, privately.</p>

               <p>Where were those things taken from to that room? - From my house.</p>
               <p>Where was the room? - In George-street.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see it? - Yes, I was there three days.</p>
               <p>Where did you go from to that room? - To a sister at Paddington. Mr. Davis was in Oxfordshire: I did not leave the things in her care; I thought as she had been before an honest woman; I gave her the key of my room; I did not leave them in any body's care; I thought they were locked up.</p>
               <p>You left them in your room? - Yes; I locked the door, and gave the key to her.</p>
               <p>How long was you gone before you came back again? - Three weeks; I told her I was going for three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Upon what account, and for what reason, were those things removed from your house to that room? - I was sent out of my house.</p>
               <p>How soon after you went to Paddington, and your husband to Oxfordshire, did the messengers commission come in? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long had he been a bankrupt before you came back again? - I do not know he was made a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did the commission of bankruptcy come in? - I do not know: I left the house in the night.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did the messenger come? - I did hear the docket was struck.</p>
               <p>How soon after was the docket struck? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it before you came back from Paddington? - I was very often from Paddington.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you hear it? - I heard it two or three days after I went to Paddington.</p>
               <p>Who paid the rent for the room that was taken? - Why, she that took the things away.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - I suppose Mrs. Humble; I was to pay her for it.</p>
               <p>Now I believe there were certain other creditors who smelt out these things? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who issued out the commission? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear who was the petitioning creditor? - I did hear Mr. Calvert was: Mr. Porter desired me to take what little things were necessary.</p>
               <p>You found this woman in some new lodging? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With most of these things with her? - Yes; all the things were found in the lodging; but some of the furniture was sold.</p>
               <p>Court. What furniture was found there? - There was a bed, a set of drawers, half a dozen chairs, two tables, two saucepans; these things were sold; all the rest were found in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Of course these were to be considered as Mrs. Humble's own property? - No.</p>
               <p>Then she was to give them you back again? - No; they were not: I was to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070045"/>back to this room when my husband came to town; he desired me to go.</p>
               <p>Were not these things delivered to Mrs. Humble, in order to prevent their being swept up by the commissioners? - No; they were not.</p>
               <p>For what purpose were they then delivered to her? - I thought her an honest woman; and she was to be with me the time; and I heard she was in another place; and I sent for a constable, and took her up.</p>

               <p>When you first observed the tub, the prisoners were not near the tub? - They were not at that time: they claimed it afterwards: the bung had been out, but slightly put in again.</p>
               <p>Was it sufficiently put in, that the liquor might not spill? - It was so full, that I could put my finger in, and satisfy myself of the quality of it.</p>
               <p>How many quarts in general, do you think that contained? - The casks are made for four gallons; they do not contain all that; they generally contain fifteen quarts.</p>
               <p>You seized it according to your form: what is that form? - I seized it for the use of the king and myself.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - I said it out loud: they might hear me; they were close enough to me: I spoke to them, and told them I seized it for the use of the King and myself.</p>
               <p>There had been no quarrel or conversation before? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Mackintosh, about half a year. One night I went to the prisoner's house, about ten o'clock, with a cap for her to make; I took it from my mistress; and I took her some edging and ribbon at the same time, for herself; it was thread edging; I did not measure it; after that I went there with some work; and she asked me for some pins; I told her I had none; and she asked me to get her some, and I took her some; and I took her some trinkets for herself; then I took her some more trinkets: she was at our house one day for some work, and she saw this edging in the window; and she said she should like some of it for a cap, so I took it to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose property was this? - My master's: I took it out of the box; I do not remember the day; she gave me nothing for taking it; and I was not to have any part of it: I was taken up, and she was taken up; I was obliged to tell of it, when I was taken up; I saw the lace in Houndsditch, where I was stopped; it was in the constable's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070049"/>hands; it was the same; for I put a mark on the card, before I took it to her: I put a T. on it, in ink; I do not know my reason: my master knew nothing of it: the prisoner told me she should not let the people know below stairs, because they were very bad people.</p>
               <p>Did you think you was doing a wrong thing? - I thought it would never be found out: the prisoner told me not to tell her sister, for she would tell my master and mistress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you been in any service whatever? - This was the first.</p>
               <p>When did you first begin to turn thief? - I cannot tell whether it was three or four months after I was bound; that lace was the first thing I ever took from any body.</p>
               <p>They told you you would be hanged or transported? - Yes, Sir, if I did not tell the truth; and I should not wish for any body to be hanged any more than myself.</p>
               <p>Did not you imagine that accusing some body else, would save you from hanging or transportation? - I thought so to myself.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of June, this little girl went into Mrs. Ure's, a baker, at Houndsditch; she had a bad shilling: Mr. Ure called me in to search the girl; and I found some property of Mr. Mackintosh's, a bit of muslin, and some thread, and some tapes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot positively swear to the lace; but I have lace of the same pattern; and I have sold a great deal of that sort: these other things are mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You believe this little girl to be as bad a girl as can be? - There is not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Towsey. Is the T. you mention, on either of these cards?</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you instructed to mark these cards: can you write and read? - I can read, but I cannot write.</p>
               <p>Can you make a T.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Court ordered her to make a T, on the card, which she did. Handed to the jury.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070052"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his More of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>A new Edition of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND is just reprinted, Price Eighteen pence; also</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System;</p>
               <p>"to which are added, a Comparative Table of Alphabets, and two Extracts by way of</p>
               <p>"Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price 2 s. 6 d. Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Bell, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No, 14, White-lion-street, Islington, or No. 35, Chancery-Lane, will receive immediate Answers; and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law, and others, immediately attended to.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on this Plan, and wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing; Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last thirty-three Years, to dispose of at the usual Price; or any person wanting any particular Trial, may have a Copy of it at Six-pence per Folio.</p>
