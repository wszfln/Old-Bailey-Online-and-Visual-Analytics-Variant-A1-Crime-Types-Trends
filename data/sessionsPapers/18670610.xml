I was footman to Mr. Richard Stoneleigh Illingworth, of 9, Norfolk Crescent—on Friday, the 3rd of May, Barwell came there about a quarter to nine in the evening—I had known him before—I took him into the pantry—there was some plate there—I cannot remember what plate there was in the basket, but I can remember the plate that was stolen, two table-spoons, three tea-spoons, one dessert-spoon, five forks, and two egg-spoons, all silver; the spoons had my master's crest on them—I had seen them safe at dinner-time—I left the pantry for a short time to take up the coffee, and left Barwell in the pantry—I was away about five minutes—I went back to the pantry, Barwell was there, and he said he must be going—I went out afterwards to get some beer for the maid<lb/>servants—Barwell went out with me—I was away on that occasion about four minutes, or five it might have been—when I came back, from some<lb/>thing said to me, I examined the plate basket—I then missed the plate mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>me—he stayed with me about twenty minutes—I did not take particular notice, but I should think it was about that time—I had not invited him—that was the first time he visited me—he had been in the pantry on the Sunday, that was the Sunday before the plate was lost—Barwell came to pay me a visit on the Friday, and was with me three-quarters of an hour I should think—he was in the kitchen and in the pantry—the other servants were there—there were three or four maid-servants—I was in the pantry with Barwell when he first came, for about five or six minutes: it was not half an hour—I then went up stairs with the coffee—I might have been gone three or five minutes, when I came down Barwell was still in the pantry—he said he must be going, as he had a friend waiting for him—we went out together—I was not exactly treating the maid-servants that night—the beer was out and I went to fetch a quart—I paid for it out of my own pocket—I had not time to stop it from my master, because I had to leave that night—Barwell and I went to the public-house and had a quart of beer, and I paid for it—we met Emly at the corner, waiting for us—I am quite certain he was never inside the house that night—none of the maid<lb/>servants are here—I was not out more than four or five minutes—Emly was with us the whole time when I was out—when the plate was missed I was blamed for it—I was discharged and told if I would find the thief my master would take me back again—I did not leave Emly and Barwell at the public-house—they walked to the corner with me, and I went in and left them—I went to Barwell's house the very next morning—I had not seen Emly before I went there—I saw them there, both in bed together—Barwell said, "What brought you here?"—I said, "You will soon know what brought me here"—the policeman then told him the charge—he said, "Good God! John, what do you mean?"—he was just roused out of his sleep—I decline to answer whether I have ever pawned any plate before—I was asked at the police-court if I had ever pawned or sold any plate, and I declined to answer, and I decline now.</p>

On Sunday morning, 5th May, I went with Slow to 84, Portland Row, Notting Hill, the house of the prisoner Barwell—I found him in bed—as soon as we entered the room he said, "Good morning, John," that was to Slow, "what on earth brings you here?"—he said, "You will soon know what brings me here"—I then told him I was a police-constable, and told him the charge—he said, "Good God!

From information I received, I went to 65, Prince's Road, Notting Hill, on 7th May I saw the prisoner Bull there, it is a shop kept by him, a general shop, clothes and other things—I asked him if his name was Bull—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am a police-sergeant; I want to know if you purchased any plate last week—he said, "No, nothing in particular; some little pieces of old silver, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100005"/>
               <p>have been sold"—I then said, "Did you buy any spoons or forks last week?"—he said, "No, nothing of the kind"—I then produced this tea-spoon, bearing the crest of the lion rampant, and said, "Do you remember seeing that crest, or did you purchase any bearing this crest?"—he said, "No, I never saw the crest before in my life"—I then said, "Have you an assis<lb/>tant of the name of Jarrard?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then do you remember that Jarrard, on the night of the 3rd, paid 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some silver, and that you completed the contract on the following morning by paying 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he said, "No, I never did anything of the kind"—I then saw Jarrard, and said to him, "I am a police-sergeant; I shall ask you some questions, but you need not answer unless you think proper to do so w—I said, "Did you pay 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to two young men for some silver bearing the crest of a lion rampant on Friday?"—he hesitated for a long time, and he said, "Well, I don't know; must I answer?"—I said, "Oh! no, not unless you like"—he then said, "Very well, then I refuse to answer that ques<lb/>tion"—I then called Addison, and we searched the house—this is a list that I made at the time—what I found does not refer to this charge—I found eight duplicates, which I produce—there are three bearing the name of Bar well, one dated 20th April, 1867, for a pair of trousers, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 2nd May, 1867, one coat, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and 27th February, 1867, one watch, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Bull does not keep a pawnshop—he asked me what the particular articles were that were stolen—I read over from a list I had—he said, "That is wrong, at all events"—I said, "How do you know it is wrong if you never saw anything of the kind?"—he said, "Oh; well, I don't exactly understand; if I had time, supposing the silver was got back, which I believe could be done"—I said, "It is too late now; you are in custody; had you told me that when I first came in, things might have borne a different aspect"—the value of the silver that has been stolen is at the lowest 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce; I know that—on the way to the station Bull said, "Supposing the plate did come back, what would the consequence be now?"—I said, "I don't understand you"—Jarrard stepped towards me, and said, "Mr. Bull means, if the plate was got back, would they prosecute?"—I said, "The matter must rest now in the hands of the Magistrate"—when I was searching the house Bull said, "It is no use searching; you will not find it here."</p>

                  </hi>. In the early part of February last I was living at 2, Barford Street, Islington—I never lived with the prisoner—I have been his housekeeper before, but I was passing in my own name—I never dropped my name—I remember his depositing this money for Miss Gale—he paid it in for her as trustee—I believe it was on the 11th—I re<lb/>member something being said about his going to Paris afterwards—I believe it was either on the 12th or 13th—I know it was about then, be<lb/>cause there were some valentines to be written to Miss Gale's little brothers and sisters by the prisoner—a party came into the room, and she said to the prisoner, "I will write you a valentine while you are in Paris," and then she said, "By the bye, Lyons, how about my money? I shall not be able to get it out if you go to Paris"—he said, "You will not want the money yet, will you?" and she said, "I think you had better give notice and have it drawn before you go; you can get it without me"—towards the latter part of the month I recollect her saying that she wanted the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her confinement, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. she would put away in her own name, and of course he could get it and sign her name, as he had always done—she said he had signed her name for her in the deposit book when she put the money in.</p>

I must have it; I shall require it shortly"—I am certain that was in February—getting towards the latter end, near the 20th—it was not in March—I believe she was confined the last day of March—it was not a fortnight before that that she came and asked if Lyons had got the money—the house we were lodging in belonged to Mr.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>—"March 9, 1867. Private. Honoured Sir,—Trusting you will not feel offended, but par<lb/>don the very great liberty I have taken, having struggled very hard in my house for eleven years to maintain my family, without any complaint being made by the police. If you will take my case into consideration, and be my friend at the coming licensing day, it will be for ever felt by your most obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">G. E. GURXEY</hi>. Robert Tubbs, Esq.") After that I received another letter—I think I received it on 10th April—it is dated the 8th—the prisoner applied on the 26th by attorney; he was present; the matter was heard, and his licence was refused—before I re<lb/>ceived the last letter I had communicated with my brother Justices, in consequence of which I made a communication to the Secretary of State by letter on 29th March.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose sometimes you are not able to attend? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am very seldom absent when I am in England; when I am absent they elect a chairman for the day—that has happened once a year if not twice—no one was appointed in that way in 1866, I was in England the whole year; I do not think I was absent a day from the Sessions—the Hon. Mr. Curzon was, I think, generally appointed as my substitute if he was there—I do not know when he sat last—the chairman is, gene<lb/>rally speaking, the most important member—he has not the casting vote—the licence is signed by a majority of the Justices present, and if they are equal there is no licence—on the 26th about twenty applications for new licences were heard, and we were kept very nearly the whole day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100025"/>
               <p>from eleven o'clock—it ought not necessarily to have come on on the 19th—the whole seventy applications were down for hearing, and a large majority, nearly fifty, were heard on the first day—we did not begin the new cases till the second day, the 19th, and finished them on the 26th—there is a list, but very often, when Counsel are on circuit, we take them out of their turn, it matters not to the Justices which they take—appli<lb/>cations I dare say were made to take cases out of their order, and very likely we took some which were low down, which, if application had not been made, would not have been heard till the 26th—these licences are I think very troublesome to the Magistrates, I have an instance of it here to-day, and very troublesome to the applicants, from the opposition of other neighbours and publicans, who do not like the monopoly to be interfered with—speeches are made by Counsel on both sides—your friend Mr. Poland does not generally appear for the Justices, he cannot—I have seen him there very often—the petition of the applicant is read, and is sometimes taken as read, and Counsel state the case—I do not think we ever have witnesses called unless there is some ill-conduct alleged against the applicant—they are called at the Sessions, but not at Petty Sessions, we are all so well acquainted with the neighbourhood—we are bound to hear everybody—if there are three Counsel I do not see how we can avoid three speeches—the Magistrates do not retire, we consult together—I have not known such a thing for years as our going out of Court—we do not make up our minds beforehand—I generally take the votes, and if there is a majority or not against the licence I declare it—I generally vote, but sometimes I do not—when an application is made to take a case out of its turn, it is generally addressed to the chairman, and I accede or decline, but if any gentleman on the Bench thinks it is wrong he would say "I do not think we ought to do that"—if the chairman says, "We had better take it," the Justices will consent—there are very often applications against the decision of the Justices to the Quarter Sessions—the Magis<lb/>trates for the county sometimes decide that the Magistrates for the petty sessional division have decided erroneously—I have sat on appeals—I got this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 11th March, and about an hour afterwards I went to Mr. Cornell, the clerk, and next morning I communicated with Mr. Curzon, the Magistrate, and mentioned having received the money—on the 19th I took the opinion of the Justices generally at the first meeting—on 27th March I went to see the Secretary of State, but Mr. Waddington was unwell and absent—I saw Lord Belmore, the political under-secretary—I know the prisoner's house, the Earl of Cardigan, Marlborough Road, Chelsea—he says that he has been in it eleven years—rl do not recollect the name of the great opposition house which petitioned against him—it is a very short distance off, 150 or 200 yards—I should say that it is not an increasing neighbourhood, and that there are no new houses in the dis<lb/>trict—I recollect his making an application in 1864, but not in 1865 or 1866—I have looked at my papers—I was present in 1865 and 1866—I have not been absent one licensing day during the time I have been chairman—I did not understand your question before to apply to licens<lb/>ing days—I said that it might be twice a year I was absent—I mean to say that for twenty years I have never been absent on the day that applications were made for new licences—I cannot recollect whether any appli<lb/>cations were made for any other houses in the neighbourhood that Jay, but the clerk is here—my servant received the letter.</p>

I am clerk to the Justices of the Kensington division, and have been so several years—a petition in favour and a petition against the licence has to be filed before the general annual licensing meeting—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the petition filed by the defendant—whether it was delivered by himself or his attorney I do not know—Mr. Martin, the solicitor, advocated the prisoner's case on the 26th for a licence for the Earl of Cardigan—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the counter petition by W. S. Smith—the defendant appeared personally on the 26th at London, attended by Mr. Martin—I saw him in Court before the matter was gone into or the notice proved—he was sworn and I examined him as to the due service of the notices—he swore that he had properly served them—the case was then heard in the ordinary way—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of the notice which was proved, I drew the notice myself in my own office—I have known the defendant very well in previous years, and have heard his case discussed when he has been present—the licence was refused, and he has never appealed against that decision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say that in previous years he has applied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in 1864, I think—I am sure he made three former applications, all of which were heard by the Bench and discussed—I had frequently seen him there—the last time-was in 1864, I think—to the best of my belief, he made no application from 1864 to 1867—he made two or three before 1864—I have to make a record of them—I am not aware whether the prisoner applied in 1863. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's petition, being produced, contained ninety-five signatures.</hi>) There has not been a licence granted in that immediate neighbourhood for twelve or fourteen years, the last was a house within a few doors of him, the one that opposes him now—there is only one signature to the opposing petition—there is no petition of the inhabitants against him—notice was given that the inhabitants would petition against him—the purport of the notice is, that the inhabitants may know that such an application is about to be made, and may oppose the petition if they please, and they do frequently oppose, but they did not in this case—the neighbourhood has not increased for the last ten years—the prisoner has had a beer-house eleven years.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I keep the Globe re<lb/>staurant, 4, Rupert Street, Haymarket—on 24th April I went to a ball in Newman Street, with ray brother Sebastiano, my cousin, Auguste Muston, the wife of one of the workmen, and two young men—we left the rooms in Newman Street about a quarter to three on Wednesday morning—I was alone, walking in the direction of Wardour Street—I saw the prisoner at the corner of Wardour Street—that was about six minutes' distance from the ball-room—he came behind me and asked me a question—I turned round to answer it, and he stabbed me—I was so confused I began to halloo—my brother came to my assistance, and he likewise received 'a stab with a stiletto—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received the blows on my left arm, two cuts—this is the coat I was wearing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had seen the prisoner in the ball-room that evening, and asked if he would have a glass with me, and he refused—that was about an hour previous to leaving the ball-room—when I received the stab I hallooed, "Assassin!" and "Murder I"—my brother, my two sisters-in-law, and two boys came up and held him till we got a policeman, and I was taken to the hospital—I was there fifteen days, and was afterwards an out-patient twice a day—I did not see the stiletto before I was stabbed—only when I received the stab. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here put in and read. It stated in substance that the prosecutor had insulted him at the ball and beaten him, and that on his leaving to go home he saw the prosecutor and his friends; that the prosecutor ran after him with a knife in his hand, which he wrested from him; that he was then attacked by them all, thrown on the ground and beaten, and that he used the knife in self-defence.</hi>) I saw no blows struck between my brother and the prisoner at the ball—I saw seven or eight persons together, but I could not see what it was—I saw a row, and my brother came back with his face all scratched—I asked him what it was, and he said it was nothing—I did not see the prisoner there then—I did not say to the prisoner, "You shall pay for this"—I did not run after him in the street—I had no knife in my hand, not even in my pocket—this is not my knife; it belongs to the prisoner—I did not see any one struggling with him before I was stabbed—he was by himself—he was held on the ground by my brother and another young man after I received the two stabs.</p>

               <p>some people in the room—I did not call to Sebastiano, telling him to come away and that I would settle the prisoner—I was quite sober—I could not drink anything, because I was sick—I never carry a knife—there was in one but the prisoner and me at the corner of Wardour Street—the others were fifteen or twenty yards before us, I mean my brother and sisters-in-law and the two boys, and Jane Muston—my brother and I did say about the prisoner in the ball-room that Raffael Fablis interfered and sepa<lb/>rated us.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that in a fit of morbid jealousy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I ex<lb/>amined him in connection with Dr. Gardner, the assistant physician to the lunatic asylum at Clapham, and we decided that he was in an unsound state of mind and dangerous to his wife, through this morbid state of mind—the history of his case would go to prove that his brain is pecu<lb/>liarly susceptible—he has been wild and odd for years past—then he took to drink and had delirium tremens, which did not yield to the usual reme<lb/>dies, showing the predisposition to irritability of the brain—when I got him over the delirium tremens he promised to be very careful in his con<lb/>duct, but he very soon recurred to drink, and then he got into this odd state of mind over and over again—Dr. Gardner said he was not fit to be at large—one of the symptoms which goes to prove insanity is, that he threatened his wife's life over and over again before other persons, and also his daughters, whom he used to love so much, and the young man was to go as well—his jealousy was entirely unfounded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I went to Bethnal Green Lunatic Asylum my wife gave me two tremendous black eyes—I was obliged to stop up stairs eight days before any one could see me.</p>

               <p>had quite time enough to allow his brain to be in a state of quiescence—I believe he has not attended to business for the last three years—he has been moving about and spending the money—I have not attended him for the last three years, but I attend persons in the neighbourhood, and I know all his movements.</p>

I am stationed at Tottenham—on Tues<lb/>day morning, 28th May, I was called to Mrs. Walker's house, and went up stairs to the bedroom about a quarter of an hour after I got there—I found the prisoner in bed, either asleep or pretending to be so—I took a blanket off the bed—he asked me what was the matter—I told him to lay quiet, that I wanted to look round the room to see if I could find any weapon—he said he knew I wanted him, but he had done nothing, he was innocent—I told him to dress himself, and we would go down stairs, that I was going to take him into custody for violently assaulting his wife—he dressed himself and came down—before he got to the bottom of the stairs he saw his wife and asked her what was the matter—she said, "Too know very well what is the matter"—he said he had done nothing, he wag inno<lb/>cent, she must have fallen out of bed.</p>

Solomon and Co., 131 to 134, Houndsditch, London, and sent it to the post by my assistant—I also wrote this separate letter of advice, which I posted myself, telling them what I wanted done with the watch—I had bought it of them last October; this is it, and this is the case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the case par<lb/>ticularly, by these two marks.</p>

I am a carver and gilder, of 20, Great St. Andrew Street—about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, 11th May, I was in my shop, when my father, the deceased, went to get some beer for supper—a few minutes afterwards I heard my sister scream, I ran outside and found my sister had just caught my father by the arms, he was about two feet from the kerb, lying down on the ground—he was perfectly insensible—his head was covered with blood, I saw a cab there, it had just passed over him—it was not more than an inch or two from him, ho was just behind the wheel; the cab was going on when I saw it—it went on for</p>

               <p>about three doors before it stopped, just at the end of street—the prisoner was driving it—he was drunk, I told him so directly I saw him—I assisted in taking my father to the hospital—it appeared to me as if his left temple was smashed—some persons in the street turned the cab round, I went to him and said, "You have run over my father, and you must take him to the hospital"—he would not answer me—he did at last take him—when we got there I asked him for his ticket—he said he was not going to give me a ticket.</p>

Q.</hi> Was there a crowd when you went out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some people were running over, directly they heard the scream, from the George public-house opposite, where he had been for the beer; there was a crowd in a very few minutes—there was a cab behind the prisoner—I could see the prisoner was drunk, by his ways, his face was red and he seemed going forwards on his cab, as if he was not able to control himself—I have seen men excited; he was quite drunk—I and another person went in the cab with my father to the hospital; I did not see any persons on the springs behind—I did not notice any one in the cab when I first came out—there were no cabs or conveyances going the other way; the prisoner was going up from St. Martin's Lane—the prisoner was sitting on his cab all the time, he did not get off—there was no policeman there, or I should have given him charge, I looked out all the way to the hospital and could not see one—there was a waterman at the hospital, but I had no idea he had power to take him—the porter at the hospital got the ticket from the prisoner after some demur.</p>

               <p>within about two feet of the kerb, and I saw the right-hand wheel go over his body—he was on his wrong side of the way, within about two feet of the lamp-post—after running over the deceased he crossed on the opposite side of the road, and went about two doors and a half from the spot—I ran over and seized the horse's head—I could not judge of the pace at which the cab was going; if he had been going at a proper pace he could have pulled up much quicker than he did—he was going very fast—I heard the deceased's son say he was drunk—I was too agitated to notice his state—he refused to turn round for a long while, till another person came to my assistance and turned his horse round—I did not say anything to him—I tried to pull his horse round to take the deceased to the hospital—he made no answer, but he did not offer to turn; we had to turn the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-frame maker, of 10, Drury Lane—on Saturday night, 11th May, about twelve o'clock, I came out of the George public-house with the deceased and a friend—I wished them good night, and he crossed the road to go towards his home—before he got across the cab came along, and, with the hallooing, the deceased got so frightened that he could not move; he kept quite still, and the horse must have knocked him down—I ran over, and was the first to pick him up—I can hardly say whether the cabman stopped his cab himself or not—it went on three or four yards, and Mr. Sharp ran out of his shop and fol<lb/>lowed</p>

                  </hi>. I am a money-changer in the Poultry—the prisoner was my confidential and only clerk—it was my custom about half-past four each day to send money from my establishment to the bank, and to receive it back in the morning through the prisoner shortly after nine—on the afternoon of 8th May I and the prisoner counted the Napoleons—his counting agreed with mine—he took those Napo<lb/>leons in the afternoon to the bank in a box—he had a key of that box, and I also had a key, but no one else—on 9th May I arrived at the Poultry about twenty minutes past nine—all the gold was in the window, as if it had been counted, and the prisoner was just counting a little silver—he could not have counted it in the time—the money is usually placed in the window about ten o'clock—I sent the prisoner to the bank to see if some drafts had been paid, and while he was gone I counted the Napoleons, and found three and a quarter short—when he returned I asked him to count them and tell me what he made them; he made them three and a quarter short, and I asked him how he accounted for it—he said he could not say, he did not know, but after thinking one or two minutes he said, "Oh! I know of three"—I said, "What do you mean? you know of three?"—he said, "I sold three this morning"—I said, "Where is the money for them"—"Oh!" he said, "it is all right; I sold them to a friend of mine"—I said, "What do you mean, a friend of yours? you have no right to sell any things to a friend of yours,"—he said, "It is all right, he will bring it round in the course of the morning or afternoon"—I asked him who this friend was, and he said, "A person named Evans, of Throgmorton Street"—I said, "I shall go round and ask him for the money"—the prisoner turned very pale, and said, "For God's sake don't"—I said, "What do you mean?"—lie said, "I will get it myself, it is all right"—I said, "Excuse me, I wish to see this Mr. Evans"—he begged of me two or three times not to go, and then said, "I must tell you that I have told a lie; the fact is that the day before yesterday, when you were absent, your brother came in, and I asked him to remain while I went over the way to get something to eat, and when I returned I found three missing, they were right before"—I told him I knew they were right the night before, and that I should go for my brother—he said, "I will go for him, let me go"—I said I would go myself—he is employed by Mr. Michael Abrahams, in the Old Jewry—I fetched him and brought him face to face with the prisoner and said, "Now what have you got to say?"—he could not say anything, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Bowater, a tailor, of Hanover Street, who employs a large number of men—the prisoner Jelly was in his employment for about three years until the strike took place, which was, I think, seven weeks ago last Monday—Hall was in Mr. Bowater's employ three weeks or a month previous to the same date—they both left at the same time—since the strike I have frequently seen them in Hanover Street speaking together, numbers assembled there conversing with each other, and as we were taking the work in connection with other members of the establishment, we were followed by them and a number of others—when people came away from the establishment they were followed in a very strict manner by these men, who have been <hi rend="italic">picketing us;</hi> they are very clever in following—on the Friday, about eleven o'clock, Mrs. Rattenbury, the wife of John Rattenbury, an engineer, of Middleton Buildings, was working for Mr. Bowater as a tailoress—I have been to her lodgings several times, followed by other people not in custody, who I have seen working on the board with the defendants as fellow-workmen, and who I have frequently seen with them watching the premises in Hanover Street—on Tuesday, 7th May, I went to Mr. Rattenbury's lodgings and found the prisoners inside on the first landing—I went up and saw Mrs. Rattenbury at the door of the room where she was working—she said, "Mr. Price, am I to be pestered with these men in this manner?"—I said, "No, I shall go for a policeman"—I hastened down, but could not find one—the prisoners were speaking to Mrs. Rattenbury, discussing the points, and she was very agitated—on my going down for a policeman they left her very quickly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journalist and Parliamentary reporter, carry<lb/>ing on business at 13, Paternoster Row—I know the defendant; I was introduced to him in September, 1865, upon a proposal to raise 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me upon the security of certain moneys in the hands of the Accountant<lb/>General of the Court of Chancery—Mr. Elworthy suggested, haying heard I was proprieter of a newspaper, that I should add that to the further security of the stop order of the Court of Chancery—I waited upon Mr. Elworthy at his office, in Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane, on Satur<lb/>day, 30th September, 1865, about making a declaration—I went with my wife, having seen him the day previously, and arranged by appointment to attend at his office—several papers were produced to me, among others the draft declaration—I perused that declaration; it was written on an ordi<lb/>nary long sheet of draft paper which solicitors use, like a sheet of letter paper laid out longways; it was blue paper, and I think there was a back sheet to it—I found it necessary to make alterations in the draft—I believe I made those alterations with a pen, sitting at his table—the first altera<lb/>tion was, he had described me as the sole registered proprietor of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100088"/>
               <p>newspaper, and I explained to him that the registration was not quite complete, for, although I had given the notice at Somerset House as re<lb/>quired by the Act of Parliament, the registration was not technically com<lb/>plete until the printer and publisher had attended and given sureties to the Crown against libels, which, however, was no part of my duty—I said, "We will strike out the word 'registered,' leaving it simply sole pro<lb/>prietor"—acting upon that, I struck out the word "registered"—follow<lb/>ing that, or in the same sentence, was this expression, "Registered as such at Stationers' Hall, in the City of London," or words to that effect—I have been over twenty years connected with newspapers, and was aware there was no such place of registration as Stationers' Hall; that attracted my attention immediately, and I struck out those words—the next alteration was this: in a sentence or two afterwards he had got the word "unen<lb/>cumbered"—I explained to him that at one time I had not been the sole proprietor, but had had only a reversionary interest in a portion of the copyright, and there might be some question arise as to whether I had encumbered it, and I struck out the word "unencumbered"—I don't think I made any further alteration; the rest was merely formal matter; I have no doubt whatever about the three I have mentioned: first, as to being registered; secondly, as to being registered at Stationers' Hall; and thirdly, as to the word "unencumbered"—after making these alterations I handed the draft declaration back to him, and shortly after that he said, "Will you step in the outer officer while I have it copied; or, as it is a fine morning, will you go and take a walk for half an hour, and come back again?"—having my wife with me, I said, "We will go for a walk in' Staple Inn, in the gardens, and return"—I and my wife then went away—we came back at twenty minutes to three—Mr. Hopwood, the solicitor, of Chancery Lane, who took the declaration, was there then; he was standing at the door with his hat on, and the handle of the door in his hand—Mr. Elworthy said, "I am glad you have come back; it is a short day with us, and I was afraid Mr. Hopwood would not be able to wait"—he then handed me the declaration—I saw that it was not in the same form as the draft; it was a printed one that he handed to me then. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Carter objected to any evidence being given of the contents of the draft de<lb/>claration, in the absence of any notice to produce it. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

(<hi rend="italic">The declaration was put in and read: it contained the words, "I am the registered and sole proprietor;" also, "they are both unen<lb/>cumbered</hi>") Within three or four weeks after this, Mr. Elworthy began making threats as to what he would do to me; he began to insist upon the</p>

               <p>declaration as I had signed it; he began to make threats that he would put me in Newgate if I did not pay him some money—I never saw the paper again until my trial; I believe it may have been handed to me at Bow Street, I am not quite sure, but I never saw it till a public occasion like that, one of the occasions—I attended at Bow Street on a charge of perjury nine or ten times—there were two summonses and several adjourn<lb/>ments, and both dismissed—I have never seen the draft declaration since—at the Guildhall Police-court, when Mr. Elworthy was under examination with reference to this charge, a paper was shown to me which was pre<lb/>tended to be the draft declaration; it was a small half-sheet of note-paper—I was asked if that was not the thing I called the draft declaration. (<hi rend="italic">It was put in.</hi>) I never saw that paper till I saw it at Guildhall the other day; it was not the draft, it was some private memorandum of his own, which I never saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see it has some reference to shares; can you explain that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a previous conversation on another day he asked me if I had any shares in any public stock; I mentioned some, and, amongst others, the Asiatic Banking Corporation, in which I had five paid-up shares; I suppose it refers to that—I first saw this piece of paper at the hearing of my case at Guildhall last month—the agreement says I was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that very day (30th September); I did not get any at all; he got the money, I did not; I got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Monday—ultimately I had 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque from the defendant, and the rest in instalments from his father, who is his partner—the whole arrangement for which I had made the bargain was rendered utterly useless—I had no money at all on the day it was proposed to be paid; the contract was to advance me the money on that Saturday, 30th September—I got the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on that day, too late for banking hours—90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether was advanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much was repaid of that 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had the order to receive the whole amount at any moment he liked after the 2nd November, when the Courts opened—he got 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in November, I paid him myself; I went with him to the Accountant-General's, and received 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a cheque, which I handed to him—I was present when the 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him, that was late in November, 1865—that money was paid by me to him in respect of this mortgage—I was subsequently tried at this Court—I defended myself—I suffered two months' imprisonment, I believe that was the smallest sentence his Lordship could pass: I went to trial, of course depending upon seeing the draft declaration—I came out of prison on 27th March last, and he caused me to be arrested at the door of the prison—I took proceedings immediately afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have had a good deal to do with legal matters, I believe, on both sides of the Court, civil and criminal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My busi<lb/>ness has been to attend the Law Courts for many years—I have only had actions with these people—I and my sister have not issued any writs against Mr. Elworthy—I suppose Mr. Elworthy was acting as solicitor for Mr. Honey, I don't know—I believe I have issued one writ against honey in relation to this matter—I will swear I have not issued seven, I believe only one; that action is pending now—I issued that writ the day before he commenced these proceedings against me, I believe, last year; it was for a claim against defendant's client and two other persons jointly, and criminal proceedings were taken against me to prejudice my action against them; I have no doubt of it—I got this money through Mr. Elworthy's hands—I went to him as a solicitor, because I was in want of money—Mr. Jenkins was not acting as my solicitor at that time; he took me to Mr. Elworthy's office—Mr. Jenkins is not a solicitor—he had been some years ago—at the time I signed this declaration, and after, he was certainly not acting as my solicitor—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I cannot help what he signed upon a document—it does not say there that he was soli<lb/>tor for me, it is signed "James Jenkins, solicitor"—he did not, as my solicitor, take me to Mr. Elworthy's office to raise the money, he only went as an old acquaintance of mine; I knew him acting as a solicitor years ago—this paper appears to be an office copy of an affidavit—that is not my signature. (<hi rend="italic">This was an affidavit, sworn by the witness on 22nd January, 1866, in an action of "Honey v. Cannon, in which were the words, "Elworthy agreed with me and James Jenkins, my solicitor, that a sum of </hi>10<hi rend="italic">l. should be paid for interest</hi>") I am now able to answer, I was not before; a solicitor practising as a conveyancer may act as a solicitor, and in that sense he was my solicitor, but not in common law matters: that was an inadvertence; I had known him some years ago when he did act for me as a solicitor, but he did not take out his certificate for some years: I met him one day and asked him if he knew any one who would lend 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once—he said, "I will take you round to a friend of mine who does business in agency," and he took me to Mr. Elworthy: in one sense he was my solicitor; techni<lb/>cally he was not, legally he was—for the purposes of the mortgage thing he was my solicitor, but not for any other purpose—I believe the mortgage was executed on 7th October—the declaration was signed on 30th Sep<lb/>tember—I don't know that he had become disqualified between those dates—that affidavit I expect was drawn by Mr. Jenkins, and he put in the words "my solicitor."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do attend to this, because really this document is entirely inconsis<lb/>tent with that account—here is a writ under the seal of the Court, dated 5th January, 1866, and your affidavit is dated 22nd January, 1866, so that the writ was long before the affidavit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I got leave to appear on the copy of the writ; I should state that there never was any copy served, an order was got for substituted service; there was no personal service—I believe I never received a copy of the writ; the copy is no doubt attached to the affidavit at the Judge's chambers, filed in the ordinary way—he had received 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., though he issued the writ for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave notice of trial.</p>

               <p>trial or any other time, except before the Magistrate—I never saw it be<lb/>fore my trial, unless it was at Bow Street—I have not sworn that I never saw it till May—I did not see it written; I don't believe I did—I gave Mr. Elworthy instructions, whether he took them down at the time I do not know—I will not swear I was not standing by when this piece of paper was written; he was writing at his table, and I was sitting at the other side—Messrs. Elworthy were perfect strangers to me, until Mr. Jenkins introduced them on 29th September—he asked me the questions about the shares and other matters, and very likely wrote down the par<lb/>ticulars—I do not know that this paper is in two persons' handwriting—I saw both the Messrs. Elworthy together when I went to the office—I went several times; sometimes both were there, and sometimes only one—I can't say the exact date I first saw the defendant; it was the latter end of the month—I did not go alone on the 29th; I went with Mr. Jenkins—I don't believe I first saw Mr. Elworthy, senior, and that he wrote down the nature of my application before his son came in—I won't swear he did not—I do not remember that his father said to him, "These persons are here making an application for money, you go on with it," and that he took the chair his father vacated and finished the remainder of the in<lb/>structions from my lips; they were together several times and alone several times—I don't see a very great difference in the handwriting of this paper; it is quite obvious that it may have been written afterwards—at the top there is a very little difference; two pens would make the dif<lb/>ference—one part is a little thicker than the other; I don't see any dif<lb/>ference in the writing—it is quite possible the latter part may have been added—I don't know that it was written in my presence—I tell you I never saw it till I saw it in this Court, I believe—I don't know that any instructions were taken down in ray presence; they were sitting at the other side of a desk; I could not tell from that distance what he was writing; he might have been writing that piece of paper or some other—questions were put to me as to what security I could give; I don't know whether the information I gave by way of answer was written down then and there; I swear I don't know—I dare say I told him what is written down there—I won't swear what he wrote; I don't know that he wrote that—I wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three or four days—I had not got ready money—I had plenty of money at command, some thousands; I only wanted it on a particular day; it was not to pay wages, it was to take up two bills; I don't remember what they were now—I have not got my book here with the entry—no doubt I represented that I wanted a portion of the money by Saturday night for wages—the defendant did not give me his own cheque, because he could not get the money from his client; I saw the clerk bring in the money from Mr. Honey, at eleven o'clock in the day—the defendant gave me the cheque after banking hours; the cheque was no use to me; I do not call a cheque money; it was not a bit of use to me till Monday, when I got the money: it was paid on Monday—I did not swear that I got no money at all; I said I never got any money on the Saturday, which was all I bargained for, and for which I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was pressed for just 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for those two purposes, and I did not get it after all in the way I wanted it—I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he sent me in a bill and sued for it over again, and objected to his own receipt because there was no stamp to it; here is his receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>what was left as security after all that was struck out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was not the security upon which I was borrowing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was bor<lb/>rowing it upon the money in Chancery, which was as good as a Bank post bill—I suppose the declaration was intended to show that I had not encumbered the fund; I had not encumbered it; the papers I had, that was what I told him at the time; that was why I struck out the word—when all this was struck out, he had still got the stop order—he declined to advance me the money upon what I produced, and required further security for the purpose of making out this bill, that was all; that is my belief; his client was amply secured before, as good as a Bank note—the money was in the Court of Chancery, and could not be got at by anybody but himself—this was intended as an additional security—I told him I did not mind how many securities I gave, because I was going to repay him the money—this was as a security, and very good security too—the words "Stationers' Hall" were most certainly in the draft declaration—I am quite certain of that—we had only one discussion upon that matter, I be<lb/>lieve—it was not struck out of the draft mortgage—anybody who has the slightest acquaintance with legal documents can see that that has been put in since; there are no initials to it—I am acquainted with legal documents, and I should have put my initials against the alteration before I signed it—I believe it has been done surreptitiously—if there is a second erasure without initials, I don't know that that proves anything; that may have been done in the same way as the first; it is a very important part, "and also the copyright"—I have been for some years connected with the pro<lb/>fession myself, and I believe I never signed a document without ticking the alterations in it; two solicitors having signed that, they would natu<lb/>rally have put their initials against it; as they have not, I say it is some evidence that these alterations were put in afterwards—I call "striking out" an alteration—if you look at the declaration you will find there is an alteration with initials to it, showing that was his practice, as it is in all solicitors' offices—I see that the words "Stationers' Hall" are struck through in the deed of 7th October; the draft of that document was no doubt discussed at the same time as the draft declaration, the week previous—I don't know whether the draft was sent to Mr. Jenkins; I have not the slightest idea whether Mr. Jenkins ever saw the draft—I don't re<lb/>member whether Mr. Jenkins sent the draft to me for my consideration—I know his writing—I think this in red ink is his writing; I should gay it was his; it is "Mr. Cannon says that this was not contemplated; see agreement, <hi rend="smallCaps">J. JENKINS</hi>"—this is the part struck out by Mr. Jenkins, "And whereas the said Thomas Cannon is the sole proprietor of the news<lb/>paper called the <hi rend="italic">South London News and Croydon Free Press</hi>, and is regis<lb/>tered as such both at Stationers'Hall and Somerset House;" I don't know that that was after I had signed the declaration on 30th September; I think very likely it was before—this is the rough draft of the deed; the deed was fully engrossed and made perfect on 7th October—the reference to Stationers' Hall is both in the draft mortgage and in the mortgage, and is struck out—I never saw the mortgage deed; that is, I never read it through; very likely the draft was sent to me by my attorney after the 30th September—I do not believe I ever saw it, though I will not swear I never did; but I do not believe I ever did—I saw the document that was prepared and executed from it—it contains the words that I struck out, according to your statement—I never read the deed, I looked through it to see if there are any alterations—I mean to swear that it was not read over</p>

               <p>to me before I signed it, and I never read it—Mr. Elworthy was acting as my solicitor, I trusted in him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that document executed in Mr. Jenkin's office, and did not Mr. Elworthy senior, when it was brought to him, say, "I am not satisfied with this; I will have it re-executed in my presence;" and was not that done again, and did not he sign his name to it afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever of the sort to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Jenkins your solicitor or not; and did he or not sign that deed as your solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He certainly did not sign it as my solicitor; I have explained what the relationship was between us—I never gave him authority to act as my solicitor in this matter—he was acting generally in matters in that way—I cannot explain it any better—he did not sign that deed as my solicitor, and act as my solicitor in the transaction, only as a friend; Mr. Elworthy was my solicitor—Mr. Jenkins told me that he was a very respectable man, and that I might employ him with safety.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not in that very document, which you had time and opportunity to see and inspect afterwards, solemnly covenanted that you had full title and good right to convey that which you say you struck out because you had no such right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my answer is, I do not believe I ever saw the draft, and I am certain I never read the deed—I had good right and title to convey at the time I signed the deed—I was not the registered proprietor—it was not unencumbered—I did not covenant that it was—I say I had full title to convey; those words have been kept in purposely—Jenkins was acting as the friend of Elworthy more than my<lb/>self, and has been all through the piece—I say that Jenkins has been a transgressor; he has betrayed me—I have not applied for a summons against him, only against Mr. Elworthy—I applied for a summons against Honey, Digby, Atherton, and Elworthy, for conspiracy—I did not include Jenkins, because I had no evidence against him—I was convicted here by the fraud of Elworthy in putting upon me a declaration which I had altered in draft—if this mortgage deed contains the same thing I tell you I never saw it—I did in my defence that Digby and Atherton had a great deal to do with the prosecution—I cannot say whether I said they were the real prosecutors—I said they were concerned in it more than any one else, and so they are now, Atherton is sitting there now instructing Mr. Elworthy</p>

               <p>and his solicitor also—Idid not prefer a charge at the Mansion House against Atherton—I did at Guildhall—my solicitor went into the case to some extent—the summons was never heard, it was dismissed because I could not get the evidence—I do not say that I had no case; I claimed to be bound over in that case in my own recognisance to prosecute the matter in this Court—Alderman Finnis dismissed the summons—I gave some evidence, preliminary evidence; that was all—I am going to prosecute Atherton—I have not done so this session on account of a mistake of the clerk at Guildhall; he did not return the depositions, and I could not—I have an affidavit of the circumstances: he will be prosecuted next session—two witnesses have died in the meantime—I have only known Mr. Honey since these proceedings—I do not make any imputation against him—an action hag been brought against him—there is an imputation against him, inasmuch as he is accountable for what his solicitor has done—he has utterly destroyed the newspaper—he told me at first that he knew nothing of Mr. Elworthy's proceedings—I wrote a letter to him on behalf of my sister to say that if he did not make some reparation I should go on with the action—I do not know that I am compelled to state what course I may take against Mr. Honey—I think both I and my sister have serious cause of complaint against him, whether there are criminal grounds for it or not I do not know, that is a question of law—this letter is my handwriting.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you found out that he was a liar towards you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not use that language, but it is quite correct—he told me something that was not true—when Elworthy got the warrant against me I went to Mr. Honey's house three times to tender myself in custody, and he told mo he knew nothing about the warrant—it was Digby and Ather<lb/>ton who were prosecuting me—they knew very well that I had a large claim against them for 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they adopted this malicious prosecution, and all the rest of it for the last twelve months, till they utterly ruined me—the proceedings were conducted in Mr. Honey's name by this man and his friends, and now they are all three gone to the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Court, and I have no redress in any other way—it is a matter of character with me; they have ruined my business—I have been in the City of London for twenty years, and never had a charge against me before, or an imputation—I do not charge Mr. Hopwood with being a con<lb/>spirator—he no doubt thought I had read the declaration—I dare say he heard all that passed on the occasion—I have not brought him here as a witness, because when I asked him the other day in this Court as to some of these particulars he said, "I do not remember anything about it, I can see that is my name, and that is the only thing I remember it by"—after that statement of his it was no use subpoenaing him here—he was present at the time Mr. Elworthy said, "You need not read it over; I have copied it myself, and I am sure it is correct"—he was talking to old Mr. Elworthy at one side of the room, and the other one was talking to me at the other side—I have not brought him here because he remembers nothing—he was not listening to our conversation—I will not swear whe<lb/>ther the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was struck out of the draft declaration; I do not remember—if it was struck out, there still remained as security the balance of the value of the newspaper—I did not represent the newspapers as belonging to me—I was not the registered proprietor—it was only on a technical ground that I objected to the word "registered"—I had given notice at Somerset House, and if an action had been brought against me for libel with respect to the paper I should have had no defence to it whatever—the notice which I wrote to Mr. Tilsley, of Somerset House, was dated 30th September, and Mr. Tilsley swore at this Court that he had it between ten and eleven on Saturday morning—that is the notice I speak of, and that is the only notice required by Act of Parliament.</p>

               <p>wished to be very careful about not having anything to complain of after<lb/>wards—you may depend on it Mr. Elworthy went to Somerset House, he would not have given me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unless he had perfectly satisfied himself on the point—he told me he had—the paper was worth 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if it had been encumbered to the extent of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would not have made any difference in the value of his security, not 5 per cent.—the thing pro<lb/>duced here to-day is not a copy of the draft—that was not a printed form—this was bought at a law stationer's and filled up—Atherton had a charge on the newspaper—that was my reason for striking out the word "unencum<lb/>bered"—Atherton had not a charge on it, but he swore he had—Digby, Atherton's partner, had a charge on my reversion for 153<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they held a document which they claimed to call a charge—I mentioned that to Mr. Elworthy, and that was why I struck out the word "unencumbered"—it was not unencumbered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have solemnly affirmed in the mortgage deed which was effected seven days after that you had good right and title to convey it, and that it was therefore unencumbered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say that has been done for the same reason as the declaration was done—it was never shown to me—I gave instructions to strike it out of the draft—I have told you several times that the deed was never shown to me—Mr. Jenkins was not present on the 30th September when I signed the declaration—I do not think he was there at all with me on Saturday—he was there on Friday—I do not believe he was present that day—I swear he did not go with me—I do not believe he attested the declaration I made that day—if you will show me anything he signed I will answer in a moment—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) I signed that—that would be done the first thing in the morning. (<hi rend="italic">That was dated 30th September, executed by Cannon, witnessed by James Jenkins, and was a charge on the fund in Chancery and on the two newspapers.</hi>) It was one newspaper, published in two forms, something like the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Evening Express</hi>, published at different times under different titles—for some reasons they may be called two newspapers, and for some reasons only one—I suppose I executed that document at Mr. Elworthy's office the first thing in the morning—I swore just now that I did not be<lb/>lieve Mr. Jenkins was there at all on the 30th; now you have refreshed my memory I dare say he was; but I don't believe it now; I believe he has added the words, "Witness, Jas. Jenkins," since—I know he told me that Mr. Elworthy had given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to come and give evidence in my favour—after that statement to me I would not call him—I have not the least idea where he is to be found—I thought he was here—if you will look at the depositions taken at Bow Street you will see that I asked Mr. Elworthy himself the question, and he admitted it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time see that draft of the mortgage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't believe I ever saw either the draft or the deed—all this first part, relating to the parties to the deed, is in Mr. Elworthy's writing—I don't know anything of the other writing—I don't believe I ever had this draft in my hands, or saw it anywhere—I did not see Jenkins or any one in reference to writing this word "<hi rend="italic">stet</hi>"—I told Jenkins the conditions upon which I agreed to borrow the money; I was very busy at the time, in fact I was going out of town, and he said, "If I look through the draft will you be satisfied?"—the draft mortgage was not long subsequent to the statutary declaration; the deed was executed on the following Satur<lb/>day; it was all done in eight or nine days—it was not read over when I executed it; I executed it at the defendant's office in Southampton Build<lb/>ings</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100099"/>
               <p>—my wife executed it at the same time—Jenkins's name appears to it as a witness; I can tell you the reason of that, he had a small commission for himself upon the completion of the transaction; so he took care to go every time—at the time I wrote the letter of 4th April I was in White<lb/>cross Street Prison, after having undergone my sentence from this Court; they arrested me upon a bill which I never had any interest in—Digby was formerly a printer in Chancery Lane—he was introduced to me by Atherton; they were partners, and printers of this paper of mine—I started the paper on account of my sister, partly with my sister's money, partly my own—I started it in her name, in March, 1865—it was regis<lb/>tered in her name, except for a few days, until the time it ceased to be published—the few days was when it was transferred to me, previous to this mortgage; it was only for a temporary purpose, to get this deed signed—it ceased to be published I think in January, 1866; it was stopped by Mr. Elworthy going to the printers and telling them it was his pro<lb/>perty, after the mortgage had been paid off; that was a long while before the proceedings taken against me at Bow Street; the money had been paid months before.</p>

               <p>the other—I drew to the fire that day to warm myself, and I was close to my son's desk—we have a call-book in our office, in which our clerk puts down each day what goes on there—I know my son was not there on the 7th October, when the mortgage was effected—I think he was out of London—here is a minute in the call-book: "Saturday, 7th, Mr. Jenkins called, Mr. and Mrs. Cannon," and opposite the name is "senior"—that would have reference to myself—my son was not there—this is not my writing, I do not keep the book, it is kept by one of the clerks—I make entries from it—this will not enlighten me as to whether my son was there or not, but I know he was not there—he was out of London, and had been, I think, for several days—I drew a draft of the mortgage, and submitted it to Mr. Jenkins, Cannon's solicitor, I received it back from him—there is some note on it in Jenkins's handwriting—he struck out several portions—I put the word "stet" here—although this was objected to, it was inserted in the mortgage deed when it was engrossed in full—I remember Mr. Cannon and his wife and Jenkins coming to the office on the 7th October—Jenkins brought the deed executed by his clients, which I thought rather singular, and I would not have it—I said, "You must take the pen and go over it again, and I will witness it myself," and they did so—my name appears under Jenkins's—his was there before—they went through the formality of re-executing the deed in that way—the balance has not been paid yet.</p>

               <p>Southampton Buildings being mine, when my son obtained his certificate I handed the business over to him—I became a partner about a year and a half since, or two years, I really cannot tell—I ceased to be a partner when my son's misfortunes happened the other day—he over-bought himself, and came to grief, and he is now going through the Bankruptcy Court—I then ceased to be a partner of his—I am carrying on the business now in my own name—the letter E in the call-book is for me, and S is for my son—where E. S. occurs both are present—I think Mr. Honey was there on 30th September, late in the day—we had not Mr. Honey's money on the 30th—my firm belief is that we had not a shilling of it then—I fancy not—I cannot recollect, it is so long since, but he sent me the money in a parcel, and I opened it before Mr. Cannon—I cannot tell whether that was about eleven in the day, I know there was a parcel I received in my son's absence—it was brought to me by the clerk—I fancy it was after this, not on the 30th, but really I cannot say the day—I perfectly recollect now that Mr. Honey had deducted his commission or bonus—we do not keep a cash<lb/>book, we have an expenditure and receipt book—it would not be in that, because it was a matter of loan—it would only contain the office disburse<lb/>ments and receipts—we should put costs in the book—we should not enter moneys as received from clients—I really cannot say whether an account was kept between Mr. Honey and my son, or between Mr. Honey and the office—there was no banking account for the firm—I had nothing to do with the cash at all—my son had a pass-book—I never saw it, or very seldom—I had no banking account of my own—I served my son for a year and a half, I think—you may call me a clerk, if you like—he made me a decent allowance to assist him, that is the genteel way of putting it—I took out no certificate for twelve months, I think—I had not this small document in my possession at Bow Street on the occasion of Mr. Cannon's examina<lb/>tion—I do not know where I saw it—I think it was just previous to his committal, or about his committal—I might have seen it, I cannot say that I did—I will not say I did not see it at Bow Street, I think it was there when there was an adjournment—I think there were two adjournments—I believe I was there twice—the case was adjourned because the Magis<lb/>trate said, as my son had written the body of the declaration, he must attend—I will not swear I was not at Bow Street four times, I think it was only twice—I cannot recollect that I saw that document there—it must have been in the bundle of papers that were there—I suppose our clerk, Mr. Wyatt, took them—I really cannot tell whether this was in it—it was very likely to have been so—it is very likely that I read it through—it is very probable that it would be compared with the body of the statutory declaration, I cannot say it was so, I have forgotten all about it—I cannot recollect whether I read the document at Bow. Street; I will not swear I did not—I went into the case, and I dare say I produced this and the declaration, and all about it, but I cannot recol<lb/>lect—my son was absent at the time—I remember going and seeing Mr. Cannon's sister, I did not threaten her that I would put her brother in Newgate—I cannot recollect saying anything of the sort to any one—I have not done it, it has been done by my son—if a client consults my son I generally attend to that myself, but if it is a common law matter my son takes it from me, or the clerks—if he commences a business I do not in<lb/>terfere—I went to Mr. Honey to bespeak this money, but my son conducted the business as between him and Cannon—my son was not managing the prosecution at Bow Street—Cannon could not be found, and a reward was</p>

I was thirteen years old five weeks ago, and live with my father and mother at Woolwich—on Saturday, 4th May, I was out late, and was in the Bloomfield Road about 11.30, and met the prisoner—she asked me to fetch her half a quartern of coarse oatmeal at the corn chandler's, and gave me a half-crown—I went to Mr. Hand's for it—Mrs. Hand gave me a small quantity to take to the prisoner, and I went and gave it to her—she said, "There is not much here"—she said nothing about the change—a policeman came up and took her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 6, Beresford Street, Wool<lb/>wich; I receive an allowance of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and draw it monthly—on 13th May I met the prisoner; he spoke to me, and at his request I went to the Woodman public-house and had some ale—I had in my purse three sovereigns and five shillings mixed with some coppers—it was in the right pocket of my dress—the prisoner was on my right side, and another soldier on my left—I saw my purse in the prisoner's hand, and said, "That is my purse, give it me"—he said, "It is all right, drink"—I thought he was joking—I asked him for it several times, but he still kept it, saying, "Drink, it is all right"—I went to the people at the bar and asked them to get me a policeman, but, as one did not come, I went to the door to get one—I then went back and begged the prisoner to give it to me—he showed me another purse with gold and silver in it, and said he had plenty of money belonging to him, he did not want mine—I followed him and gave him in charge—I had noticed a scratch on one of the sovereigns—my purse buttoned over with a brass button—this is the sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is marked across the nose—there was a scratch similar to this and I recognise it—I was sober.</p>

               <p>May, about four o'clock, I let Miss Bell out at the front door, and went down into the kitchen—my mistress was not there—I went into the break<lb/>fast-room, which is on the same floor as the kitchen, and saw a stream of blood flowing towards the cupboard—it came from the deceased, who was lying with his head near a packing-case, and his feet on the hearthrug—I went up stairs to my mistress, and asked her what was the matter—she said, "He aggravated me, he aggravated me, he made me do it, I was obliged to do it"—she was then up stairs, near her bedroom door—I left her and came down stairs to call my master from the drawing-room—my mistress appeared very wild, and her eyes appeared to be starting from her head, and she was rolling herself backwards and forwards on the stairs, and wringing her hands—I met my master coming from the drawing-room, and asked him to go down and see what was the matter with Master Willie—he went down, and I was on the stairs when he brought the child in his arms—I went for Dr. Hope—I met him in the Florence Road—I also fetched Mrs. Cofferton, a neighbour—when I returned my master was up stairs holding my mistress in the bedroom—the knife was in the breakfast-room, lying on the table—there was blood on it—it was a large-bladed knife, with a white handle—I had cut the child a piece of bread and butter about three o'clock that afternoon, and left the knife and bread and cheese on the packing-case—that was about twenty-five minutes before I saw him bleeding—he was sitting at the table writing in a copy<lb/>book, and his mamma was sitting on the opposite side with her arms folded—that was the last I saw of him alive.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That was about an hour before you saw him with his throat cut, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was about twenty-five minutes to four, and it was about four, or it might have been a little after, that I went down stairs and saw him lying with his throat cut—this is a common bread knife—I had taken it in with the bread and butter a short time before—I had been with Mrs. Bell about ten months—she was always very kind to the little fellow—he was a healthy child—I saw her after this was done—she appeared wild—she was wringing her hands and throwing herself forward—she seemed like a person out of her mind—a few weeks before this I had washed a napkin for her, it was stained, but not much—I had never washed one for her before—I believe she is fifty-six years of age—she was clean in her underlines but she wore the same dress the whole time I was there—she did not change it—she was a very kind mistress to me—she appeared in a very melancholy kind of state—she would sit with her arms folded and not say anything to you—she would just walk up and down, and be in a very melancholy way—she would continue in that state perhaps for an hour or more at a time—she seemed to me to continue the same as usual—I did not notice her getting worse—I have observed this from the first time of going into the service—I cannot say how often I have observed her in this melancholy state—she would often be so, walking about in and out—lat<lb/>terly she was very fidgetty, and she would frequently be behind me when I was not aware of it—I would be standing doing something in the kitchen, and when I went to turn round I would see her behind me—I did not kuow that she was there—she would not speak—it would startle me to see her there—she gave no explanation for it—she has looked the same at those times—I did not notice anything particular in her more than usual—I did not say anything to her about it, because I did not take notice of it till this occurrence, and then it occurred to my mind—on the Thurs<lb/>day,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100114"/>
               <p>as the child was killed on the Saturday, I remarked to Miss Bell how fidgetty her mamma was when we were doing her bedroom—when I had put the blinds up she told me that I had done them wrong; I had done them right, and she would come and ask me why I did the stove in that way—I had brushed it with black-lead; that was the proper thing to do, but she was fidgetty, and says a thing was wrong when it was right—when I showed her how I had put the blinds she was satisfied—I could not have put them any other way because of the cords—it was impossible to have done them as she wanted—she never went out of the house the whole time I was there, not even in the garden—on the same Saturday that the little boy was killed I took some spoons into the room and dropped one, Mrs. Bell was apparently asleep, and my dropping the spoon dis<lb/>turbed her, she looked up very wild and asked me why I wanted to drop the spoon and disturb her from her sleep—I had never noticed her speak so crossly to me before—I observed a peculiar wild look about her, and I was glad to get out of the room away from her—that was about half-past three o'clock.</p>

               <p>packing-case towards the cupboard—he was quite dead—the wound in the neck was the cause of death—it was a most frightful gash, extending almost from ear to ear in front, right down to the backbone—I saw a knife lying on the table; it was marked with blood; it appeared perfectly fresh; in fact, apportion of it was not congealed—I subsequently examined the body more minutely—in my opinion, attempts had been made to cut off the head after the wound was inflicted—I then went up stairs—I found the prisoner pacing the room and her husband following her, watching her—she was in a very excited state, moving backwards and forwards; she was not crying; the husband appeared also greatly excited, pacing the room in quite an agony—he said, "What are you going to do now? You have killed my child; what are you going to do to yourself?"—she made no answer; I should say she did not appear to understand what was said—she wished to go to a particular drawer—I said to her, "What are you going to do?"—I took hold of her hands to prevent her, and said, "What made you do it"—she replied, "He aggravated me to do it"—she asked for water or tea; I would hot allow her to have it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a telegraph clerk of 6, Milton Court Road excatly opposite one of the shop windows of 6, John's Terrace—on 28th August I came down late, and was attracted by the breaking of glass—I went into the parlour, looked out of the window, and saw smoke coming out of the shutters of the shop opposite—it was about one o'clock—I saw nobody there—I went outside, and a man and woman came from the shop, from the direction of the side door—I cannot identify either of them—when I first saw them they were near the middle of the road about half<lb/>way between the corner of the shop and the side door but I could not see the side door exactly—I said, "Ain't you going to fetch some one? "or something like that—they did not seem to endeavour to raise any alarm, so I thought I must, and ran off in my shirt sleeves to fetch assistance—I woman said, "Cannot you save that box? the fire is not at the back"—I got assistance, and saw the fire got under—when I came back there was a box in my garden—I was informed that Bond afterwards fetched it—he had his clothing on and his hat, and the girl had on a bonnet and a walking dress.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on the night of the fire I came down from London by the twelve o'clock train, and went into the kitchen to have some supper—I heard glass breaking, and ran into the parlour and saw smoke coming from the kitchen to the shop—I ran out to the gate, and saw a male and female running in a direction from the side door, which I could not see—they stood in the road and looked on—I said to the female, "Do you belong to the shop?"—she said, "Yes—I said, "Is there any one else in the shop, cannot you save something? "and she turned round to the man and said, "There is that box the fire has not got to it yet"—the man then went towards the side door and fetched a box—I think he must have fetched it down stairs, because I heard a noise, as if somebody was dragging a box down the, stairs—I said "Put it here" and he put it in our garden—either he or the girl gave me</p>

               <p>a black satin skirt, which I afterwards saw Mrs. Bond wearing; it was trimmed with velvet, and I remembered it again—there was no one to own the box, and it was taken inside our house, and remained there three or four days, till Mr. Bond came for it, and I gave to him—the man I saw in the road with the girl was a dark man—Nye is the man, to the best of my recollection—he had his hat on, and the female had a black bonnet on I think—they were fully dressed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Southsea Buildings, Southwark Road—I relieved the fireman at six o'clock in the morning after the fire, and the foreman showed me over the premises to show me what I had to watch—I had no conversation with Bond—he was in the house next morning—I was there sixty days altogether—during that time I talked to Bond several times about the fire—he said he had left somebody in possession while he was gone to Norfolk, and he did not know where the man was or where to find him—the neighbours had told me something, and I said, "There was a female here with the man that was in possession"—he said, "I left no female here when I went away"—on the first or second night after the fire some goods were brought there, and I helped to move them out of the van—some short time afterwards I said to Bond, "I will tell you what it is, Mr. Bond, you will never receive any insurance without you find the man who was in possession at the time of the fire"—he did not say before I went whether he liad found him—he came home one night and said, "I cannot find him, perhaps he has gone to Norfolk for what I know, he is a countrymau of mine"—nobody that I have seen here came to the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 8, Bed Lion Street, Clerkenwell—in September or October last I became acquainted with a person named Hayho, and shortly afterwards went to his office, 10, Baaing-hall Street, where I made the acquaintance of the prisoner Nye—Hayho introduced him to me—I met Hayho and Nye at my house the same night;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100122"/>
               <p>they spoke about the fire, and several other fires—Nye has told me that he keeps a general shop, and sells beer and all sorts, in Bromley—they spoke about a fire at Bond's, but I did not know Bond, and did not pay particular attention—Hayho said that it was a bad job, and asked Nye how he thought it would end—this was some time in October, about three weeks from the time I first saw Hayho, and before I was introduced to Bond—the conversation was chiefly about my being put into business—they conversed about fires—I do not recollect the particulars, but they made a jest of it, and seemed to be merry, and said that the money was coming—I after<lb/>wards met Nye and Bond at my house, not Hayho—I went down to Bromley with Hayho to see Nye, and saw him there—I went there to complain of Hayho not putting me into business as he said—they were taking some refreshment together, and Nye said, "I think she is a good one, and will go through it," meaning me; and Nye said he wished he had got a little money; he had got plenty of stock in his shop to go into two or three places—I was to meet Nye next morning at the Bow station to go with him to search for a house; I promised to do so, and Hayho said in Nye's presence that I was to state myself to be a crinoline manufacturer—I promised to meet him next morning, and did so—Nye was there; he he said we were not to walk together, he would walk first, or I would walk first; we were going to Stratford New Town, and we must not be seen together, for he had had a fire there six months before, and it would not do for him to be seen with me—we came to a house where there was a card in the window, "A house to let"—we made inquiries, and it belonged to Dr. Sweeting—I went to him and came back and spoke to Nye—I told him that I had taken the house, and inquired the terms, and all was satisfactory, and Dr. Sweeting would like a reference—I said, "It is a good house"—he said, "Yes, it is in the corner and could not stand better," the house was at Stratford New Town, by Bromley—after some further conversation concerning fires, which I cannot recollect, Nye asked me if I had ever been to the Surrey Theatre; I said, "No"—he said he should want me to go there some windy night, when the house we had taken would soon come down—he said, "Choose a windy night, old girl"—I said, "Then I suppose you mean to have a fire here?"—he said,' "I suppose Hayho has told you all about it"—I said, "He has not;" he has given me to understand that I was to have some machines there and to put a card in the window, and style myself a crinoline manufacturer, but I was not aware that a fire was to take place"—on passing the Phoenix Office, Nye said, "There, girl, there is the office where you will have to go and insure"—I took the house, but did not take possession—I did not go there—I had not been introduced to Bond at that time—there was a conversation in Nye's presence about a fire in Nye's house before I was introduced to Bond, but I did not feel interested in it, and did not bear it in my mind—on the second day after that Nye brought Bond to my house, 2, Napier Street, Deptford, and intro<lb/>duced him as Mr. Bond, the man who had had a fire in Milton Court Road, Deptford—Nye said he had been to Bond's, and there was not sufficient furniture there, as Hayho had represented, to go to this house which I had taken in Stratford New Town—I afterwards had conversations with Nye and Bond almost daily about Bond's fire—after we were at Stratford I went to see Mrs. Bond, and she supposed that I was really going to take the house to set fire to it—Bond and Nye inquired of each other what they thought of it, whether it was a bad job; and Bond inquired whether he</p>

               <p>must keep quiet—Nye said that he must, for he thought he had better not come forward—nothing was said about the insurance—they also said that Mr. Perry had some suspicions about the machinery, and did not feel satisfied about paying them—I met them on different occasions at my house, and Nye told me that he had set fire to Bond's house, and that Bond had employed him, and that he was going to give him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said that all had been prepared by Hayho, it was one of Hayho's messes; he had spoiled the thing—Nye said that he knew all about it, it had been arranged between them, and that Bond went to a coffee-shop by the Monument to sleep the night, and that he was to be at Bond's house to set the place alight, and was to go to the coffee-shop next morning—he mentioned the girl, and I wanted to know who she was—I had not seen, her then—he said that all preparations were made, and they had a bottle of gin and enjoyed themselves, and that after Bond left, he went into the shop and set light to it—I asked him what girl he meant, but I do not recollect his answer—he told me that a girl was in the house that night with him, that Bond had supplied a bottle of gin, and the bottle was left on the floor—I asked him how the girl came to be with him, and whether her parents were willing—he said they had known him some years, and would trust the girl anywhere with him; she had been out with him before—Bond was not there then—I went afterwards to his house and he to mine—he said he first went into the shop and set alight to that, and that there were machines there, but I cannot tell you the conversation—when Bond was present on another occasion Nye said he did not know how he should manage him—he wished him to go to Bromley—Bond said, "Oh! you must go into the country, the same as I did"—he said that him and Mrs. Bond were sup<lb/>posed to go into the country, but they went and slept at a coffee-shop at London Bridge, near the Monument—Bond said that Nye was there for the purpose of setting the fire off, and that the morning after the fire Nye came to the coffee-shop where he was sleeping; I understood him to say about half-past six in the morning, and told him that the fire had ccurred—Bond said that Nye had not done it to his liking, and Nye said he would do it better next time—the lace was shown to me—the first night I saw Mrs. Bond, a Sunday night; she showed me all the pieces of lace and a piece of silk—everything was said to be sent there by a man named Hayho, but they would have nothing more to do with him, when they got over this they would have a job by themselves somewhere—the lace was spoken of in Bond's presence up stairs—pieces of silk were Binged, and singed in large folds, but it had not been burnt altogether, and I said, "How re<lb/>markable!"—they said I was to have some pieces of lace to make up for bonnets—the lace was slightly marked—they said it came from Hayho's, and had been singed in another fire—I asked them where the lace was, and they said, down in the shop—I saw Bond and Nye continually, and had several conversations with them about the fire—Bond said that Mr. Perry should tell him they would not pay until the man who slept in the house the night of the fire was brought forward—Nye was there when he said that—on one occasion Nye, Bond, and I went down to Bromley together to meet Hayho; at least I went with Hayho, and Nye and Bond met us there—we came across a fireman named Jones in a public-house, but I did not hear the conversation between them—we were all inside—I do not recollect going out until we all left together—Jones left first—he had drunk with us inside—we met him outside—Hayho or Nye asked him in—I think Hayho—nothing passed particularly about the fire—the inter<lb/>view</p>

               <p>at my house on Saturday was after the visit to Bromley—Mr. and Mrs. Bond and Nye were present—it was Jones said Mr. Perry had refused to pay till the man was brought forward—I believe that was at the latter end of September, and it was in October we went to Bromley—they said the office would not pay, and they did not know what they should do—Bond said that as they seemed to want to see the man who slept in the house, would it not be better for Nye to go forward, and it was arranged that he should go on the Monday morning to the office—he was to meet Bond <hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi> on London Bridge—Nye said it would be better for him to shave off his moustache—when the arrangement was made for him to go Nye said, "D—it, old boy, I must not go as Nye, I shall go as Noble"—he did not say why he should take that name—he said that I was to go to 1, Victory Street, Dockhead, to represent myself as Mrs. Carrow, should any one come from the office to inquire—Nye and Bond had arranged to meet each other on London Bridge in sight of a police constable, and to take notice of his number, and bring the constable forward, that it should look like business—it was arranged that Nye was to say at the office, if they asked him, that he was a single man, living on his means at Victory Place, Dockhead, and that sometimees he was at home and sometimes out; that he bought and sold again, and was sometimes away for weeks together, and that he was the man who slept in the house on the night of the fire, and that, owing to some words and blows between him and Bond, he had disappeared, and kept out of the way, because Bond had <hi rend="italic">rascallied</hi> him like a pickpocket, and that he was not aware when he went to the office that Bond was insured; otherwise he should have come forward before—I went on the Saturday with Bond and Nye to 1, Victory Place, and saw, Mr. and Mrs. Carroll and their daughter Mary; and Bond told me then that Mary Carroll was the girl who was at the fire—Nye was not present then—I went to Victory Place, Dockhead, on the Monday, but nobody came from the insurance office—I saw Nye again about the middle of the day (Bond was not there)—he said that he had been to the office, and he inquired if anybody had been from the office, and asked me and Mrs. Carroll if we saw any difference in him—we said, "No"—he said, "Cannot you see that my moustache is taken off?"—he said he had been to the office and represented himself as Mr. Noble, and he thought the office was now satisfied and the money would be paid in a few days, and he wished he had gone forward before; that they asked him what his occupation was, and he said he bought and sold, and was sometimes out and sometimes at home; that he was single and had lived there upwards of two years, and he left his address, 1, Victory Place, Dockhead, if they wanted anything further—he is not single; he is married—I went home to my house that day, and Mrs. Bond was there; Bond came in in the evening, but not Nye—they said that they were glad Nye had gone forward, and they thought all would be right in a few days—I saw Bond and Nye again the next week—Nye told me the office had paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe they had notice of when the office was going to pay; Nye came in, and Bond went home—Nye said that Bond had got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was a small sum, and he regretted it was not more, and he should not ask him for anything, and he thought all parties ought to keep quiet till some<lb/>thing fresh turned up—I only saw them once or twice, I think, after that—I have not always gone by the same name; my proper name is Freer, but I go by the name of Cousins—I have since this, and before I gave information, several times applied for money to Nye, but have received</p>

I am an assessor of losses by fire to the London Assur<lb/>ance Company, and live in Blomfield Street, Finsbury—I remember the fire occurring in Milton Court Road—on 28th August I went to inspect the premises—I saw some goffering machines and winding machines in the shop—they were incomplete, not in working order, apart from the injury by the fire—I saw sixty burnt cardboard boxes in the back parlour; also a deal box about three feet long and twenty wide, full of cuttings of various sorts, burnt; nothing perfect, all pieces—the box itself was not burnt—in the basement I saw two sacks of shavings, one partly emptied out and strewed about under the stairs—on 1st September I received a claim from Mr. Rumsey with respect to the premises—this is it—it is for 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were insured for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Rumsey called with the claim, but I never went into any settlement with him—I told him, from what I had seen, that I was not satisfied with the appearance of the place, and he said he would not be answerable for the claim, he merely left it with me; I did not see him after that; he did not come by way of getting a settlement or anything of the sort—on 11th September I made inquiry among the firemen; I made inquiry where the machines had come from—I went down to the house on the morning of the fire—I did not see Bond that morning; I saw Mrs. Bond, and Bond called on me the following morning—I asked him the cause of the fire; he could not tell me anything about it—he told me he had slept at a coffee-house in Fish Street Hill that evening with his wife, intending to go to Norfolk next morning, and that he had placed a person in charge of the house while he was away—I asked him to produce the person—he said he could not find him; he had not seen him since he had come to inform him about the fire in the morning—he called several times afterwards, and never could produce Noble, which was the name he gave—on 15th October he called, and I told him that he would not get his money without producing Noble—in November he brought Nye, and introduced him as the man who was on the premises on the night of the fire—I asked him if he could account for it—he said he could not—I asked if he was in bed at the time of the fire—he said, yes, he went to bed about ten o'clock, and was awoke about one in the morning by the fire—I asked if he was alone in the house—he hesitated at first, but afterwards admitted that he had a young woman there to sleep with him—I asked him what he was—he said a commission agent—he also told me the same tale about Bond going to Norfolk, leaving him in charge of the house, and that he went to Bond next morning to let him know of the fire—Bond told me that the reason he had not brought him before was that they had had a quarrel, and that he met him accidentally on London Bridge and had brought him on to me—Nye was present when Bond said this—Nye gave an address somewhere in Dockhead; I don't think it was written down; our clerk can tell you; he was present on pretty nearly all the occasions; to the best of my memory it was on 9th November that Bond and Noble called—I think the money was ultimately paid in De<lb/>cember—this is the receipt—it is dated 9th November—it is for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the cheque, with Bond's endorsement—it was paid to him—it is dated 9th November; the manager paid him—I asked Bond if he had not had a fire at Greenwich; he said, "No"—he told me he had had two fires in Norfolk, but he was uninsured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Perry—I remember a claim being made with regard to this fire, and I had several interviews with Bond on the subject—on 11th September he called to ask when the business would be settled—I had several interviews with him after that—on Monday morning, 15th October, he called with Nye, who he described as Noble—he had no moustache then—I know it was 15th October, because I put it down in the diary—he said that he and Bond had fallen out on the morning of the fire, because Bond accused him of having set fire to the place, that they had high words and came to blows, when Nye was so disgusted with Bond's treatment that he was determined not to speak to him again, that he happened to meet Bond <hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi> on London Bridge that morning, and Bond asked him to come on to the office, because they would not pay his claim until he produced the man who slept in the house on the night of the fire—he said that was the first time he was made acquainted with the fact that Bond was insured, and to oblige him and get him out of the difficulty he would come forward—he said that if Mr. Perry was not satisfied of his respectability or with his story, he was to go to Victory Place, behind the Feathers, Dockhead; I fancy he said No, 7, I did not make a note of the direction at the time, Mr. Perry took it down, it was at a Mr. Carroll's—Bond called subse<lb/>quently to that, I think it was three or four days afterwards; that would be about the 19th—he said that he was getting sick of the business, hang<lb/>ing about, and offered me 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I would get the claim settled for him—while Bond was there a person named Appleby came in, and said he had been told by a stranger named Voy, that we had some goffering machines for sale at New Cross—I had previously made inquiry of Bond as to where he had got these machines—he said he had been introduced to a person named Matthews, who had introduced him to a person he did not know, to buy them—he said he had given considerably over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, but they were worth 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on that same day, afterwards, I saw Bond, Appleby, and Hayho walking down Moorgate Street, in earnest conver<lb/>sation—on 20th October Bond called and said he had received a letter that if he offered Mr. Perry 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would settle the claim at once; he made a further offer of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me—I accused him of being in Hayho's company—he said he had never seen Hayho before that day—I told him that I could account for his conduct in offering the money, after seeing the company he was in—I then asked him again respecting the origin of the fire, and he told me the same tale he had before, that he did not know—I asked him if he had had any other fires—he said only one, in Norfolk—I asked if he was sure of that—he said, "Yes, I can call God to witness that was the only fire I have had"—I then said, "The fire in Norfolk, I suppose, was before the one you had in Market Avenue, Greenwich?"—he was completely taken aback, and was going to deny it at first, and then he wanted to know who told me—I declined telling him—he then said he would go back and be the death of the fireman—he referred to the fireman Smith, the witness—I told him he need not do anything of the sort, for I did not get my information from the fireman.</p>

I am the wife of George Capern, who keeps the Prince of Wales beershop, 185, New Kent Road, about two minutes' walk from the last witness's—between eight and nine on 27th May the prisoner came for half a pint of beer—he gave me a shilling, which I placed on a shelf by itself—after that he had some more beer and tobacco, for which he paid me in coppers—he then called for a cigar, for which he paid me with a shilling—I tried it and found it bad—I told him so, and he said he had taken it at the Grown and Anchor public-house, and he would take it back—he snatched it up—I then looked at the one he had given me pre<lb/>viously, and found that was bad—I told him so, and he muttered some<lb/>thing and walked out—he was brought back and given into custody.</p>

Dock head, Bermondsey—about a quarter-past two on the morning of 9th May I was aroused by a constable—I went down stairs and found the front door open—the fanlight had been forced in—I found Biggs concealed behind the counter—a man would require assistance to force in the fanlight—my shop is part of the dwellingliouse.</p>
