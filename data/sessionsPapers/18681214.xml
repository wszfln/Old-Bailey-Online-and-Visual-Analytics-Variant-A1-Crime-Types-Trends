I am an interpreter, and live at 19, Charles Street, Euston Square—I know the prisoner; he called on me some time ago, and showed me a letter which he said he had received from his agent at Dunkirk, that he expected a bill of lading, and he had confidence in me to undertake the landing and sale of the cargo, which was about 100 tons of potatoes—</p>

               <p>he then said "Will you be so kind as to advance me some money till my ship comes in?"—I said No, I should go over to Dunkirk and see if the ship was there—he said "All right, you can go"—I went to London Bridge to take the boat to Dunkirk—the prisoner said "It is no use to go there and spend 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you had best stop till to-morrow, and the ship will be here"—so I did not go—this is the bill of lading he showed me—I said "If the ship will be here to-morrow, I will give you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I handed him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold: that was on the faith of the bill of lading—next day I went to the Custom House to inquire if such a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Mary Adelaide</hi>, had arrived—I did not find her—I telegraphed over and got a reply—I never saw the ship at all—I saw the prisoner four or five days after, and gave him into custody, but the inspector discharged him because I had not evidence enough—when I charged him he said, "Oh, I am my ship's captain, you must not be so fast, the ship will be here to-morrow or the day after; it is very bad weather there, and it is a sailing vessel, you can't expect it to a moment."</p>

I am a shipping agent, of 1, Water Lane, City—on 24th October the prisoner came to my office—I had never seen him before—he said he had arrived the previous day from Dunkirk, where he had loaded a small sailing vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Reine Victoire</hi>, with potatoes for the London markets, and that he had been recommended to apply to me to take charge of the cargo and obtain the sale there of—I told him I could do so—he then produced this bill of lading—you can buy blank forms of these things at any port, and fill them up as you choose—I asked him if that was his name, "De Bac," as the shipper—he said it was, and he signed that name at the back of the bill of lading—it purported to be signed by R. Pinto; captain of the French vessel, <hi rend="italic">Reine Victoire</hi>, of Dunkirk, for 100 tons of potatoes, to be delivered to London to the order of Vincent De Bac—it is dated 22nd October, 1868—I observed that it was dated the 22nd October, and said, "I suppose it will be up to-morrow"—he said, "To-morrow or Monday"—I went with him to the potatoe market and introduced him to several buyers—he then told me that he had bought a lot of potatoes in the North of France, that they were going to Boulogne to be shipped—and he should</p>

               <p>go over to Boulogne to get a vessel to bring them—he left this bill of lading in my hands, so that if the vessel arrived I should take charge of it; he said possibly he might not have sufficient money to pay the charges at Boulogne, if I would let him have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on security of the bill of lading it would be rendering him a service—I told him I should have to advance the freights when the vessel arrived, it was not my business to lend money, and I would rather not do it—he said I had plenty of security for my money, and subsequently, to oblige him, I gave him two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—after a few days, finding the vessel did not arrive, I wrote to my correspondents at Dunkirk, who made certain inquiries there—the prisoner never came to me any more—on 5th November I met him in the street—I said "Well, Mr. Luco, what about the ship that you said was coming?" and he said, "Oh, she sprung a leak before she left the port, and was unable to start"—I took him to my office—he then said the potatoes were coming by a steamer—I told him, from the inquiries I had made, I was satisfied he had been endeavouring to swindle me—I told him bills of lading were never signed unless the goods were actually on board—he said "Oh, the goods were on board, but they were discharged on account of the vessel leaking; I am an honest man, I don't wish to defraud you, and I will prove that to you by returning you the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he did not do so—I sent my clerk with him to enable him to get it, but I never got it, or the potatoes, and no such vessel exists.</p>

I live with my parents, who keep the Forresters' Arms Heston—on 27th November, the prisoners came in a pony cart—one of them asked for a pint of ale, which came to threepence; they both drank of it—Brown gave me a crown, saying, "I hope you can change it, miss"—I took it to my mother, who gave me four shillings and sixpence, which I gave to Brown, with threepence—Humphreys was warming himself in the tap room, and Brown asked him if he should give the pony some ale—he said, "No;" but they afterwards went out and gave the pony some—they both got into the cart, and went towards Shepherd's Bush.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Great St. Helen's, and am an oil merchant—the prisoner is a war finger, carrying on business at Albany Wharf, as Finden &amp; Co., Limited, but I believe there is no limit—on 10th June I bought ten casks of paraffin oil of Messrs Mordaunt Brothers, which were lying at the defendant's wharf—I got the delivery order on the 24th, this is a copy of it—the prisoner has had notice to produce the original—I lodged it myself in the letter box at his wharf—about three days after, on 1st July, he called at my office—he said, "I am very sorry I was not at the wharf when you called to see the oil and receive your sample. I sent you a sample"—I produced it—he gave me this gauge note, two or three days afterwards—he said it was the gauge note of my oil—I afterwards sold that oil to Mr. Davis, about 12th September—on 6th October, I saw the prisoner again—I said "Mr. Finden, this is a very serious matter about my oil, the casks being emptied and taken away"—he said, "We have used part of the oil to fill up three other merchant's casks. I shall receive the money for it in a few days, and will pay you"—he said "The quantity used was about sixty gallons"—I said, "That is nonsense, when your foreman in<lb/>formed Mr. Davis that the casks were nearly emptied for that purpose"—he said, "The more money therefore I shall have to receive for it from Messrs. Mordaunt's, Browning's, and another firm—the last two firms I did not hear distinctly—I thought one was Browning's—I said "Well, as a</p>

               <p>wharfinger, you had no more right to use my oil than I have to pick a man's pocket, and I intend to apply to the Magistrate at 11 o'clock next morning for redress"—he said, "In that case you may do your best or your worst"—a week before I had written to him to explain what had become of the oil, and he had taken no notice—I went to the wharf three separate times, and was denied admittance by a man who opened the door with a chain up—on 29th September I obtained admittance by a back entrance—I found two men rolling out empty casks, and I noticed between forty and fifty casks there—I examined them all and could not find one cask of my mark amongst them; the premises were quite empty in other respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your experience as an oil merchant, will paraffin oil, or not, keep for several months at a wharf without injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At all other wharfs I have never had a case of leakage—there is no difficulty in keeping it to order, we might lose about a gallon a cask, in hot weather, in two or three months—when the prisoner called upon me, on 2nd July, he told me that the casks were perfectly sound and in good order, and capable of standing the weather, and if I desired to leave them any time there, he would have the greatest care taken of them for me—the vendor is not here—the prisoner told me they were part of 200 casks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the oil business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years and a half; on my own account, not more than three months—I was with an oil broker—paraffin is more volatile than any other oil, it percolates through the wood to a slight extent; the longer time it remains in the cask, of course, the more it percolates through—it is generally put in casks that have been used before, not in new casks, they are not so good as the American petroleum casks—it is generally put in those casks—I know that there were about 25, 000 casks of oil at Plaistow Wharf last summer—I believe they are kept in sheds, or vaults, chiefly under ground, to preserve them from the sun—they never put them in the sun—it is not taken out of the casks and kept in tanks at the wharfs; that is done in retail shops, to avoid the loss in tapping—there was no one present when I had the conversation with the prisoner—I met him on the causeway—I had previously been to the wharf and seen between forty and fifty petroleum casks, apparently empty—I hare never seen the prisoner's foreman, Mr. Harris, in reference to this matter; I could never find him—the prisoner said that in hot weather the casks would leak a good deal, and I said, "It is your duty to keep your cooperage, you are paid for it"—I understood that the 200 casks had been there about three weeks before I bought mine—I have had oil at Mellish's wharf, but never knew a cask to leak out; I have known it to lose a gallon or two—I am not aware that they put it in tanks there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although paraffin is more volatile than some heavier oils, is there any difficulty in keeping it at a wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever; it is not nearly so volatile as spirits at high proof—it does not so much lose by evaporation, but it is so insidious, that it <hi rend="italic">goes</hi> through the pores of the wood, but it would take two or three years for a cask to empty itself from the pores, unless it had an accident.</p>

               <p>—I afterwards gave certain instructions to my carman, but I got no oil—I sent him three times—I have never received any part of it—I afterwards went to the wharf; the foreman let me in, I believe his name is Harris—I saw some empty barrels there; I am quite sure they were empty, because I turned them over—three of them were certainly marked "J M S," which was the mark on the barrels I bought—I paid Mr. Begbie 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—it is always customary in the oil trade to pay on account in the first transaction, when you receive the delivery order—there is no difficulty whatever in keeping paraffin oil at a wharf—I had some lying at Plaistow Wharf longer—heat will make it sweat, but not to the extent of bursting a cask—I have known it kept for two years at Plaistow Wharf, without injury—I speak from my experience as a merchant—I have been in business since 1864, and I think I understand the business thoroughly—no doubt exposure to the sun would increase the leakage, but it is the duty of the wharfinger to see that the barrels are in good condition, and that they are kept so—they are mostly put into sheds—I should say the barrels I saw were good barrels; there was nothing in their appearance to lead me to suppose they were leaky; they were as good as the ordinary run of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say it might be kept two years; I suppose that would depend upon the sort of barrels they are in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would in some measure—there are plenty at Plaistow Wharf, that have been there two years—I don't think that keeping them in vaults would make a great difference—I don't think there is any necessity for that; they put them in covered sheds—I don't think they have any vaults at Plaistow Wharf, and I have been there fifty times.</p>

                  </hi>. I was foreman at Albany Wharf—the defendant opened! that wharf in August, 1867—from that time up to September this year, I should think 5000 or 6000 barrels of paraffin oil have been delivered there—this is the first complaint that I have ever heard—I have been foreman there all the time—in May last 200 barrels were removed from the <hi rend="italic">Avon Carron</hi> steamer, marked "J. M. S."—they were originally consigned to Butterworth &amp; Son—they were removed from the steamer in a lighter, to the wharf—I was at the wharf when they were removed—the whole of them were in a very bad condition—I pumped out two barrels and a half of oil from the lighter, which had leaked out of the casks—they were old barrels, and had been used twenty or thirty times previously—they buy them for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and send them over to Scotland—sometimes the oak heads of the casks are destroyed, and fir heads put in instead—the oil gets through the fir more easily than through the oak—some of those 200 barrels had fir heads and some had not—they were a mixture, I expect—they were consigned by Butterworth &amp; Son to different parties—they were all delivered but ten barrels, taken by different parties—I can't exactly tell when they were delivered—it was somewhere about the end of August, and early in Sep<lb/>tember the prisoner went to Margate, and was there three weeks, I think, on and off—I managed the business at the wharf in his absence, and Mr. Blenkinson at the office in Bishopsgate—the ten barrels were on the premises during that time—they were in a bad state—I had to pump out four of them into different barrels, to preserve the oil, or else we should not have had any of it—I put it into empty barrels—the other six are there—there are ten there, four that I pumped out, and the remaining six—they are all still on the wharf—I should think there is hardly 100 gallons in them now—it has been leaking out ever since, on and off—I did not tell Mr. Davis, or Mr. Begbie, that they were there still—I did not see Mr. Begbie—I saw Mr. Davis—I did not satisfy him that the casks were there still—he had not brought any order, and the brokers were in at the time—I did not write to satisfy him—I did not know him—he had no order, and I had no order concerning him—there was no delivery order lodged with me in his name—I had never seen it—that was my reason for my not telling him anything about it—Mr. Finden was away at Margate at this time, I think—I am not positive he told me he was going there—he came up sometimes—I can't say whether he was out of London or in it at the time—I can only tell you as he told me, that he was going to Margate—I did not see him at the wharf—the brokers were in at the time I removed the oil—I removed it to save it—paraffin oil generally leaks out very much—if a hoop falls off it will empty itself in four hours—there was a hoop off one of those ten—the brokers left the wharf on the Saturday morning—I had orders to clear everything out by 12 o'clock on Monday—Mr. Finden came up and told us to take the oil out anywhere until he could make arrangements—the ten barrels marked "J. M. S." are now on Kent's Tar Wharf, in Upper North Street, adjoining the Albany Wharf—we are frequently obliged to cooper casks anew, to prevent their leaking—these 200 barrels were always being coopered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you say that the whole of the 200 barrels were in very bad order? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all of them had leaked very badly—as bad as they could be—the staves were not rotten—it was the jolting that started</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140024"/>
               <p>the casks—I can swear positively to the ten casks of Mr. Begbie's being in that condition—all of them were, including his—no part of Mr. Begbie's oil had been used—I will swear that I did not use it—no part of it was used to fill up the casks of other persons—I will take my oath of that—I had some conversation with Mr. Davis—I did not tell him that any of his casks were empty—he came and said there were ten barrels of oil marked "J. M. S."—I asked him for his order, he had not got it—I told him there were some empty casks over the way, which had been made up, and those empties were Mr. Browning's, who had 100 of them—Mr. Browning's orders were that we were to make his up out of his own oil—the remainder that he had—I did not satisfy Mr. Davis whether those were his—I did not tell him his casks were empty—I told him there were some empties, and he went and up-headed them—I did not point them out—I should say there were 100 empties, fifty for Hawkins and nearly 100 for Browning—they had been delivered and the empties returned—I was with the prisoner when he opened the wharf, and have been with him ever since—I have not heard of any complaints—perhaps a merchant will come and ask how it is there has been some extra leakage—we have had some complaints, but not what you would term complaints—I have not heard of any—I know the firm of Billing &amp; Sons, they dealt with us—they were oil merchants—I know they made a complaint—they asked how it was there were so many ullages—they gave Mr. Finden in custody on the charge of stealing their oil—when I said there were no complaints, I thought you meant any com<lb/>plaints about those 200—I know Messrs. Billing gave him in charge, but they could not uphold it—I don't know of any complaint from Mordaunt Brothers—I never heard of any—I heard Butterworth's have made a com<lb/>plaint, all of them will halloa out about a gallon of oil—we have had the weather extremely hot, and of course that has acted upon the oil.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were any of those 200 casks sold to Browning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; 100—the charge Messrs. Billing made was afterwards abandoned—the prisoner commenced an action against them—he told me so, for false imprisonment—persons are always complaining of the leakage, but there is hardly any heed taken of it; it is only just a few words, and it is all over.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had Mordaunts some casks at your place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—none of the oil from the ten barrels was poured into his—it is not true that Mr. Mordaunt had to pay my master for oil put into his casks: I should think not: of course I can't answer for anything between him and Mr. Mordaunt privately—I swear that none of this oil was poured into Mordaunt's casks—I can answer for that—I was on the wharf all the while—I don't remember any of Mr. Mordaunt's own oil being poured in to fill up the casks; and I will swear there was none of anybody else's.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140025"/>
               <p>had leaked from the barrels; there was about two and a-half barrels of it—I observed these 200 barrels afterwards; they were leaking—I helped to cooper them many times; we could not stop them, anyhow—I watered them twice a day to keep them cool—10 of those barrels remain; 190 were delivered to various parties—I don't know to how many, but, I dare say, to five or six different parties—the ten barrels remained there three or four months after the last were delivered; the ten barrels are there now—it is not customary to fill up barrels that are leaking from others—we don't do that unless a customer orders it; it is done sometimes to preserve the oil—complaints are always being made about short measure, the casks leak so much—I never knew barrels arrive full—I have used many a pound of soap to stop the leakage of these barrels; I used more to these 200 than we ever did to any others—it was green wood, not fit to hold water—I remember the brokers being there; the defendant was not at the wharf at that time; he went away somewhere—I can't give the exact date of the brokers coming in—it was on a Monday; I can't say the month—they were in eight days—Mr. Davis came there while they were in—we could not allow him to remove anything then; they told us we should not be allowed to deliver anything—I told that to Mr. Davis, at least, I believe the foreman did—he spoke to him; I did not—the ten barrels of oil are now on the wharf adjoining—they were never moved from Albany Wharf till they were removed to the next wharf; it was by direction of the landlord that the wharf was to be cleared—no oil was removed from four of the casks—I don't recollect any oil being pumped out of any of the casks—the ten casks are there now—I should think there is 100 gallons in them now; they are leaking still—we durst not go to cooper them now; of course, we have not since they have been removed—they don't require it, now the weather is different.</p>

I knocked at the door, nobody answered, and by rattling the door it came half a-jar. I thought he must be drunk. I lit my pipe, and then saw the woman coming down stairs; she said, "What do you want here, you wretch?" I said, "I have come to see Angel." She said, "No; you have got in at the window." Even if she did fasten it, it is quite feasible that other people might open it as well as me. She knows that I am innocent, only there is some disagreement between me and her stater's husband. We have been fighting several times. I know the woman perfectly well, she is poorer than myself. Is it likely that I should break open a house where I knew I should find nothing?</p>

I am now living at Pelham Street, Brompton, under the protection of a gentleman—in 1867, I was acquainted with the defend<lb/>ant—I knew him before 1867, for seven or eight years—I had been in the habit of receiving visits from him from time to time—I knew he was a married man—I received money from him at various times—this bracelet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—I bought it with my own money, from Mr. Vincent, a pawnbroker, in the Borough Road—I gave over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—about three months before August, 1867, the prisoner left the bracelet with Mr. Williams, of Hatton Garden, to be repaired—about August I spoke to him about getting the bracelet back from Mr. Williams, and bringing it to me—I did not give him any authority to deposit it with anyone—I was to pledge it myself—I saw him about three days after—he called on me, and said he had taken it from Mr. Williams, and that he had received a telegram from Brighton, stating that his wife was very ill, and as he did not like to take it to Brighton, he had left it in the care of a friend—he would not tell me the name of the friend—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's handwriting—I received that before he took the bracelet from Mr. Williams—I received this letter, dated February, 186—, the day after—it contains the statement that he was obliged to go to Brighton—the bracelet is mentioned in that letter—I found out where it had been deposited, about January or February this year—I went and saw Mr. Barker after that—I first saw a solicitor—I called on Mr. Barker and claimed the bracelet, perhaps eight or ten days after—I think it was in April—I only went once—the prisoner had told me that he had left it with a wine merchant, a friend of his—he also said that he advertised a great deal, and I found him out in that way—I brought an action against Mr. Barker, and subpoenaed Mr. Haggard as a witness—Mr. Murray is my solicitor—the prisoner was not served personally with the summons.</p>

I told him it was my wife's"—after I gave him the authority to get the bracelet from Hatton Garden, I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—I also went with him and ordered some furniture, to a large amount—I should think about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I never saw the bill—it was to furnish my bed-room—he gave me some money when I went to Margate—we were very good friends after I had given him the authority for the bracelet—I have not seen him since last February until the other day—I always recived him, whether he had money or not—I knew he was in difficulties—we were very good friends after he would not tell me where the bracelet was, and after I had been to Mr. Barker—he might have done anything he liked with the bracelet, if he had told me where it was.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to this indictment—I am the son of the last witness—I have known Crane six or seven months—he is no trade; he was an officer in the East Indian army—I know a person named Geeson; I have known him about two months—I have seen him at Crane's, and that is how I became acquainted with him—on Monday evening, 16th November, Crane, Geeson, and myself were at Gatti's restaurant, in Villiers Street, Charing Cross—there was some music going on—Crane and I went together—Geeson came in afterwards—he said he was very cold, and had had nothing to eat all day—I told him that I had ordered supper for him—I told him I should want him to cash me a cheque to-morrow—he asked me how much it was for, and I said 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Is that all?"—Crane was present while this was going on—I had been talking to Crane about the cheque during the day—on the Sunday evening I told Crane I wanted to see him in the morning—we met at the Cannon Street Station at 11 o'clock—I told him I was going to write a cheque—he said to me, "Who will change it?"—he then said, "We will get Geeson to do it; we could not get a bigger rogue"—that was all that was said—Crane</p>

I wish I bad the chance"—he asked me if my father blotted the cheques or not t—I said, "That is quite immaterial"—after I had written the second one, he said, "You can practice on all the cheques, to make sure"—the first one I wrote, I spelt "forty" wrong, and then I wrote another—he called for the blotting-paper, and then I gave him the cheque—it was white blotting-paper—Geeson went out with the cheque, and we were to meet him in Bishopsgate Street—I walked down Alderman's Walk by myself—I afterwards saw Geeson coming with one of the banker's clerks—I then turned back again and went down Alderman's Walk—I saw Crane in the evening, at his brother's house, in Lower Marsh, Lambeth—I asked him if he had seen anything of Geeson—he said, "Yes; I saw him twice; he nudged my arm three times as he was going along"—when we had tea, we went up stairs; I took out the cheque-book and said to Crane, "Will you put this in your trunk for me?"—his brother was up in the room with us—Crane said he would burn the book, and he put it in the front of his drawer till he came back—I believe it was afterwards burnt—I left it there, and have not seen it since—I heard that Geeson was in custody on the Tuesday evening—my father spoke to me on Wednesday morning, and I went to Mr. Mullens and gave myself up—Crane was taken soon after; he was standing outside the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, of 10, George Street, Com<lb/>mercial Road—last Thursday evening, about 7 o'clock, I had just come to shore in my boat from the other side of the water, but had not landed—the prisoner came to the shore in his boat a minute or two afterwards—he got out of his boat first—I was first sculler, and I had plied the prisoner as a fare, but he took another man—we were not <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>, but I said, "Mr. Start, what is the reason you refused to take me, when I am first sculler? I have never done you harm, you have put many a shilling out of my pocket by refusing to take me"—he has not got a boat, he was a passenger, and was bound by Act of Parliament to take the first sculler—on my complaining to him he stabbed me in my side, near my hip—I saw something shining in his hand, which I supposed to be a knife—I said to Alexander Hughes, who was with me, "<hi rend="italic">Sandy</hi>, I am stabbed, pick me up"—I had fallen in the mud, to avoid the blow—Hughes pulled me up—the prisoner had an umbrella in his hand, which he poked at me, and told me not to follow him—I went to the lamp at the top of the street, and found that the knife had gone right through my clothes, and there was a mark on my skin—I went with a con<lb/>stable to the prisoner's house and locked him up—I had not applied any abuse to him coming over—I had passengers in my boat.</p>

In substance it was as follows: that one Robert Dalton, a labourer in his employ, being entitled to a share in some property left by one Henry Trimmer, having repeatedly urged him to advocate his claims, he was induced to make inquiries into the matter, and ultimately found the will in question in the cover of an old book, called the "Contra Book" amongst a number of papers belonging to Henry Trimmer, and that his wife and two sons were present when he found it. He also described the finding in a box of other documents, referred to and described in the evidence</hi>.</p>

               <p>of paper—this box was kept in a bed room which belonged to Trimmer: it was a room that was always kept for his own use—it was down stairs that I was talking with the Dalton's—they were with me, it might be, about two hours, or from that to three hours, on that occasion—we had a very long talk over the whole family matters—I was interested in the family, of course, knowing them all—Mr. Spong came on the Tuesday with Mr. and Mrs. Dalton—they introduced him to me as a friend of theirs, Mr. Spong; that is all I recollect of it—I told Mr. Spong all I knew about Henry Trimmer; his habits, and so on, as well as I could recollect—the Dalton's talked it over about the will not being a genuine will—they wanted Henry Trimmer's signature and writing to got their property—they said there was a good deal of property, and it was kept back from them—they did not say anything at that interview, to my recollection, about going up to London to see Woods' will—my husband was present on these occasions; he is rather deaf—Henry Trimmer came over a day or two before Christmas Day; I think it was the day before, and he went away on Christmas Day, in the morning—I can't recollect how he came; I did not ask him—he used to get a lift with the market people—he left on Christmas morning, and said he would come back again—I saw the Dalton's at Mrs. Christmas's, at Liphook, when we went there to meet Mr. Spong—they had not been to our house in the mean time—it was in April, 1847, as near as I can guess, when John Trimmer came over to our house, bringing the key of the box with him—he went up into the room where the box was; it was there, lying open—he might be there two or three hours, not in the room but down stairs, because he had some refreshment—when we first broke open the box it was full of old news-papers and different papers, and there were some old buckles, and a variety of things—there was no money, or plate, pictures, or jewellery—the buckles were old brass ones, that Mr. Trimmer used to wear in his shoes—the things did not amount to 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I turned over the papers in the box—I read some of the letters; I did not read any of the other things—I pushed them all in again till I took the papers out afterwards, and made a clothes box of it—I did not see an old will of Mary Trimmer's—the box was not corded or fastened up again; there it would have been, open to anybody who came into the room—I was not absent from my home for a day, from Christmas to February—I might have been for an hour or two, but I don't think I was.</p>

               <p>fetched the box down stairs, and took it into the room where they were—when the Daltons came on the previous occasion, they had not seen the box or the papers, only No. 1, which gave us the authority—when the box was brought down where the Daltons and Mr. Spong were, it was set in the passage, as they sat in the room adjoining—then I took the bandbox in, and showed Mr. Spong, and he said, "Will you allow me to take it away?" and it was put in the box and corded up, just as it was—it was never meddled with—there was no opportunity for the Daltons to put anything in the and box—the box was never touched after it was corded—my hus<lb/>band corded it.</p>

I am a farmer, living at Thursley, near Godalming, and husband of the last witness—I remember Henry Trimmer living with us; he left in the year 1846, about Christmas—he only stayed with us one day and night on that visit—I believe he came on the 24th, and left on the 25th, in the morning—I asked him to stop and spend the Christmas, but he said he must get back, to see his doctor; we had no doctor nearer than Liphook and Haslemere—I did not see him alive after that; he was never at our house afterwards—he had been there in the summer before, from ten to twelve weeks, I don't justly know—he was not in very good health, he always complained and coughed, and was very particular in what he ate—I remember this large box; it was left at our house when he went away, and it was at our house when he died, and for years after; it had not been moved before his death, it was never interfered with, he had the room to himself—after he left us at Christmas, I heard of his death, and after that I opened the box; it was looked, I did not know where to find the key; it appears that his brother John brought it afterwards; Henry Trimmer had taken it away with him—the box was left looked at our place—it was some time after his death that I broke it open; he had left that little note with Mrs. James, we both saw him write it, on our table, she got the paper for him to write it, and I considered the box was my property, and I broke it open; there was nothing in it particular; there were a few papers, and one thing or other in the box, all the lot of it was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; all the property there was not worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, there was no plate or jewellery—he owed me 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for lodging—I never looked at any papers then, I turned them out, I saw there was nothing of any consequence, and so off I went, and I never looked into the box for twenty-two years, till it was in Court—I remember receiving this letter of 15th October, 1867—up to that time I had not heard that Henry Trimmer had made a will and made me executor; he had always said he would see me righted, that was all I heard; I heard him say so many a time—I had lent him many a shilling and half-crown, if he wanted to go anywhere, and he has said "I shall never pay you, but I will make you amends some day or other"—I was at home when the box was taken away; I corded it up, and Dalton, and Mr. Spong, and Dalton's wife, I believe, took it away; they put it in a cart.</p>

I am a miller—the deceased, Henry Trimmer, was for Borne years in my father's employment—I remember the whole of the time he was there—I can hardly tell you the time, but he left in 1842, I believe—I don't recollect the time he came—I did not notice, but I can easily ascertain it—I should think ho was there two or three years—I remember Mr. Spong coming to me last year; I can't give you the date positively, but I believe it was in August—a person, who I afterwards knew as Mrs. Dalton, had been to me previously—when Mr. Spong came, he asked me if I could find</p>

               <p>any writing of Henry Trimmer's, and more particularly if I could find his signature—I said I would try and see if I could find any of his writing, which I did in that book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am not sure whether I gave it to the prisoner, or to Mrs. Dalton—I think they were both present at the time—I think Mrs. Dalton also came with him when he came, but I am not sure that I found the book then—I think, perhaps, it was afterwards—Mr. Spong only came to my house once, I believe—there is an entry in the book about Henry Trimmer's leaving; it is in my writing, in pencil; "The day Henry Trimmer left"—I can tell from this that he left on 4th October, 1842—I referred to the ledger and found the day that he was paid for his services, and I made that minute when I gave up the book—I can't find any of his writing after that date—the entry in ink does not show that he left that day; it would only show anyone who knew his handwriting that it is his writing—it is "Thomas Wheeler, a sack of flour, ground; John Baker, two bushels of barley, ground"—that is the last entry I can find of his in the book—I made the pencil memorandum to give the date he left to whoever I gave the book to, Mr. Spong or Mrs. Dalton, as they wished to know when he left—I suppose that must be it—I don't see why I should do it without—I had not the slightest interest myself in knowing when he left—the ledger showed the last day he was settled with—this book does not contain any signature of Henry Trimmer, that I am aware of—I did not see the book again till I saw it in the Probate Court—I understood Mr. Spong that he required Henry Trimmer's signature to test a will that he considered forged—I understood him that Dalton was employed by him, and he felt an interest on his behalf, on account of his working for him.</p>

I am a solicitor, at 13, South Square, Gray's Inn—I was formerly a member of the firm of Pritchard &amp; Sons, of Doctors' Commons—I have been solicitor for all the White family, and for all the Trimmer family—I was also solicitor acting for the two executors, Mr. Christmas and Mr. Edmund James, in the suit in the Probate Court last April, in propounding the will of December 1846—I was first consulted by the White family, in December, 1863, after the death of the tenant for life, John Harriot—Dalton and his wife came to me then—he is a journey<lb/>man brewer, or a brewer's man—he can sign his name, but I don't think he could do much more than that—his wife can neither read nor write—none of the White family can read or write—Mr. Christmas and Mr. Trussler can both write a little, sign their names, and write a little, but very imperfectly—Dalton was recommended to me by a client—I did not know the prisoner Spong at all when Dalton came first—I first became acquainted with him at the end of January, 1867—Dalton and his wife called and asked me if I would see a gentleman and explain to him what was being done in the various proceedings in Chancery that I had instituted—I said "Yes," and in consequence of that, Mr. Spong called upon me—he gave me his address—he said he was an agent in this country for Tooth, the brewers, in Australia, or he mentioned their names as having business with them—I did not know then that Dalton had been in his em<lb/>ployment; I know it now—I knew it from about the time Spong came to me—I explained to him the course I had taken in the Chancery proceed<lb/>ings which I had instituted and had the carriage of, and I also explained to him that I had been accustomed in all these proceedings to confer with Mr. Chalcraft, the defendant's brother, that now he was dead these parties had behaved in a way that I considered unjustifiable, and therefore I declined to communicate with them, and I told them they must find some gentleman with whom I could communicate, or else I should tell them nothing—after that I always communicated through Spong on the business of this property in the Chancery suits—I was dissatisfied with all the White family—they reside at the foot of Sir William Erle's property, at Liphook, and they went to him, and made representations to him about this will, which I was very much annoyed at, and after that I would not do anything for them—I heard of the will of 1844 being proved—when I filed my bill in 1844, I searched the Probate Court and I could find no proof of Henry Trimmer's will being proved, and I alleged that he had died intestate—I applied in April, 1866, for letters of administration to the legatees of Henry Trimmer, and then I found that the will of Henry Trimmer had been proved by Mr. Woods—I did not see the will itself, but I saw a copy of it—I saw it was attested by Mr. Parnell, and I saw him and Mr. Woods upon the subject—I afterwards saw the prisoner, but I saw the Whites first—I did not mention about that</p>

               <p>will to the prisoner until the April twelvemonth after—I told him that Mr. Parnell meant to insist upon the will, and I had given him the necessary information, in Chancery, for him to come in and prove—the citation in the Probate Court bears date, 5th November, 1867—that was the commencement of the suit—I did not employ Spong to make in<lb/>quiries in any way or in any manner; nor did I pay him—on 15th October I received this letter from the prisoner—it is the letter that informed me of the discovery of the will—a copy of the will was enclosed in it—I saw him on the 16th—he then brought the will itself—he told me he had found it in the book called the contra book—I received the contra book the next day—this is the letter I received from him (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Bradbourn Vale, Sevenoaks, 14th October, 1867.

As I was examining an old book, I found it pinned in the cover. After several small gifts, he bequeaths the residue to the female portion of the Whites'. I will see that you have a copy of the document to-morrow; and, if possible, I will run up and see you about I o'clock. Yours faithfully, John Spong.")—He came up the next day, and brought the will and the contra book—I received these documents, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, from the prisoner, on 5th December 1867—1, 2, and 3, were given in evidence at the Probate Court; number 4 was not—it was in my brief, and part of my case—this old book of Mr. Beales' was given in evidence—I received it on 10th December, from the prisoner—I received a copy of this bill of exchange on 11th April, 1868, and, on the 17th, the first day of the trial, I received the original from Mr. Spong, and that was given in evidence—I was conducting the suit for the plaintiff in the Probate Court—the plaintiffs case was finished, and witnesses were called for the defendant—after some of the witnesses for the defendant had been called, the counsel withdrew from the case—that was on the fourth day—the prisoner's wife was not examined, but she was in Court the third day, or the fourth day: I think it was the morning of the fourth day—Dalton was called—I told him to be in the way, but he purposely got out of the way, and we could not bring him into Court—his name was called out—he was sent for and found, but he would not come into Court—Mrs. Dalton was called and examined as a witness by our counsel—I saw Mr. Debenham, the solicitor—he was one of our witnesses—I sent for him and he came at my request on the second day—he brought the deeds and papers with him, containing Joseph Kimber's signature—Mr. Chabot attended as a witness for us—he was not called—he saw the deeds and papers brought up by Mr. Debenham—I requested him to do so; I did not look at them myself—I went down with Mr. Chabot to Hedley, to see the marriage register—that was on Tuesday, the 21st; after the second day's trial—with the exception of the will and the documents numbered 1, 2, and 3, no handwriting of Joseph and Sophia Kimber's was given in evidence in support of the plaintiff's case—the marriage register, which has been produced to-day, was not put in evidence by us: I did not think of it until after the trial had begun—I did not receive these papers from the prisoner—I received these from Mr. Curtis, of Hedley, the bill of exchange and this account—Mr. Curtis is the brother of Sophia Kimber—he is very ill indeed; bed-ridden—we could not think of bringing him up to the Probate Court—I did not speak to the prisoner about these—I gave them to Mr. Chabot—I received these on 15th January, 1868, and another document that was with it, the</p>

B. and W. M." in the left hand corner—finding the word "Exc.," it put me to inquire, and I went down to Farnham to see what trace I could find of it—that, in the ordinary mode in an office, is to show that it has been examined—I did not find any of the parties—I went to Hollis and Mason's, they took some trouble to find it out, but I did not get any evidence through them that I have to day that it was Avenall's handwriting—Mr. Spong suggested that I should advertise for the parties—my clerk was engaged for several weeks making inquiries—he has gone to Canada—he left some few months ago, or he would have been here—I did not make any inquiry with regard to the person who wrote the body of that will—my clerk did all that, and witnesses were examined to prove it—the will was shown to Mr. Restall and he at once said "That is my schoolfellow, John Avenall's handwriting."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographer, of 25, Southampton Row, Russell Square—I have for many years made handwriting a study, and have con<lb/>stantly been consulted by the Treasury, the War Office, the Post Office, in various public cases—I was consulted by Mr. Pritchard, the attorney for the plaintiffs in the action in the Probate Court—before the trial I examined the documents 1, 2, 3, and 4, and also the will of December, 1846—I attended in the Probate Court for the purpose of being called as a witness on behalf of the plaintiffs, but I knew they would not call me, from my report—I had examined and reported—I was not called—before the trial I had this book, containing various entries in Trimmer's handwriting (<hi rend="italic">The one produced by Mr. Beales</hi>)—I had it from Mr. Pritchard—I also saw some papers which purport to be written by Joseph and Sophia Kimber—there was considerable writing of Joseph Kimber's, but very little of Sophia's—I saw some parchment deeds at Westminster, produced by Mr. Debenham—I also saw this small book, and all the signatures in it—the book produced by Mr. Beales contains a great number of entries by Henry Trimmer—I can identify his handwriting a very great way through the book, down to October, 1842—they are trade entries—I do not believe the signature "Henry Trimmer' to document No. 2. is in Trimmer handwriting, that is my opinion—I can give my reasons—the body of No. 3, I do not believe is in Trimmer's writing—I say the same of No. 4, no part of it—the initials, "H. T.," I am quite certain are not his writing—they are particularly objectionable—I say that of the whole of No. 4—I have looked at the writing in the inside lining of the box, "In country book, my own will, H. T."—certain parts of that are certainly not in Trimmer's writing—I cannot speak of it all, but I have no belief that any of it is his—I have taken it all, and copied the short<lb/>hand as well—there are the words, "In country book, my own will, H. T."—I doubt the whole of that—I could not take a particular word—if I saw nothing but "My own," I could not tell, but judging from the words "Country book," and the initials "H. T.," and assuming it was all written by one person, I judge from those parts, that taking it as a whole, it is not in the handwriting of Trimmer—the signature of "Henry Trimmer" is a very easy signature to imitate; having got over the capital letters, the rest is very readily imitated, so as to pass, so as to deceive any ordinary person—any person acquainted with his writing would be deceived with it—in the lid of the box there is the word "key" or "keep," I think it is "key," and following that there is something which I cannot decipher; but the capital K in "key" is unlike the "K" that is made by Trimmer, but it corresponds with the notion of making the capital K as in the word "Kimber" in the signature of the attesting witness to the will, and in document No. 2—it is a capital "K"—in one essential particular it differs from Trimmer's "K," but it agrees with those two—so I say of the small "k" in the word "book," there is the same objection to be made—it is quite opposed to Trimmer's mode of making a "k," but it agrees with the "k" in two matters upon which I have not yet been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140089"/>
               <p>examined, that is, it agrees with the "k" as found in Kimber's writing at the top of the bill of exchange, and with Sophia Kimber's at the bottom—neither of them make the "k" as it is made there—I mean in substance this: that the "k" on the lid of the box, and the "k" in Kimber's writing at the back of the bill, and the "k" in Sophia Kimber's writing at the bottom of the bill, might all be the production of one person, but the "K" in Kimber is different from the mode in which Sophia Kimber makes it, and the "K" in "Joseph Kimber" is different from the way in which he makes it, and they are different from each other—I say they are not made by the persons assigned to them, because each of them make theirs differently—there is some short-hand on the box, just underneath the words "J. Neale's will," that is, as I read it—I believe it to be only a make-believe short-hand—I don't believe it is short-hand at all—I don't believe anyone can decipher it—they are short-hand characters, but they have no meaning: for instance, there are three crosses following each other; I cannot conceive what meaning that can have; again, there art three per<lb/>pendicular strokes following each other; that cannot be consistent with any system of short-hand—I have studied short-hand writing myself—I cannot follow a speaker, but I write two different systems, and understand the principles of short-hand perfectly well—I have studied different systems—I have formed an opinion as to the signatures of Henry Trimmer to No. 2, No. 3, and to the will—I cannot speak with any degree of strength—I believe them not to be the same signature as the signature to the original will, but from so few signatures I cannot speak with any degree of strength—if I had nothing else to pass an opinion upon, I should decline giving an opinion, but being assisted by other matters I am just enabled to say that is my belief—I believe the signatures to the will of 1846 are not genuine signatures, but if I had those signatures given me independently of anything else I would not give an opinion about them—the signature of Joseph Kimber to the will and to document No. 2 are perfectly identical, and undoubtedly written by the same person—I have compared those with the deeds and papers produced by Mr. Debenham, and also with docu<lb/>ments K 1, K 2, and K 3, C., and several signatures in the memo<lb/>randum book, I dare say twenty or twenty-five genuine signatures altogether—all those produced as the genuine signature of Joseph Kimber appear to be identical; he writes his signature remarkably in one way; he seems to me only to know how to write it in one way, like indifferent writers; they commonly write it in one way—a good writer varies his writing a little more or less, according to the instrument he writes with—I have the strongest opinion that the Joseph Kimber on No. 2, and on the will, is not the handwriting of Joseph Kimber—I cannot express my opinion too strongly on that point; it was that signature which so shook my faith in the case for the plaintiffs in the Probate Court—I have also ex<lb/>amined the signature, "Sophia Kimber," to No. 3, and to the parchment will, and also the "S. Kimber" on the lower part of the back of the bill—I believe that was all written by the same person, all written by one hand—I have seen some of the genuine writing of Mrs. Kimber, and I have also seen her writing in two places in the marriage register as Sophia Curtis—I believe the writing to No. 3, the attestation to the will, and the writing at the bottom of the will, are not the genuine handwriting of Sophia Kimber—but there, again, if I were examined only upon those points, unassisted by other matters, I should hesitate to express an opinion; still, it is my belief</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140090"/>
               <p>that they are not; there are reasons upon which I found my belief—in my judgment the word "Curtis" on the back of the bill, and the signature "Sophia Curtis" in the register, are not written by the same person—I speak decidedly stronger on that point than the other matters; than the signatures; that is clear to my mind: I have no hesitation about that—the "Sophia Curtis" in the two places in the register are evidently written by the same person; they will bear the closest comparison—I was taken down to Hedley to see the register, while the trial was going on—I have looked at the back of this bill of exchange—the words, "George Woods" and the initials "G. W." are, undoubtedly, not in the genuine handwriting of George Woods—I have seen a number of documents produced by Mr. Woods' son, in his father's handwriting, quite sufficient to enable me to form an opinion; I speak confidently as to that—I have seen some of the writing of Mrs. Woods, her writing of her husband's name, "George Woods" and "G. W."—these words and initials on the back of this bill appear to be imitations of her writing.</p>

               <p>other common marks of forgery; nevertheless, I am perfectly satisfied they are forgeries—patching and painting are what I look for in forgeries, but it is not always that I find them; it is only once in a dozen times that you will find a matter of patching; it is commonly supposed that all forgeries arc patched: it is not so—I say I look for it and I find it once in a dozen instances of clear forgeries.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an able seaman on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Mofussilite</hi>—the prisoner was the captain's son, and was the second mate—a young man named Charles James Dryhurst was a midshipman on board—on 23rd June, this year, the vessel was off Calcutta, and about 4.30 that morning, Dryhurst came up on deck, and was in the act of putting on his coat, when I heard the prisoner speak to him, but he made no answer at all—the prisoner then struck him—the first blow I saw was on the head—I could not see what part of the head, but I know it was not low down—his head was cut, and the blood was running, but he continued to stand—there was thin some scuffling on the hencoops, and there were several blows—while dawn I heard Dryhurst sing out, "Don't sir! don't sir! don't sir!" three times, and then he let out a loud piercing cry; he was partly on the hen<lb/>coop and partly against it—I was at the wheel, and did not see what was being done to him while he was crying out, I merely saw him from where I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140092"/>
               <p>was standing—he got several blows from the prisoner while he was down, or in a reclining position, but I cannot state on what part of the body—the prisoner left him about five minutes afterwards, and went towards the bin<lb/>nacle to do something to it, and Dryhurst came to me—I then saw that he was bleeding from a cut on the front part of his head, above the temple—there were two more wounds at the back of his head, which were bleeding very slightly, they were not running—we had left Bombay about the latter end of May, or 1st June—Dryhurst's health was then apparently very good, he never complained to me; and he always performed his duty—after 23rd June his health began to decline every day, and he would stop suddenly, and say that he could not see, there was total darkness before him—he was not in a condition to do any work afterwards, he kept his bed until we arrived at Calcutta about 6th July—he then went into the hospital—I afterwards saw him dead in the dead house, he was carried there from the hospital—on the Sunday before the ship left, both me and the sail maker went to try to see the hospital doctor, but failed to do so, though we waited three hours—that was about a week after seeing the body—I also made a communication to a Magistrate in Calcutta on the Monday the ship was about to leave, the day before she was leaving—on the very day the deceased died I wrote a letter to his parents, and on my arrival in town I was met by his father and brother.</p>

SERJEANT SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first join the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I joined her in Bombay, in December—she went from Bombay to Annesley Bay—she returned to Bombay before she went to Calcutta—I was at Bombay some weeks before our arrival at Calcutta—we left Bombay on the 5th or 6th of June—it is only about three weeks' voyage to Calcutta—we were lying at anchor off Calcutta about a week or ten days before the deceased was taken to the hospital—I do not remember the date of Dryhurst's death, but he had then been about six days in the hospital—the vessel left Calcutta about 28th July—she was a troop ship, of 1008 tons—her crew consisted of about thirty in all, and there were between 200 and 250 troops on board, besides soldiers' wives and children—the troops were conveyed from Bombay—there was illness on board, as usual in troop ships—the crew were bad for a day or two—there was a regimental doctor on board—there were as many as twelve deaths on board in the short voyage of three weeks, from Bombay to Calcutta, but only one man and one woman, all the rest were children—Dryhurst was not laid up with fever at Bombay that I am aware of—he was not, after I joined, occasionally unwell and under the doctor, to my knowledge; I always saw him going about his work, he might have been sick, but he never stated it to me—he was not ill, to my recollec<lb/>tion, on the voyage from Bombay to Calcutta—he did not complain of fever before these assaults were inflicted upon him—he may have had toothache, but nothing more—he might have a pain in the bowels—he was not off duty, to my knowledge, in consequence of illness before we left Bombay, but I was not in his watch, and had not much to do with him—I do not know that he was two days laid up, and excused from duty two or three days before the date I fix for this assault—I never heard of it before to-day—I did not state before the Magistrate that this occurred at 6 a.m.—I stated the bells, I stated my relief time—the mistake was made in one bell—it was either at the half hour or the forty-five minutes—I am not certain, because they are not punctual in striking the time—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I was wrong in stating on my oath that it was 6 o'clock, it was</p>

               <p>4.30")—I told the Magistrate that it was 4.30, but they must have made a mistake in the bell—I made an information which was taken down in writing, and which I swore to before the prisoner was arrested—I stated that it was 4.30, or a few minutes after—there was light enough for me to see—I was relieved at 6 o'clock—Mr. Symes, the chief officer under the captain, came up just after this was over, and wanted to know what the row was about—I have not seen him here to-day, but I did yesterday—the prisoner and I were always on good terms—he made a row with me on the passage and in the docks, only twice—I did challenge him to fight, and told him I was no pick-pocket, and would have none of his <hi rend="italic">Yankee</hi> phrases—I do not know when that was, it was before this matter—I had no ill feeling, only just at the time—I was at the wheel when this happened—I cannot tell you how many men were on duty on deck at the time—about nine men would be on duty in the watch between 5 and 6 o'clock—I did not call out from the wheel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were at the wheel, and eight other men would be on duty at the time, and you saw one man inflicting such injuries upon the other that the other was shrieking out with pain and agony, did you not raise the slightest alarm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was paralyzed, and the ship was all aback at the time, she was in the wind—the men were not shifting the sails.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you so paralyzed at seeing this act of brutality committed, that you did not cry out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if I had troubled myself about it I should probably have got shot—there were not only private soldiers, but officers in command on board the vessel, and a doctor—people were sleeping under the place where the scuffling was going on, only separated by the deck—I was about forty or fifty feet off, I am not certain, because I did not measure it—it did not strike me that, as a mere matter of humanity, I could go and make a statement to one of Her Majesty's officers when I next saw one of them on deck—I did not complain to the captain, the prisoner's father; I waited to see the Magistrate—I did not complain to the chief officer—when the vessel anchored off Calcutta I went on liberty—I did not go on shore almost every day from 28th July, only once or twice a week, and on Sundays generally—the rest of the crew had the same liberty—I went to see this young man lying ill in the hospital, and I attended his funeral with another of the ship's crew, and a midshipman—we all subscribed, except the prisoner, to a monument to Dryhurst—the prisoner did not put his name down—I merely state that he did not give it on paper—the captain instructed me to take a list of those who subscribed—I did not collect the money, I collected the names, and how much each one gave—it made eighty rupees altogether—I will not undertake to say that the prisoner did not subscribe five rupees, but he did not put it on my paper—I got the signatures of the officers—I got the captain, and the mate, and Mr. Jeffery, and the steward—I gave the paper first to the able seamen, then to the petty officers, and then to the officers—we had no doctor on board when we were sailing, except the regimental doctor—there was no doctor to the ship, that I am aware of—I believe the doctor attending the troops gave Dryhurst some sticking plaster—we left the doctor attending the troops in Calcutta—I do not know that Dryhurst was under the treatment of the doctor three or four days before the 23rd June, for bilious fever—there was, of course, a different doctor in the hospital—the doctor in Calcutta resides there—I endeavoured to see him before we sailed—Dryhurst had then been dead about fourteen days—I saw the Magistrate on the Monday, and we sailed on the Tuesday—the vessel is taken down the Hoogley by a steam tug—she was not detained</p>

               <p>from going down the river for six hours while I was ashore—the captain asked me if I had seen the Magistrate—I said, "Yes"—two hours afterwards the prisoner called me up, and asked me what satisfaction I had got—I said, "None"—he said, "God d——your heart, I will give you plenty going home"—I never said a word of this before the Magistrate at Stratford—I was never asked for it—Dryhurst was confined to his bed after 23rd June, but he was brought up to walk about and to do his own needfuls—he was bad in his bowels, and when the captain called him he would have to answer the captain's summons—I wrote a document home on the very evening of the man's death—I would not say that it was 12th July, but I wrote it the very day he was buried, after we came from the funeral, which was the day of his death, and gave it to the bumboatman to post—he delayed it six or eight weeks, but I did not know that till I came home—this model (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is a pretty fair representation of the poop of the ship—I was here at the wheel, on the lower platform, on the grating, the hen coops are here and here, both on the side—the vessel was in full sail, one spanker was set—I have been at sea about nine years—I know that at each of the British ports there are Magistrates to whom seamen may make complaints of ill usage—I know also that the ship's articles, on arrival at a British port, are always deposited at the shipping office, which is a place to which seamen have a right to resort to make any complaint—the shipping master at those ports is the person under whom the engaging and discharging of men takes place.</p>

I live at New Street, Stratford—on the morning of the 4th November, about 7 o'clock, I was at work on the Romford Road, opposite the "Three Pigeons"—I looked over the fence and saw something in the ditch which leads towards Stratford Green—it was about thirty yards from the high road—I got over to see what it was, and found it was a child—I saw the head and a portion of its feet—I got back again, and told the landlady of the "Three Pigeons," and a policeman was sent for—he came and took it away—I saw him pick it up—after he picked it up I saw part of the child's bedgown crammed down its throat—that was when he had got it in his arms—I was not standing beside him when he picked it up, I was by the roadside, and he was in the field—I saw some little spots of blood on the child's mouth, from its nose—it had a flannel on.</p>

I am a physician, practising at stratford—on the 4th November Holman brought me the dead body of a child—it was dressed fully for bed, with bed-gown, flannel, and so forth—the clothes were like these produced—the policeman took away the articles of clothing when I undressed the child—I noticed that the bed-gown was forced in the child's mouth—in my judgment that could not have been so placed accidentally—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body on the 6th November—I stated before the Coroner that it was a week old: it was about two or three weeks old—it was a male child—I found the vessels of the brain congested and full of black blood, but otherwise healthy—the heart was empty, except the left side, where there was a small clot of blood—the lungs were congested, and the chest—on opening the abdomen I found the viscera all healthy—the liver was congested—there was an in<lb/>ordinate quantity of blood in it, of a dark appearance—I believe the child to have died of suffocation—it must have been dead for some hours—the body was fresh—there was a little mucus and blood oozing from the nostrils—there was blood on the bed-gown, but that came from the interior of the mouth; it was on the upper lip.</p>

I took the train about 8 o'clock in the morning of Tuesday, and went to Stratford, and walked about till 4 o'clock, and laid the child down on a doorstep. I did not do anything to the child."—I then produced and undid the clothing, and the mistress identified the bed gown, in the prisoner's presence, as being one of the two that she sent with the flannel to her in the workhouse—upon that I took her into custody—I produce a copy of the register of the child's birth, on 12th October, 1868.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Victoria Docks—I was on duty there on the night between 11th and 12th November—and near I o'clock I heard a splashing in the water, as though someone was rowing a boat—I waited some little time, and saw a barge coming across—a man, who I can<lb/>not swear to, was on it—I called out and got an answer, and directly after<lb/>wards Powell came up and said, "Have you seen my barge, Ned?"—he said, "No, I have had trouble enough to find my own"—Powell asked me if I had seen a barge adrift—I said, "No," and asked him what sort of barge it was—he said, "A decked barge, with about 60 tons of rice in it, and that he would go up the south shore and look—I walked up the south shore with him very nearly a mile, and could not see it—at the end of my beat is the pontoon bridge, he stooped down there and said, "I think I see my barge behind those steamboats, how can I get to her?"—I said, "I do not know, the best thing is to ask the man you spoke to on the other barge if he has got a boat"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140108"/>
               <p>—he said, "I will do so, and if I cannot get a boat I will turn in, for I am very tired"—I then came up to the fireman and went with him, and saw no more of Powell—the conversation lasted three-quarters of an hour—about 2.55 I met Robert Christopher, another dock constable, I told him what I had seen—we went round to the backs of the warehouses, and came upon some bags of tobacco lying on the ground—we laid down near them, and Edward Turnbull and another man came up—Edward Turnbull took a big and turned it over down towards the bottom of the bank, which slopes towards the boundary fence—he then saw us lying on the ground, and sang out "Halloa <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, is that you," three or four times—we made no reply—Edward Turnbull came towards us with something in his hand—we got up and I said to Christoper, loud enough for him to hear, "Look out, he has something in his hand!"—Christopher immediately sprang on him, threw him down, and took him in custody—they were about seven yards from the bag of tobacco—the other man ran away—we took Edward Turnbull to the station—I afterwards saw a hole under the fence—the bags of tobacco were distributed through the hole to the top of the embankment—some of them were close to the hole.</p>

On Saturday evening, 12th December, about 8.30, I was on duty in the Police Galley, in the Thames, off Pickle Herring Stairs, and saw the two prisoners in a small tug-boat going up the river—Clark stepped out and made the tug-boat fast to a barge—I went alongside, and said to Peek, "What have you in the tug?"—he said, "Wheat!"—I said, "Where have you brought it from?"—he said, "From Mr. Matthews' place; we are going to load upon Monday"—I said, u Have you any notes for this wheat?"—he said, "No,"—I said to Clark, "Do you belong to this tug-boat?"—he said, "No; I have only come to help him up; I know nothing about it"—I said, "I shall detain you"—Peek said, "It is all right, you can see the governor"—I said, "Who do you work for?"—he said, "For Mr. Matthews, and have for three years"—I took the prisoners into custody—I found in the boat ten sacks of grain, bearing the mark of "J. F. Cohen."</p>
