               <p>I am the wife of John Moffatt. I know the watch very well, which is the subject of this indictment; I have wore it myself, at times, for two years and a half. The prisoner at the bar was a servant in the family; he was a <rs id="t17940219-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">footman</rs>

                        targets="t17940219-1-defend66 t17940219-1-deflabel4"/>, he had left our service about fifteen months before the watch was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your service? - Between ten and eleven months.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before the watch was lost had you seen it? - I saw it the evening before, but Mr. Moffatt put it in the drawer himself, at ten o'clock that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How late that evening did you see the watch yourself? - I did not see it after dark myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you see it in the course of the day before it was lost? - Hanging up by the side of the fire, in a small parlour, where Mr. Moffatt generally dresses, on the ground floor, close to the hall, it opens into the hall, it always hung there, in the course of the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the practice, to hang the watch in that place at the time the prisoner lived in your service? - Very frequently, but sometimes Mr. Moffatt carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it usually deposited in the evening after Mr. Moffatt went to bed? - In a little table-drawer in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was it generally removed from the fire-place to the little table-drawer? - Sometimes eleven o'clock; now and then at half past ten; Mr. Moffatt used to wind it up just as he was going to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the practice at the time the prisoner was in your service, to deposit this watch of a night in this table-drawer? - Yes, always when we were in town.</p>
               <p>Q.How did this table-drawer open? - The top listed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked or not? - It was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it you missed it after you had seen it? - Nine o'clock is the usual time that Mr. Moffatt comes down stairs, and then he always lifts up his drawer, and that morning the watch was missed; I was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was usually hung up by the fire-side; at what time of the day did you see it hung up at the fireside? - I cannot say what time I saw it in the course of that day.</p>

               <p>I am a servant in Mr. Moffatt's service, and was so at the time the watch was missed. I am a footman. I know the prisoner at the bar, I saw him the day the watch was missed, in the house; I opened the door to him; he said pray is Master Norris here he is a young man belonging to the family; I said no,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190004"/>he is not; he asked me if my master was up? I told him no, he was not up; he asked what time he would be up? I told him he would not be down much before nine; he asked what it was o'clock, I looked at the clock? and said it wanted twenty minutes to eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know at that time he had lived a servant in the family? - No, I did not; he said he came from some gentleman at Westminster, I have forgot the name; and he said my master had written to him to be there at eight o'clock; then I asked him if he would call again? and he took his hat and went out to the door, and I shut the door after him, and held the door; he never went out of my fight at that time, while he was in the house.</p>

               <p>I was cook in this family of Mr. Moffatt's. I know the prisoner perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day when the watch was missed? - On Wednesday morning, I think it was the 18th, it was a fortnight before Christmas; I was in the hall when the last witness gave him the answer the first time, cleaning it; and the young man sent him away, and I was at the bottom of the stairs, and he came in again in about twenty minutes afterwards, or not so much, the door was a jarr and he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the hall besides yourself? -  No, I was on the bottom of the stairs, I knew that to be the same man that came after my master before, and so I shut the hall door, and shut him in.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say? -  He had told the young man what he came for, and I had heard it all, and knew him to be the same man again; while I was cleaning the hall, he asked several things about the family, he made a deal of wet about the door, and I left him, to go down into the kitchen to fetch a cloth to clean where his feet had wetted the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any of the family left with him in the hall, or was he alone? - He was alone in the hail.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been in the hall all the time before you went down? - Yes, he had not been out of the hall at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from the kitchen, where did you see the prisoner? - I see him coming out of my master's little room, that opens into the hall; I was rather surprised at seeing him come out of that room, but he asked me for Mr. Moffatt's, or my master's bulfinch, I told him it was dead; he says dead! how sorry I am, that bird cost five guineas. I told him my master was very sorry for it; he stopped some time in the hall after that, and then said I have heard that Mr Moffatt is better natured after breakfast, and I will call again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call again? - He did not, I asked him if he had ever lived in the family? he said he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your master's watch hang up? - Yes, I believe I have, I never saw it in any other place; he told me he had been at Mr. Moffatt's country house, with his master, who was a single gentleman, a month or two at a time; I let him out, and never see him till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Jury How do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I knew him by sight very well because I see him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the hall after what past about the bird? - About five or six minutes, not longer.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Moffatt. Do you know the particular day it was lost? - It was the 11th of December.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-maker; I live in little Newport-street, Leicester-fields; I know the prisoner at the bar, I recollect him perfectly well, he came into my shop to know the opinion of a watch, which he said he found; it was on Wednesday, the 18th of December last, I looked at it, and told him it was a very good watch, likewise told him that he was very lucky to find so good a watch, that I frequently looked for to find something, but never was so lucky as he had been; so then says he, I cannot say that I admire this watch, it is not modern, and it was a high watch, and he fixed on one that was then in the shew glass, a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to fix on a watch in your shew glass? - He fixed on a silver watch, and intimated that if I would make an exchange for the silver one, he would let me have the gold one; I answered him that I would do no such thing, that the watch that he had found was preferable to the watch that he meant to exchange for; he then pointed out on the gold watch the defect of the maker's name being crased, I told him that I could rectify that; I had seen that, but I did not say any thing to him about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he express it? - He said it was rather an eye sore, or a hurt to the watch; I told him that I could put a name plate on the watch, and that the cap could be cut again as there was sufficient thickness there; he asked me how much it would come to? I told him half a guinea, which, he found rather too much, he then seemed rather to with to dispose of the watch, and for me to buy it, he intimated as much as that, I told him if he had the defects rectified he could better dispose of the watch, and perhaps get more than I could allow him for it; he asked me then, do you think that you could dispose of the watch for me? I said, I dare to say I can, he said, he would call the next day, or next morning, which was Thursday, I said, very well, but if you leave it only till to-morrow, I cannot be able to get it done, nor perhaps the next week, because it is holiday week; but at last I promised it should be done for him by the Saturday; he left the watch with me, I asked him what name I was to put on the watch? he told me, Frederic Hatfield, London. I asked about the number? he said it was immaterial; O, then says I, I will put one of my following numbers on it; he said, just so; and he left the watch; I took it in pieces the very moment he left it, in order to trace out whether this watch was not stole, I had my suspicions, and I found a mark in the inside, Mudge, No. 576, I recollected that an hand-bill had been left at our shop which mentioned something about a watch of that description, I made enquiry and at last traced it to be the property of Mr. Moffatt's. The prisoner called again on Saturday and then I apprehended him, I have had the watch ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man of whom you took that watch? - I am.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190007"/>Q. How did you leave your house? - My maid left it very safe, I left her in the house, my bed room door was locked, the chief part of the things were lost from the bed room; I had the key in my pocket, I am very sure it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the other keys of the house in your pocket? - No. When I came back I saw my servant come home before me and she told me I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you observed? - I did not observe any thing till she told me, and I went to examine my house and I found that my room door was forced open and the locks of my drawers broke all to pieces, and I missed my watch.</p>

               <p>Q. How many were there? - Five. I think three twenty's, and two ten's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you recovered any of your things since? - At the time that my things were cried I found my metal watch and a pair of metal buckles, and two or three other things; and at the trial of the other prisoners, I had one twenty pound note returned me. This metal watch always hung in the kitchen, it was the gold watch that hung at the beds head, this metal watch was taken at the same time. I have recovered in all a metal watch, a white shawl, a pair of buckles, a pair of buttons, a lawn white apron, and three half handkerchiefs; they were all in the house when I went out to the tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was in the tabernacle did you see your maid there? - Yes, I saw her come in about half an hour after me, into the tabernacle.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say anything to you before she went away, that she was going? - She did not; she went away in the afternoon; the man that cohabited with her was in the room. After that she did not return never any more. I went momentarily into the room as soon as she was gone; I missed the sheets off the bed, the one was torn in two and part left behind, and the other was quite gone; I missed a flat iron, and a tea kettle; the curtain she had tore, was not taken away; I put it in the indictment to let you know what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feathers did she take away from the bed? - There is not so many now as I can carry in a pocket handkerchief, it was a well stuffed bed before.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the feathers were taken out? - Because the feathers were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it ripped? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.These things were all let with the lodgings to her? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she to pay you? - Two shillings and six-pence a week. After she took the lodgings she had a man come there with her; the man sometimes paid me and sometimes she; he had a wife and three children, but she said, where she was there he should be.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the man come there after she took the lodgings? - I cannot say, very shortly, after a night or two; he was not there when she took the lodging; she took it as a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190010"/>widow. I know nothing of the man of my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q.You sometimes received the rent of the man? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Was you paid pretty regular? - Tolerably, only the last week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your things again? - I found some tickets in the room, in a drawer of a bureau, when the place came to be cleared, two days after she was gone. I found the ticket of a tea kettle, and the ticket of a flat iron.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean a pawnbroker's ticket? - Yes. I went to each of the pawnbrokers and brought them out, and paid for them. I found the tea kettle in St. Giles's, the flat iron in Carnaby-street, and the curtain I found in St. Giles's, the one that was taken away, the other was tore; the sheet I found at another pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how these things came there? - I don't, only they were in her name.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up? - On Friday after Christmas, the day after she left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her that day? - I see her at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. The man you say, lodged with her? - But she cleared the man when she was before the justice.</p>

               <p>CHARLES HAWKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a baker, at Sunbury. I received information concerning this matter on the 18th of January, from one Doctor Hansel, at Sunbury; in consequence I went and searched several public houses, this was on Saturday night between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend any body that night? - I apprehend Grist first at his father's house at Sunbury; then I apprehended Bryant in bed, in Mr. Richardson's, back of his place at his hot house, he was a gardener at Sunbury; I took them all the same night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on either of the prisoners? - No, I did not find any thing on them; I took Grist to the cage; when I came back his father wanted to know where he was; I went with him to the cage, I heard Grist tell his father that he did not do the robbery, it was Bryant did the robbery. I took him before the magistrate in the morning, I found nothing on any of them, but Bryant told me where the property was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What did you say to Bryant before he talked about where the property was? - I said nothing, only insisted on searching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him it would be better for him? - I did not, it was repeated to him, but I did not say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear some body tell him that it would be better for him? - No, I do not recollect I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, don't you know that somebody said, in your hearing, that he had better tell the truth, or something of that sort? - There may may be such words pass, but I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. But you recollect the other part of the story, why don't you recollect that? upon your oath did it or did it not pass? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that some person, in your hearing, did not say so? - I don't know about the particulars of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You may as well, on this case, speak the truth, will you swear that such conversation did not pass; that there was expressed a promise of favour if he would confess? - I cannot tell particularly.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any talked of shewing him favour, because he was a young man? - Yes, there was somebody told him that if Mr. Hudson got his property they dare say he would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any part of the property that was claimed? - Yes, I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it? - In the third, the further shed, on the second beam at the back of Mr. Richardson's hot house, I found there the two bank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190014"/>notes, one twenty pound and ten pound, and the purse has been found since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look for them there? - Bryant told me to search there for them. In the first place he told me he had thrown them over the hedge; I told him I was sure he had not thrown the property away, and I insisted on searching of him; then he told me if I would go and look where I afterwards did, that I should find the two notes there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the second beam in this shed? - He did, under a board in the hot house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bank notes? - I took them before the magistrate; I have got them now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know these notes by this paper that they were wrapped in, being my own figuring, and my brother's; they were wrapped up in that paper when I put them in my purse.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. That is the paper they were in.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You had taken these notes that day? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And a very good way too; perhaps you have heard of a forty pounds reward? - Yes, but I don't want it.</p>
               <p>Q. There are three forties if these men are convicted? - I did it for the good of the parish where I live in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Hansell? - Yes, he was the man that gave me the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that Hudson was very drunk? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not hear him charge Hopton with being the person that robbed him? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Any body else might have put the notes there for what you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- DARK sworn.</p>
               <p>I know no more only picking up the watch chain; I found it on Sunday morning, near the place where Mr. Hudson was robbed, between the George and Mr. Hudson's lodgings, in the high road; I picked it up about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it here? - I gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure that is the chain, I know the seal, the chain was broke off by the swivel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you see the prosecutor that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he drunk or sober? - I think he was rather in liquor.</p>

               <p>DOCTOR HANSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gardener, and nursery man; I know the three prisoners, I know Bryant, I have known him many years, I never knew a miss thing of him, I have known Hudson about two years, he lives on his means in our neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the Saturday that he talks of? - Yes, I went to smoke my pipe at the widow Thomas's, at the George, at Sunbury; it was about six o'clock, when I went in Hudson was there, and was very drunk indeed, and very abusive, with every person, I believe he came in very drunk, and the time he was there he drank three glasses of gin, and called for seven pots of beer, when he first came in he was very drunk, very drunk indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all this quantity of liquor did not help to make him sober? did you see him go out of the house? - I did not take particular notice, he went out several times in the course of the time, and came in again; the longer he continued the quarrelsomer he was with different people. I said to him as this, you are very troublesome in company, because he swore so very bad and often; I and another took down sixty nine oaths that he swore that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Hawkins say any thing about the three persons, Bryant and the other persons, when he had them in custody? - Mr. Hawkins could not find any thing on them, and he said he would acquit them; if that the prosecutor would acquit them; I said as you have taken them on suspicion, you have a right to keep them in hold, and you are very much to blame to acquit them, and we had words on that, about acquitting of them; the next morning I went to the justice's, to get him to stay at home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190016"/>before he went to church, to give them an hearing, I went before the prisoners some considerable time, when I came before the justice, Hawkins accused me at the justice's of making Hudson drunk, and I never was in his company ten minutes; after that as I was coming from the justice's Mr. Hudson was having a glass of brandy, and after that I was accused of making him drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Hawkins talking about any reward? - Yes, when we came out of the justice's he said after a few words, he said you are only angry with me because I have cut you out of the blood money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Hudson had the three glasses of gin that you stated to the jury? - I am sure of it, I set in the room and see him call for it, and called for seven pints of beer, and he was very drunk when he came into the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took off that wen? - Mr. Bevan and Jackson, farriers; they had cut off one of his ears to disguise him, and the tail and mane, and made him all over dirt, as possible a horse could be.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you agree? - Yes, I gave him eighteen shillings and six pence; he left the horse with me, and he had the money. I brings all my horses to Mr. Boswell's, in Cow Cross, ever since my husband has been dead, but I could not bring it down that night.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you said any thing to the prisoner about taking the horse any where for you? - He said be could leave it down in King John-court; I said it would be lost for I had no stable. This King John-court is a place where rubbish lays; I told him if he left it there, it would be lost, and I had nobody to kill it, I could not lead it down myself where I usually kill them; he said, then if I had nobody, he said, he would kill it, that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he kill it? - I never saw the horse, only going by the window when it was alive.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horse? - The gentleman gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid him the money? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Then what became of the horse after it was tied to the post you don't know? - I do not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have been in this horse business for these twenty years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour the horse was of you don't know? - It was dark, I had a candle, and the wind blew it out.</p>

               <p>Q. On finding that horse lay dead, how did it appear? did it appear to to have been killed, or how? - It had been stabbed. Seeing the horse in such a place, thoughts arose in my mind, I asked who it belonged to? I heard it belonged to Mrs. Seabroke; there was a gentleman there who suspected it to be his property, but it did not prove to be his property. From the information I received of the daughter of Mrs. Seabroke, I went and apprehended the prisoner, I found him in Pevitt's-court, Holywell-lane, in the same house where Mrs. Seabroke lives; I then took him to the watch-house; I asked him how he came by it in the watch-house? I made the best haste I could with him there, I locked him into the cage, and locked myself in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise or threats? - No; I asked him how he came by the said gelding?</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell him that he was apprehended on account of a horse? - I did; he told me that he had it of a man at the Horse and Groom, at Stamford-hill; I asked him what sort of a man, did you know him? he said no, he is a tall man, but he said he should know him if he was to see him again. I then left the watch-house and locked him up; I goes down to the watch-house in the afternoon to take him down to New Prison; to secure him, I pulled out a pair of hand cuffs; for God's sake, says he, don't iron me, for I am not guilty of it; says I, I think I shall be able to tell you that I have found out an owner for the horse, in order to try if I could discover any thing of him; he seemed very much affected; I don't recollect any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the horse? - Before I took him to the New Prison I went and got the horse, and drawed him from this place into the premises of Mr. Blinkworth's; after I had taken the horse I then attended the examination in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when Mr. Adams saw that horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same as you saw lying in the morning? - I am very certain of that; I had taken its marks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there present when Mr. Bagley's man saw the horse? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this place where you found the horse a great thoroughfare? - No; but there is a vast quantity of horses come down of Mr. Blinkworth's and another person's that lives there, but a strange horse I do not recollect ever seeing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You don't know what house you saw this man in, was it a public house? - No, a private house, in the lower apartment of the house where Mrs. Seabroke lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Cooke? - He now follows the lumping business, he was a dustman.</p>
               <p>Court to Cooke. You are bound over as a witness. What do you know about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190023"/>this horse? - I know nothing at all about this horses the prisoner spoke to me about a horse before he brought the horse, on Saturday about seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him then? - No, not that I saw; he asked me what price dog horses fetched? I said, there was all prices, according to what flesh they had on their bones they gave for them, I saw no horse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel, and you gentleman.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Kingstand-road, opposite the King's Head; I am a cabinet-maker; I was in business in Brewer-street, Golden-square; now I do business in the brokery line; I know the prisoner at the bar, and his father and mother; I have known them for some years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing respecting this horse which he is charged with stealing? - I will tell you the truth as near as possible in a few words. I had been to Tottenham about some business of my own, (it was Saturday the first of this month) coming home I met with the prisoner, and he told me that he was going to London, to buy some shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts was it you first light of him? - Near Stamford-hill, on the London side of the turnpike, but I am not very particular; the prisoner came up to a man who was leading a horse, and they seemed to know each other, he called the prisoner by his name, and he said, I have got this glandered horse to sell, and he asked him if he would go and sell it for him? and he would give him five shillings for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. About where was it he sell in with this man? - Near about the brow of the hill. He told him he was to ask twenty-five shillings for the horse, and he was not to sell him for less than eighteen shillings, and when he had sold him he was to carry the money to him some where about the Horse and Groom.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there such a sign as the Horse and Groom at Stamsord-hill? - I believe there is, I did not know that ever I was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed? - I left the prisoner; I went away about my business, and I saw no more of him, Cranny took the horse from the other, and I left them together.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be applied to on this business? - Knowing the father and mother for some time, and being informed the prisoner was brought into confinement, I recollected seeing him, and he told his father and mother about it, and they came to me, and I related to them as I have to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this man yourself that applied to him to take this horse? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at Kingsland-road? - About five years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in your present house? - About a year and a half, it is opposite the King's Head, Kingsland road.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has this lad, Cranny, borne? - A very good character as ever I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he support himself? - By working at different butcheries, sometimes he is a gardener and works at husbandry; he has been in the butchering line, a pork butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever brought up to a certain business? - No, I believe he was not. The father has had a large family of fourteen children; there is ten living now, one step above another, and he is the eldest.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go with the father and mother before the magistrate, when he was charged with the offence? - I did not know of it till after the time; he was in confinement here before they applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190024"/>to me, I believe; I believe he was intoxicated in liquor at the time they took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you imagine he did not recollect that you was with him at first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going when you first saw him? - He was coming towards London, and I was going the same way, I overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been with him before you met with this man and horse? - About a quarter of an hour, or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was the man coming with the horse? - He was coming towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason why he did not go himself to London with the horse? - He said he was busy, and if he would go with it, he would give him five shillings for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you and the prisoner did not come to London after this? - No, I left the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what size man was this? - He seemed to be a middle size man, a shortish man, not a very short man, I did not take any very particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He seemed to be an acquaintance of his, they seemed to know one another? - I cannot tell whether they did, I did not ask them any questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice enough of this horse to know whether it is glandered or not? - I don't know a glaudered horse if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Messenger. Where did the prisoner tell you that he had the horse? - He said he met a man at Stamfordhill, that he was at the Horse and Groom door when the man came up to him; it was a man that he did not know, but he should know him was he to see him again.</p>

               <p>Court to Hawes. Was it any thing of a glandered horse that you saw? - The horse was as clean as could be from any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Messenger. I was desired, by the magistrate to get it examined by a farrier, and it was not glandered, nor never had it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What was this horse worth? - I should have been sorry to have taken twenty guineas for him, he was such a good horse to ride.</p>
               <p>Court to Siabroke. When you was taken up you said you had the horse of this man; did you know his name? - I did, I knew him before very well.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had he ever sold any horses to you before? - Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you don't know the prisoner so as to swear to him? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. The prosecutor applied to me, and said she had been robbed, about the 20th, and asked me if I knew the prisoner at the bar? I told her I believed I did, and that I thought I could find the person, (it was Monday morning) I looked about for the prisoner for a few days, I heard of him, and went and broke into his room, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him? - In his lodging room in Grub-street, he said he knew nothing at all about it; I took him to a public house and there were a ten or a dozen people, the woman and child come, and both said that was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This woman owns that her house was a common lodging house, I think it is a very unlikely story that that man saw me in the room and yet he can give no description of me. As the lodgers can get out of themselves at what time of the morning they please, they may take the things themselves. I am really innocent.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a constable? - No. The prisoner came to my shop on Monday, the 20th of January last, and brought me these things, and offered them to sale.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it the prisoner brought for sale? - He brought two locks, and three hinges, an iron eight inch dead lock, and a padlock; I live in Princess-street, Lambeth, he came into my shop, and he pulled out this padlock, and said will you buy this padlock? I said what do you ask for it, he said eighteen pence, and I knew very well that that padlock must be worth five shillings; then he pulled out this eight inch dead lock, and the fcutcheons, and screws, and two brass hinges; and I said to him my friend, where did you get them? poh, poh, says he, hold your bother, give me five shillings, and let me go about my business, I found him in Chancery-lane, says I, where is the other hinge? he said he would go and fetch it, when he went away for the other hinge he returned and brought me a bed winch, and a common lock, and then I said, my friend, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190029"/>must go along with me to Union Hall; says he with all my heart, but what for? says I, I don't think you have come honestly by these things; I took him before a magistrate at Union Hall, and the things were advertized by the magistrate, and I went round to different ironmongers, where I used to deal, to enquire whether they had lost such things? and I got to Mr. Downer's on the Thursday following, I went into Mr. Downer's, and I asked if they had got any hinges of this kind? they said they had, and they brought down one to match it; I then asked if they had lost some? they said they had, and Mr. Downer and servant went with me to Union Hall, and they saw all the things, and they owned to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the things that you took from the prisoner, have you kept them from that time to this? - I left them with the magistrate at Union Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope they were not confounded with the things that were brought from the shop? - No, they were not.</p>

               <p>I am a shopman to Mr. Downer.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Downer's christian name? - Henry.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any partner? - No. I know these three hinges, they are the property of Mr. Downer, by the private mark that is on them, I missed the three hinges, and the eight inch dead lock; on Saturday, the 18th of January, I opened the paper of those hinges, to few a customer with them; the prisoner at the bar was in the shop, and I left him in the shop; it was about five o'clock in the afternoon, on Saturday, I saw him twice before that day, in the same shop, he came with small locks, to fit little keys with them, afterwards I left him in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop when you left him there? - Yes, six or seven people, some of them strangers, and some of them servants, when I returned I missed the locks, and three hinges.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you gone? - About three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold any of these hinges to the prisoner? - Not any of them, they lay on the counter for about three hours, before he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they on the counter at the time that he came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near that counter? - Yes, he was, he had been in the shop about half an hour before I went out, and I left him in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came back did you find him there still? - No, he was gone, I never saw him any more, till I saw him at Union Hall.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to go to Union Hall? - By the broker's calling at our house; he called on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see any of your goods? - At Union Hall.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that exactly the quantity missing? - Yes, exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you identify, the whole, or only part of them? - The padlock I know to be on the counter that very day, here is our private mark, I had received it of a customer returned; the inch dead lock I had had in my hand before that day, I had four of them on the counter, and I missed this one, which the prisoner took away; I know it by a private mark that is on the bolt, the name (Tarratt)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190030"/>these three hinges were opened in a paper to shew to a customer that evening, and he did not take them; I know the hinges perfectly again, by a certain scratch that was on one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the things that you saw who put them into your hands? - Pullen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they were the same articles? - I am certain of them, I examined them particularly at Union Hall and they prove to be the same now as then.</p>
               <p>Court to Pullen. Did you put into the hands of this man the same as you took from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Downer. When was it you was at Union Hall? - I do not recollect the day I was there, I think it was two days after the broker called on me, and informed me that such things were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you identify them more than your servant has done? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - Upwards of twenty shillings, they cost me more.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more have you in this shop? - Three shopmen, and an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - They are not.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it your own mark, or your servants? - I believe it to be the writing of my shopman, not the mark of any man present because this shopman has not lived with me above two months.</p>
               <p>Q. To Ousy. Do you know of your own knowledge that your dealer has not sent to any shop besides your's any dead docks of the name of Tarratt on it? - We wrote to him particularly about this, and he sent word back that he had never made any for any man in England besides Mr. Downer, not locks of that size, with the name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold any with the name of Tarratt on them? - We had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you sold some hinges of this sort? - Yes, some, we had sold three pair, but I had a perfect knowledge of these hinges, I had rubbed one of the joints of them.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the padlock you had sold some of them with the private marks on them? - I never have, others in the shop might have done it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 18th of January, I was accused by Mr. Downer and servants in the shop of being in the shop that afternoon which I was at work that morning from seven till six in the evening, in Little St. Martin's-lane, along with Mr. Shaw, the master that I worked with, and I was paid for my time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the day of the week? - Saturday.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is Mr. Shaw here to prove that you was at work on that day? - No, he is not.</p>

On Saturday the 18th of January, I was very much in liquor, and did not go home till between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Berwick-street, and I went down Charing-Cross, after that I went into a house, I don't know the sign of it, and there I staid, and had some liquor, and became quite insensible; I really cannot tell the sign, it is the right hand side going down, near the Admiralty; I got quite drunk, I don't know what became of me; at five o'clock in the morning I found myself in the watch house.</p>
               <p>Court. That was right enough, you ought to be taken to the watch-house to be sure. - I found I had lost my property, after that I asked them if they had any charge against me? they told me no, they told me where they picked me up, drunk in the street, at the top of Bow-street. When I came to myself I found myself in the watch-house, with no coat, hat, shoes, nor neek handkerchief on; they discharged me, they had no charge against me, at ten o'clock I returned to know if they knew any thing about my things; they told me where they picked me up, accordingly on Sunday morning I went to the Sun in Long-acre, and there was a watchman, and two of the justice's men, and the watchman said that he saw this man take my things.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got your property again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you? - I had two guineas and some silver, eight or nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you was sensible you had got that money about you? - Between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether you was not at Charing-Cross, a treating of some girls of the town? - There were two women in the house at the time that I was there, and I drank with them, but they went out before I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that? - About one o'clock in the day, or some little tritle of it; the robbery was committed about ten minutes after eight o'clock at night; I had been at different places, about my business, from that time, but never took my money out of my right hand breeches pocket, no other than three guineas, which I changed at Mr. Oliver's at night; that was before this happened, then that left me ten half guineas, and three whole guineas, I left Mr. Oliver nearly about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the town is Mr. Oliver's? - At the top of Nightingale-lane, in East Smithfield, within a little way from where I was robbed; I come my way home, and came to <placeName id="t17940219-12-crimeloc58">Parrott-alley</placeName>

I came by this alley, and I see a man rather standing within the alley, and I thought I knew the man, I asked the man if his name was Appleby? he replied it was not; I asked him if he knew a man of that name, that resorted that neighbourhood? he asked me what profession he was? I told him; he readily told me that he knew a man of that name, that lived in that alley, and I was very glad of the opportunity, because the man owed me a little money; he told me if I would go down that alley with him he would shew me where the man lodged; I went down the alley, it may be within a foot or two the length of this table, when the man laid hold of me by both my arms.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he lay hold of you? - I had my hand in my breeches pocket, he laid hold of me, and pinioned me up, and the expression he made use of was, d-n you, not a word, he laid hold of both my arms.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he laid hold of both your arms, did your hand continue in your breeches pocket, or not? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your hand came out of your pocket immediately? - It did, he took both my hands behind me, and pinioned me up to the building, and then four or more women came, three I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did they come from? - They came from the end of the alley,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190036"/>they were standing at the end of the alley when I spoke to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that they came into the alley after you? - They were in the street when I first talked to the man, and they came up the alley after me, the one as the man held me put her hand into my pocket, and stole all this gold out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the woman's hand in your pocket, and not the man's? - I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q.Which pocket was it? - The right hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When she had done that what became of the others? - As soon as the man saw that the woman had robbed me of my property, he fetched me a blow as hard as he could on the head, but my hat having an high crown to it, it did not hurt me, only knocked my hat off; after that they all ran away as fast as they could, and the man ran to East Smithfield, the way that I came in, and the women they ran down the alley the other way, the alley is a thoroughfare; I saw one woman run into a house, and I pursued her immediately, there was an inside door to it, but I ran against the door, and the door burst open; the house was in the same alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she get out of your sight at all? - No, I never let her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean she was not out of your sight from the time of her running away, from the time you found her in the house? - No other than when she was going into the door; I impeached her immediately with the robbery, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door, locked or how? - I believe it was only latched, I shoved against it and it flew open; she denied the robbery for a long time; I told her if she would tell me the parties, so that I might get my property, I should be very happy.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the person that you seized? - Lloyd, I never afterwards let her out of my sight, I kept her in my custody in that house, till the watch was set, and then I had her secured, and I called him in, his name is Frederic Wibbing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that one of the women put her hand into your pocket; was that Lloyd or the others? - One of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Lloyd before? - Yes, I had, by passing and repassing, and by living in the parish so many years. There was a light shone bright on her.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was that? - The light of a lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the other prisoner was taken? - The next morning, between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Was you present? - No, I was not, I see her at the watch-house before the hour of ten in the morning, they came to let me know she was taken, as soon as I saw her I knew her face.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did she take in the robbery? - She took my money out of my pocket, I knew her person very well, I had seen her many a time before.</p>
               <p>Q. For what length of time do you think you had known her person? - I think for three years, I frequent that neighbourhood two or three times a week at times, I have lived in the parish nine years, I have seen them both about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how Lockhart came to be taken? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any description of her person? - I did, the best that ever I could I gave to Moses Fonseca.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property about her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. On neither one nor the other of them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I am counsel for Lockhart only.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190037"/>Q.You know these persons at the bar are trying for a capital offence; you are well acquainted with that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently if your evidence is believed it will doom them to suffer the law? I would have you be cautious before you swear positively what you have said to my learned friend. I take it for granted in Nightingale-lane there are a great number of loose women? - There are.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between eight and nine o'clock at night? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was done at a time that they are not less frequest than they are in day light? - I don't doubt it in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know the persons of all the women in that neighbourhood of that character? - For to say that I know every one by name I do not, I know them no otherwise than I know you, supposing I was to meet you in the street; I suppose there is five hundred, if the truth was known, in that lane.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Lloyd you had as good an opportunity of seeing as the prisoner Lockhart? - I had not a better opportunity, for I saw Lockhart's face well, and I had a good opportunity of knowing her.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my learned friend and my lord just now, that you followed her into a house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. She was taken on the spot? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. The other women got away at that time? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women think you there might be with this man that you first addressed? - There were four, and there might be more, I cannot tell; but there were not exceeding five, I could almost venture for to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take on yourself to swear to the others as well as to these women? - I could not; there were others apprehended, but for the exchange of dress I could not swear to them, for which I am sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lamps were there in the alley? - There was none in the alley, but there was at the bottom of the alley; whether there is any lamp in the alley or not I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the lamp by which you made your observation, is the lamp in the street, at the end of the alley? - It is, it shone right on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How far had you proceeded up the alley when the man laid hold of you? - It did not exceed the length of this table the long way, a very little way into the alley.</p>
               <p>Q.Then after you had got that distance this matter happened that you have stated? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an inclosed alley? - No, it is an open alley, a thoroughfare, I know nothing to the contrary; I was never down the alley in my life time; it was thoroughfare enough for them to run away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Lockhart taken? - She was taken in the same court I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure to the best of your recollection, there was no other lamp, save the lamp at the end of the alley? - I cannot say there was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what length the alley is? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman that went away from you proceed up the alley, or come back again into the street? - There was none proceeded into the street but the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Now there was no property found on Ann Lockhart? - I was not at the searching of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the searching of the prisoner Lloyd? - I believe she was searched in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found or not? - No, I recollect she was searched.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190038"/>Prisoner Lloyd. Pray, sir, did I ever wrong you of any thing? - I have said to the learned counsel what I had to say. She was one of the women, she was helping to hustle me up against the wall.</p>
               <p>Court. What particulars did they do besides the one woman that took the money? - They all assisted as well as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do? let us hear if they did any thing? - There were no other expressions than d-n you not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the women take any other active part than the woman that took your money? Lloyd you pursued into a house, how far was that house from the spot where your money was taken out of your pocket? - A very small distance, it did not exceed thirty yards; I see her all the way into the door, it was a moon light night, I see her go in doors, and I followed her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman in the room at that time with her? - I saw no other, and I don't know there was any other woman in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never lost sight of her from her entrance into the house, till you found her in the room? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to swear to her, as being one of the four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any candle light in the room? - Yes, there was a candle had been a light, it was just blowed out, the snuff was alight, and I put it to the fire, it light directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known Lloyd again if you had not seen her so soon? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You was asked by the counsel how you happened to know the persons of these women more than a great many others that are there of the same sort of women? - I never was molested by any other parties; I know them no other than by passing and repassing; there is a great number resort to that neighbourhood, but there were no other about at that time just there.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing nothing had happened to you, how should you have known these women from other women of the same description? - I should not have taken notice.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had noticed them before? - I had not noticed them no more than other women.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have given this as a reason? - There is many a one that I should know perfectly well, as well as them by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you still persist that you knew these women by sight before? - Yes, I know them by passing and repassing many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you broke this door open? - I dare say the space of time was not half a minute after I had my money taken out of my pocket, and received a blow on my head.</p>

I made up to her, and she was standing, and a man with her, before the Crown and Anchor, in Black horse yard, so I heard somebody coming down stairs of the Crown and Anchor to open the door, and there was a watchman that brought her there; where he came from I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this watchman? - I cannot tell indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her first was she in custody of any watchman? - No, this watchman knows nothing about this affair.</p>
               <p>Court. I am sure you don't know much about it? - Seeing this man stand at the door with Ann Lockhart I was rather dubious to take charge of her by myself, therefore I went to the watch-house to get assistance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you any information from Grose that led you to suspect Lockhard? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q.Grose had given you this description before Lockhart was apprehended? - Yes, it was when Lloyd was taken to the watch-house he gave it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you take with you? - The houseman from the watch-house, Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her? - Yes, at the Crown and Anchor.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time in the morning did you take her? - About half past three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she had got into the house afterwards at where you first saw her? - Yes, I gave the people a light in the house before I went to the watch-house; I took her to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got her into the watch-house did you search her? - Yes, and nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long have you been a watchman in this part? - Seven years last Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Q. It is pretty well crowded with these sort of women? - Very much so sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at the time, between eight and nine, they are pretty plenty? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this Crown and Anchor from the place where the gentleman described himself to be robbed? - About four score yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any light in this alley? - There is one lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - Yes, at the bottom of the alley, that lights to the corner of Ann Lockhart's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that lamp would give a light as far as the prosecutor has said? - I was not there on the spot at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. If there is a lamp at the end of the alley, in the street, it could not give so great deal of light to an alley so long as it has been described? - That I cannot say any thing about.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched both the prisoners? - Yes, they were both searched in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Lloyd was taken directly, and nothing was found on her. How many did you see that night do you think after eleven or twelve o'clock, or thereabouts? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have been drinking at all? - He was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190040"/>Court to Grose. As I collect from you, they put their hands in one pocket, then there was no further search made? - There was not. I had nine pounds in silver in my coat side pocket, but that was not taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say why they deserted you without attempting to make further search? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lockhart. Before I was taken to the watch-house I lived in this house; when I first saw this gentleman it was at this house where this woman was taken, he stopped me first, and when I saw him in the house he said this woman had robbed him, and then he light the candle, and shewed me the bed, and said it was on that bed he was robbed, and then afterwards that he had said so he first locked the door and locked me in, but afterwards he opened the door and let me out, and said I was not the woman, and then I was taken in the morning as I was going to Gravesend, but I wanted to get something first to drink.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lloyd. I came from my day's work; I am but a poor woman; I have a garret in this house, and I saw this gentleman sitting in a chair in this house; I had a coat to mend for a person; I asked him whether he came for a coat I had to mend for a young man? he told me no; he said to me he had been robbed of six guineas and a half, and he said if so be I could not find him the people that robbed him, I should suffer for all; where of I never saw the people, nor know nothing at all about it; so immediately he pulled me into the lower room, and kept me there till the watchman came to cry the hour, and then he gave charge of me; here is a young man,

               <p>I live at Woolwich; I am a rope-maker belonging to his Majesty's yard. Last Friday when I was coming through Black Horse-yard, about half past eight, I went into Ann Grey's house-

             I mean - I made a mistake, and enquired for my coat that she had to mend.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you given her that coat? - About four or five days before, it was tore underneath the arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she usually work for you? - Yes, for these twelve years. As soon as I entered the room I saw this gentleman there, the prosecutor, in the lower room, and the woman was sitting down in the chair, and the man was standing up, they were talking concerning a robbery; I asked what was the matter? the gentleman replied he had lost six guineas, immediately there was a watchman sent for, and she was immediately taken away to the watch-house. I see her searched, and I knew no further.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you working in his Majesty's yard still, down to the present time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what department are you working, under whom? - Mr. Suckling.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into this house? - About half past eight as high as I can judge.</p>

             at home then? - She was, and I told her if it was so it was a very bad thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expostulate with the watchman about his charge? - All I heard was that the watchman took charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the watchman must have seen you? - I was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not talking of the juncture of time, but the juncture of place? - I was in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190041"/>Q.Was you in the room before the watchman was called in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how was the watchman sent for? - First of all there was a boy very nigh the door, and this gentleman said, I will give you a shilling if you will fetch a watchman; the boy was just by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find the boy was just by the door? - I saw him myself, and the gentleman saw him too; the room that we were standing in looked into the alley; this boy was standing just at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out the boy? - Because this gentleman he went to the door, to give an alarm to the watchman, and he saw the boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the boy went out for the watchman? - He did; but the watchman came before the boy came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the watchman that came in? - I cannot see any man that is here, that is like him; he was a short elderly man. I went to the watch-house with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep in this house sometimes? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you attended the woman, and the prosecutor, and watchman, to the watch-house, and see her searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing taken from her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. She had been your acquaintance for ten years? - Yes. I have been in the house many times when I have had money in my pocket, and laid on the bed when I have been in liquor, and sometimes have treated her with a quartern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you to mention the name of Groves? - It was a mistake of mine to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for it? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you see any thing of that last witness that night? - He came in about two or three minutes before I gave charge to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see him? - He came into the house; she asked this man if he would give her something to drink? he said, no, he would not, for she was a very bad woman, and he would not give her any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention about losing six guineas before him? - I was not certain to the sum till I got to the watch house, and counted all the other money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that you put all the gold into that pocket? - I knew very well I did, but I was in a flustration that I did not know hardly what I had got about me; I believe I did make use of the words that I have lost six guineas, and when I came to recollect I had ten half guineas in that pocket and three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. The man you have never said hold of? - No, I have not, but if I was to see the man I should know him.</p>

               <p>Q. When was your house broke open? - On the 17th of January, on Friday; it was supposed to be broke open about half after five in the morning; I did not sleep in the house on account of its being lately finished, it was damp with the plaister, I was afraid of catching cold; there was no person in the house except a dog in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in it that day? - Yes, I was there on Thursday night, about ten minutes before ten; I was the last person in the house, I locked the street door, and sastened every thing in the house the last thing when I left the house, and fastened all the places.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make your discovery that it had been broke open? - The next morning, I was the first person that went to it myself, I went a few minutes after eight o'clock. The first thing I discovered was all my pegs empty; I found the street door fast as I had left it, but I observed a pane of glass taken out of the parlour window the first thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this pane of glass, did you discover it when you was inside of the house, or when you went to the door? - I discovered it when I was inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What other parts of the house was broke besides the pane of glass, were there any shutters to the window? - Not any at all. I apprehend they broke in at the back door, but I could not get to the back door without going into the parlour, the pane of glass was taken out of the door of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this parlour door, is it a communication between the shop and parlour? - It is between the shop and parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you conceive this was broke, for any purpose, or was it a mere accident? - They could not get into the shop without taking this pane of glass out; but before they came to this they got in at the back door, with an iron crow or something; the back door is exposed to the street, I found that door broke all to pieces almost; they had forced the things that the bolts go in, and broke the door all to pieces almost; so then by breaking this pane of glass in the parlour door, they could put their hand in through and get up the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came away, ten minutes before ten, it was quite dark then, I suppose? - O, yes, quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know how it was when you went to this house in the morning, was it dark or was it not? - It was not as you say dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish a man's face? - Yes, plenty of light to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the shop finding your back door broke this way? - I did, I missed forty or fifty pair of shoes, I cannot tell justly how many mens shoes, and some boys, and half boots, all leather shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop did you miss them from? - I missed them from the pegs, some racks that I had made to hang them on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were there the over night? - I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else missing? - Not that I can recollect, except a pair of half boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover any of these shoes? - Yes, two pair offered for sale, and one pair I took off the prisoner, Webb's feet, at the office; one pair offered for sale I saw in the hands of Mr. Ford, this was on Monday, they had wore them, because I should not know them. The other pair were offered for sale to Mr. Richardson, in Monmouth-street, that was on Tuesday; the third pair I took off his feet at the office, this was on Tuesday. He came in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190043"/>over night, the Thursday night before the house was broke open; to get something done to his shoe. I have kept ever since, that pair I took off Webb's feet, the other persons who stopped the other two pair have kept theirs; Webb was in the shop the night before the robbery, to get his shoe mended, and he said when he was there it must be cold to sit here; and I said yes, it is very cold, and I saw him as he went out look through the parlour windows, I took notice of him particularly, and had some suspicion of him.</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker, in Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from the house of Mr. Colwell, the last witness? - About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a pair of shoes brought to you by any body? - Yes, by Webb; they were leather shoes; I asked him where he got them? as soon as I took the shoes into my hand I saw the private mark, and I thought they were Colwell's, he said he got them of a man at Kennington Common; I told him I knew the person that owned them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more about them? - No, going along we met Mr. Colwell, as soon as he met him, he said you are the young man that I want to see, and he collared him, and took him to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the shoes that the lad brought to you? - I had them of him, and have kept them ever since, till I came to this place, I marked them myself in the office with an R.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look on them altogether, and tell me whether these are the shoes that you took from the prisoner Webb? - I can swear to the shoes; I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>BOLTON FORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a shoe-maker, No. 31, Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the house of Mr. Colwell's? - About half a mile. The prisoner Lewis offered these shoes to fell to me the Monday following after they were lost; I have kept them ever since, till to day they were all put in an handkerchief, and given to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were the shoes you gave to the prosecutor? - I wrote my name, 
               <persName id="t17940219-13-person199">
                  Joseph

            , on them, at the Justice's; I am confident they are the shoes I took from Lewis, he offered them to me for sale, he asked me two shillings and six-pence for them, and I looked inside and see the marks correspond to a bill that I had left in my shop, I took him instantly to the office.</p>
               <p>Court to Colwell. What may be the value of the shoes that you took from Webb yourself? - One shilling; they were all old shoes only new foled and heeled, I know them by a cut with the knife in the inner foles.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you sold some with that cut? - Yes, many a pair.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you can say with certainty that they were a pair taken out of your house that night you missed some, or a pair that had got into the world by sale? - It was a pair that I missed that night, because I had left them in the shop, I had been in the shop but five days, I could swear to them if there was no mark on them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a pair produced by Mr. Richardson, have you got that pair here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them? - They are marked according to what they cost, this is cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had they been mended? - I cannot justly say, because I may have mended them before I was in business for myself, because I have mended many a pair before I was in business.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you had not sold these shoes? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190044"/>Q.Now there is another pair taken from Lewis, by Mr. Ford? - Those I had seven pair of one gentleman's wear, and I had not sold any pair of them, they are my own work, soled and heeled, and they are cut with a knife too.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you mended them? - I cannot say, it might be a fortnight, I cannot justly say, I missed the whole seven pair of one gentleman's wear.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see there a pair only found, and these boys lives depend on your evidence; have you on your conscience any doubt about them; supposing these shoes had been put into your hands at York, should you have known them at York; should you have ventured to have said, supposing you had seen them at a shop in York. these are my shoes? - Yes, I should, I should have known them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the whole three pair? - About four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of the whole forty you lost? - Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Would they sell for three pounds do you think? - Yes, they would.</p>
               <p>Jury. One shoe of this pair is marked and the other is not, have you any reason for that? - No, it is by accident; I keep them in pairs as I buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in the morning, how did you find your dog? - I found it cut loose, it was out of the house, I met the dog by St. Giles's Church.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he hurt at all? - He was not, he was tied up in the house, and he was cut loose with the rope about his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Webb. I works for a plaisterer, and I was going to work between six and seven in the morning; I was going across by St. Giles's pound, and I saw one of these shoes lay in one place and three or more lay straggling all in the road, and I picked them up, and one pair fitted me, and the others I went to sell them, and this man stopped me with the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lewis. On Monday morning I went to sell my things, and I met a man in the street, and he asked me to buy them shoes, and I told him I had but six-pence and half a dozen of mats about me; and he said he knew what to do with the mats as well as me, and I gave him the six-pence and half dozen of mats for them, and I went to sell them in Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Ford. Did he give you any account how he came by them? - He said he gave six-pence and some mats for them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How soon was you to return to this house? - In the course of five or six days, or not so much, as soon as the plaisterers were out of it.</p>

               <p>I keep a house in Long-alley, Moorfields; I bought the looking glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that looking glass in a gilt frame? - Yes; I bought it the day after Christmas Day, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I bought it of Vandome and Brown, Vandome brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner with him? - Yes; one Mr. Wright, a neighbour of mine, came with them, to recommend them to sell the looking glass; they asked me sixteen shillings for it; I asked him whether it was his own? they all three came together.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom was the conversation? - I asked Vandome whether it was his own? he said, he had rather been a drinking, and he would sell the looking glass unknown to his wife, and asked me whether I would buy it? he said that he had had words with his wife, that he was drinking, and would sell the looking glass; I told him I could not give that money, for I must make money of it again; I gave him eleven shillings and six-pence for it; the bird was broke off it, and I said I could not give him any more for it; he said it cost him a golden guinea. They went out all together, and that was all that passed. I am perfectly sure of the two men; I never saw them but that once; Mr. Wright was with them, that was the reason I bought it, or else I never buy any thing at the door without I know the people.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Brown say? - He never said a word.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was the money paid to? - To Vandome. I did not know it was stole, I hung it out at the door for almost three weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Brown. Your husband, Mr. Ferris, is a person employed in the police office? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore one would think that would be the last shop that a thief would take goods to, to the very thief taker's shop. When Wright came with the two people you knew him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Vandome brought the glass? - He did, and Brown only came with him, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I understand you to say that Vandome said that he had some liquor, and that he must part with the glass? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you found her attempting your pocket, before you gave her the halfpence, or after? - Before, I told her to keep her hands off, when I felt her hands on my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave her this copper what then? - She tusled her hand under my waistcoat pocket in a minute, and turned out nine shillings, at the same time as I was giving her the copper; this was in the public street, and not in the court, on the top of the court; the lining of my pocket was turned up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the money tumble down, or how? - Upon my word I cannot be certain, but the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see it in her hand? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor see it fall? - I did not, but her hand was put to my pocket, and I heard the silver rattle, but I see nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know there was nine shillings in your pocket at that time? - I had changed at the coffee house, half a guinea, and had nine shillings in change, and put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. On your charging her with picking your pocket of nine shillings, what did she say, or do? - There was no further conversation passed then but what I have mentioned; then I laid hold of her, and gave charge of her into the watchman, or patrole's hands, she tried to rescue herself from me, but I never quitted her till I gave charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she taken to? - To St. Martin's watch-house, she was searched there, and three half crowas were found on her, and two shillings and six-pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What pieces of money was your nine shillings composed of? - Two half crowns and four shillings, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, belonging to the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, and my watch beat is down Spring-gardens, this happened the 21st of January, just about half past eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you quite sober? - Yes, I am sure I was.</p>
               <p>Bamford. I had just called the half past eleven, and I had got into the watchbox, and the patrole came by and challenged me, and I gave him the answer, as soon as I gave him the answer, I heard a talking in Buckingham-court, between some parties.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is your box from this court? - Quite at the corner. It was in the court, to the best of my remembrance, when I heard it, as soon as I heard that, I was endeavouring to stir out to see what was the matter, and in almost momentarily they came up to the box, and the prisoner at the bar, called out patrole; she was coming out of the court, and she told me that there was a gentleman threatened to knock her brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body near her at the time? - Not till they both came up to the patrole and me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see the prosecutor? - They were both together in the court, or coming out of it, I did not see them till they came up to the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first of them? - The woman was the first, and coming as from the court, it goes from Spring-garden Mows into Parliament-street, just by the Admiralty, they were coming from Parliament-street way, through the court into the Mews, my box is on the Mews side; it was all peaceable and quiet five minutes before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190052"/>Q.On her saying this what past? - The man said that she had robbed him of nine shillings; while he was telling the patrole that, the woman came to me, and offered me half a crown in the box.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she say what she offered you the half crown for? - Not at all; I told her I dare not do any such thing, nor I would not; then the man came and told me that she had robbed him; says I, you must charge her with it, and he did, and I and the patrole took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when she was searched there? - Yes, she pulled the money out of her pocket herself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she pull out? -  I cannot charge my memory, I believe about ten shillings, it was what she herself produced.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HUMPHRIES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the beadles of St. Martin's in the Field; I was on duty that night, between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 21st of January last, the prosecutor and the watchman brought the prisoner at the bar into the watch-house, the prosecutor said he was robbed of nine shillings; I said, my good woman, you must be searched, I was approaching to search her, and she said I will pull out all I have got, and she throwed out three half crowns, two shillings and six-pence, and four-pence in copper, three-pence halfpenny and two farthings, I searched the outside of her pocket, and there was nothing else in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she undergo any further search? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any thing more pass? - The charge was taken, and she was committed to person the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told them I had eleven shillings all but two pence, in my pocket. This gentleman as I was coming across Buckingham-court met me; and as he met me I heard a noise of some woman, in this said court; with that I went down, and this man, the prosecutor, catched hold of me, and in catching hold of me, I said, what do you want? says he, will you have a glass of any thing? and I said, yes, if you please, then with that he gave me a penny, after he gave me this penny he wanted to be very bad with me indeed, and I would not consent to it, and after that he asked me how far I was going? I told him I was going into the Strand, to pay some money away; as I came out he said he would give me an unlucky blow, that he would make me call the watchman to him, I called the watchman and the patrole, and the watchman came out of his box directly; says I, I will give you something if you will not let this man meddle with me, and after that then the watchman he came out, and behaved very civil indeed, and after that this man charged me for a robbery, I knowed myself very innocent; the watchman said you must go up to the watch-house; I said I will go up with you. I had been working for a person that keeps a chandler's shop in Westminster, one Mr. Burrows, and his wife paid me five shillings for washing, that very day.</p>

               <p>About half past five on Wednesday evening, I saw two men coming along by the Royal George, at the back of Mr. Anderson's garden, the prisoner at the bar went down to the corner of the wall, and looked down after some clothes, but there being a girl in the garden he came back again, and he went up towards Sloan-square, and towards Knights-bridge; about three quarters of an hour after I was going to water a horse, and a man in a white jacket was running down the town, and my brother that was along with me said, that man in a white jacket is one that was going into the garden we pursued him, and went down the Ranelagh-walk before him, and we saw he had nothing, and the other he came past with nothing, whistling; after we had past the one, Mr. Anderson came by, and asked if we saw any body go by that way? I told him what I saw, and went with him, and overtook the prisoner, and took him into custody, and took him across the bridge, which they call Genevin's-bridge.</p>

Then the constable came, and the woman gave charge of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190055"/>me, and he took me to the watch-house, and the next morning they came to me, and got some beer, and asked me to go for a soldier again, and I told them the same, and then they gave me some bread and cheese, after that they said you must go to the justice's, and I said if I have done any thing to go to a justice's I will go; I did not like to sent to my friends, because of losing my character.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had she been in your house? - About two months before this happened. I stayed out rather latish one night about ten o'clock, and my wife was along with me, and she took it off the bed, when I went home my little child cried, and said Kit had taken the blanket away from the bed, and gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left her in the house? - My wife did, I had been out all day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return? - Ten o'clock at night, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether any blanket was missing on the bed? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than one blanket on it? - No, only one.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner? - I sent out after her directly, and I heard by the watchman that she was gone down the road with the bundle under her arm; I set out after her between ten and eleven, I did not overtake her at all, I heard at Islington that they had taken her on suspicion, and had got her into the cage, and there I found her, the constable of the night had got the blanket, I saw it there at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember packing up any pins on the 7th of February? - On the 7th of February in the morning there came two foreigners to our house to buy some pins and needles by way of a sample, and I looked out seventeen thousand needles, and a quantity of pins, two half dozen of full whites, two packets of flat heads, a dozen of three and a half middlings, one dozen of best middlings; I see the goods packed, I was by all the time they were packed about nine o'clock on Friday morning, that was the same morning the foreigners had bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the person here that put them in? - No, I see them packed in a parcel, they were in different parcels each separate and then packed together in one paper parcel, then they were deposited in a place in the shop, I saw them, they ordered them to go on Saturday morning at half past eight o'clock to Angel-inn, Angel-street, room 25. Mr. Dupont, the foreigner, ordered them, this was the next day. I saw them put bye, in a window behind the door of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How late had you seen them on the 7th of February? - I did not see them after they were put there, about ten o'clock on Friday morning. On Saturday morning at half past eight o'clock, I ordered the porter to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your masters a wholesale or a retail shop? - Both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to see whether they were missing? - I did and I found them missing, then I acquainted Mr. Finch of it, and he looked for them and could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen these Needles and pins since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.In whose possession are they now? - In Nowland's, the officer's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to know them to be your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of them before they were in Nowland's possession? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them in Nowland's possession, was you able to identify them as your masters property? - I was</p>
               <p>Q. You was not present at the apprehension of either of the prisoners? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before? - No; when I came before the justice, I went along with the police officer to Whitechapel, there I saw the two prisoners, and Jellison said that he had bought them at our house a month ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190057"/>Q. Did the magistrate take it down in writing? - Not that I know of, I took it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am counsel for Jellison.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other shopman of your shop here to day? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the parcel after ten that day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see it in the evening of that day? - I did not look for it.</p>
               <p>Q. This parcel was put on a window behind the shop door? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is within the view of all the persons who are serving in the shop? - No, it is not, because the door stands against it, the door stands open and that blocks the window up, there is a brass grating which secures the window from any person without.</p>
               <p>Q. So that any person could not have taken it from the street? - No, they could not, there was no glass broke.</p>

               <p>Q. How near is this to the counter where you served? - The space of a yard and a half I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any workmen employed about your house that day? - O! yes, several.</p>
               <p>Q. That was what I wanted to know, I believe suspicion fell on some of the workmen of the house? - No, I did not entertain an idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no suspicion mentioned in the house that it was probably done by some of the workmen in the house? was not it talked of? - It was talked of.</p>

               <p>Q. How many workmen were there in the house? - I cannot say, seven or eight, or ten, perhaps more than that, they are not in the house, they come in and out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. This man you never saw in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then whoever committed this robbery must have come into the house? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the police of Whitechapel. In consequence of information on the 8th of February, I went to Jellison's house, when I first went there it was about six o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Jellison live? - In Winfield-court, Winfield-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be Jellison's house? - I knew him to have lived there sometime.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there what did you observe? - I watched there till about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Jellison at home when you went? - He was not at home when I went into the house; at seven o'clock I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190058"/>went home to my own house, and returned again a little before nine when I found him at home, I went to his house in company with John Griffiths another officer, Jellison, as soon as I went in asked me how I was? he knew me before and I knew him; I told him I was very well, and that I had some information of some property being in his house; he told me he believed he knew what I wanted in his house; he asked me if I had an information of some stolen butter being in his house? I told him I had, I searched about and did not find any thing for some time, I searched at last in the cupboard in the first floor, and found a quantity of needles and pins, (I had been up stairs before,) they were in a brown paper, I took them and have had them in my custody ever since; I found also a quantity of pins wrapped up in a blue apron laying on a table; I asked Jellison what was in these paper parcels? he told me pins.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these quantity of pins wrapped up in the blue apron in paper parcels? - Yes, they were in separate papers not loose, I asked him what they were? he told me pins, I asked him how he came by them? he told me he bought part at the foot of London-bridge, and part in Cannon-street; I asked him what quantity there were? he said twelve thousand, speaking of both the pins and needles. I asked him how long since he had bought them? he told me three or four weeks; I searched his pockets and found some papers of pins and needles. Bellamy was there, I asked him who Bellamy was? he was there when I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bellamy go up stairs with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after you found the things or before that you asked him who Bellamy was? - After I had found the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he give you to that? - He told me he was a watchman in the City; I searched Bellamy's pocket, I found nothing in his pocket, Jellison begged I would not meddle with Bellamy, he told me he would take all on himself if there was any thing wrong in his house. I told him I thought it proper to take Bellamy and him before the magistrate; in consequence of which I did take them both before the magistrate and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any more pins in that house? - There were some more found in the afternoon, but I was not there.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was examined before the magistrate, was not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There you related all that you have told us? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You related this conversation that passed between Jellison and you; "how long he had bought them, and where he had bought them," it was read over to you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a little unfortunate here that there is nothing of this, that you have said Jellison said to you, in it? - I told the clerk what he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the clerk read it over to you, you said, why here you have made a great mistake? - The clerk puts down what is material.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the clerk, it is very strange that you have just omitted this account that I have just sworn to? Did you swear before the magistrate that Jellison gave this account of the things? - Yes, according to the examination I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the magistrate swear that Jellison told you that he bought part at London-bridge, and part in Cannon-street? - I did, but the clerk does not put down all the things that are mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190059"/>Mr. Raine. I am for Bellamy. You told us that you searched Bellamy's pockets and found nothing on him, then you told us that the other prisoner in terms acquitted him of all blame. Did not you see some pigs heads in Jellison's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know that Bellamy came into the house to bargain for a pig's head? - He told the magistrate so.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that of your own knowledge? - I do not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Jellison. Ask him whether he did not turn the bed and bedstead up, when he went up stairs with me? - I did part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask me in the office where they came from? now if I had told you in the house where they came from what business had you to ask me in the office? - I did not ask you in the office.</p>

               <p>I am a police officer, I went to Jellison's house with Nowland, and was informed that some stolen goods had been carried in there; in a closet I see a quantity of needles, I believe it is a closet, it was at the right hand going at the door, I stood inside of the door while he searched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up with Nowland? - I did not. Part of the pins were in a blue apron laying on the table on the left hand door, I see them in the apron; after that Bellamy being in the house with him we took Bellamy into custody, and brought them both to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Bellamy searched? - Yes, did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these needles? - We brought them along to the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Bellamy say any thing about his house? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other witness that knows it to be Bellamy's house? - Not as I know of his own knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know whose house it was? - Bellamy's house, he told me himself, he told me in the first place that he lived at No. 19, Rosemary-lane, at a public house, I went and that was not the house, I came back and asked him how he came to tell me wrong? and he told me it was No. 19, Blue Anchor-yard, then I went to No. 19, Blue Anchor yard, it comes into Rosemary-lane. I searched his apart<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190060"/>ment there, he has only a lower room in that house, his name was wrote on the door of the room that I searched, Bellamy.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into that room where Bellamy was wrote on the door? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there? - I found these needles in a box in the room.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find any more than that parcel? - No. When I shewed them to the prosecutor he said he had lost a large quantity of the same kind as those; it is a very small quantity not above two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else? - No. thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. You went back and took these to the magistrate? - I did, and they were committed.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor can speak to these needles? - He said he had lost a large quantity of needles of the same mark as on that paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. The direction Bellamy gave you was No. 19, Rosemary-lane? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you afterwards found his house was No. 19, Blue Anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his wife was a quilter? - I don't know, there was some such thing in the house as patch work.</p>
               <p>Q. There was the appearance of needle work going forward? - There was.</p>
               <p>Court to Hanson. Where were these needles laying? - In a box there was other clothes and some of this patch stuff in the box, it was a large clothes chest.</p>
               <p>Court to Nowland. How came you to go to this house of Jellison's so early as six in the morning? - I received a general information against Jellison's house that some stolen goods had gone in there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You looked on Jellison as a since, as a receiver of stolen goods? - I did.</p>
               <p>Fincb. I can identify one of the parcels as being one sold to the foreigners that morning, it is one of the pockets of flat head pins. I happened to be standing by while the foreigners were choosing there articles, and I saw one of them mark this parcel. Here is a box of Needles which I had out of the country, I know it by the word Milliner being wrote on this side, it is to mention that they are for the milliners use; they came up so marked in this way; that box had not been opened till these foreigners came on that morning, so that I could have sold none of that parcel, I am sure that these needles are the only parcels that have been sold out of that box, I have the remainder now.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your belief of all the rest? - I believe they are all the same parcel as sold to the foreigners, the flat heads and these needles, I am perfectly confident of; in consequence of having lost this parcel, I went into my counting house to look over the remainder of my stock of needles, which I very well recollected, that parcel which I missed was marked to the best of my recollection as near to this as could be, but that was no part of the things sold to the foreigners.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jellison. I have one thing to ask; who produced that paper of pins, which he swears so positively to the mark? they were not brought in till the second hearing.</p>
               <p>Nowland. They all came out of Jellison's house.</p>
               <p>Hanson. I found this small parcel in Jellison's house, in the evening, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190061"/>second search, between the bed and the sacking.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went a second time to this house? - About six o'clock on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you found any needles and pins there before? - I had not been in Jellison's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Nowland. You have stated that you went up stairs, and Jellison with you, that you searched up stairs, and found nothing, and then came down again. Was that in the morning or evening? - Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You never mentioned a word of your having gone a second time? - I did not go, Hanson went.</p>
               <p>Court to Hanson. You said nothing in your exnmination about being to Jellison's? - I thought the counsel was instructed, and he would ask me the question. I went to Jellison's about six o'clock, and I found this parcel of flat head pins, and another parcel; I rolled the bed up, and between the sacking I found these quantity of pins; I took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jellison. The witness before has sworn that he looked at my premises, and saw nothing, and there was no such thing present; from that moment I was taken into custody he never let me go; these were never brought against me for three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jellison called Sarah Monday who deposed she knew him.</p>

First of all I asked the prisoner if he knew the basket; he said he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the man that you have been speaking of all this time? - Yes, Then I asked him do you know the man belonging to the basket? he said he did; says I, tell me who he is, perhaps I may know him; he said he should not tell without he liked; says I, what is the objection, if you are right you may as well tell me as not; says he it is George, at Mr. Lawson's, Bishopsgate-street; very well says I, if it is Mr. Lawson's, Bishopsgate-street, it is all very well. I kept him there till this man came to the basket, when he came up to the basket I asked him if he was Mr. Lawson's man? he said no; says I do you know this man; says he I don't know him; he owned the basket, and the bread, and the prisoner was secured; I asked him where he lived? he said in Church-street, Bethnal Green.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him wheather I had any bread in the bag or not, and whether I had forsook the basket or not when he detained me? - He had.</p>

               <p>The prisoners at the bar came to Mr. Wooding's shop, as near as can be at five o'clock in the afternoon, and this lace was offered by them to pledge, I thought it was not theirs, in consequence of which I sent to Bow-street for an offacer, to take them into custody, and they were taken immediately; that is the lace which they brought.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was not Currie the person that had possession of the lace? - I cannot positively swear.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not Currie the man who asked you what you would give for it? - I believe it was, but they both came together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not Currie who all along treated with you as the owner of the lace? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You often have persons come into your shop together, one as the owner of the goods, and the other as a companion? - Surely so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner White I was going home about five o'clock, and I met the prisoner Currie, and I accompanied him innocently into the shop; I know nothing of the lace, nor had nothing to do with it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner White called five witnesses who gave him a very good charaster.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had got the custody of the ass when you saw him? - This woman, the prisoner at the bar, was leading of it, and the other was leading of it with a bridle; when I came there I met them, the top of Seymour-street, my Lord stopped the ass himself, I was not there, my Lord sent for me to meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. So it was some time before you saw it afterwards? - It was stopped about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; and the ass was my Lord's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose that this woman took it? - Only by its<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190067"/>being found on her. We lost three asses that same time last year.</p>

I was coming down below Harrow on the Hill ; I met this gipsy, I had a little lame horse, and they asked me whether I would chop this little lame horse for this ass? and I did; as I was coming along the high road the next day, there was a gentleman met me, and asked me whether I would fell this property? and he left me a card where to bring it. I never was in London before, they took me up at such a nonplus, and my husband being in the militia, that I don't know where to send to him. I have six small babies.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in the room at all, or any where in that house where you slept? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your breeches since, or your gloves? - I have seen the breeches, I got them the same day at Guildhall from the hands of the constable that took them, Dawson.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say by whom the pots were thrown out? - I could not, because they dropped them out, they did not put their heads out, they dropped on a dunghill. I picked it up directly.</p>

               <p>I am a Trinity officer. On Monday night, the 20th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at the bar, with this bundle of goods in his possession, at a place called North East-passage, Wellclose-square; I took hold of him, and asked him what he had there? there was a wine-vaults close by there, and I took him in there, I asked what he had there in the bundle? he said they were a few things brought from aboard of ship; I took then and opened the bundle, and saw a child's frock in it, and told him that I did not think that these things could come from on board a ship, or else this child's cloak would not be among them; with that I immediately secured him, and took him to the magistrate's; I went the next day about the neighbourhood, to give them notice, in the afternoon this good woman came up, and asked me if I would be so obliging as to shew her the bundle; it was at the Virginia Planter, the public house right opposite the office, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190075"/>went and got it down, and shewed it her, which she said was her husband's property, that she could swear to, excepting this outside coarse apron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether I did not tell him every thing that was in the bundle, when he first stopped me? - I do not recollect any such argument being between us at all.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Herbert. This jacket I put a gore in the steeve, I know the child's cloak, it belonged to a child that used to be along with me, that I kept; this hammock I used to put under my feet, it is a dirty thing, this velverett waistcoat is my husband's; here is an ironing cloth that I know, and a linen towel.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On Monday night I was going to go down Wapping, to get a man to get me a ship, to go on board a West India man, I was to go to the Jolly Sailors, I did not see him there, I was coming up from there, I see these articles all lay one by one, the first thing was the hammock, then a bit of an old towel, then a bit of a shift, and a bit of an old waistcoat, with the flannel side outward; I picked them up, and was going to sell them for old rags, and when this man took hold of me, and took me into the public house, I told him every thing what it was. My father has been dead about a fortnight before I was taken up, and was going to get a ship to go to sea; had I known the consequence of picking up these things, I should never have touched them; any body else would have been as liable as me, I thought they were nothing but rags.</p>

               <p>Q.What time of the day was it taken? - I went out on duty about five o'clock in the evening; I am a patrole belonging to Bow street, I left this woman with my wife about a quarter of an hour before I went on duty, I never saw her before that day in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she there? - It appears she had seen my wife the day before, the 2d of February, being Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I cleaned myself, and was going to church, my wife asked me as I was going down stairs, where I was going? I told her I was going to church, and I had gone about half way, and she ran after me, and said John, have you got that little bag in your pocket? I said what bag? says she the little bag with the money; I went back with her, and it could not be found; says I to her, who has been here? says she, nobody but that Welch girl, the last night; I found the purse was gone, I went to my partner, Mr. Creedland, and we pursued the prisoner, and we found her in Queen's-court, Pimlico, in the house of one Mr. Davis; on Sunday about four o'clock, when I came to her, I asked her how she came to make my property away, and rob my wife of it? I said to Mr. Creed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190076"/>land I wish you would search her; so Joseph Creedland began to search her pockets, and was proceeding to search her about the breast, and she refused, and said she would not be searched about her bosom, or bubbies, by him, or any man, she would be searched by a woman, accordingly Mrs. Davis, the person who was in the room went to search her bosom, and there she found a little pocket-book in her bosom, she spoke something to Mrs. Davis in welch; says Mrs.

I then told her I must search her pockets, she readily pulled her pocket outside of her petticoats, and I found three-pence halfpenny and two keys, then I told her I must search her bosom, she said she would not let me search her bosom nor no other man; I asked if she would let this good woman search her bosom, Mrs. Davis, and she readily consented and she brought out this little pocket book and she threw it down, and I picked it up and have kept it ever since.</p>

I had not seen her for two months before, till last Saturday night she knocked at the door, when she said she was married to a lawyer in the Tem<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190077"/>ple, she said she was going to Wales, and asked if I had any message to go to Wales? I said no, I said to her as you have got two bundles about you it will be dangerous that you will be robbed, you had better have a coach; I went out to see for a coach, and I could not get any, and I told the watchman that there was a young woman that was going to Wales at my house, so then he came down to my house, and he says to her it is better you stop here till the morning four o'clock, and I will go with you through the Park to see you safe, but now I can not; in the morning the watchman came at four o'clock, and we went to the White Horse cellar, and I asked if the Bristol coach was gone? it was half past four when we got there, they said it was gone ever since four o'clock; O! says she what shall I do? says I, is there no other coach will do? and we found that that there was another coach going again at half after five in the afternoon, and she took the coach for seventeen shillings and had change for a guinea, and had four shillings; I then said you had better go home with me now, and go to sleep,or else perhaps you will tumble over the coach, so she came back with me and had a bit of breakfast, and a bit of dinner; so at four o'clock she saw the Corporal

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lived with Madam Boileau in Bruton-street, Bartlett-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with her? - A fortnight to day. I was in the house about half an hour before the prisoner for the first time I entered the service; I came the very day that the prisoner did for the first time.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray had you any conversation with the prisoner at any time and when? - About half after one in the morning it might be, when we servants were going to bed, there was a silver tea pot on a tea board, on a dresser in the kitchen, I thought it had been block tin at first, and I looked at it again and saw the stamp at the bottom of the pot, and I shewed her the stamp and told her it was silver, and some china that she remarked, some cups and saucers that she remarked were very old fashioned china, and I told her that they were not; there was a pair of clean sheets that we had to put on our bed were airing at the fire, which kept us up longer to air them, she said it was necessary to air them; while they were airing at the fire, before we did go to bed, as we might have gone to bed, she took the opportunity of hunting all over the kitchen, and looking into places that I thought she had no occasion to do; in looking about the copper, and under the coal hole, I thought her curiosity uncommon, but I said nothing to her; I began then to prepare to go to bed, I took the dirty sheets off the bed, folded them up, and put them on the table at our bed side; and before we went into bed she threw the remains of a scuttle of coals on the fire, and said, she wished the fire to keep in all night. We got up the next morning together a little after seven; while we were getting up she said she must wash the street door, but she must put on her bonnet, she said she should catch cold in case she did not. After I was dressed I went up stairs to open the window, or draw up the curtains in the second floor, and came down again for some wood for to light the fire up stairs, in the second floor; she light a candle to look for wood, and we went into the back kitchen together, and the first thing she opened was a large square box in the back kitchen; and there was plate in it, and there were four salts in it; she took them up and said, were they silver? I shewed her the stamp and told her they were; she took up an ink stand, which I believe is not silver, from the same box, and she asked me if it was silver? I told her I did not know; but in the stand there were two or three cruet tops, which were silver, she did not ask me about them; she took up a spoon for a middle dish on a table, which was plated, and other things in the box, which were plated, which she put down in the box. After this, as near as my recollection will afford, I think we went up both together into the parlour, to call the lad that lives with Madam Boileau, he sleeps a little behind the back parlour; in going through the parlour to call this lad, the cloth was left on the table the night before, the same as her ladyship had left it from supper, I made a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190079"/>remark of the cloth being left on, to the cook, which she made no answer to at all, but cleared the cloth away; she moved the plates away, and knives and forks, and four large glass salts, in this glass there were three spoons.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray can you tell if these salts were the salts that were missing? - They are not; I only made a trifling remark on the carelessness of servants, and I left her and went up to the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she put these things that she took off this table? - She took them down into the kitchen, the plates, knives, forks, spoons, and table cloth. But before I went up stairs I went into the front parlour, we both went in together, she had taken the plates down, leaving the other things on the table with the cloth; we went into the front parlour, and she opened one shutter, and by the light that she had in her hand, she was looking at the parlour clock that was on the mantle piece, and looking at other things round the room, and she came to a sopha, she moved the pillow of the sopha and shewed me a counterpane; says she, here is a counterpane.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen that before? - No. I took a bit of the counterpane up in my hand, and took and looked at it, and said, yes, it is a counterpane. I then went up stairs to the second floor, left her in the parlour, I came down stairs again for a scuttle of coals, some little time after, and I met her with a table cloth coming down the kitchen stairs, coming out of the parlour, I was coming up after I had been down; I had been down for these coals, down the kitchen stairs, she was coming down with the table cloth as I was coming up; I went up stairs, being a stranger to the house, without knowing particularly what I should want; I thought I should come down again presently, and I came down for a broom, or a duster, or something that I had occasion for, and then I met her again with the counterpane, on the kitchen stairs; I had been down then, and was returning; I did not say any thing to her, because I thought it was work that belonged to her, if she thought proper to move it; I went up stairs and had every thing that I wanted for my work, and was not down again, I suppose, for three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you what she was going to do with that counterpane? - She did not. After this, when I came down, the boy asked me if I had seen the cook? I think this must be rather after eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not by when the boy asked you this question? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact the prisoner was not below stairs? - She was not. In the course of the morning she had told me that she must go to Burlington-street, to fetch her box that night or the next morning, where she had lived two years and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she return? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from her mentioning this I suppose you was not so much surprised at her absence at that time? - I concluded, when the lad asked me if I had seen her, that she had gone where she said she was to go.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did the suspicion arise in your mind? - A little after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever return? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see her again? - On Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this that she went away? - Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her on Monday? - At Mr. Bates's, an office for hiring servants, near James's-street, Oxford-road; she came there to apply for a place, as I heard, a lad came to fetch me and the lady, to see whether she was the person that they had the description of in the hand-bill that was given out; I went and saw her in consequence of that information; I was asked whether that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190080"/>the person? and I went to her, and said, yes, it was; she at first said, she had robbed nobody, what was she detained there for? I asked her why she abseonded her place so clandestinely? she said, that she found it a place that would not suit her, and so she chose to go away. I looked at her petticoat that she had got on, and I said to her, Nanny, sure you did not take my gown away; there was nothing further passed concerning Madam Boileau; she was secured at this office.</p>
               <p>Q.Now you yourself, I suppose, don't know where the other articles mentioned in this indictment, were that night? - Yes, I know where every thing was; I was the only person that knew where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the articles in that square box? - No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the tea pot? - On the tea board; the other plate was in the square box, all but the five table spoons, three lay on the dresser and two in the soup plates that were brought out of Madam Boileau's room.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any conversation about them five spoons? - No, none at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable and beadle of St. George's. I was sent for up to Madam Boileau, Bruton-street, and I went, and I was obliged to be at Westminster that day; I told her that the readiest way was to go to Bow-street, and have some hand-bills printed, (that was Friday morning,) and she desired me to break open this box; and I refused to do it till such times as it came to Bow-street, it is a box as was left, as I understand, by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you go in search of the prisoner, in consequence of information you received? - I did, on Monday following, at Oxford-street, I found her at the house of Mr. Bates, the intelligence office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her into custody then? - I did; and took her to Mount-street watch-house till six o'clock, and she was examined at Bow street the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, search the lodgings of the prisoner? - Yes, on the re-examination, the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were her lodgings? - In Cursitor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were her lodgings in Cursitor-street? - Because the pawnbroker had found it out; she told the magistrate, that a key that was found on her, was the key that opened the door; it was taken from her person along with the silver spoons that are here now. I was ordered to go and search the lodgings; I did so,and that key let me in; I found these two pair of salts, mounted top and bottom with silver, one foot was broke off from one of them; three salt spoons; these keys, and an abundance of duplicates were found in a trunk that stood at the left hand of the door as I went in, at the bottom of the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you found these things? - I took them to Bow-street, and kept them till the re-examination day again, that was Saturday, and I produced them on the re-examination.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Boileau. The gravy spoon has my husband's cypher on it, P.B. the other spoons are all marked the same; the tea pot is mine; the salts are mine, I have no doubt, they are cut glass mounted with silver; the salt spoons are not marked, but I know they are mine, and I lost such.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not engage myself as an hired servant with that lady; she gave me two shillings, and told me to keep myself disengaged till Thursday week,(this was on the Thursday she engaged me before,) I have always gone out to dress dinners or ball suppers for going on of three years. I went to this lady's house about three o'clock in the afternoon, one of the young ladies told me I was not wanted then, I was to come and call again at night. When I called in the evening they were very busy, there were two servants going away, and they were searching their boxes for property that they had lost in the kitchen; that servant that was witness against me, she was in the house about half an hour before, one of the ladies asked me if I would go up and make Mrs. Boileau's bed? I went up and helped to make the bed; I came down stairs, and I was told to cut some cold beef for supper and send it up; I then asked the boy if they were going to have company in the morning?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190082"/>he said, I said what does Madam Boileau want with me, if she was not going to have company? I said I was not going to light the fire, nor clean the door, it was what I had not been used to, nor what I would not do (she gave me the two shillings when she engaged me the week before) I said that was what I never had to do in any family whatever I was in, and I should not do it; in the course of the evening the other servant asked me where I had a lodging, that she might come and lodge with me, because she said she could not think of stopping in such a family (it was this servant that is now witness against me) I told her then I should not stop, and she might come if she liked. She said she should come in a day or two, as the house was so abominable dirty she would not be in it, she then asked me to take part of her property with me, and she would bring the remainder at night; I took that bundle that she gave me into my hand with me, which was a gown, petticoat, and black cloak, I then unbundled it, and took the gown off the outside, and there were two pair of sheets, a table cloth, a counterpane, and two pair of glass salts in the bundle; I then took them into my own room with me, and laid them down on my own trunk in the room, I then went out and left them, I came home in the afternoon, about night; I never went out any more till the Monday morning following, when I went to Mr. Bates's office, Oxford-road. I had been accustomed to advertise at different times, in different papers, I have constantly done it for these two years. When I went to Mr. Bates's office, then the clerk at Mr. Bates's told me I must stop,then he told me that there was a robbery committed, that by my features and person, it was me that had done it; he detained me, and sent for the constable, and I was taken up; there were several duplicates in that bundle, that I had of that witness, but not of my pledging by any means, I never pledged any of the things at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Boileau. Where did you hire this prisoner? - She came to my house, to say that she heard that I wanted a cook; I asked her where she came from? she said from Mr. Bares's in Oxford-street; I told her I never took a servant from an office; she then told me that she had a very good character, that she lived with Mrs. Middleton for two years and a quarter, if I would write to her; one of my people wrote to her, but we got no answer; she called in a day or two after, when she came to know if we had any answer; I told her no,and told her that she might come; she brought in a box full of dirt,and said it was her clothes.</p>

               <p>I live in Maze-pond, Southwark, I have lived there for some years (I am a schoolmaster,) in the course of that business I have a great many petitions, and things of that kind brought to write; this will is my hand writing, I can have no doubt; I think, as near as I can recollect, I wrote it in the latter end of the year 1791.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to swear that it has not been wrote four years back? - I cannot take on myself to say to a month or two, but to the best of my recollection this is a transcript of a paper which was brought to me to copy, about that time, some time in the latter end of the year 1792, I had a paper to write this from, a person brought a paper for me to copy, and he was to have it in such a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you paid for the copying of it? - About two shillings; no more than for my honest labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person that brought it? - I believe I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to say that will is your hand writing? - I think it is my hand writing, but I think also that I could not copy two sides of a paper without likewise knowing something of its purport.</p>
               <p>Q.Let the witness see Thomas Borthwick? - This is the very person that brought the officers to me, when I was taken to Bow-street, and this is the very person that brought the paper to copy, I have not a doubt of it in my own mind, the least in the world. This will is from a paper that I absolutely copied, and it is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper that was brought to you, you copied correctly? - I did, as correctly as any man could, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That young man, Thomas Borthwick, was the young man that brought the officers from Bow-street, in order to carry you before the magistrate? - He was, and I believe he was the man that brought the will to copy.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190090"/>Q.What was the officers brought to you from Bow-street for? - He came to setch me by an order of Lord Kenyon; I believe it was when this thing came out at the King's Bench; I was taken up to Bow-street as the copier of the will; when the officer came to me I knew nothing of the parties, I was excessive ill, the officer asked me if I remembered such and such a time, having wrote such a writing? I said, yes, perfectly well, and he said then that the whole had turned out a very bad piece of business; I said the parties are utter strangers to me; I was paid for my honest labour, and no more than I ought to have been.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the officer's name that came for you? - Townsend.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to his house with any officer? - The officer took me, I told them at Bow-street, that I did not know the house where I took the paper to. In the year 1792, I lived along with Mr. Innis, as his servant; one day Mr. Innis came to me and said, that I must write a copy of a will for him, accordingly I did, he was not satisfied with my doing it, he said I must take it to a schoolmaster, as he wished to have a good copy of it; I took it to a school-master in the Maze, and agreed to give him two shillings for the copying of it, and afterwards I had it again from the schoolmaster, and gave it to Mr. Innis. I wrote it first from an original one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Innis do any thing with it afterwards? - No, I see that on the will that I brought home, I see a little boy write the name of Thomas Gardiner.</p>
               <p>Q. To that will that you brought and delivered to Mr. Innis, you see the little boy write something; what was it? - It was Gardiner, I think, Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that boy's writing? - I cannot pretend to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write often? - I have seen him write sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Shew him that will? - I do not believe that name,

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing before they went out of the shop? - Immediately I thought he was stealing something, and I looked at the shoes, and I saw two pair of shoes in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Two pair in one pocket? - Yes, and I took hold of him, and took the two pair of shoes from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man in the shop then? - Yes. I fetched him a slap of the face, and he pushed me against the door, and ran away; the man went away at the same time; I did not miss the stockings till after he was gone; I missed the stockings directly as he was gone out; I did not know where he was gone to. About two hours after there came another young man in, and I told him of it; about ten minutes after, this young man came in again and said, I believe the man is in the other clothes-shop; I went into Mr. Wright's, the other clothes shop down the street, I found him there; my husband and I went down to see, my husband was come home then; my husband asked me whether that was the man? I said, yes, I am sure it was the same man; we brought him up to our shop, and he said he never was in it; but he pulled out a pair of speckled stockings out of his pocket, which was the other stockings that the other man offered to sell, and a pair that was our own, a cotton pair, one that was missed from the window; the other three pair I don't know what became of them, he had not them about him.

               <p>I live with John Fieldsend. On Tues<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190097"/>day the 28th of January, I observed a man with some printed cottons on his shoulder, (I was in <placeName id="t17940219-37-crimeloc210">Oxford-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. You did not see the man come out of the shop? - No. Mr. Fieldsend answered me in the negative; from that I pursued the prisoner into Dean-street; I see him go down Dean-street, when he looked back, and, I suppose, seeing me pursuing him he let the goods fall and ran away; when I called stop thief, several people pursued him, amongst the rest a soldier of the name of Nicholls, who will appear; he was taken in Soho-square; I stopped with the goods till a person of the name of Foster, who lives with Mr. Fieldsend, came and took him. The prisoner had turned the corner of Carlisle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that the prisoner was the man that had the things on his back? - I cannot positively say that; I followed him when Mr. Foster had the care of the gods, and came up with him in Soho-square; when I came up with him he was taken to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you take him up if he was not the man that had the goods? - It was not me that stopped him, he was stopped by other people.</p>
               <p>- FOSTER sworn.</p>
               <p>There was an alarm in the shop of a man taking away some printed cotton; they were not laying in the shop, they were out at the door; I am in the shop of Mr. Fieldsend. I went to the door, and the people told me that the man was gone down Dean-street, and I pursued, and I saw the printed cottons thrown down on the ground, and our man standing by them, the other man had gone first. I know nothing, only that these are the very goods.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a labouring man; I live at Hampstead at present. On the 14th day of this month, I was up in Oxford-road, and this prisoner came to me, and asked me what countryman I was? (it was in the street) I told him I came from Reading; and he told me he had just come out of that country; in walking along we meets another man, and after we had passed by him the prisoner picks up a small parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other man join you before the parcel was picked up? - No, the other man was going on, he did not speak to the prisoner nor me, and he says to me, I have picked up a prize, and as we are both countrymen together, we will go share alike in it, he said, we will go to some public house, and we will open it; he had me into one public house, and he says, this house will not do; this was on the one side of Red Lion-square; then we went a little further and went into another a little beyond Red Lion-square.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what house that is? - No. And he says, this will not do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason why these two houses would not do? - No. And<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190098"/>he goes a little further, and has me to another, and he says, this is the right house; this was in Gloucester-street, and he had me into a little parlour, then we went in there, and there came in another, and this prisoner says to the other, sir, we have found a prize.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the man that passed you in the street? - I don't know. He says, we have found a prize, and I cannot read it, I wish you would be so good as to read it to let us know the consequence; and the other man took hold of a bit of paper, and he said, a noble prize indeed! The bit of paper was opened, it contained a bill and receipt for two hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you read? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there with this paper? - There was something in a little pocket book, there was some sort of a cross, a diamond cross, and the other says, I suppose, as you are two countrymen together, you go share alike in it, and the other says, how would you part it if the other has not got cash enough to give the other his part? then the prisoner says, I have got an acquaintance that lives near here, where I can borrow seventy guineas, and give this man, and the rest will be my own; he sets out, and was gone pretty nigh half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other man stay with you at that time? - Yes, he did; and when he came back he said, the gentleman was gone out that he wanted to see, and his lady had but two guineas in her pocket, and says the other man when he came back, I keep a public house in Oxford-road, and he says, you may as well come up to my house and part it; but, says he to me, you must let me have your money and your watch, to bind you that you shall both come to my house; and says he, pull your money out, and says he, let us see what you have got; and I pulled my money out; in looking as it he catches hold of it, and says let us have the purse and all; now, says he, give me your watch too; he took the watch out of my hand as soon as I took it out of my fob; as soon as he got it he shot out of the door, out of the public house, the other way; as soon as I came out I said to the prisoner, where is the other man? I see him go out; he said he did not know; I stared him in the face, and I said, then I am done, and I says to him, come you shall go up along with me, and see where the Green Man is; he had said that he kept the sign of the Green Man, in Oxford-road, and we went up and found the Green Man, and when we came there, there was no such man lived there.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts did you find the Green Man? - In Oxford-road, he said his name was White, and there was no such name kept it as he had mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take you there to the house of the Green Man? - Yes, he did. I knew there was such a house, I found it out myself some time ago there. I stared up in the prisoner's face and I said, this is a dead take in between you two, and he says, if you will go along with me to such a street, I could find an acquaintance that will let me have two hundred pounds, and I can pay your money; he then mentioned the name of the street. He had me down a street, I don't know what street, I am a stranger to town, and there was a couple of young lads stood in the street, and said to me, farmer, don't go along with that old villain any farther, for he is going to take you to a place where you will have your brains knocked out; I then took him by the collar and told him he should go along with me back, and as I was leading him along there was a gentleman came up to me behind, and he calls to me, farmer, says he, what are you done out of your money? I says, yes, sir; says he, bring him back here, here is the office up here. I brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190099"/>him back to that person, and he went and shewed me where the office was, I led him to the magistrate and they put him in hold.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the fine property, the diamonds? - The other man went off with that. On the 18th of that month we were ordered to meet in court to be reexamined again, and when I went there there was one of this prisoner's acquaintance came there and offered to make it up, he would bring me my watch and money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by? - No, not at first, but he was afterwards; he said he was a friend of his when he was abroad, and he thought he would come to see what he could do for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your watch and money again? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there in the purse? - Three guineas and half in gold, and thirteen shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never had the man's money at all. he gave it to another person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutor. Had I your money? - You was at the doing of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all of the matter, he said he would take forty pounds for his part? - He said he would go and fetch me seventy guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got nobody here, I was abroad with Lord Cornwallis in America seven years, and with Sir John Erskine.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of January last I was in Thomas's Buildings, I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of a house with three deal boards under his arm, I said to him where are you going with these? he said nothing to me then; I said again to him where are you going with this? says he, I am going to the saw pit, this was between eleven and twelve at night. I said who set you to work at this time of night? I said, Conner, this is a very bad subject, he dropped down on his knees and begged of me to say nothing, and he put down the boards into the saw pit, the one part of the boards were down the saw pit, and the other out. In the morning when I got up to go to work for Mr. Thomas, I work near within a hundred yards. I was rather astonished to think they were gone, after I accused him with them, I goes to the door and found the door was shut, in the course of an hour I saw one of Mr. Thomas's men and told him of it, and he told his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were Mr. Thomas's boards? - It was not probable any other boards would be in Mr. Thomas's house. I knew but little of him; where he lived, and where I live, and where he did the robbery is all within about one hundred yards; I know him merely by working on the same ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190100"/>Q. To Mr. Thomas. Have you seen these boards since? - I don't know that I have, there were three of the same sort in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in the morning did you find three missing? - I did not, because I have so great number in the house.</p>

Your lordship finds I am charged with stealing some boards, I work for Mr. Dover, in Edward-street, May-fair, there was a carpenter there putting a flooring in the house; after leaving off work, the carpenter asked me to take some boards to another building, which I accordingly did; after that we drank together, in going home I found a board near the spot, which I took up, and thinking it belonged to the rest, and I put it down a saw pit, thinking it belonged to the carpenter who sent me before with the other, but the other carpenter came up and took me into custody, charging me with the intention to steal. Your lordship will find there was no property lost, nor no intention of committing felony.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of the City. On the 27th of January last, in the evening about twenty minutes before nine, going down Houndsditch I saw a coach stop at the corner of Gravel-lane, I was then on the same side of the way, when I saw the coach stop there I got the other side of the way, and I saw this man here packing this chest out of the coach.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190104"/>Q. he was not coachman, was he? - No, I don't know that he was, the coach drove off without him, he then rested it on the posts at the corner, being so heavy, and the weather at that time was very slippery; he took it part of the way down Gravel-lane, and two more with him, I followed them, it being so heavy he let it fall once from his back, he then took it up again, I went up to him, and insisted on knowing what he had got, and how he came by it? he told me that a man gave him a shilling to bring it out of Bishopsgate-street; I asked him where he was going to take it? he told me he was going to take it to Winfield-street; I told him he could not afford to have a coach out of a shilling for carrying of it; in consequence of that I stopped him; the soap was ordered by the Lord Mayor to go, but here is the box it was in, I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the man of the inn to know any thing about it? - Mr. Sapwell and I enquired at every inn there, and I found that they had lost it; I gave notice to Mr. Ager, and they came to my house and owned it; that was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming down Bishopsgate-street, there was a gentleman came to me and asked if I would earn a shilling.</p>
               <p>Court to Ager. Is that the box that you lost? - It is, the name is wrote on it in full length.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said it was to carry this box to the second turning, the upper end of Houndsditch, and if he was not there to carry it to Winfield-street, and as it was slippery to put it in a coach to carry it to Houndsditch; when I came to Houndsditch, as he was not there I was going to carry it to Winfield-street; they took me into custody at that second turning; there was nobody with me to have any witness.</p>
               <p>Court to Ager. What may be the value of it? - Four guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this that the prisoner called? - In the evening, between one and two o'clock; he waited there till the dusk of the evening; I told him our gardener was not at home, to come the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you told the prisoner to come the next morning? - About four o'clock in the evening, he went away when I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of him afterwards? - Not that evening. The next morning about seven o'clock, I was present, and Mr. Ashley set him to work, that was on the 8th of January, he worked that week all out; the Monday morning he came to work as usual, he worked till Saturday morning breakfast time; Saturday he asked his master gardener to give him leave to go away that evening on some business that he had got for himself to do; the gardener gave him leave to go; and he promised to come again, on Monday morning. I heard that, on Sunday I missed my clothes, I wanted to put them on.</p>

               <p>Q.Where were they before you missed them? - Over the stable, I sleep over the stable, I had them on the Sunday before, they were my Sunday's clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in any box, or any thing? - No, only hung on pegs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you miss your things on Saturday night? - No, I did not suspect any thing of that kind. I missed a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of boots; on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190107"/>Monday morning he did not come to work.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make any enquiries after him on Sunday? - None at all; on Monday when he did not come to work I suspected him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication to this room, except through the stable? - No, none at all. I went to Brentford, where I thought I should find them in some of the shops, and then this Thomas Ashley and I, we went to his lodgings at Brentford, (Hasting Sharp's,) there I found my boots, that was all; I went and examined all through Brentford, and I could not find any thing more, and they told me he was gone to another place to work, and that he was gone to market, and that I should meet him on the road; accordingly I went, and I met him by the Pack Horse, on Turnham green; I asked him how he came to take my boots away? he said he had not; I told him then that I found them at his lodgings? he said that he had put them on to get some turnips on Sunday; then I asked him what he had done with my clothes, he denied them; I told him if he would tell me where they were I should be much obliged to him, and will not hurt you? at last he told me where he took and sold them; says he, the person is here who bought them of me; he shewed us himself where he sold them to, to a gentleman at Brentford, a man that deals in clothes, his name is Phillip Mattingly; we took him to the justice's the next day, and he brought the clothes there.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see them at Mattingly's first? - I did not, till he brought them to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things that were produced before the justices, the coat and waistcoat that you had lost? - Yes. They are here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the man to Mattingly's house on Tuesday night, succeeding the Saturday that he went away from me in the morning; I asked this Mattingly whether he had bought such a thing of that kind, as a coat and waistcoat? then Mattingly denied having bought such things, he did at that time; I then returned to Turnham-green, thinking it had been fictious what the prisoner had told me, I met the prisoner on the way, and one Naybour with him; when I met the prisoner I desired he would go back with me to Mr. Mattingly's, he went back with me, and when he came back there, Mr. Mattingly then acknowledged that he bought the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What description had you given of the clothes? - I told him it was a light coloured drab coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you described the sort of man that you supposed had sold them to him? - I mentioned that he must have bought them a very short time before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mattingly produce them that night? - No, the next morning they were brought to the justice's, Bland's, at Brentford, that was the first time I saw them, from the time they were stole; in consequence of his being taken up, from the evidence that was given before justice Bland, he was committed to Newgate; the clothes were put into the hands of the constable of Brentford, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the clothes? - Naybour.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness coming to your shop, to know whether you had bought such an article as this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190108"/>coat and waistcoat? -  Yes, he described it as a light coloured drab coat, and it is a dark colour, I do not recollect that he mentioned the person, nor a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. The fact is, you bought a coat and waistcoat? - I bought them of a man much like the prisoner, but I don't know the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy them? - I don't know when I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before application was made to you? - Four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came to your shop, and said, that he sold you the clothes, was it true or not? - I thought it was true, from what the prisoner said, I don't know no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no recollection how long you had been possessed of these clothes? - No, no further than what he said he had sold them me.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that or was it not true? - I did not know the man again, if he had not said that he sold me the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what past between you, and the man you bought the clothes of, whoever that man was at the time? - Nothing more than he asked me if I would buy the clothes? I asked him what they were? he said a coat and waistcoat, he said he was out of work, and he would sell them; I offered him first half a guinea, he said I must give him twelve shillings, I gave him twelve shillings for the coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say that you forgot the person that you bought the things of, when it was in less than a week that you saw him again after you had bought them? - I did not know till I saw the prisoner, and he told me that he was the man that sold them me.</p>
               <p>Q.What enquiry did you make, of the man that sold you these articles? - I did not make any enquiry. no otherwise than that he told me he was out of work.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these livery clothes? - Yes, it had been a livery coat, but it had been turned.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - To the best of my knowledge it is the same man, but I never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you give him? - I gave him twelve shillings, what he asked.</p>
               <p>Q. To the best of your recollection the prisoner is the man? - Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whoever the person was, the man that they brought, said he was the man that sold you the clothes? where are the clothes now? - Naybour has got it.</p>
               <p>- NAYBOUR sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a man that works in gardens along with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the loss of these clothes? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get this bundle? - I received them of the constable, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body say these are the clothes that were found at Mattingly's?</p>
               <p>Askley. I see them delivered into the hands of the constable's son (Pollycut.)</p>
               <p>Mattingly. I believe these are the clothes I bought.</p>
               <p>Postern. I know them fast enough, they are my own clothes, I was at the justice's when they were brought there, and these are the clothes, they were my clothes once, but they have not been in my care since they were stole till now.</p>
               <p>Court to Naybour. The clothes were delivered to the constable by Mattingly? - Yes, and Porter swore they were his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. And these are the same as produced by the constable before the justice? - They are.</p>
               <p>Postern. These are my boots, there is my name within them on the inside; they were hanging up in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190109"/>Prisoner. I met a traveling man on the road, and he had these clothes, and he asked me what I would give him for them boots? and I told him I would give him eighteen-pence for them; and so he said no, that would not do, if I would give him a pint of beer I should have them; so with that I went down with him as far as the King's Head, and drank part of a pint of beer, and he delivered the boots to me, and said they were his; he said he had got these here other things, and he was going to sell them as soon as he could; and I went up to Brentford with him; he said they were his own, and he went into this shop, just by the seven mile stone, and he sold them, and I stood at the door, and I thought being a travelling man that they might be his own. So he said he had made pretty well of them, as he was out of work He took me over to the Black Boy, and treated me with part of a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q.Were any geldings missing at any time? - Not before them two; that was the 8th of January, I don't know the day of the week, this here man came into our yard, and he wanted an employment; it was about eleven o'clock, between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in Lad-lane? - Yes, he said he lived with Mr. Bolton as horse keeper, at Charing Cross; I desired him to ride the horses round Moorfields, Finsbury-square; they were some that had bad colds on them; and I asked him if he knew where our farrier lived? he said he did, some wanted something done to their shoulders, I told him to ride them to him; instead of riding into Moorfields, he rode up Silver-street, across Smithfield into Holborn, and here he sold them. I told him I would satisfy him for riding them out a bit, as he had nothing else to do. He was not in any employ otherwise, when the time was up, I found he did not come back, I began to be rather uneasy about four or five o'clock; he went out with them between eleven and twelve; then I went out to Charing-cross to Mr. Bolton's head hostler, to know if ever he knew such a man, and whether he lived there? he said he did not, but I might hear of him at the Ship, at Charing-cross. I went down there and the master gave me a very bad character. I did not find him, I heard of him; he was taken in the Broad way, Westminster. I never saw him till he was taken, it was in the same month, about eight or nine days afterward, I saw him then at the office, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your horses again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not ask you to ride them out? - No, I asked him to ride them out for an hour or two, and would satisfy him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they? - Geldings.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had he? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of them be? - I don't know, the horses were in bad condition, worth about four pounds in that condition, but we do not sell them, we keep them when they are worked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190110"/>down to get them about again if possible. I am sure that is the man.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a horse dealer, the prisoner at the bar brought me two horses on the 8th of January last, nearly about twelve o'clock, Tuesday, I think the day was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he bring them to? - Oxford-street, where I live; he asked me if I would buy them? I asked him what was the matter with them? he told me they were glandered. I asked him where he brought them from? he told me from Lad-lane; I asked him why he brought them so far? he gave me for answer, that he was going into Piccadilly to fetch a letter bag back, that was left by one of the mail coaches, and that he might as well bring them to me as any body else; he said he was going to the White Horse Cellar. I asked him what he wanted for the horses? he asked me two guineas and a half for them; I told him it was more than I gave any body at that time of the yeat, I would give him but two guineas; he said when he lived with Mr. Parminster I always used to give him a shilling when he brought a horse for himself; I told him I would not go from that rule, I would give him a shilling for each horse, besides the two guineas, which I did; he had lived with Mr. Parminster, Duke-street, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That there gentleman told me that the horses were glandered, and told me to try to sell them some where.</p>
               <p>White. It was some days after this that Mr. Smith and another gentleman that is here, asked me if I did buy two horses? I told them I did; they were both glandered, to the best of my knowledge, it is impossible for any hostler, or any doctor, to swear positively to that kind. I took them to be slaughtered the same day myself, and Mr. Smith called on me after he had apprehended the prisoner. Mr. Smith called at my house, and I told him they were down in the inspector's book; one was a chesnut, very much rubbed, and the other, I think, was a dark bay, or a brown, I am not clear to that.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. What was the description of these horses that you lost? - One was a chesnut horse, cut a little with the barness; the other was a brown bay.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see them after they went out of your yard? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in the public house, the corner of the gateway, and the hostler asked me if I would have a ride? why, yes, says I, I don't care if I do; he went up and asked me if I would ride them geldings? when he got them out into the street, he said they were glandered, and says he, go try and sell them, and I knew this gentleman in Oxford-street, that he bought horses, and I went to him and sold them; and I had to go to Piccadilly and I never returned again.</p>

               <p>Court to Smith. Are you positive that you never held any language to this man that he could understand that you wished him to sell them? - Nothing at all, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses glandered? - I cannot say they were, or were not; the chesnut horse had some little appearance of it, but the brown horse had no appearance at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him directions to go to the White Horse Cellar? - No, none at all.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, I know the prisoner. Between nine and ten o'clock, on Sunday night, the ninth of this month, as I was coming on my duty,I met the prisoner, and he kept the middle of the street, and I had suspicion of him, and I went to him and asked him where he lived? he said in Whitechapel, and I fetched him down, and he offered me a bribe, and I laid faster hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What bribe did he offer? - He pulled out some money. I told him I should not have it. When the constable of the night examined him in the watch-house, he gave several excuses.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find on him in the street? - The things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he carry these things? - He carried them quite loose, they were only huddled up, he had them in his arm, the constable of the night took them from him, and the constable of the night gave them back to me, and I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he be from the house of Mr. Reynold's when you saw him? - Not a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>Q. He said he had got nothing but his own property? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very sober I take it for granted? - I cannot say whether he was sober or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say that you would take three guineas, or two guineas, and discharge him? - I told them always when they offered me that I would take no money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That young woman, as I passed by the place, she asked me in, and kept me from half past six, till half past nine; and she asked me to take them things with me; she gave them me herself, and I left my basket there; the girl made me leave the basket, she would not let me take it away; I was to come on the morrow and meet her, and give her what the things fetched.</p>
               <p>Court to Elen Mitchel. Did this man stay all this time in this place with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you give him any of these things? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court to Pendergrass. Did he or did he not, at the watch-house, say any thing about the house, from whence these things came from? - My Lord, he said first that he brought them from the corner of Monmouth-street; their house is three or four doors from Middle-row; in the street; he said they were his own property, he told us that he brought them from the corner of Monmouth-street, and it being Sunday night, the constable of the night convinced him of that; then he said he brought them from the corner house. I am certain he said the corner house.</p>

               <p>Q. What business did he say he had there? - He did not tell what business he had there, he said he left his basket where he brought the things from; the constable of the night examined him again, and desired him to tell where he fetched them from, and he would not detain him any longer; then when he was backward I asked him to tell me the number of the house, and I would go there and get him acquitted, with that he told the number of the house, a shoemaker's house, No. 40, St. Giles's; then I went up and rapped at the door, and asked the man if he had lost any bed-clothes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He told you the right number of the house? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the basket there? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - As soon I cried ten o'clock, it was a few minutes after ten when I alarmed the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190117"/>Q.When you got back to that house(No. 40,) what time was it? - It was about ten minutes after ten, between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the girl appear to be in bed? - She did, one of the lodgers let me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the girl say at the time that she had let you in? - She said that she let her mistress in to the apartment where she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the mistress was up? - She got up on my alarm.</p>
               <p>Court to Reynolds. When you came home did you hear of this basket? - My little girl told me that the jew had been there, and gave the girl an orange, and her brother an apple; she spoke of it after the child told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first saw the basket? - I did not see the basket at all till the day after, which was on Monday. The basket is there now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the servant maid at any time say any thing to you about the basket, afterwards? - When she came up to wait at surper, I asked her if the jew and she had been fellow servants? she said no, she never knew him in her life. A little after ten the watchman came and made an alarm, and the lodger let him in, and they came up to my door, and we got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the servant maid first tell you about this basket, or did you speak to her first about it? - To the best of my recollection she told me, that the jew had been there, and he had left his basket, and that she refused to take it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did your servant lay on this same bed where the clothes were taken off? - Not on the same bed, but in the same room.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had this servant been with you? - About two months, but I don't recollect that ever she saw him before.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mitchell. What time did the little boy go to bed? - About a quarter to nine, and the quilt was on the bed then.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. These are my things.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole of St. Margaret's. On the 16th, about eleven o'clock at night, I was crossing of old Peter-street, there was a stranger stood by my side, he said, there is a bundle gone into Lane-court, and he went and I followed him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190118"/>door, and I knocked at the door, after knocking some time, Jackson opened the door, where of I asked him what became of that bundle he brought in? he said he brought no bundle in at all, with that I looked about the place, and moved the bed about, and at the foot of the bed, in an old deal box, I found the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know this was his room? - He said he came in that afternoon. I asked him where he got the bundle? - I found in this bundle a pair of sheets, a gown, and three clouts; he said, he picked them up in Peter-street, coming from his mother's; I carried them to the office.</p>
               <p>Charnock. I know the gown, here is a piece of the same; I can swear to the clouts, one has a mark on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I left my work at six o'clock and went home to my lodgings, and had my supper; after that I went to my mother's for a clean pair of stockings, and stayed at my mother's within ten minutes of eleven o'clock; coming from there to my lodgings, there was a man came along with a bundle in his hand, as soon as he saw me he dropped the bundle and ran away; I said to him you have dropped your bundle; and he said nothing, but kept running; I stood by it for five minutes, and then I took it up and went home, and went to go to bed. I was undressing myself when the gentleman knocked at the door and I opened the door immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your window broke at all? - No, they opened the door and took them out, the door was on the latch. When I came out of my parlour into the shop I observed the door open, it was that that made me look about my shop, and I missed my shoes.</p>
               <p>MOORE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. On Tuesday the 21st of January, I was going into Strutton Ground, and as I was coming back again I saw the two prisoners at the bar, going down Duck-lane, Horton seemed to have something in his pockets, with that I was in a hurry going back I did not watch them then, I went home and came back again to the place, and they were coming up again, and Kelly had a bundle in a blue apron tied up under his left arm; I made a stop, they repassed me by for some considerable distance, I believe it may be an hundred yards, or better, I perceived them look back, I did not turn back, I goes round to Percival into Tothill-street, to desire him to go with me, I left them again after I had watched them for a considerable time, Percival he went with me, we went into the Broad Sanctuary, there we found the prisoners, they were coming into the Broad Sanctuary, they went to pass us and we stopped them, Percival took hold of Horton, and I took hold of Kelly, and took the bun<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190119"/>dle from him and searched him, the bundle was in the apron. I asked him what he had got there? he said an old pair of breeches which he was going to carry to Lambeth to his mother to mend; I opened the bundle, I saw there two pair of slippers in the bundle; Percival was holding both the prisoners while I was searching him, I took them away and locked them up. Percival has had the slippers ever since in his possession. Knowing the marks, I goes to Mr. Langdon to ask him whether they were his? he said, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. At the different times you met these men were they together? - Both together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Horton say any thing about this business at all? - Not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Horton behind Kelly? - He was as close to him as he could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was this that you saw them? - Between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>- PERCIVAL sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the man was examined? - Yes, I held both prisoners while Moore took the slippers, they were wrapped up in a blue apron with an old pair of breeches; I have kept them ever since. Horton told the magistrate that he and the other were going up Charing Cross, and he picked the slippers up, they were lapped up in two papers, and they picked them up and throwed them into the hamper that was on their jack ass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to Horton before this to induce him to say this? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the examination taken in writing? - Not Horton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other's? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Langdon. These slippers are my property, here is the mark on the bottom, they are womens slippers, E. L. is stamped with iron on the heels.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Kely. Last Tuesday morning was a month, as I was going up King-street, about half after six, to the best of my recollection, I saw something wrapped up in a piece of paper, and I went to look at it, and I found they were these two pair of shoes, and I chucked them into Horton's hamper; then when I came back I had a pair of breeches and a pair of stockings that I was going to take to my mother to be washed and mended, and I tied them up in the bundle, going along by Westminster Abbey, one of them gentlemen stopped me and took my bundle from me, and searched me and found these two pair of shoes, and took me before the justice. I have been the chief support of my mother and two children ever since my father's death. I never saw the prisoner but once before in my life, nor ever had any acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Horton. As I was going along the church yard; Westminster, going to my work, I saw a mob, and I stopped to see what was the matter, these two men stopped me as I was walking along, and said, I was concerned with this prisoner at the bar, as I was going to my work.</p>

I told him I did not wish to buy her, I did not want her; he said he would be very much obliged to me if I would buy her, for she was so very heavy with sold that he did not know what to do with her, if he put a load on her she would lay down. I gave him at last twelve shillings for her; I knew the man before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190121"/>I have sold him some asses before, and he has bought corn at my shop, I sell corn.

               <p>Q. Where did you get this ass you sold to this gentleman, Mr. Stone? - The prisoner came to me on Thursday morning, and knocked at the door, I live in Hare Walk, Hoxton; he came about seven o'clock, he brought the ass to me, and asked me if I would let him put it in my stable, for the value of a couple of hours; then he went away, and I went to market about my business; about two hours after that he came again and said, that he was very much distressed for money, and asked me if I could help him to a customer for it; I told him I believed I could. I took it to Mr. Stone's and asked a guinea for it; Mr. Stone said it was not worth above half a guinea, but twelve shillings was the most he would give for it; he gave me the twelve shillings, I took the money to the prisoner and he gave me eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by it? - I did not ask him, he said it was his own property, he bought it on the road. I was coming by on Friday night at the officer's door, and I saw the officer Armstrong, and he told me he had been looking about for a whitish ass very heavy with sold, and string halt behind; and says he, if you can give me any intelligence of it I will give you a guinea; so with that I told him if I should happen to hear of any thing I should let you know. This was about ten o'clock, at his own door in Kingsland-road; I afterwards came back to him and resigned myself to him, and I went with the officer directly and took the prisoner. I went home to my wife first to know whether it was the same ass by the description, that Mr. Armstrong told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return to Mr. Armstrong? - In about ten minutes, or hardly so much. I told him I had sold it, and was employed by the prisoner to sell it for twelve shillings, and he gave me eighteen pence, and he took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give evidence before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever know the prisoner before this transaction? - Yes, I have seen him before about the country, but I did not know but it was his own property; I never had any dealings with him, I am sure of it.</p>

I told him then I knew a gentleman that had lost a whitish ass, very big with soal, and a spring halt; but I did not know what that spring halt was; I told him if he could recover it me I would give him a guinea; he left me and I went to bed, there was somebody knocked at the door, my maid went to the door, it was Bull, Mr. Armstrong he says, I am come to surrender myself up, I have sold the ass to

            , afterwards I and Mr. Harper and Bull, went to where the prisoner was in bed. I went were I was informed by Bull, Bull being present, and Mr. Harper. I then says, George, you must get up, I said, I am come to take you, for that ass that you employed Bull to sell. I found him at a lodging house in Kingsland-road, in bed with his wife; he said, he employed him to sell it, and he said, he bought it of a man about nine miles from London. I asked him how long he had had it? he said, he had bought it the Saturday before. I asked him if he should know that man? he said, he did not know but he might; he said, he brought it of that man for eight shillings and six-pence, he bought it on Edmonton-road, about nine miles from London. I asked him if he bought it the Saturday before where he kept it; hearing by the hand bill it was only lost on Thursday; he said, he turned it out on the Common. Mr. Harper took both the prisoners and put them in our watch-house, and we went to Mr. Stone's house, I told him I had a little business with him concerning an ass he bought; he told the boy to drive it out, and it was delivered to us, and it was identified by the witnesses at our office.</p>

I bottom chairs about the country, and I buy horse hair, and rags, and a few odds and ends, to get my bread by; and I met a man with this ass, and he asked me if I wanted one? and I told him I could not spare the money; he asked me twelve shillings for it, and I bought it for eight shillings and six-pence in the road. I have known this man, Mr. Bull, above these twenty years, and I went to him and told him I wanted to sell it, and he said he would go and sell it, and take the ass on his own hands, and nobody should know it was mine, and he had three shillings for felling of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Bull by it? - I carried it to Bull and asked him to put it in his stable, and he told me he could help me to a customer; and he told Mr. Stone it was his own property, and that nobody had any thing to do with it. I have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Harrington. Honoured gentlemen, I have lived a widow in credit and honour these seven years in one street, which can be testified by all the neighbours who can appear for my character; and I had my husband sick some time before he died. This man, on whose account I was taken up, has been on terms of marriage some time past; he told me that he had been married before, and that the clothes he brought me were his first wife's. I pawned these things in my own name, and gave him the money, not thinking of the trouble that was to follow. If I had thought they were got by any way dishonest I would not have pawned them with the pawnbrokers, whom I have dealt with for these number of years. Neither would I have allowed them to be brought into my place, as it is well known I work for my living in hard and honest labour. Therefore I hope you will take my case into consideration, as it would be hard for me and my children to suffer innocently. I never was in prison before, and trust, if ever I get out again, I never shall be in again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mabony. I can produce witnesses that I was never married before, I never was married in my life.</p>

On Friday the 10th of January, the prisoner at the bar, came to our shop, and he asked to look at a muff, at about a guinea or twenty-five shillings, he pitched on one, and then he asked for a tippet, and he agreed for both for forty shillings; while I was making out the bill, he threw me down this bill that I have in my hand, the moment I looked at it I considered it as a bill on Messrs. Taylor and Lloyd, that was money every hour of the day to give to me, a stranger, I had suspicion, I said, I did not know that I had so much cash in the house, I told him I would go out and try to get change; he thought I went out to get change, but in fact I went to bring in some neighbours, and I consulted Mr. Phillips, and asked him what his opinion was on this bill. I returned and I asked him how he came by the bill? he gave no answer. I then asked him who he was? he then told me that if I would go along with him he would shew me, but that I did not think it quite safe to do, and so I had him taken up on suspicion, and I have since been at the gentleman's No. 60, in Lombard-street, and made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190128"/>an enquiry, and they said, it was a false note.</p>

               <p>The prisoner at the bar came to my shop to buy some silver spoons, the 27th of December, Friday, he agreed for the spoons, and looked at two more silver articles, he then begged a bill, the three articles came to two pounds three shillings, but he desired the abatement of the one shilling, which we did; then he presented this bill for payment. At the first moment I took it for a Bank note, but on looking at it I saw it was a bill payable at Taylor and Lloyd's. I asked him to endorse it; when I gave him the pen I discovered something of a sluttering in the man, he attempted to write and he could not; he turned about the note and began at the other corner, he could not write there; and then I addressed him, I said I would give him a book to write upon, he then in an awkward manner writ his name on the note; I gave him the change in three guineas, and the spoons; I thought there was something suspicious, I slipped on my hat very artful, and I followed him and kept him in my eye till he came to Soho-square, there he joined a very suspicious young man, I then came up to him and touched him by the shoulder, and told him he must come back with me, that he had given me a forged note; he seemed very much surprised, and asked me how I knew it, and where I had been to know it? he came back very quiet, I begged him to give me my money and spoons, and I give him the note again; but when he had got the note he said, I knew very little about notes, for it was a good note; we exchanged two or three words and I said, will you let me look at it again, he did, and then I said, he should go along with me, there was a carriage then came up to the door, and while I put my head into the door he slipped away, and he was taken about a fortnight after.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you put them before you went away? - I left them in the taproom; in a little corner where they keep their pots to dry, I laid them there, and she told me they would be safe till I came back again, then I was gone about an hour and a half, while I was out one of my companions said, she would go to her mother-in-law, and the other said, she would go to her father's, and left me; a gentleman saw me in the street very distressed and he gave me six-pence, and I gave it to somebody in the street to shew me the way back again, this was just before dark.</p>

Parry went out and in less than a minute returned again, I then could plainly see that he was packing the wine glasses into a basket, Parry did not long remain packing, he went to the opposite end of the warehouse towards the counting house; I then whipped out of doors unperceived, satisfied of what he was doing.

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. How many years had this man been your warehouse man? - Fifteen years. He had been my wife's warehouseman twenty-five, years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at that time he was employed to fell in the warehouse? - He was employed as a packer in the warehouse, I had such confidence in him that I admitted him to do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned the name of Hampton, I ask you whether Hampton had not been a considerable dealer in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190134"/>house with you? - He had been a dealer; the goods in this basket were entered on the state that very day to Hampton.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they entered on the state previous to the time you saw them packed? - They were not, but they were in the course of the day, because in the afternoon I went to see if the glass had been taken from the warehouse, and to see whether there was any entry to Hampton and there was.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you have any reason for supposing the entry was made on the slate before or after the packing? - I should suppose it was after, because it was so dark he could not have wrote so plain. This packing was in the morning early, it was before it was quite light. This slate is merely a memorandum book of the warehouseman's, and afterwards the order is taken into the order book, and when this man packs the goods he keeps down each separate goods on this slate, and when he has so done, he takes it to the clerk, and he puts them in the day book, and he there has a bill of parcels made.</p>
               <p>Q. It is then the regular custom of the house, that they should be put down on the slate till they are packed up? - It is. These goods remained on the slate towards the evening, but were never on the day book or order book, and no bill of parcels was given.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the hamper carried away? - I cannot speak to that; it was taken away somewhere about noon day. I took every care in the world that there should be no suspicion that I had any suspicion.</p>

               <p>I am the partner with the other witness. On the 7th of January about seven in the evening, I and Mr. Slater went into the warehouse after it was locked, about eight in the evening, it was after the warehouse was shut; we shut up at seven; and there I perceived Hampton's basket, with one of ours by the side of it filled, they were left there till the morning, in the morning we perceived Hampton's glasses filled with those glasses. I saw it filled just before seven, it was hid behind the prickles in a corner of the warehouse; our intention was to see who took this basket away, afterwards I was sent for over to the glass-house, where I saw Hampton, and I mentioned to my brother to be particular to see who took that basket away, but he was obliged to go up stairs to look out some glasses with a gentleman, in the interim the basket went away, it was Hampton's basket that I saw filled, I saw wine glasses at the top.</p>

On my going into the house, while I was going in it disapeared, it was thrown aside, Parry was in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Who was in the house at that time? - My wife, myself, and four or five children. Mr. Robins asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him I did not know that I had; he then asked me if that was my pistol? I turned into my front parlour and looked, and saw but one, and about ten minutes before there were two laying there, one was gone, and that was the pistol that Mr. Robins brought. We were then going to take the prisoner to the watch-house, and we met with an headborough, who took charge of him, and he was immediately conducted to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find your house? - He must have lifted up the fash.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think so? - I am sure it must be so, it lay within a foot of the fash window a few minutes before, the fash was put down again.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it shut or open ten minutes before? - Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fastened at all? - There was a brass screwed at the side of the window, so as to let in a little air, so that nobody could get in, it could be lifted up about four inches, and admit a person's hand, but nobody could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was your outer door before that time? - It was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it when you looked into your parlour ten minutes before? - It was shut then, I think they could not come in at the front door.</p>

Then he puts down from his hand a pistol;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190136"/>and I said don't put it down there, give it to me; I knocked at the door, and the gentleman came; I said, is this your's? says he, there were two of them, he looked into the parlour, and said, there was but one; when the prisoner got into the parlour, he downed on his knees, and was going to say something, but he stopped and did not, and we were going to take him down to the watch-house, but we met the beadle, and gave him into the beadle's hands.</p>

Where did you find it at last? - In her pockets; I found the muslinet in one pocket, and this piece of printed cotton in the other; her pockets were put back behind her shoulders, she had two long great pockets; I know the cotton by the pattern, and I know the muslinet by the shop mark; it is Mr. Craig's property.</p>

               <p>I was with Townsend; he was apprehended in this public house; at the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury; on or about the 23d or 24th of January last, I was at Dunkirk, and on account of the troublesome times there, me and two more Englishmen got into an open boat, and got off from Dunkirk, to see if we could get on board a ship going to America, or any other part; we got clear of the Roads, and with our night glasses we saw a vessel, and she appeared to be a smuggling vessel, going to Dover, she came up to us, and they took us up, and brought us to Dover; I made application there for any ship going to the Indies, but I could not procure any thing at Dover, I came up the next day, I applied at Lloyd's coffee house, and I could not find any thing there. At this time there is no such thing as an Englishman's living in Dunkirk, unless he will take up arms against the English nation; knowing the circumstances I laid under, in having received the humane mercy, I had received of my Sovereign, I never could dare to take up arms against my nation and my Sovereign; but they said that the English had forced the French in their towns that they took to take up arms against the French nation, therefore the English that lived in their towns against Flanders, should also take up arms to do the same; and if I had taken up arms, I should have deemed myself a rebel. As soon as Valenciennes was taken, there were three Englishmen were taken in the midst of the French, and were executed directly; there is another person who obtained a pardon with me, and at this time he takes a part in Dunkirk against the English. I have no witness, because I did not like to make my cafe known to the tradesmen that came over with me. I have further to say, that particularly after the attempt at Dunkirk they have been more sharp on the English than they were before.</p>

Seddons foremen, these articles are not in my department; I was going into a warehouse where these kind of goods are kept, on Monday evening last, on endeavouring to open the door, I felt the door press against me, I pushed the door with more force, and opened it, at the time the door opened, I heard something, I looked behind the door, and saw the prisoner at the bar stooping down behind the door;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190140"/>asked him what he did there? and what he had got there? he made me no answer, be thed stood up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to see this? - I had a light; he then took up the piece of cloth, and carried it towards the opposite end of the room; there is a counter at the opposite end of the room, which is for the use of the room, in cutting out different kind of articles in the upholstery business. I followed him, thinking he would put the cloth on that counter, he passed the counter, and went up the other side of the room, towards the end where I first see him, he then came round, to nigh the same way that he went first.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might this be? - Between the hours of seven and eight; then he went down to the counter, and placed it on the counter, I followed him, took the piece of cloth up as he had put down; he then made a return towards the door that I came in at; I followed him part of the way, and seeing him go that way towards the door, I put it down on the counter again, where I had took it up from, he then came back, seemed very much agitated, and confessed he was very sorry for what he had done, he was very sorry for what I had catched him at; I saw him out of the room, double locked the door, and communicated the circumstance to Mr. Shackleton.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business in the house? - A <rs id="t17940219-64-deflabel362" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do in that room? - Not at that time of night as I know of. After this Mr. Shackleton and Mr. Seddon's sons came up to the prisoner, Mr. Seddon's sons asked him if he had any accomplice? this was the first question Mr. Seddon asked him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had Mr. Seddon told him it would be better for him to tell all the truth about it? - That I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he did not? - It is not clear to me that he said it, but I will not take my oath that he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the conversation begin - I nat was the first that I heard Mr. Seddon speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he afterwards add that it would be better for him, if he would tell all that passed? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. He asked if he had any accomplices, what did he say then? - He said he had not; he then asked him if he had taken any thing before, and pawned it? and begged that he would give the pawnbroker's name up; he declared he had not taken any thing, nor never pawned any thing, I believe them are the very words, Mr. Seddon desired me to go and fetch a constable, to go and search his apartment, and then I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this piece? - It is a piece called irish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it from that description? - I do not of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say this room is not in your department? - The upholstry branch is not in my department.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him, you say, behind the door? - The door opened on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at that time where was this linen? - It was on the floor, close to his legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you cannot tell where that linen was before? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not the afforting of the linen, nor the disposing of it, the thing may get out of its place, or be mislaid, and you not know any thing about it? - It may.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore where that piece was before, you cannot say? - Not of my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Wood, and his Partners, they are lightermen. On the 7th of this month, I was in at the Waterman's Arms public house, at <placeName id="t17940219-65-crimeloc367">Shadwell Dock</placeName>

                        targets="t17940219-65-off364 t17940219-65-crimeloc367"/>, a man came in and told me there were two men stealing of coals; I went out, when I went out I saw the prisoners at the bar, on board of the barge, the property of Messrs. Wood and Co. it was laying inside of the Shadwell Dock, inside of the Tier; the prisoners were on board of the lighter, the barge was there, it was laying along side of the Adamant, Captain Jackson, they were from the Adamant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been lately on board that barge? - I had quitted that barge about two hours, she was put along that ship which came from Newcastle, she was from the Port of Whitby, with coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any part been taken out of the Adamant into the barge? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Q. When, that morning? - No, before; they had been to work a couple of days before, if not three, but I think only two days.</p>
               <p>Q. On this alarm being given you went out, how near was this Waterman's Arms to where the barge lay? - The Waterman's Arms is about twenty yards from the Adamant. When I came there I saw two men in the barge, and I observed him doing something, as I thought, it was filling the bags, it was between the hours of three and seven, it was the dusk of the evening; I waited on the stairs till the lad got another boat along side of the barge, there was a boat coming up the river, with a little boy in her of about thirteen or fourteen years of age, she went on long side of the barge, and I saw the prisoners at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see whether they waited that boat, or called it? - I do not know, the two men when she came along side of the barge, they put three bags of sacks of coals in, I am sure they were half full, each of the bags.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190142"/>Q. Was there any thing on board the barge but coals? - No, only the Oars that we navigate with.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bags put all at once, or one after another? - One after another. Then the waterman's, boy or whoever he was, took and shoved away from the barge, and was going up the river, the tide was going up; they shoved away about the distance of a hundred yards, as near as I can guess; these two men had got into the boat with the boy, the two men that I saw do this were the prisoners at the bar, then I and some more assistance took a boat from Shadwell Dock Stairs, where I was on shore, pursued them and secured their boat to ours, and lowed them down against the stream to Shadwell Dock Stairs, they had got down about one hundred yards from the barge when I stopped them.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when you came up to them? - I told them they had been robbing of the barge, of course I should take them before a magistrate; there was one of the men that was in the boat along with me took a crencher and knocked one of them over the arm, and I said, don't use the men like dogs, there is plenty of us to take them. When I came to Shadwell Dock Stairs, the people that I had with me took the bags to the public office at Shadwell, and secured the men, and took them there the same night. The bags were opened and examined at the public office, they contained coals; I don't suppose that the bags belonged to Mr. Wood at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not got them here? - No, it is not at all material because the identity could not be made out.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know when you first saw the two men employed on board the barge in the way you have spoken of. It was impossible for you to know them at that distance? - I never lost sight of them, therefore I cannot be wrong. The boat contained no other persons, except the two prisoners and the boy, with the three bags of coals; the two prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This barge was laying close along this coal ship you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These men are men who work in unloading this ship? - I don't know that they were particularly on board that ship, but they were employed in that way. I have been told that they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see the mate of the ship in company with them that evening? - The mate of the ship was on shore as the captain was on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mate of the ship in company with the two men on that day? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Till the coals are delivered into the lighter they are not your master's property? - Not till they are turned over by the meter.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it your master's barge the coals were taken from? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Is it not customary for people to give a small quantity of coals to people that load and unload these ships for their families? - I don't know that; some time back they might when men worked on different terms to what they do now.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know how these men was working on board of that ship? - I did not know they were working on board that ship at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not get these bags out of the ship but by lowering them into the barge first? - In case that they were the men that had been employed in that ship they must have been gone two hours. That barge that was along side of that ship was detained to load that afternoon, in order to come into our wharf, but the rain prevented us from doing it, on that account we were obliged to leave many a barge half loaded; we cannot go on, because we durst not bring up any thing but what is full pay, if it wants a vat of coals we must not bring them up.</p>

               <p>I live in Carrier-street, St Giles's; I keep a lodging house; I never saw him in my life before yesterday morning; his wife came and took a room at my house yesterday was a week; I never saw him till yesterday, his wife took the lodgings, and he came into the house to lay there when he thought proper; his wife was sent to Bridewell, and his wife being put into Bridewell, I had a strong suspicion about the man. I got up yesterday morning early to go to work, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190145"/>five o'clock, and my wife says to me, I heard a strange bustle in the night, between one and two o'clock, William, do you light a candle and go up stairs, and see what it was with that strange man; I went and got a light of the watchman, and went up stairs, and went to the door, and knocked sometime at the door before I got an answer, he lodged in the two pair of stairs, at length this man opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there alone? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with him? - A girl of the town that he brought in from the street. My wife she came up and came into the room, and asked for her rent, the week being expired, which he refused paying; my wife asked him how came he to bring that girl into the room, and into her bed? he replied it was his sister; I said it was very uncommon for a man to have his sister in bed with him. My wife turned about and see this lumber of baskets in the room; I said to him, this is what you have been robbing all night; I told my wife to keep the door secure till I called the watchman; accordingly Hogan, the watchman came, and the watchman took him and linen to the watch-house. The constable of the night viewing of the linen and the letters on them, said he thought he could find out where they belonged to, and he came up to my house, and he looked at the baskets, which he said were part of the property, and they were taken to the bench of justices, at Marlborough-street, and there they bound me over to come and tell the court, which is a very heavy loss, because I am a very poor working man.</p>
               <p>DAVID COLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of the night. Yesterday morning, about half after five, the watchman brought the prisoner to the watch-house and the cloths, I asked the prisoner whether the cloths were his property? he told me he had found them; I examined the cloths and I found they were marked W.Phillips on them; I took the charge, and I locked him up; after I had taken care of the prisoner I left him there, and went and searched his lodgings, I went to his lodgings and I found two flats in the room with the same name there is on the cloths, we left them in custody of Mr. Bowen, the man that keeps the house; after that we went to the watch-house again and stopped my time. In the morning I went up to the Green Man and Still, to see if I could find out the owner; they told me Mr. Phillips's waggon put up there, I should find the book-keeper there; I went there and I asked him if he knew of Mr. Phillips's waggon being robbed? he said no; I asked whether it put up there? he said, yes, then I shewed him the cloths, and marks, and asked him if they were Mr. Phillips's? he said, yes. We went together then to Marlborough-street; he was examined then before the magistrate, and committed to prison.</p>
               <p>Holt. One of these cloths is marked with the name at full length; the other is not marked at all; they generally have one in each hamper, in order to know who the meat comes from; he finds hampers for the whole of the butchers, but not cloths, therefore we know by the name who they belong to; these baskets were butter flats but these cloths were put into the hamper where the meat had come from; these cloths were in the meat hampers returning home, not in the flats. The flats were at the tail of the waggon, and tied in such a manner that it was impossible to get them out without cutting the rope; the waggoner is not here; I made enquiry at the Green Man and Still, and they told me his ropes were entirely cut to pieces; I saw the ropes of the waggon fast; the cloths was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190146"/>an hamper with some other goods, a large mat of leather, and two half firkins of oysters, very heavy goods, I dare say the whole would weigh two hundred weight if not three hundred, and the cloths lay at the top of the goods in the hamper; the ropes of the waggon when I saw it was fast.</p>

               <p>Q.Can you at all say whether these were the cloths that you set out with Thursday night? - I know it very well by the mark, and I know there was no others of his in town at that time. These cloths are never left, we always return them the day they come up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the flats? - Yesterday morning. One thing Mr. Bowen omitted in his evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowen. Have you any thing more to say? - He first said yesterday morning, that he was a butcher by trade, and the girl told him before his face that as soon as he pulled out the linen, he pulled out some skewers, which he threw down under the grate, and the constable picked them up and put them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming home Thursday night, between nine and ten o'clock, and I saw these two baskets and these cloths lay down in the broadway of St. Giles's, laying down in the middle of the road, I took them up and carried them into my room. Between five and six Mr. Bowen and his wife came up into my room, and asked for the rent; I said it was not due; he then snatched up these two cloths and said he would keep them, and his wife took and slapped me in the face twice; then Mr. Bowen ran and fetched a watchman from the watch-house, and came back with the cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. To Holt. You did not see the waggon set off? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether they were taken from the yard or past, you don't know? - I know they were not taken from the yard; all that I know of it, is, that he left word at the Green Man that his waggon was cut open in St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I worked at Chester and Brewer's key, and have always been trusted in the buildings; I had been in the buildings most part of the day, I was admitted a scraper or any thing, when there was nothing to do; this morning there was little to do, we weighed ten hogsheads for shipping; my master told me he had very little to do that day, so he told me, Thomas, you may as well go along with the cooper, and hold the hoops for him, very likely he will give you a bit of sugar when you have done; I went with the cooper, and was with him about four hours; he desired me to get another cask to pitch, and turn them; I did so. When we had done he asked me whether I had an handkerchief to carry a bit of sugar? so I told him no; he said, then take your hat off and he filled my hat; coming along this place there were several people there, I stopped and I took a bit of sugar from there and I eat it; I had my hat on my head with the sugar, and he took me up and sent me to the compter. The sugar was given me by the cooper for assisting to hold the hoops before I came to this place.</p>
               <p>Q. To Wood. Are you sure that you saw him put it in his hat, and put it on his head? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it altogether? - About half a crown; here is five or six pounds of it.</p>

I felt the bag, and I thought there was something in; he said no; I felt the bag and I thought there was something in it, and I found in it the indigo which it contains, I have kept it till now; I asked him how he came by it? he said he found it.

               <p>Q. What did you see in these parcels? - Indigo. I examined the samples and went down to the chest where they were taken from, and I am positive they are the same sort; one parcel was taken out of the chest where there is but a small parcel of indigo, not common; they were taken out of two different parcels and two different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sorts were there in the bag? - Two sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they blended together or separate? - They were in separate papers, they are in separate papers now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there the same quantity found as you missed? - That we cannot tell, because the chests are repacked, whether there was more or less lost I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that corresponded with what came out of the chest? - I am sure this came out of the chest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked with Messrs. Hanson, Pearson, Stiles, and Pearson; I worked with them sometime, and on Monday I went first to Chequer-yard, there I continued till half past two o'clock, first piling some wool, then I went down to pile some silks, then I went from there and went to my dinner, and a man came in and said, Green, you must go with me; I immediately went with him, it was then a quarter after three; I went with him to the Steel-yard, and worked with him twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; I came up again, and Mr. Green ordered me to go with this man up to the warehouse, in Mud-lane, which I did; when we had done I asked this man to lock up while I went down into the necessary, says I, I shall be off nearly as soon as you. I went down to the necessary, and afterwards, in running along Thames-street, I picked up this sack, I saw it laving as I ran by, I ran by it and saw it, and went back and took it up; afterwards I met this man, Wainwright, and he said, Green, what have you got there? but before this' I went and threw it into Mr. Barker's, the public house were we are paid; I goes to Mr. Pearson's and there I gets my note for my day's work, two shillings, I goes and gets my two shillings, and has a pint of beer and drinks it; a man says to me there, what will you have for this sack? I said, you shall have it for a shilling, not noticing then there was any thing in it; after I got out and was a little up Bush-lane I thought I felt somewhat, and then I met Wainwright, he said, what have you got there? says I, I don't know, and with that he took me to the counting house. I have no witnesses: if Mr. Wainwright had got that man for me that he promised to do, he would be a witness; and Mr. Hanson knows, and Mr. Pearson and them, that I have never been in the indigo warehouse since I have been in the Steel-yard. Mr. Hanson weighed the chests, and the chests weighed the gross weight as when they came.</p>
               <p>Hanson. I went down and desired the merchants clerk to weigh it, and one was weighed by those that, no doubt, had a hand in taking it.</p>

Now this haughty old tyrant."

However I managed the business very well, for I caught Mr. Tyrant by the head, and dragging him immediately to the block, with a heavy knife in my hand, separated his neck at a blow; and what will surprise you very much, when his fine trappings were stripped off, I found he was no better than a common scratchdunghill pullet; no nor half so good, for he was tough, and oily, and rank with the pollutions of his luxurious vices."

               <p>I was employed by Mr. Sangster, on Monday, about the 2d or 3d of February, I waited several mornings in Milk-street, to watch. On Monday morning the 7th of February, at seven o'clock in the morning, I perceived a man come down the street, pass Mr. Sangster's door, and up a little court, which they call Godfry's-court, that goes out of Milk-street, he returned again very shortly, in the mean time, before he got back to Mr. Sangster's, Kirkhan came and opened the door, he came out of the door, took down one shutter, and the other man, who is the prisoner Whalley, went into the door, that was the same man that I had seen come down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that went past the door and returned back again, was the prisoner Whalley? - I am. Kirkham took down one shutter and car<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190152"/>ried it in; at that time the prisoner Whalley was in the house, Kirkham came out and fetched in another shutter, he carried that in and returned out again, and carried in two more; when he had carried them in I perceived the prisoner Whalley come out of the door, followed by Kirkham to the door, the prisoner Whalley came out of the shop with a bag under his arm, it was not full, but a considerable quantity of goods was in it, and it was a large bag. I immediately went and took hold of him, together with the bag, with the assistance of another gentleman, we took him to the Axe Inn. Aldermanbury, where we sent for a constable and examined the bag, where we found several pieces of muslin and some handkerchiefs; the bag was put into the hands of a constable, I delivered it there to the constable into his care.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Kirkham into custody? - No, another gentleman took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man any bag when he went into the shop? - No bag nor bundle, that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Whalley. This bag came out of the shop? - It did not belong to Whalley at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him carry it in? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Kirkham was in the shop at home when Whalley went first in? - Kirkham followed him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the conversation that passed between them? - I was at the corner of Mountford's-court, not able to hear the conversation that passed between them in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And when he went away with the bag, Kirkham followed him to the door? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had watched for four days before you saw Whalley? - Two or three mornings I had.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended the examination before the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whalley was there committed for receiving, I believe, the goods knowing them to have been stolen? - I cannot tell what he was there committed for.</p>

On Friday morning I was with Mr. Boreman, and about seven o'clock Mr. Boreman said there he comes, the person he alluded to was the prisoner Whalley; I saw Whalley come and go up the court, and when I saw that, I fell back for fear of being discovered, a little after that Boreman said, now he is in, and a little after that he said he came out of the house, we went and took him with the goods on him, when we took him to a house, the Axe, in Aldermanbury, when I helped to secure him, he had a bag under his arm, that bag was taken to the Axe, and delivered to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see the bag opened? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it, from its appearance, belong to Mr. Sangster? - It did, I have got a list of what was in the bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Read it - There are three pieces of book muslin handkerchiefs, a piece of juganot, two pieces of book muslin, and two pieces of cotton for handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went back again from him, and sent for a constable and secured Kirkham? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these goods your mark on them? - One piece had Mr. Sangster's private mark.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I did a little afterwards.</p>

               <p>Sangster. One piece, I think, is my property, it is a piece of book muslin handkerchiefs, it has my private mark on it, it cost me upwards of forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it? - That I cannot be positive; the other pieces I cannot say that they are mine, only from the circumstance that they came out of my shop that morning, and I had the same in my shop, because the marks are not on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say that the piece that you can identify, cost a little more than forty shillings? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. But perhaps now the original manufacturer would have sold it for something less than forty shillings at this time? - I believe they would.</p>

He came into my house to dinner, on the 5th of this month, and enquired whether I could lend him ten or twelve guineas or not; I told him I could not, but I could give him a draft to answer the same purpose, and he went and received it I suppose. He came home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190154"/>in the evening and informed me that he had bought goods at Mr. Sangster's to the amount of ten or twelve pounds; he then informed me he was very lame in his ancle, and could not go for them, and he desired me to go for them in the morning; I had to go to several trades people that morning, and I went to Mr. Sangster's first. My fellow prisoner, I never had seen my fellow prisoner before that morning; when I went in I enquired of him if there were not some goods left there by Mr. Simpson? he said there were, and he gave me these goods, and the draft that Mr. Simpson received of me I believe can be produced now in Court; and as for the goods I understood they belonged to Mr. Simpson, and by the papers, and the bills of parcels that were found on me, when taken, it can be proved I turned above one hundred pounds a week. I would wish to know whether Mr. Workman is in Court or not.</p>

               <p>When I was taken the constable asked me what I was? I told him I was a lodger in Mr. Whalley's house, and I gave him up the key of my box, and he searched me, and in my left hand waistcoat pocket he took out forty guineas; I told him what I had got, I bought them, and I would find where I had bought them. I lodged with Whalley, I lived with him for five weeks to this day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Green. Look at these goods produced by Fenner? - There is no marks on them, but there were three pieces of that colour came in the day before; the seal is cut off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Might not your fellow servant sell them? - He never sells.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you are out of the shop? - I never am out unless Mr. Mason is at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Other warehousemen and manufacturers have some of the same kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How would you distinguish it from that taken from any other warehouse? - I know it by the colour, that was the same, I cannot swear to the callimanco, I lost two pieces, but I cannot swear that these are the two pieces, but we missed such.</p>
               <p>Simpson. The night before that I was taken up these things were brought in to Mr. Whalley, by Mr. Mason's man, Mr. Mason's man complained that Whalley would not give up the full money, but always let money be behind, and I offered to let Mr. Whalley have some money to pay Mr. Mason's man. These are the same goods; but Whalley used always to cut the marks off the callimanco; he has brought in different pieces before, but I do not think any thing of this kind. I was taken the Friday morning the 7th.</p>
               <p>Court. These two pieces were brought in on Thursday? - They were.</p>

               <p>I am a widow, I live at Newington. On the 13th of January I had been to the Bank to receive my dividends; I took two notes from the Bank, one was a forty pounds, and the other was a twenty pounds; I put them in my pocket book with some other notes, one of two hundred pounds, one of fifty pounds, one of twenty and two of ten pounds, and a five pound, two hundred and ninety five pounds I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190156"/>out with me, and the sixty pounds I received, made three hundred and fifty-five pounds, I had a little girl along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body at the Bank? - I did not take notice of any person particularly, I desired my little girl to take notice that I put them in my pocket, and that I put them in safe, and I felt my pocket book outside of my gown, after I had put my hand in, and then I was going home, to Newington, to where I live. Before I met with any kind of interruption. I got as far as <placeName id="t17940219-74-crimeloc415">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you observe who that man was? - Not particularly, I seemed to want to get on, and one of the women looks over my shoulder, and makes a bit of a laugh at the Greenwich coach, they asked the man what he would have for them four to go to Greenwich? that took my attention off, other people were behind, I cannot say how many, when they moved off one man went with the women, and this man went by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe who that man was that joined the other women? - I knew he was a broadish man by his back, I only see his back, he was the man that had been behind, that made up the four people; he had a light coloured furtout coat on at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his hair? - I really did not notice it, for I was really very much frightened, that very moment the croud moved from me, I missed some weight from my pocket, and I put my hand down and could not feel my pocket book, the croud were then leaving me, and then these four walked off.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get at your pocket? - They took my gown up. I felt the weight from me, that I had lost the weight, and that was the reason that I thought I had lost my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they walk off pretty fast? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no more croud? - The street was clear in less than a minute, or two minutes, and I went first one way and then another, and I said O! dear, what shall I do, and I went to the coachman, and said, did you see any body rob me? and a captain out of the coach said, I saw that man hustle you, the man who was behind you.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw his face? - I did not, but he was a man of the same size as the prisoner, a stout man, and he walked off immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray had you any money in your pocket besides? - I had received twenty-four pounds, and they gave me a twenty pounds note, and the remainder was made up of cash, gold and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what else had you there besides; ladies pockets are generally pretty full, they say there is no bottom to them? - I think there was two guineas and a half, besides the money I received.</p>
               <p>Q. What else had you in your pocket? - What keys I had, I kept in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What else had you in your pocket? - I don't know that I had any thing else, I am very careful that I do not lumber my pockets with a parcel of litter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing else in your pocket? - Nothing, except my gloves, or such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray in what kind of a pocket book was it you put these Bank notes in? - Extremely small thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Put nothing in it but bank notes? - There might be another paper in it, because I have missed a promissory note.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190157"/>Q.So much for the weight in your pocket. Are you sure that you had that pocket book in your pocket at the Bank? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you always sure that you had that pocket book at the Bank? - I am sure I put it into my pocket, and I felt it outside of my pocket, and I found it was in, and I never had any interruption till I got to Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You never asked any body whether you left it on the counter in the Bank? - Upon my oath I absolutely put it in my pocket, and I desired my child to see that I put it in safe.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you never ask any body whether you left it on the counter in the Bank? - No, I had no occasion to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean positively to swear that? - I never asked. What I should ask them for?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never ask of any broker? - I never did, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. This was pretty early in the receipt of dividends, a good many people there to receive dividends? - There were. I took dividends that were owing me a twelve-month before.</p>
               <p>Q. It would have been very easy for any person that was there to have listed up this gown? - But I am sure they did not, because I went out of the place with my pocket book in my pocket; besides there was not many persons in the court, and particularly no croud.</p>
               <p>Q.How many people might you meet there? - There was no interruption; there might be one or so.</p>
               <p>Q. But there were a number of people there? - There were some, but I met with no interruption.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see the prisoner at the bar, till you charged him with this offence? - Not till I knew he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in his company three days afterwards, and drinking with him? - I am far from a drinking woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in his company three days afterwards, and drinking with him? - I will tell you how I came to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in his company three days afterwards, and drinking with him? - I was in his company for half an hour, but I did not know that he was the person; it was at the Bunch of Grapes, in Bow-street, I did not know that he was the man, or else I would not have drank a glass of wine with him; I dare say he only sent for me on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him of your loss? - I did, he knew of my loss.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this at the public house in Bow-street, where Clarke and Carpmeal were talking of the robbery? - I don't know any of them, I never was in the house before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not Carpmeal one of the officers there? - When I went to Bow-street I asked if I was in time. I had been sent for, they said there were some suspicious people that had been there, and I was to come and see them. They told me to stop a bit, and he would answer me presently, accordingly when the clerk had time, he did, and I had a person along with me, at this time at Bow-street; the clerk says you have not been sent for here; when that was the case I was going home, and I went towards Covent-garden way, and there comes up a man to my relation that was with me, and says, what have you heard any thing more of this affair? and he said yes, he heard something, for he had got partly information who the person was, then this here prisoner came up, and he said I am very sorry for your loss madam, or something to that purpose; the prisoner's acquaintance said to my nephew, come, says he, we will go back and have some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190158"/>thing to drink together? says I you know I will not go and drink, but we did go; he said you will be very safe, and we went to Carpmeal's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay drinking with the prisoner? - I did not stop above half an hour, I did not drink above one glass of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not charge him at all with the robbery? - I did not know him, I gave no charge against him, but I believe two days after the people took him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you see him in the office in the course of the very day that you made the affadavit? - I did not see him till the very day after, when they supcenaed me to come.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the man that robbed you, you had not an opportunity of seeing his face at all? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was taken to Bow-street by some idle tale of a letter? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had no suspicion of the man being a thief? - No.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Price's, No. 18, Grace-church-street; I have the care of the silversmith's shop. On Monday, the 13th of January last, I saw a concourse of people before my master's window, and I saw the prisoner looking in at my master's goods, but by the manner of his looking, I thought he was after no good, then I kept looking at the window, at the prisoner, and I saw him put one foot on the step of the door, which he made a kind of a false slip on one side, as if Mrs. Jones pushed him, when I saw that, I thought my master's windows were in danger, I went to open the door, to desire them to disperse, but as I was opening of the door, I saw them all sheer off; as they were going off, I saw the prisoner standing tip-toe, hanging his head almost over the lady's shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them? - I don't know, it was not two minutes after, that Mrs. Jones returned crying, and said, that she had missed her property.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he go off with? - There were two women and a man went first.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you observed in what situation this man and two women had placed themselves before? - They walked three together, before Mrs. Jones and a little girl, the three were all in company together, and I observed the prisoner was taller than the other two, which were of each side of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was examined before Mr. justice Staples? do you mean to say that you sware positively to the man? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Now I caution that there are three persons attending here, who were present there? on your oath when an information was read to you, in which it was put down by the clerk, that you was positive to the man, did not you correct that clerk, and say no, I cannot say that? - I certainly was positive he was the man, I never had the least doubt but he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not that pass? - No; to my recollection it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man is swearing before a magistrate, he can recollect, and say whether he corrected a person, and said no, I did not swear that so positive. You must recollect either one way or the other? - I might say so the first time.</p>

               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether it was not put to you again, and you desired the clerk to correct it? - I remember so far as this, not before justice Staples, but the other justice, Mr. Wills, there was an attorney, Mr. Fletcher there; he says, please your worship, will Mr. Wren positively swear to the man, or does he not? says the justice to me, I would have you examine this paper, and read it over attentively, and think well of it, before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190159"/>you decide; and I did, and I told his worship, I accorded to every thing that was put down.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man has said you swear so, and you say no, I did not, that is wrong, you must recollect whether you ever said so or not. Did not you twice say so to the clerk, and twice correct the clerk? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very important fact? - Certainly it is, I cannot recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear positively that you did not twice contradict him? - I don't think that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not, and I will produce two witnesses to you that will swear you did? - No, I do not like to swear I did not, nor I cannot recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray in whose company have you been since? - In the company of Macdonner, this lady's nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that his aunt was up to any rigg? - I never heard any such expression.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath at the several times that you met him, what did you talk about? - Only to attend to the duty of the business; we never met privately about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you meet? - Not above four times, set aside these days that I have attended here.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what might your conversation be about when you met? - About nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. What else could you converse about but this business of the robbery? - He never said much about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray who might be in your company at that time; what do you say to

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I drive the Greenwich coach, on the day mentioned in the indictment, I was in Gracechurch-street, it was Monday the 13th of January about a quarter after one, there were two women and three or four men who came up and asked for the Camberwell coach first, I said you had better take a ride to Greenwich; they asked what my fare was? I told them fourteen-pence; I think that is the man that stood by the silversmith's shop, I think he is the man but I cannot really swear to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190160"/>Q.You say there were three or four men and two women? - There were, they asked me what time I went off? I told them in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, one of the women said that would not do; in less than two minutes Mrs. Jones cried out she had her pocket picked, this lady was in the midst of the cluster; I think when they dispersed, which was in less than two minutes, they went down Lombard-street</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go by the coach? - They did not.</p>
               <p>- USUAL sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on the day mentioned in the indictment your being in the coach at Gracechurch-street? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor there? - I did, I was in the coach about a quarter before one, or somewhere there about that time, and I saw a man come and stood opposite the coach door, I did not hear the question that was asked; just after that I saw Mrs. Jones pass the coach, there was a kind of a mob about the breast of the horses of eight or ten people and a kind of hustle, and the woman was pressed over in that kind of manner with the man's face towards the house, he then clapped his foot on the step on the door and walked off. I asked Mrs. Jones what she had lost, she said she had lost, notes to the value of three hundred and fifty-five pounds. I believe the prisoner to be the man, he appears like the man in the face but I thought the body larger, he had a great coat on, a drab colour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you see the witness Wren before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not at that time say that the person had taken his information wrong for he was not certain of the man? - They asked him if he was positive to him? the answer was, that he thought he was the man, and when they asked him again he said he was positive.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the magistrate's office when Wren was examined about this business? - Yes, both times</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell us what he said relative to this information? - The first time he positively denied swearing to the man, and Mr. Staples thought so lightly of the evidence that he would have taken any body's word for the prisoner's appearance again.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you say Wren denied that he would swear to him? - He did, and so he did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time he was there did he or did he not make an objection to the information? - I don't know that he did till he was asked the question by Mr. Fletcher, when he said, he would not positively swear, but I think he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190161"/>Mr. Scboen. What are you? - I am an officer to the Sheriff of Middlesex for fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - I live in North East-passage, Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Mitchell? - I knew him nine or ten years, I know him by levying an execution on him, that is all I know of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not chuse to be bound for him? - Why should I involve myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you happened to hear this, Mr. Usual he heard nothing about this, he has contradicted it, he has said no such thing passed? - I believe he will tell you that he could not swear to the man, but I believe this is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was this? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago might it be? - Three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell the day of the week? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you at the office that day? - I had a warrant to execute upon an officer that belonged to that office, and one day the magistrate put the prisoner into my custody instead of sending him to gaol, and so I went with him again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here to day? - I came to hear the trial and to be ready if I was called upon.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he describe. what he had seen of the man? - He said he had seen him by his master's own door.</p>
               <p>Court. And that he suspected him and that he had a full view of him by the prisoner looking in at the window at the goods? - Just so.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you must be surprised that the man should have a doubt because he had a very fair opportunity of observing him? - I was a little surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you attended the second time? - I did so.</p>
               <p>Q.Neither of which days you remember? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate then the second day this man would not be positive yesterday, but he is positive now? - I never said a word, I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. But it must strike you very odd that the man should swear so positively to him the next day? - The first day he did not swear to him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Mitchell? - Nine or ten years. I was formerly employed by his attorney not by him, but I saw him several times, before the business was disposed of, and I have seen him repeatedly since and drank with him.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all you scarcely knew him, and now you say you have seen him repeatedly since and drank with him, this is something more then serving a writ on him? - It is very true, it is.</p>
               <p>JOHM FLETCHER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Mr. Staples's at the time that Wren was examined? - I was, I was clerk to Mr. Staples's office five years formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this man swear positively to this Mitchell or not? - The first time he did not swear any thing like it, and the Evidence was so slight that Mr. Staples would have taken any body's word for his appearance. This was the first time, it was said by the lady's Nephew that Captain 
               <persName id="t17940219-74-person810">

             could swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at that time? - I did, Wren said it was much like the man; I mentioned it to Mr. Willis, the justice, and remarked these inconsistencies, Mr. Willis asked him several times, he said he was much like the man; at last Mr. Willis rather tired with the examination, bid him read what was wrote deliberately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190162"/>he did and the justice asked him if the contents was true? he said yes, and then it passed as it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you clerk there now? - I am not, I am a Notary public.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you before, you was a justice's clerk? - I was formerly a clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know it is the custom of the office to return the examinations as they are taken? - It is as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this examination being read to Wren was altered? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it stood as originally taken with this doubt upon it? - I believe it stands as originally taken that day, the first examination was not taken.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore with this alteration he would not swear positively to it? - There was no alteration.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when it was read over in the presence of the witnesses and they having put down by accident, that he had sworn positively, he objected to that, and would not swear to that extent? - The witness never made this objection, it was me that made the objection.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the magistrate read it over to him diffinctly? - The magistrate asked him the question, and he was a long time giving an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in partnership with any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not practice in the law at all? - No, I am a notary public.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath that you have taken, do you understand any other language but English? - No, I do not.</p>

We had a coach to go to the Commons to take out the licence, and he gave me a ten pound note, and he had said before to me, that when he had some money come to him, without you will be my wife I will never live with you. Another day he bought me a pair of silver sugar tongs, a silver punch ladel, seven china bowls, two large ones, which we had one for our marriage bowl. When he urged me to marriage, I told him I was married; then he said that was nothing, for if I was cast for death, I was dead in law and to all; and when I asked him what name I must be married in? he said, I must be married in my maiden name. I never lived with my first husband but eight months; there he is, he knows what I say is truth.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Ratten. On Monday evening, about eight o'clock, the man came into our shop, the man Edward Murray did, it was on the 24th of January, and he asked for a penny candle; I asked him which he pleased to have, a long one or a middling one? he said a middling one; I cut him a middling candle, and he throwed down a six-pence, I looked at it, and told him I thought it was not a good one, (we sell candles, cheese, butter, and every thing in chandlery,) I sent out for six-penny worth of halfpence, I sent it out; he put it down, I gave it to Hannah Tabley, and she took it over to Mr. Brisen's, the baker, she came back, and I asked her for the change; she said Mr. Brison was coming in with it, and Mr. Brison followed in immediately, and Mr. Brison came in with the six-pence, and said it was not a good one, and searched him, and found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190166"/>two more on him, and he asked him if he had not more about him? he said he had one more shilling about him; Mr. Brison asked him if he would let him look at it? and Mr. Brison looked at it, and that was a very good one, Mr. Brison asked him if he had got any more? and he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where he took that thilling from? - No, I did not. Mr. Brison asked him if he had got any more to pull out? if not he would search him, for he had authority.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Brison search him? - Yes, he was going to search him, and the prisoner pulled out two six-pences out of his pocket, and was going to drop them, and Mr. Brison took them out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did the prisoner take them out? - I did not see, but I saw the six-pence when Mr. Brison took it out of his hand, and I saw him take them out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with all that money? - I don't know.</p>

               <p>The last witness applied to me for sixpenny worth of halfpence, in change for six-pence; I looked at the six-pence and I saw it was a bad one; says I, did the servant give you this six-pence? I took the six-pence back, there I saw the prisoner, I asked him if he had got any more money? he said, yes, he had one shilling, which he produced, one from his right side breeches pocket, that was a good shilling; I said, have you got any more? he said no, he had not got any money about him; says I, if you have any more produce it, and if you do not produce it yourself, I will search you, he then took out a second shilling, which was also good, from the same side; says I, have you got any more money? says he, no; says I, I am determined to search you; I had hold of him to search him, and he pulls out one bad six-pence out of his pocket in this manner, behind him, from the same side; I am certain of it, I then took him by the hand, says I, what have you got here? only sixpence, says he; I then took and searched his pockets, and I found another bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any thing from him when he said only six-pence? - I catched his hand and opened his hand, and took the six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that taken from the same pocket from whence he took the shillings? - It was from the same side, he had on two pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take the last sixpence from? - From the same side out of the pocket of an under pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish whether they all came from one pocket? - I could not, having two pair of breeches on.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept all the three sixpences? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried him to the Computer, I believe, immediately? - I did.</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith; I attend to examine the money for the Mint prosecutions. These three six-pences are every one counterfeits, and nearly alike, as nearly as possible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The humble defence of Edward Murray, sheweth, That he was committed to prison, for offering a piece of counterfeit money, resembling a six-pence. Not knowing it to be a counterfeit, deign, my Lord and Gentlemen, to permit an unhappy captive to let his defence be read, not having fluency of speech to speak. About the latter end of January, having occasion to buy a candle, I went into a shop for that purpose, and paying, as I thought, a good six-pence, the shop-keeper, not having change, she sent her servant to get it, who returned and brought a constable with her, who insisted on searching me, and found two bad six-pences on me, which I took as good, but they shewed they were bad, by wearing them in my pocket, and of course did you offer to pass them; I had likewise fourteen-pence in halfpence in my pocket, the property of another labourer, who worked with me, but having a hole in his pocket, he desired me to put it in mine; all of which money was taken from me by the constable. I humbly beg leave to implore you that I am innocent of offering the money, knowing it to be bad, as I had not long before taken it before for good for my labour; I have bad, for two days past, people to prove it, and having nothing but my labour to depend upon, humbly beg that this honourable Court will consider my case, and mitigate it according to your wisdom and judgment.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to St. Sepulchre's. The prisoner was brought up to the watch-house about ten o'clock at night, we stopped a few minutes, and then we examined him; he said he had the money of his master for two days work; says I, whereabouts do you live? he said, he did not know; says I, are you a stranger in Town? he said no; but he would not give any more account for the best part of an hour. I have the half guinea, I had it from Bladen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parker. It is a counterfeit, it appears to be quite new.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was doing some work for a person in the farriering line, and it came to half a guinea, and I received the half guinea for it; I had had three guineas in my pocket, when I came home I got a guinea changed, so that I did not know whether it was the half guinea that I had taken of that gentleman in the morning, or the half guinea that I got in change. This day I called, as I came along up Field-lane, where this gentlewoman lives, and I asked her if she would sell me a shirt? she said she would, I agreed for a shirt, and was to give her three shillings and six-pence for it, and I said I have not any silver at all without you give me change for half a guinea, I laid it down, and she weighed it and said it was light, she was afraid it was a bad one; I said I cannot tell where I took it, except I took it of my master; she said, I will send it over the way to a gentleman. If I had known it had been a bad one I had time enough to go away; as soon as the gentleman came I resigned myself up to be examined in every respect. As to that stuff, if it was touched with a hammer it would break all to pieces, it is what I had used in my business.</p>

            , I did not see the other till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did she come to your house? - She came to get a glass of liquor, sometime about the 25th of January last, the same day as Mrs. Taylor speaks of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come before or after the other? - After the other; I was in the bar when the other came, but I did not see her, Bowling came in and asked for a glass of liquor, which when served, she tendered me down a six-pence, which I supposed was a bad one; this might be five minutes after the other, it was not more, I gave her the gin, and she tendered me in payment the six-pence, I thought it had been a good one at first, but on inspecting it more particularly, I found it to be a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that sixpence? - I have got it in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Mrs. Taylor on that occasion? - There was nothing passed between me and Mrs. Taylor about that six-pence, but about the former one; I was sitting in the corner of the bar at tea, and Mrs. Taylor got up to serve the little one, Cooley, and she gave me a six-pence, which she shewed to me before she gave change; I returned it to Mrs. Taylor again, and I thought it was a good one, Mrs. Taylor put it in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her put it in the till? - Yes. One of the officers came in and asked whether there had not been a little woman come in to ask for some drink, and what she gave? Mrs. Taylor said, she gave six-pence, and he desired to look at it, and she took it out of the till, and gave it to the officer; I got up, and while we were talking about the sixpence, the other woman came in. I have got the six-pence taken from Cooley, and the six-pence taken from Bowling. While the officer and me were talking about that six-pence, the big woman came in (Bowling.)</p>
               <p>Q. After Bowling came in, and tendered the six-pence to you that you have got, what happened then? - While I was talking of it to the officer, the other woman came in, and asked for a glass of gin, and she offered a bad sixpence, which I have kept, and Jostling the officer, he went to a place at our bar, at a distance, and when I pronounced it a bad one, he went and laid hold of Bowling, and took her into the room, and searched her; the other two officers brought the other woman in, and they were searched both together, I was there present; the officers brought in the other while we had got hold of the great one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the three officers and women go both together in the other room? - Yes, there were some halfpence, and some good half crown pieces found, I cannot particularly say to the number, the litil cone dropped a bag on the ground, I heard it crop.</p>

               <p>I am an officer, I was with the last witness in Fleet-street, I saw Mrs. Cooley go into a feed shop, before that I saw the two prisoners both standing together, talking together, but what we could not hear, then we followed them into Salisbury court, there the tall one goes into a baker's, and buys a loaf, and I saw the little woman walking backwards and forwards, waiting for her; and then they went into a cheesemonger's shop, Cooley comes out then, and goes to the end of Salisbury court, and they both went together down Fleet-street, till they came to the Bell, Mrs. Cooley went into the Bell, and we watched Mrs. Bowling standing at the corner of Brides-lane, about four or five yards within view of the house; when Mrs. Cooley came out, J stling, the officer, went over the way to the Bell, I was watching them the mean while, and then Mrs. Bowling she went into the Bell, and Mrs. Cooley walks backwards and forwards, Mr. Jostling sends out for us to bring Cooley in; I went to Mrs. Cooley and takes hold of her, and leads her into the public house, as soon as we got into the tap-room, she drops the bag from one hand, and from her other I takes out a good half crown, and a bad six-pence.</p>

               <p>These two six-pences produced by Mr. Willis, are counterfeit; this six-pence produced by Jostling is counterfeit; this six-pence taken from Cooley's hand, is the same; these two in a bit of blue paper, they are both the same, the nineteen are all counterfeit, every one, and the shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. To Willis. Were the prisoners searched before or after you had taken that six-pence of Bowling? - After; there was some monies found in Cooley's hand after that, and Bowling was not searched till the two officers had come in with Cooley, when they were both searched together; the prisoner Bowling, dropped the six-pence first, before the other was brought in, the bag was dropped from Cooley after that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bowling. This is all spite of the officers against me; the last lottery I had won eleven pounds of a lottery office, and I employed Mr. Jostling and Mr. Newman to get it, and promised them a guinea a piece if they would get me my money. As for this woman I don't know her, I never had but four-pence and four shillings, and I was going to my children, and at Water-lane I went in to get a two-penny loaf, and I went into this gentleman's house, and I called for a glass of peppermint, and he refused the six-pence, sir, says I, if you don't like it, I have got another, and Mr. Jostling laid hold of me; as for this woman I know nothing about, I have got people here that will give me a good character, of being as hard a working poor slave as ever lived.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cooley. I was going to Fleet-market, and I met this woman, and she told me that she found that money, that silver, she said if it was good, she would make me a present out of it, and desired me to go into a seed shop, to get half a pint of split pease, and he objected to the sixpence; and she sent me to get half a pound of eight-penny butter, and I missed her when I came out, presently I see her come out of a baker's shop with a loaf, she asked me then to have something to drink, and to go into that shop? I told her no, I would not go without she went with me, but she insisted that I should go, and I gave that lady the six-pence, she shewed it to a gentleman, and he said it was a very good one, and I came out, and she gave me the bag, and the two runners came and took me, and when I went in she denied me at first, but afterwards she owned me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bowling. I never knew any thing of her, and Jostling gave her a shilling at the Poultry Compter, to say what she did.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners called three witnesses each, who gave them good characters.</p>
               <p>Court to Willis. Did you take the sixpence that Bowling offered? - Yes, I took it, and gave her change.</p>

             or order, forty days after the date thereof; and that you on the 29th of February did forge and counterfeit, and did willingly act and assist in the forging and counterfeiting on the back of the said Bill of Exchange, an acceptance, in writing, to the tenor following, John 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person888">

                  </persName>
             with intention to defraud William Dalby and 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person889">
                  Richard
                   Brown
               <interp inst="o17940219-1-person889" type="surname" value="Brown"/>

            . It was proved that you negociated the Bill of Exchange, in the words and form as stated in the indictment. That at the time you negociated it you told Mr. Dalby, the prosecutor, to whom you tendered it on account of himself and his partner, that Mr. King lived in Bartlett-street, Portman-square, and that he was a man of opulence; it was also proved in evidence, that there was no such person of the name of King, living in Bartlet-street, Portman-square. You, indeed, attempted to prove, by witnesses, that a man of that name lived there, and that he accepted the Bill, the jury did not believe your witness, on this evidence they found you guilty. There was no doubt, either on the minds of the court or jury, on the evidence that was adduced against you, but that the fact of forgery was fully established; and it also seems to have been accompanied with some aggravating circumstances on your part, inasmuch as you called witnesses to prove a palpable perjury; for it is stated, by the report, that those witnesses that were called by you were disbelieved in the evidence that they gave. After that the fact was established against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190174"/>you, the learned judge, before whom you was tried, with his usual caution, examined the indictment itself; it does not appear that any objection was made, either by yourself, or any body on your behalf. But the learned judge having conceived a doubt, in his own mind, he reserved your case for the consideration of all the judges in England. The doubt arose on that part of the indictment which states, the Bill to purport to be directed to one John King, by the name and description of 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person890">
                  John
                   Ring

                  </persName>
            . The court entertained a doubt, whether this mode of proving it could be good in point of law; now it is clear that where an instrument is set forth of that description, as purporting a particular fact, it necessarily means, that what is so stated, being of the purport, should appear on the face of the Bill itself; and whoever 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person891">
                  drew
               <interp inst="o17940219-1-person891" type="given" value="drew"/>

                  </persName>
             this indictment seems to have been drawn into a great blunder, by not considering what was the original state of the Bill, and what was the appearance of it, after the acceptance was put on it; and it does not seem that the person knew under what terms, or by whom the Bill might or might not be accepted. On the face of the Bill, which is the only thing to be considerd, when we examine this averment, nothing more appears than that the Bill is a Bill of Exchange, drawn by 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person892">
                  John
                   White

                  </persName>
            , on 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person893">
                  John
                   Ring

                  </persName>
            ; therefore, when the indictment says, drawn on John King, purporting to be 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person894">
                  John
                   Ring
               <interp inst="o17940219-1-person894" type="surname" value="Ring"/>
                     <interp inst="o17940219-1-person894" type="given" value="John"/>

                  </persName>
            , it is absurd and repugnant to itself, for the name or description of any one thing cannot be purporting for another. Though the Bill was drawn on John Ring, it might have been accepted by 
               <persName id="o17940219-1-person895">
                  John
                   King
               <interp inst="o17940219-1-person895" type="surname" value="King"/>
                     <interp inst="o17940219-1-person895" type="given" value="John"/>
                     <interp inst="o17940219-1-person895" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
            , for a Bill might be accepted by other persons than to whom it is directed, when it is accepted for the honour of the drawer, or any of the endorsers. But this blunder, which makes the indictment absurd and repugnant in itself, is sufficient reason, as considered by all the Judges in England, to arrest the judgment against you; but though the judgment, on this indictment, shall be arrested, yet you are not to be immediately discharged out of custody; for this is a case in which the opinion has been founded, not on any proof of innocence on your behalf, but merely on a blunder in the form of the indictment. The prosecutor is at liberty to indict you again on this offence, and for that purpose you are to remain in custody to the end of the sessions.</p>
