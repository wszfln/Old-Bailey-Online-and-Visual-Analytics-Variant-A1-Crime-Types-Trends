I and my little sister Louisa, lived with my mother, the prisoner, at 31, Wellesley Street, Somers Town—on the Thursday before I went to the police-court, my mother came home and beat me with her hand, because I was asleep, and threw me up against the door—she then told me to go into the bed-room; she then undressed me and told me to go into bed—I lost a scapula that she had put round my neck and she put the poker in the fire and told me to undress, I did undress and she took the poker out and held my hand and commenced to turn me—she burnt me on the neck and sides, and on my back and arm—the poker was red when she put it on my arm—it ceased to be red whilst she was doing <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, but it was hot, it hurt me—it was late at night when this occurred—three days after<lb/>wards I was seated on the door-step, and Mrs. Hazlehurst spoke to me and took me into her room, and afterwards to the police-station—this is the poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> I am a travelling clerk in the missing letter Department of the General Post-office—in April last I was directed to make an investigation as to the loss of certain letters—on the 25th April I made up a test letter in which I enclosed 206 penny postage stamps—I addressed it to Mrs. E. Thompson, 126, Pentonville Road, London—I posted it at the northern district office, at 7.15, in the evening—I drew the attention of Mr. Carman, the inspector, to it—at 9.30 I went to 126, pentonville Road and enquired of Mrs. Thompson, who answered the door, and she brought me another letter which she had received—I afterwards saw the prisoner in uniform going on with his delivery, and after that I saw him go into a public-house in Henrietta Street, Brunswick Square, where he remained about fifteen minutes—he then went into No. 19, and about a quarter of an hour came out in private clothes and went again to the public-house—I went into another compartment of the bar and <hi rend="italic">w</hi> him with another man—he then came out and walked down the street and pareyed with another man in Compton Street for about twenty minutes he then re-crossed the street and went towards Cockburn Street, where stopped him and said I wished to ask him about a letter which I had posted that evening to Mrs. Thompson—he said "I delivered a letter to Mrs. Thompson to-night"—I said "I know you did, but not the one I posted"—he said "I know nothing about it, I want to go"—I said "You not go"—Rumbold, the officer, then came up, and Mr. Carman—I said Do you know this gentleman?"—he looked at him and said "No"—I repeated the question and he again replied "No"—I said "Look again"—said "Oh yes, I know who it is now; it is Mr. Carman"—we all then went to a top front room of No. 19, where I again asked about the letter;—the prisoner denied all knowledge of it, but said to Mr. Carman "I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187705070009"/>
               <p>a letter for you and sorted it for the delivery"—I then directed Rumbold to search the prisoner—he said we should not, and became very violent, so that I was obliged to assist Rumbold to hold him—I shortly afterwards saw Rumbold take a letter from the left hand pocket of his private coat—the prisoner said "That is the b——trator," pointing to Carman, "who put the letter there"—I took him into custody—at Bow Street I examined the envelope and found seventy-two stamps were missing—the envelope produced is in the same state now as when it was found on the prisoner—the stamps had been put in the envelope in different pieces, the one of forty-eight stamps was missing; of a piece of twenty-four, twelve remained; eight were taken from a piece of sixteen; and a whole piece of four—the stamps were also folded differently to what they were placed by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that the delivery that evening was a heavy one; I should say it was not—there were ten pieces of stamps in the letter and two single stamps—it is customary to tie up letters with a string, which sometimes cuts the letters—there are no shops in Henrietta Street to give light to the street—Mr. Carman wore a hat—I do not know what he usually wears—we had great difficulty in getting the, letter—the prisoner is an auxiliary letter carrier—he was employed from 5 p.m. till his delivery was finished, between 11 and 12 o'clock, for which he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he may have been seventeen years in the service—I do not know whether he knew me—when a letter is accidentally broken it is the carrier's duty to deliver it to the address on it, give an explanation, and endorse it—he ought in no case to delay a letter even to show to the inspector—express rules are laid down for our guidance.</p>

I am silk buyer in George Williams' employ—on 3rd April, I called on Parsons, in Barley Mow Passage, and told him I came from instructions I had received, for some duplicates he held, for some silk which had been pawned at Harrison's, in Aldersgate Street—he said "I have not any"—I asked him if he had pawned any silk at Harrison's—he said "I have"—I said "Have you any of the silk by you"—he said "I have not"—I said "Were they black, or coloured, or striped?"—he said they were black—I said "Have you any small pieces so that I can see what they were?"—he said "I have not"—I said "Were you cautioned about the silk by Harrison?"—he said "I was, and I have not taken any since"—I asked him if he could tell me what was the longest length—he said "About 9 or 10 yards"—I said "Do you call 9 or 10 yards scraps and bits?"—he said I do"—I asked him "Do you know the party who you received the silk from?"—he said "I do not"—I said "How did the party come to you?"—he said "He came to me as many others do, at Cloth Fair"—I said "Do you know where the party came from?"—he said "I do not, but I think he comes from somewhere near Hackney, after I was cautioned by Harrison about the silk, I made enquiry of the party from whom I received the silk, how he came by them, and the explanation I received was perfectly satis<lb/>factory to me"—the party said I am a cutter in a wholesale house in the City, and by skilful cutting I am able to save the lengths.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Hovenden and Sons, wholesale perfumers, of the City Road; on 24th March eight dozen boxes of Blair's pills were sold to my firm, but not to me; and on 5th April six dozen, and on 12th April twelve dozen—I communicated with Messrs. Prout, and gave certain directions, and last Thursday week Robinson called with another parcel of goods—I said "Can you <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me any information who you got these from?"—he said "From a man named Goodwin"—I asked him where he obtained Blair's pills; he produced a piece of paper from his pocket with the name of Billett on it, who he said was an advertising agent, and that he got the goods in payment for advertisements—he went with me Steadman's, and on returning he said that he was well known to Serjeant Moss, the City Police officer—I went with him there the same day to the Old Jewry, and Moss took him in custody.</p>

On 26th April, Mr. Hovenden came to me at 26, Old Jewry, with Robinson—I said to Robinson "You have sold a large quantity of Blair's pills, from whom did you receive them?"—he said From a man named Billet"—I said "Where does Billet live?"—he said "I cannot tell you"—I said "Do you know where he carries busi<lb/>ness?"—he said "No"—I told him the account he gave was not satisfactory, and I should have to charge him with the unlawful possession of the goods—he said that he had been to Prout's, in the Strand, and referred me to Mr. Prout; he said "If you go to Prout's you will see a little man behind the counter, who will be able to give you some information who Billet is"—I then went to Robinson's residence, and found seven boxes of Blair's pills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187705070019"/>
               <p>and otter articles—he said that he had got a portion of them from Billett and a portion from a man named Goodwin, who he hed seen that morning and received the goods from him, that he had an appointment to meet him at 2 o'clock that day, but he did not know where he lived—it was then past 3 o'clock—I went to Prout's next day with Downes, and saw Newman—I told him we were City detective officers, that I had a man named Robinson in custody charged with the unlawful possession of a quantity of drugs, that he had been selling a large quantity of pills, and had referred me to him; I asked if he knew such a person, and if he knew Billett—he said "Billett is not his right name; his name is William Kennett" (that is the other pri<lb/>soner)—he said that Kensett was formerly employed there, and lived—at 188, High Holborn, that he had been induced by Kennett to steal the pills, and had been taking about three—quarters of a pound of those pills three times a week, and he generally came there about 9.5 a.m.—Robinson was remanded twice that inquiries might be made about Goodwin, and then he was dis<lb/>charged—I saw the three in the dock at Bow Street—a quantity of pills was found at Kennett's married sister's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Ltston Road, Grafton Square, Clapham, and am assistant inspector of guages for the Customs—on 16th December I was at Dowgate Dock, overlooking the guager Millard—it was his duty to have the casks placed out for him—I saw John Carr that morning by the arch where the guaging is occasionally done, and I went up and found a tin can of about 2 1/4 gallons, partly full of brandy—I asked Carr a question and sent for Millard—I had not observed Doherty, but he was on the spot in a moment, and said "We are only regulating the casks"—I said "You have no right to do anything of the sort, I don't believe you"—he said "Allow me to return the brandy to the casks again"—I said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi>"—Carr then came back with Millard—the can was then measured in my office in the presence of Doherty and myself; I don't think Carr was there; there were 7 pints of brandy in it—Carr pointed out four casks in Doherty's presence, who merely repeated his request to allow him to return the brandy to the casks—I communicated with the Custom House authorities, and in consequence of instructions from them I commenced going through the Stock ton the 20th, and it lasted a month; I went into the inner vault where the wine was kept, and saw a butt of sherry in which was a pump, and a hogshead with a funnel in it—the butt was guaged, and it was 13 gallons short—the hogshead was then dipped; it contained about 4 1/4 gallons of water, with a very small mixture of spirit—Doherty was on the spot and I said to him "What have you here?" he made no reply; Mr. Hebb said "What is it?" I replied You had better ask the man himself; he will tell you"—he asked Doherty, who said "It is only a little spirit and water"—I said "How did you get this water down in the vault; did you bring it in a cask or in a can?"—he said "I brought it down in the cask"—he had no authority to bring water into the vaults for any purpose of that sort—about</p>

               <p>I gallon per annum per cask is allowed for deficiency from evaporation, and also a gallon for sampling; there would be a sampling order, and it would be allowed for—that is credited to a cask—we should allow a gallon for a month and the same for a year—in the course of taking stock, with Air. Mil<lb/>lard's assistance I found four casks which I could not account for—I could not trace them in the stock in any way; one contained some Madeira one 44 gallons of port, another 11 gallons of braudy, and another some strong spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Strong spirit is plain spirit without any special character; it may be 60 or 70 degrees over proof; it is no doubt made into brandy and rum—it is delivered to distillers, but what they do with it I do not know—I do not know whether those casks were on the premises when Mr. Graves left—"regulating the casks" is an expression which I do not understand officially, but it is putting from one cask into another, equalising the quanti<lb/>ties, because there is not the same quantity in each cask—I never heard of that being done on wharfs—it is ipped after it is made up—making up is making the casks level, not as to quantity; but the two ends of the wood-work should be level with one another; that has nothing to do with regu<lb/>lating—the guaging marks are first put down on the head of the cask—the can with the 7 pints of brandy was put at the back of the cask—I saw it—it was 11 o'clock or 11.15, and it was standing there in broad daylight, but it was partly hidden by an empty package—my eyes saw it; I went up to it and looked into it, and then I spoke to Carr, who was standing there—no steps were taken against the prisoner till February—he was ad<lb/>mitted to bail, and has surrendered to take his trial.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When casks come from a barge they are placed along the wharf in a row, so that the guager can guage them—it is contray to regula<lb/>tions to transfer liquor from one cask to another—the result of the stock<lb/>taking was about 450 or 460 gallons deficiency—that appears in the official report—that is after making the proper allowance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a guager of the Port of London—on 16th December, about 10.30, I was at Dowgate Wharf, and the boy Carr-made a statement to me, in consequence of which I went with him to the arch, where I saw nine casks of brandy, marked J J D 1 to 9, and a can of brandy—I heard Mr. Ohds ask Doherty what he was going to do with the brandy in the can; he said that he was going to equalise the casks—Mr. Ohds said that he did not believe it—I measured the brandy in the can, there were 7 pints, I compared it with the brandy in the casks and it corresponded—the casks had not been guaged—casks are sometimes gauged the day they are landed, but usually the second day—I guaged these casks myself on the 17th—it is not the proper thing for anyone to touch the casks before guaging—on 20th December, Doherty came to me on the quay and asked if he could proceed with the racking off of a cask in the vault; I said that I was engaged at present—it is my duty to dip the casks before they are racked; nobody has authority to rack a cask before it is dipped; I then went into the office and got the order to dip, and when I went into the vaults I heard the inspector ask Doherty why he had placed the pump in the cask—I saw a pump in one and a funnel in another—I dipped the hogshead and the butt, the butt was 13 gallons short; the hogshead con<lb/>tained 4 gallons of spirit and water, very weak, that hogshead should have been empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Olds asked Doherty why the boy had taken the</p>

               <p>brandy from the casks, and he said "We were going to equalise the ullages"—I did not understand what he meant by that, but I did not ask him—the tin of brandy was then taken to the office and measured and tested—no charge was brought against the prisoner till February—he was discharged on 20th December, for something else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. He was not suspended on the day the brandy transaction was found out, but on the wine day.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Messrs. Breffit's employ—I remember, some hogs-heads of brandy, marked J J D, being on the quay—I saw Doherty take the bungs out, and by his instructions I got a can and drew 7 pints of brandy out of four casks—he was there some part of the time, but not all the time I was doing it—he asked me to take some brandy out of each cask and regulate them, and I put it into the can—he was with me while I took it out of one, and when I got to the fourth Mr. Olds came up and told me to go and bring Mr. Millard, and I did so—I took water into the vaults nearly every day, by Doherty's directions—I put it into the tubs to wash glasses and wash hands—the tubs were alongside Doherty's office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They gave me in custody, and I was discharged; I am not in Mr. Breffit's employ now, I have been out of employ all the time—I did not think there was anything unusual about it when Doherty asked me to take the brandy out, or I would not have done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a clerk, but am now unemployed—I live at No. 3, Sergeant's Inn—on Tuesday evening, April 24th, I dined with a friend at the Carlton Club—I left about 10.30 the worse for liquor, and went to the Alhambra Palace, in the promenade; I felt much worse and became giddy and sick—whilst in this condition the prisoner came and spoke to me—I do not remember what he said—he took my arm to help me out and walked with me to Leicester Square; eventually I found myself in my chambers; I went to bed—I do not recollect anything further that night—I know I did not take anything at the Alhambra—in the morning, about 8 o'clock, I awoke and found the prisoner in bed with me—I expressed my surprise—he asked if I did not remember the state I was in the previous night when he brought me home—I said I did remember it, but had forgotten that he was with me still—he said as he was very tired and had come home with me he thought I would not mind his staying, and as he found it cold in the other room, he got into my bed; I expressed my wonder that he had not used another bed which was there, but do not recollect his reply—he said he suffered from rheumatism, and he was so tired the previous night he did not want to walk to Islington—I went into the next room and dressed—I returned and found the prisoner dressed—after my laundress had been and we had had breakfast, the prisoner said in the sitting—room he did not admire my old china, he liked modern china best—in the conversa<lb/>tion he told me he sold goods on commission in the City, and that he would have to go to business that day—I said I had an engagement and wished to leave and prepared to go—he stopped me and said he had a favour to ask of me; he was hard up, would I lend him some money—I said I was sorry I had no money, and was not in the habit of lending it—he said that was all nonsense, I must give him some, he intended to have some before he left the room—I said that what I told him was true, besides I did not see that he had a particular claim upon me—he then used violent language and said if I did not give him some money at once, he would smash me and the place up—I had valuable things about and knew he could do considerable damage, and I made some excuse to try to go out—I said I wanted to send a telegram—that was to bring a friend to nay assistance or to get the money for the prisoner—he said I should not leave the place until I had given him money—I then asked him to go—he said he would not unless he had money or the equivalent of it, and that I had better not <hi rend="italic">angry</hi> him—I was alarmed and went towards the window—he pushed me towards the chair and told me to sit down—he then proceeded to examine the drawers in the sitting-room, as he said, to see if he could find a letter or anything he could make use of—he then led me by my arm into the bed—room and examined ray boxes, compelling me to hand him my keys—finding nothing there he took me back to the sitting-room and asked for something to drink—he said his patience was exhausted—I gave him what liquor I had which made him more violent and he re<lb/>peatedly threatened me with violence, especially when I got up or made any motion towards going out—he took a watch from the mantelpiece and said it was not worth 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he told me he was a discharged soldier and that he was desperate, that he did not care as he had nothing to loose if he got seven years, and that he was determined to make a haul this time as he had bee a tricked before—he asked for something to eat—I had only sardines in</p>

I have offices at 173, Ball's Pond Road, Islington, and live at the Elms, Wood Green—on 23rd November the prisoner called on me—I think he had called once before—he said he wanted to get an action settled that was against him in the Mayor's Court, and asked if I could lend him the money to settle it—he said he wanted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him what security he was prepared to offer—he said that he had got a house of furniture, a piano, a horse and" cart and harness, that it was a valuable little pony—I asked him particularly if the piano was his, or whether it was on hire, he said No, it was his own property—he produced a list of his furniture, I have not got it, I left it with the clerk to the Magistrate—I said "If I make this advance I shall require a bill of sale"—he said "Oh, will<lb/>ingly, but don't register it under any circumstances, it would be my ruin"—I said "If you are honest, which I have every reason to believe from what I can see of you, I will not register the bill of sale, but you must make me a</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The declaration being read, stated that the goods mentioned in the bill of sale were his absolute property, and that his liabilities: did not exceed</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) There is no schedule referred to in the bill of sale, it is general—having made the declaration and signed the bill of sale, I advanced him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part by cheque and part money—I parted with my money on the faith that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> goods he had assigned were his property, and that he was not in a state of insolvency, otherwise I should not have lent him the money—he was a perfect stranger to me—afterwards, in consequence of something that I heard, I wrote to him to know why he had not paid the money ac<lb/>cording to promise, and he wrote back a letter—I then went to Cambridge and took an officer with me from there to Horseheath, to take possession under the bill of sale—that was about the end of February.</p>

I am a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, and visiting medical officer of the Westminster Union—on 9th April I saw the child, he presented a pallid emaciated appearance—he was apparently six years old; his feet and hands were cold and livid, there was a considerable bruise on his right temple, the middle finger of his right hand was much bruised, and there was a small ulcer on the finger next to it; and an ulceration behind each ear, which might have been from neglect and dirt, or from injury, or from the weak state of the blood—there were ulcera<lb/>ions on his toes, and a large ulcer on his right thigh, and another on the back of his <hi rend="italic">right</hi> hand across the knuckles, the mark of which will always remain and so will those on the thigh, as there is complete loss of structure—that indicates a burn I think.

               <p>about 43 lbs. and his weight was only 29 lbs. because his clothes weighed 3 lbs.; I weighed them myself—the emaciation was such as to endanger life—the glands of the groin were very much inflamed and it degenerated in to two abscesses which I have had to open—they arose from want of proper food and nourishment—I also found a mark on his forehead, and two mark 8 of what I think had been contused wounds on the outer part of the left side of—his head.</p>

When my wife died it shook my nerves very much and I lost the use of my hand and could not carry on my business, and my son took this cottage for me, and bought an annuity on my life, and I had nothing to do with the business for years, and what he borrowed or what he did I know nothing about; but unfortunately I did not separate my name from his, it was still Golding and Son, and therefore his creditors made me liable and sold my bed from under me.

Seeing its date I believed it was of no value, yet knowing that another lease was mortgaged to a building society, I took no notice of it to my father, thinking that as he was ill if anything happened to him I should be in the right if it proved an original, and being pressed by Mr. Briggs for money, I did hand him the lease. I was not acquainted with its worthlessness, until this charge, when it appeared that it ought to have been for nineteen rears, instead of ninety.</p>

I am married, but living apart from my husband at 8, Great College Street—on 4th April, I met the prisoner near Charing Cross—he said he would write me a letter—I received a letter next day—he came on the Thursday when I was moving from my last residence—my friend Emily Ashton was with me—he came with me to College Street—he said he was Lord Willoughby—he came and sat opposite me in the room, my friend being present, and said he wished to talk to me very seriously, he had a nice house at St. John's Wood, and I must give up my apartments and go there by 8.30 on the following Saturday, to meet him there to dinner—the address was Alpha Villa, Abbey Road—he said I was to have a carriage and pony and a nice little page and several servants, and whatever I did I was not to associate with the servants—he then asked what jewellery I had and said "I suppose it is all rubbish"—I said "Unfortunately it is" and showed him the rings on my finger—he asked for a plain ring which appeared to fit me the best, for a pattern, saying he would send me some better ones by a commissionaire from the Army and Navy Club, he belonged to that club, and if I wanted any more money I was to apply there for it—I said "You could take the size of the ring without taking the ring"—he said the had given a ring to another young lady and had lost it through not taking the size, and he took it—I also had some filagree earrings—he said He admired the patterns, but that they were rubbish, and if I would allow him to take them he would have them made in real gold—he shewed me a ring on his finger which had been left him through his ancestors 500 years before Christ—he put the earrings in his pocket—he then asked for pen, ink, and paper, and when it was brought he wrote on it and I was to give it to Messrs. Howell and James, as he wished me to have good clothing—he also enclosed a cheque in an envelope which he took from his pocket book—he said "Don't unseal it because they will think it is not from the Lord"—I was to take it to the London Bank, No. 12, Lombard Street—he looked at his watch now and then, and at last said "It is time you went to the bank otherwise you won't get this money"—after sitting a little while longer, my friend and I went out with him, and in' the street he said "Oh what a nuisance I have sent my brougham away, have you any loose change in your pocket?"—I said "Yes, I have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said "Will you let me have it because you will have plenty when you get to the bank"—I said "You can lake 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you want it only for a cab"—I handed him my purse showing him the amount I had—he said "You may as well let me have it all because you will have more than enough when you get to the bank, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. will be</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hawley Terrace, New Cross—on Easter Monday and Tuesday I was assistant barman to Mr. Burgess, at the Prince Arthur public—house, Greenwich Road—the male prisoner also acted as assistant barman—it is a large bar, there are four or five tills in it—when change is required it is taken from the tills, the gold is taken from behind—during the Monday I observed the female prisoner come in and out several times—on the Tuesday I made a communication to my master and watched—that was from what I had observed on the Monday—I had told the pri<lb/>soner on the Monday that he was doing something wrong, and he made a laugh of it, and walked away—on the Tuesday I kept observation on the prisoner—between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening I saw the female pri<lb/>soner at the bar with a small stone bottle, she called for half a quartern of gin—I directed my attention to her carefully—while George Woods was getting the gin to serve her she put a sixpence on the counter, the male prisoner picked it up, put it in the till, and gave her two shillings and some bronze—she took up the money and went away with the gin.</p>

                  </hi> Clifford. I am manager to Alfred May, corn merchant, of Greenwich—On Saturday, 7th April, I sent Barber who is the carman to take forty—five trusses of hay and trefoil to Mr. Musgrave's, at East Green<lb/>wich—I gave him a delivery—note; I wrote it myself—I counted the trusses and could see he had forty—six but was not certain that he had forty—seven—I asked him how many he had—he said forty—five—I followed the van—I then went to Turner's place in Roan Street, and asked for the money for some trusses he had taken away on the Thursday, previous to Good Friday—he said that he had not any <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi>, meaning money, but would call and pay me—on coming away I noticed some loose trefoil on the pavement—I made enquiries and then went back to Turner's and said "My man has been here has he not?"—he said "Yes"—I said "And delivered you two trusses of stuff"—he said that he had—I said "Where are they?"—he pointed and said "Here"—I said "How came you to take these trusses knowing there is nothing ordered, and you know I have refused to deliver you any trusses, or to trust you, you pay for the trusses you had on the Thursday, and I shall lock the man up for stealing these"—he said "I hope you will think nothing more about it"—I then left—he had not mentioned the trusses when I called on him first—the trusses of trefoil are mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Barber</hi>. I am sure I asked you how many trusses you had, and you said forty—five—I was standing outside when you came out with the load—I did not tell you to take some to make up weight.</p>

I did not trust Turner, he took the trusses away—I cannot tell the exact date without my books—what I said before the Magistrate is correct—Turner had formerly dealt with Mr. May and paid him—what he had fetched on the Thursday he had not paid for—I will swear he did not meet me and ask if I would let him have a couple of trusses—he owed us 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—goods have been sent without a ticket, but the ticket has been sent afterwards—when I saw the trusses I asked Turner if he had paid for them—he said he had not—he did not say that that was not the stuff he ordered and that he had ordered clover, till afterwards.</p>

I was house surgeon "at Guy's Hospital, on 10th February—I saw Gardner there between 10 and 11 o'clock, he was suffering great pain and I found that the bones of his hip joint were severely injured—he was there till my appointment was up, and I left him there—I also saw him on 5th March, when he was discharged—he was not cured—I have seen his leg since, there is permanent injury, and it is shortened half an inch—that does not necessitate a fracture—the injury resulted from a violent fall or a blow.</p>
