I am the wife of George Dorling, of 422, Euston Road—my husband has lived there for sixteen years and I thirteen years—we keep an oyster shop—early in November last the prisoner Mitchell called, and asked if I would be kind enough to oblige him by taking in a few letters for his father-in-law, Mr. Crofts, who had come up from the country—I said, "Yes"—he said he would pay me half-a-crown a week for my trouble—after that some letters came addressed, "T. W. Crofts, 422, Euston Road"—next day Ambrose came and asked for letters for Mr. Crofts—I gave them to him—letters arrived nearly every day for three weeks or a month, sometimes two a day, and sometimes three—Ambrose gene<lb/>rally came for them—I knew him by the name of Lisson—Mitchell used to be with him, but waited outside—Mitchell never came alone to fetch letters—my husband gave the letters sometimes—Ambrose used to wear a moustache—we keep the whole of the premises—they are very small—there is no London Imperial Advance Company carrying on business there, or any office, or anything of the kind—I never heard of such A company.</p>

My dear Sir,—I can assure you I am very thankful to you for answering my letter so quickly. I have enclosed the bill, signed.

               <p>saw Pugh—I went with him to get it discounted—Pugh did not put his name on it—it was discounted by a man named Morris, of Regent Street—I don't know what Morris is—it was not Mr. Morris the attorney—I also raised money through a Mr. Hyman Davis, of Bruton Street, Bond Street—I raised 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. through him, upon three or four acceptances, at several times—that was at the end of 1864 and the beginning of 1865—September or October, 1865, I think was the last—there were three or four bills—I don't know exactly the number—the amount was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Davis—I don't know where he got them dis<lb/>counted—I believe he was the principal, he always gave me the money, I am not sure, but I believe he was—he charged me 20 per cent. for three months, not 50—I have also employed Baxter &amp; Co.—they carry on busi<lb/>ness in a turning out of Regent Street (I forget the name), St. James's Street, I think—I began to have transactions with them, I think, in January or February this year—they did not get me any money—I was only negotiating with them—I asked them to get me 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they told me they were agents, they would try and get me the money—I don't know how long they were trying to get the money—they had the bills some time in their hands—there were two bills, I think two 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—I have not tried any other persons since—I tried another person before, Percy, of Craig's Court, in the beginning of 1865—I gave him an acceptance—I think the first was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he discounted it himself—I think he calls it a loan agency—he discounted two or three bills—those bills were running when I applied to the prisoner; I think between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no transaction with a person named Thornton—I raised money on one bill from a man named Gorrar—when I applied to the prisoner in November I had not 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of acceptances out; I had about 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got them discounted—they have been paid since—they are all paid—they were paid this year—not after I had instituted this prosecution—arrange<lb/>ments were made to pay them before—I believe I am right in saying that some of them were paid before—they were all to be paid before, and all have been paid—it was not a part of the arrangement that my acceptances and liabilities should be taken up if I persisted in this prosecution—there is no reason for-saying that—I did not see the prisoner until about six weeks after I had written to him—I believe the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was dated the same day as the letter, 7th November—I believe the date is the prisoner's writing—I think it was sent to me ready drawn, but I won't be sure—I suppose it arrived on the 7th—I cannot recollect the day—there are two or three deliveries a day at Aldershot—I cannot recollect at what time in the day I sent the letter off—he answered my first letter—I must have sent him a letter before this one—I cannot find his answer—I have tried to do so when I was sued for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I do not remember his saying in that letter, "I can get you a bill discounted for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you will send your acceptance"—he did not say so; as far as I remember, he said he enclosed the bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I accepted it he would give or send me the money for it; I believe those were the words—if he had sent me the money short of discount it was no business of mine where he got it—I should have written to acknowledge it—I should have said nothing more—I think I had a reply to this letter of 7th November a few days after—I can't say for certain how many days; I think two or three days—I have not got any letter except the first and second—I can't be certain whether I got one or two letters before 15th November—I can't say how many letters I received from him, three or four I think about November—I have</p>

               <p>the last letter I received from him—that was after I had found out he had negotiated the bill—that was in February, I think—when I wrote in November, asking for the money by return of post, he answered in a few days that he could not advance me money upon so large an acceptance—it was not that he could not get me the money—on 15th November I received a letter from him stating that I had doubtless been daily expecting to hear from him with reference to my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. acceptance—he did not say, "Much greater difficulty exists than I anticipated when I first addressed you. You are, I have ascertained, involved with Mr. C., and Thornton and Co. refuse to touch your paper upon any terms. There is, however, a channel in the City, and I am now waiting the result of their inquiries of your agents, Messrs. Bryce and Bowstead. If their reply is favourable I believe the bill will be done. I hope to be able to write more satisfactorily in a few days."—I got no letter to that effect about 15th November—I have not the least idea who the Mr. C. is that you allude to—I have heard of Mr. Calisher—I never had any transaction with him—I do not know Thornton and Co.—Bryce and Bowstead are army agents—I had not referred the prisoner to them in any way—he could ascertain that they were my agents by looking at the <hi rend="italic">Army List</hi>—I did not on 20th November receive a letter to this effect: "No direct information can, it appears, be obtained from Messrs. Bryce and Co., but an offer is made to the following effect: namely, if you are disposed to allow your acceptance for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to remain as a collateral security, the party I alluded to in my letter of the 15th will discount two bills for you of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each."—I believe I sent him a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about 22nd November—I don't know the exact date—that was in consequence of a letter I got from him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "November 22nd.

Put on, 'To be called for,' and the other money, if you can get it, please send to Aldershot."—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the bill I enclosed him on 22nd November—there were two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—I cannot tell which was the one I enclosed in that letter—this is dated 21st November—I think I was at the Norfolk Square Hotel, Paddington, about that time—I don't think I found a letter for me there, because I sent a mes<lb/>senger to his house—I did not get a letter containing a cheque of a Mr. Lyon for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe not—I never remember receiving a cheque (<hi rend="italic">looking at a cheque</hi>)—I never remember having this—I never remember seeing that cheque—I sent a porter with a letter to the prisoner, asking if he could let me have the money he had promised—I won't be certain whether 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes was sent back by the porter or by post—I received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him in bank notes—that was after I had sent him this bill on the 22nd—he had then two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills of mine—I do not remember the day I sent him the first 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I don't remember how long it was before this one—I know he had two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills of mine in his possession—this one was paid by my agents—I have not stated that the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills were in substitution for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—it is not so—I sent him two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills, as he asked me, and he asked me at the same time to allow him to keep the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill as a collateral security—he asked me that by letter, a few days before 22nd November, when he told me he could not cash the large amount—I think it was after I sent him the two bills for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the letter I sent before getting the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I shall be happy to allow my first bill to remain in your hands. When can you let me have the money for the enclosed bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?

Can you name a day to see me at the Queen's Hotel, North Camp? Say Thursday next, and name hour if you can.

I live at 41, Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel, and am a tailor—I know the prisoner—I did not know him before 24th June, to my knowledge—about twelve o'clock that night I was at the door of my house in the street—I heard a female voice crying out and making a noise in Bakers' Arms Alley, close by—I could not see up the alley from where I stood—I saw the deceased and his wife come out of the alley—the woman had a long-handled broom in her hand—I did not know them before—they came into the street, the wife defending herself—the husband hit her a blow in the face—she lifted the broom again—he stopped the broom, and hit her a second blow in the face—she did not strike him, because he defended himself, and she said, "You call me a wh—, and I am none"—they both fell on the ground—she fell from the blow he hit her, and he fell a-top of her—she dropped the broom and got up and hit him two blows with the right hand on the right cheek; then the prisoner came out of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Ellis, a marine store dealer, and live at No. 5, High Street, Battersea, at Mr. Allen's—on 5th May, between 11 and 12 of night, the prisoner came there with a woman and his children—he had the baby in his arms; at least, I suppose</p>

I wish it was dead. It is more trouble to me and my mistress than enough"—they then went upstairs—some 8 or 9 days afterwards I went into their room—I saw the child that is now dead on a bundle, I could not say whether it was rags or flock—it was very filthy and dirty—I have often heard it cry, particularly when the prisoner has been the worse for drink—it has cried for bread, and for water—it has been left without its father or the woman from nine in the morning till eleven, twelve, and perhaps one o'clock—I could not say that the children were left without food all that time, but they have been left by themselves, and have cried for food during the day, and we have relieved them in the house—I knew the prisoner three years ago, and he was a bad man to his wife then—she has been dead about three years.</p>

I am a surgeon at Battersea—on 30th April the deceased child was brought to my surgery for medical advice by some relation, I believe by the woman with whom the prisoner lived—it was a very small stunted child, unusually small for its age—it had disease of the lungs, tubercular deposition in the lungs, and disease of the mesenteric glands—I saw it several times between that period and 23rd May, when it was brought to me by the grandmother—the second time it was brought to me by a woman named Sweeney, with whom the prisoner lived—on 23rd May it was very much worse indeed; in fact, it had sunk rapidly from the time I saw it before—that was the last time I saw it—deprivation of food, and want of clothing and other comforts, would have a great deal to do with accelerating its death—I must say in fairness that the child undoubtedly would have died at some period, and at no distant period, from the disease under which it laboured, consumption both of the lungs and the mesenteric glands, but the absence of food and clothing would accelerate its death; in fact, the child was in a starving condition on the last occasion when I saw it.</p>

I am single, and live at Chelsea at present—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> in April, in consequence of which I wrote to the Cavendish Institution, and received a prospectus in reply—I went there on 9th April—it was at 9, Mortimer Street, Regent Street—I saw both the prisoners there, and asked for the address of the companionship advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—Wattez, I think, wrote it and gave it to me, saying that I ought to write soon—Smith said I was to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before I received the address, which I paid, and got a receipt—this is the address: "Mrs. Duperny, 40, Rue St. Omer, Pas de Calais"—I wrote</p>

               <p>there, but received no answer, and my letter was returned about three weeks afterwards through the dead letter office—after that I went to the institution again, and saw both the prisoners—I complained about the letter being returned, and they said that the lady had returned a week since to London, and they would give me the address when they got it—I think it was Wattez said that—I went again in about a fortnight, and saw, I think, Wattez alone—he gave me the address, "Mrs. Ablett, Mr. Shearing, 9, Mortimer Street, Herne Bay"—I wrote to that lady, but had no reply, nor did I have the letter back—I received this letter between the first and the last addresses—it is in Wattez's writing—I have seen him write—he wrote me the address. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated March</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th, and stated that there were no situations on the books likely to suit the witness at present, but that the first that came would be sent to her, in the meantime giving her the address, "Mr. Donovan</hi>, 30, <hi rend="italic">King's Road, Ball's Pond," who required a young lady to instruct his daughter in music</hi>.) I do not remember whether I received that in March or April, but it was after I received the first address—I have not noticed that it is dated 20th March, and not April—I went to the institu<lb/>tion again, and saw Smith—I told him there was no such name as Mrs. Ablett at Mr. Shearing's—he said that it was all a mistake what I had seen in the newspapers—I had referred to that—I told him that he might either return the money or I should expose him—he said that it was not customary to return money when once received—this letter marked B is in Wattez's writing (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "Mr. Ablett, care of Mr. Henniford, 20, Old Street, St. Luke's.

Madam,—We cannot understand the reason your letter was returned from Mrs. Clark. Immediately on receiving fresh addresses we will forward them. Yours respectfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">J.

After some little time I went to the in<lb/>stitution again, and saw Smith and a Miss Hawkins—I believe I said that it was very strange I could not obtain a situation, and if I did not get one I should have to ask him to return my money, or make it payable some-where else—he told me to do my best and worst—I said that I should endeavour to do so.</p>

I am a reporter attached to Marylebone Police-court—I was present on 13th May, when the prisoner preferred a charge against Mr. Moseley, and took a short-hand note of her evidence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a transcript of it. (<hi rend="italic">In this the prisoner stated that she lived at</hi> 112, <hi rend="italic">Warwick Street, Pimlico, and was the wife of a military outfitter; that on the previous day she travelled from Watford to London with Mr. Moseley, who locked the carriage door, and violently dragged her from one side of the carriage to the other, threw her clothes over her head, and otherwise assaulted and ill-used her, and that he was smoking during the whole journey</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at 16, Sunderland Terrace, Paddington, and practise as a surgeon-dentist, in partnership with my father—I am 29 years old, and am married, and have two children—on 29th May I was living at home with my wife and children—I went to Watford that day on business, and returned to the station to meet the six o'clock train—I saw the prisoner on the platform, she asked me if the train which was approaching was the train for London—I said, "Yes"—she asked me if I was going to London—I said, "Yes"—the train drew up at the station—I walked to the first empty second-class compartment and entered it—the prisoner followed me into the carriage—it was the compart<lb/>ment nearest the engine—she was carrying a large bouquet—she began talk<lb/>ing about the aspect of the country, and said that she was very fatigued; she had been to Watford to see her children, who were at school there, and had been rambling in the fields—after a short time she alluded to her children again, and said that the youngest was a very fine little fellow, something like she was—I had asked her if she had any objection to smoking before we got to Pinner, and she led me to infer that she rather liked it than not—I then lit a pipe, it was almost immediately we started—I then took a book from my bag, not wishing for conversation of that description, and commenced reading—on the train arriving at Pinner there were a great many people on the platform, and I observed to her, "You have no objection to smoking. As there seem a great many people here, somebody may get in who has, and if you have no objection I will lock the door of the carriage"—I locked the door with a key which I had in my pocket—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090043"/>
               <p>the train stopped at Harrow, Sudbury, and Camden Town, where the tickets were collected, and I unlocked the door either just before or after we got there—we both gave up our tickets, and the train arrived at Euston Square—from Camden Town to Euston Station it takes six minutes—the train was due at London at a quarter to seven, leaving Watford at five minutes to six—I cannot say whether it was late or not—I took up my bag and got out of the carriage first, and was proceeding along the platform, when a railway inspector came up to me and said that a lady desired to speak to me—I went back to where the prisoner was; she accused me of having grossly insulted her and asked me for my card, I refused to give it to her and denied the charge—she said that she must have my card, or she would give me in charge for haying insulted her—I was asked my name, and I gave the name of Jackson—I then asked to be taken to the police-station and to have the case thoroughly investigated before a magistrate—several railway officers accompanied me to the station with the prisoner—I gave my correct name and address at the station—the charge was entered against me, and I was locked up that night and taken before a magistrate next morning—I took no indecent liberty with the prisoner during that railway journey, nor did I attempt to throw her on her back on the seat of the carriage—I did not pull her about, or throw her clothes over her head, or touch her, or commit any act; nor did I expose myself in any way, or use any indecent language—she had her bouquet on the platform, and at the station too; it was not injured in the least, nor were her clothes or her bonnet in any way rumpled or injured—her hair was not disturbed that I observed—my dress was in the ordinary way—she was a perfect stranger to me—the matter was investigated next day, Wednesday, at the police-court, and I was discharged—on the following day I applied for a summons, and she was arrested on a warrant.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090044"/>
               <p>I moved back again, because the platform where we got in is not on the same line as where we got out—but they had the other stations to stop at on the side on which I was sitting—nobody came into the train—I was still smoking at Camden Town—I fancy I finished my pipe there, and unlocked the door—it was just before or just after—I make an invariable rule to get into an empty carriage, for the purpose of smoking—I noticed that the first compartment was empty, and walked in without taking notice of the others—I got out before the train stopped, and had got some distance on the platform before I was stopped—I think I was very near the engine—I had walked some yards, certainly—I was walking fast.</p>

I am a bricklayer, and live at 131, Pownall Road, Dalston—the prisoner is a cousin of my wife's—I had a daughter, Mary Ann—she was about two years and three or four weeks old—on 30th May I saw the child in the morning, and saw her again at dinner time—when I came back in the evening the child was missing, and, from some informa<lb/>tion, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, No. 3, Baldwin Court—I went down the court with the prisoner—the child was then in the front room on the bed, and was given to her out of the window by some one—she was in the court along with me and the policeman—it was a small four-roomed house—I took the child from the prisoner and said, "That is my child." She said, "No, it is not, it is mine"—I then gave her in charge to the police—before I gave her in charge she said, "That is my nephew." I said, "It is not your nephew; you know very well it is not a boy at all"—when I found the child she was dressed in a little red flannel frock, she had no stays on, and white socks and low shoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am quarter-master of the 17 th Regiment of Bengal Infantry, and live at 179, Globe Road—on the afternoon of 21st May, about five o'clock, I was in the Grove Road Archway, Bethnal Green, near Victoria Park—I saw two vans coming along the road, each drawn by two horses—they were racing and galloping—they were coming in the same direction—Cobb was driving the advance van—I saw the little boy who was afterwards killed cross the road with his sister—when I first saw him he was on the side of the road where there were some stalls—the little girl had hold of his hand—she let go his hand and ran across the road—the boy was about following when the near horse or the near wheel of the van driven by Cobb struck the child, and it stumbled and fell forwards, and both the wheels of the other van driven by Clark went over it—the drivers galloped on through the archway up the hill forty good yards before I could get them to stop—when they stopped Clark's van was close to the kerb, and the other one was jammed close to it—they could not pass one another—the constable came up—I explained to him what had happened—I then went back and saw the child being taken to the doctor's, and I saw it die about five minutes afterwards.</p>

Mrs. Andrews and Sutton <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Parker—Sutton <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Parker was pending in 1861, to the best of my recollection—at that time I knew the prisoner Crowther Smith by that name—I came to know him at the concluding part of the case of Sutton <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Andrews, and I saw. him throughout the next action—he was acting as clerk to Mr. Wood, Mr. Sutton's attorney—I have frequently seen the two prisoners together during the progress of Sutton <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Andrews—I went to 8, Store Street, Bedford Square, for the purposes of the first action—Sutton was living there, carrying on a surgeon's or a medical man's business—I saw a diploma of John Potter Serjeant exhibited in the window—this was about 1860 or 1861.</p>

               <p>open into the yard—I then went to the cellar—on the way to the cellar I heard a cry outside of "Stop him! stop him!" and turned round to go up-stairs again—on going upstairs I saw prisoner rush from the other part of the house, down the stairs, and out at the same door I had entered by, slamming the door after him—I opened the door, and saw one of the policemen had fallen down in the road—I went in again, and called the landlord and land-lady—of course I lost prisoner then—I took him into custody on the fol<lb/>lowing Tuesday afternoon—I went to the "Hong Kong" to make some inquiries, and there found him at the bar—I recognised him directly—there was a dozen or twenty people in front of the bar.</p>

               <p>boy, and going out with the cart since he has been bigger—Clark is a firewood cutter in Lower Whitecross Street—on 11th June, about half-past 8 in the morning, Lovett left Dockhead with a horse and cart, loaded with boxwood, to the order of Mr. Lynes—not wood from the box-tree, but selected deal picked out for the purpose of making boxes, sound pieces selected from the rest—there was half a fathom in the cart, 108 cubic feet—the wood was up to three feet in length—when Lovett left with the cart he was to go direct to Lynes, Twister's Alley, Bunhill Row—our course of business is to give the carter a delivery note when the customer is not to pay for the wood—I gave Lovett a delivery note on this occasion—the delivery note is in duplicate, one half is kept by the customer, the other signed and delivered to carman, and brought back home—that is held as evidence of the receipt of the wood by the customer—that half delivery note was brought back to me by Lovett, about half-past 11 in the morning—it is here—about half an hour before Lovett returned Mr. Lynes's boy came to me—in consequence of what he told me, when Lovett returned I told him that Mr. Lynes had sent down, saying the wood was short, and he would have to back with me and see to it—I had not then seen Curtis—Lovett said, "I don't know anything about it. If the other man, Hickie, has done anything wrong, I must get out of it the best way I can"—strict orders had been given to all the carters not to leave their carts to any one else—Hickie worked for us 18 months ago—I told Lovett that Lynes's boy said that some of the wood had been left in Lower Whitecross Street—his answer was that he didn't go with the cart—he said, "I have been on a message for my father"—Lovett went with me to Mr. Lynes—I measured the wood, and found five-sixths of the quantity that left the yard—the value of the wood missing was about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I. then gave Lovett into custody—I saw Clark the same morning at his cellar, in Whitecross Street—he rents a cellar under the shop, No. 51—I told him that I had come on very unpleasant business, that we had information that one of our carts had been leaving wood there that morning—Clark denied that any had been left—he said he had had no wood in that morning—I said, "We have witnesses that one of our carts had been delivering wood here this morning"—he still persisted that he had none—I went to fetch an officer, who searched the place, and found a lot of wood similar to that which had been sent to Lynes's that morning—the quality was sound dealings—I took 39 pieces of that wood away—that was nearly the whole of what was missing from Mr. Lynes's cart—Clark said, "I bought that of you"—he is a customer of ours, but not for boxwood—when we sold wood to Clark we always sent a receipted bill—our transactions with him were always for ready money—we did not pursue the delivery note system with him.</p>

I asked him, "Who put the wood down at Clark's?" he said, "Nobody." I said nothing more, and he said nothing more—I wanted to see Mr. Lynes, who was engaged—I saw him after the cart drove away—I assisted in measuring the wood with one of Mr. Lynes's men—ten shillings' worth was missing, one-sixth of the whole quantity—the whole quantity was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was only 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth—I believe it was Hickie who was throwing wood off the cart.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in the "Mail Coach" Public-house, Farringdon Street, on 9th June, on a warrant, which I read to him, and said that he must consider himself in my custody—he said, "Very well"—on the way to the station he said, "Where is Pudde-foot. Can I see him?" I said, "Do you wish to see him?" He said, "Yes, to ask him if he means to <hi rend="italic">lay me up</hi>." I said, "Do you mean, lock you up?" He said, "Yes; if he does that he will not get his money back; if he don't do it he might get it back. Where are we going now?" I said, "To the police-station." He said, "Then I reserve all I have to say"—I searched him, and found copies of the specification and letters upon him—he said that he had no fixed residence.</p>

I live at 3, Crossfield Lane, Deptford—I was employed in the dockyard there—on the evening of Whit Tuesday, as I was returning from work, I saw the deceased near the railway arches, lying against the wall, with his arms down and his head a little drooping, and I saw the prisoner strike him two blows, one with his right hand, and the next was an up blow, as it appeared to me—he fell forwards—the blows were struck while he was in a stooping position—he fell along by the side of the wall—I went up to him afterwards—he was then lying across Mr. Worth's lap, bleeding from the nose and mouth—he appeared to me to be quite insensible—the prisoner was standing in the middle of the road—he was going away, and I put my hand on his shoulder, and said, "Stand your ground; do not run away; it appears to me he may require medical assist<lb/>ance"—the man, who I have since found out to be Fletcher, nudged him on the shoulder, and said, "The b—has not been hit hard enough"—that man went away with the prisoner—I followed them—the deceased seemed still in the same position when I left—a woman was bringing a glass of water to him, and Mr. Worth was going to put it over his face.</p>

                  </hi> (Police Sergeant 8 R). On Saturday evening, 9th June, in consequence of information, I went to the "Green Bank" Public-house, in Half Moon Street, and there saw the prisoner—I was in plain clothes—I told him I was a police sergeant of the R division, and that I came up respecting a man who was assaulted on Whit Tuesday at the railway arches, Deptford—he said, "Yes; I have been down there. What I did was in self-defence. I had been with some friends to a public-house called "The Gunner"—I told him he would have to accompany me to Deptford, on the charge of assaulting a man named John James Buchan, who was since dead—he said, "Very well; I will go," and he went.</p>

I am the family physician of Mr. Buchan—the morning after deceased received the injury I was called in, and I found him in a most peculiar condition, in a half conscious state—I could not rouse him or get any answers from him that day—the impression I had was that he had been drinking apparently some beer that had been drugged, and I gave a certificate to that effect—he continued under my care till the 1st of June, when he died—he did not remain unconscious the whole of that time—he became conscious the latter part of Thursday or Friday morning, and then gave me some little account of what he supposed was the state he was in—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on 2nd June—the abdominal thoracic viscera were healthy—we first of all laid open the spine, throughout the whole canal, and across the back and throat—throughout the whole of the track of the spinal marrow there was considerable effusion of blood—I should have mentioned that there were some few bruises externally, but not of any marked character—there was no injury to the bone of the skull—on taking off the skull-cap, the whole of the vessels of the brain were highly congested—on the top of the brain there was a deposit of lymph, showing that inflammatory action had set up—the vessels of the brain generally were in a congested state—the brain itself showed red spots in the substance of the brain, there was blood in the ventricles, and at the base of the brain; all the vessels were considerably congested with blood—we found a clot of blood on the right side of the neck, two of the muscles of the neck were lacerated, one completely, and the other two-thirds or three-quarters of the substance—they were muscles pro<lb/>ceeding from the breast-bone to the throat—they were torn—one was torn completely across—the jaw-bone was fractured completely through, to the left of the chin-bone—very great violence indeed must have been used to fracture the jaw and lacerate the muscles—I have been in court, and saw one of the witnesses describe the position in which the deceased was when he was struck an up-blow in the jaw—I should expect such a blow would produce the injuries that I saw, especially if there was a resistance at the back of the head, so as to prevent the head from going back—I think the same cause of violence would also produce the effect on the brain that I found—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, and an effusion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090095"/>
               <p>into the ventricles—the fracture of the jaw and the laceration of the muscles had nothing to do with the cause of death—the mischief at the brain was the cause of death—I attribute it to the inflammatory action set up, and the effusion into the ventricles—I think the blow which fractured the jaw would produce such a bruise at the brain, that as a result there would be inflammatory action set up there, which would terminate in effu<lb/>sion and death—I found no other cause of death.</p>

I am a tin<lb/>plate worker, and live at 7, Victory Place, Wall Street, Bermondsey—on Saturday night, 7th June last, I was going home—whilst passing under the railway arch in Bermondsey Street I was suddenly prounced upon by three men—they forced me against the wall, tore away my watch, and threw me down heavily on the pavement—I became partly unconscious from the violence with which they threw me down—I believe the prisoner was one of the men, but I can't swear posi<lb/>tively to him—from the time I had to look at him I should say he was the man—I only caught a very transitory view of his face—I couldn't see the features of any of them—when I recovered myself I found the. watch was gone—the chain was hanging on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Radnor Street, St. Luke's, and am in the employment of the Mint—on Thursday morning, 3rd May, about half-past seven or a quarter to eight, I went, with Inspector Dann, Inspector Bran-nan, and many other officers, to No. 3, Little Queen Street, Camberwell—we forced open the door of the house—it consists of two rooms, one above the other, with a kitchen at the back—we proceeded upstairs, and in the first floor found two moulds for making florins, five double moulds for making shillings, and one treble mould for making sixpences—on the mantelshelf stood a good florin and two good shillings, fifteen counterfeit shillings, and two counterfeit sixpences—the shillings corresponded, in date with the mould and with the two good shillings, which I believe the impressions were taken from—the mould also corresponded in date with the good florin, one of the sixpences also corresponded in date with the mould, and one I believe was cast in the same mould that was found in another house where a large seizure was made that morning—in the room I found several tin bands for making moulds, and iron clams for holding the moulds when the metal is poured in in a state of fusion—in the cupboard I found two galvanic batteries charged, containing acid much diluted, with these wires, bent as they appear now, to hold the mould at each side, some plaster of Paris, and some powder, a file, with white metal in its teeth, and all the necessary implements for making and coating counterfeit coin—in the back kitchen there was a middling-sized copper, full of broken plaster of Paris moulds, a glass with plaster of Paris adhering to it, and a box con<lb/>taining a small quantity of quicksilver, which is used in the process of coating—we took possession of the articles, and came away, leaving persons to watch the house—on the morning of 20th June, a little before eight, I accompanied Inspector Fyfe, with another officer, and placed myself in a position to command a view of Bowman's Buildings, Aldersgate Street—I saw the male prisoner come from the court, accompanied by another man—I pointed him out to Serjeant Elliott, who took him into custody—I said to him, "Well, Mr. Williams, we visited your house, 3, Little Queen Street, Camberwell, on 3rd of last month—you have not been there"—he said, "I never lived there, I was never there in my life, nor do I know where Camberwell is"—I said, "Quite a stranger, Mr. Williams. Where do you live?" He said, "I have no fixed residence"—I asked the man who was with him where he lived—he said, he worked for Mr. Brock, and lived at 41, Snow Hill—he did live there—I knew him to be a working man—I went there, accompanied by Fyfe, and saw the female prisoner—she was taken into custody—I called her by the name. of Williams, and</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High Street, Putney—at the time of this accident I lived at No. 2, College Street—on Monday night, 21st May, I got home about half-past seven—eight o'clock was the time to go in, appointed by me and my wife—I went in company with my wife and a broker—we all three went in together—the broker was to buy the things—there had been some disagreement between me and my wife—we had a mutual consent to sell the things—I consented to sell the goods and give her half the money, and separate, and for me to allow her a maintenance—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186607090101"/>
               <p>I only sold part of the things to the broker—after they were sold it was very nearly eleven o'clock, or a little after, I could not say to a quarter of an hour—I saw my wife go up Wandsworth Lane towards Putney, and I thought I would go home and have a doze with my clothes on, which I did—we were to separate on that night—I was at the street-door—she went one way and I another—the street-door was locked, and the landlord opened it—I got into my room by entering the window, as the door was locked, and my wife had the key—when I got into the room I laid down and went to sleep, for I was very tired—I had worked very hard all day—when I awoke I found my left hand tied above my head to the head of the bed-stead, and my right hand to the foot, and the rope passed across my bed, and my throat cut—I awoke by the feel of the cut, and the blood coming out of it profusely—it was perfectly dark, there was no light in the room—I heard my wife say, using a foul word, "I will see if you will go away from me," and she gave me another cut—I was entirely in her power—I then got my feet disentangled, and got them on the floor, and I promised her I would not go away—I felt something, I do not know whether it was a razor or a knife, in her hand, but I felt something cut my throat—she then loosened my right hand from the rope, and I got loose, opened the door, and went out into the street—she followed me—she said she hoped I would not transport her; she would attend to my throat herself, and say nothing about it—I told her I was going to the doctor's, but I made my way to the police-court—she helped me part of the way—I fell down, and I know nothing more till I got to the station.</p>

For some time past my husband has been in the habit of ill-treating me, and saying terms towards me that I never deserved. He commenced again last night, and I could not stand it any longer, and I committed the act"—I asked her what she had done it with, and she said, "With his razor"—I asked her where it was—she said, "On the top of the dressing-table in our bedroom"—Inspector Usher came in at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in New Park Street, South-wark—I was in Dover Street with Rich about a quarter-past eleven on the night of the 1st June—I saw Jones snatch a watch from the prosecutor's pocket—it was done in half a second—as soon as he snatched it he ran down Napier Street about twenty yards—I ran after him—he fell down, and I fell over him—he got up again and ran five or six yards—I caught him again, and while I was struggling with him Leary came up and gave me a violent blow in the face, which knocked me down, and he then kicked me—when I got up Reeves came to my assistance and helped me get</p>

               <p>Jones out of Napier Street—he was wanting to get into Kent Street, and I had hard work to hold him from there—he struggled to get away—with Reeves's assistance I succeeded in holding him, and gave him into custody—I did not see what became of Leary—I can swear he was the person who was with Jones.</p>

Q.</hi> Where had you been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To see some friends at Peckham—I had had very little to drink—I was going home—I was about three yards from the prosecutor when the prisoners came up—I saw Jones's face so distinctly that I can swear to him—they snatched the watch, turned about, showed their faces, and ran off—I was not above a yard from Jones as I was following him—my companion went after Leary—I saw Leary's face, and am certain of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live in Albany Street, Old Kent Road—on the night of the 1 st July, about half-past eleven, I was in Dover Street with my wife going home—I heard a female cry, "Stop thief! my husband has lost his watch"—I then saw a man in a white smock stop the prosecutor—I cannot swear to either of the prisoners—I went round the corner into Napier Street—I ran round and saw Wybrow on the ground with Jones—I seized hold of Jones—he was struggling very violently, kicking and punching as hard as he could at everybody—I saw the watch on the ground—he fell on to the ground again, when we seized hold of him, and, in so doing, he managed to take up the watch from the ground, and I then left go of his collar, and seized hold of his hand with the watch in it, and his fingers and mine met on the watch—I struggled with him with the watch in his hand for full ten minutes—I then received a severe kick, which caused me to take away my hand, Leary said, "Get up mate," and, in so doing, the watch left—he then got up and said, "I have not got the watch"—I did not see the watch in Leary's hand, but I will swear it was in Jones's hand when Leary took hold of it—I then took hold of Jones and struggled with him, and gave him to the sergeant—I held him by one arm along Blackman Street until we met another constable.</p>

I am a basket maker, and live in Colt Street, Great Dover Road—I was returning home on this night, and saw the prosecutor—I saw Leary take the watch from Jones, and pass it to a woman—I followed her to the bottom of Napier Street, when she dis<lb/>appeared among the crowd—I went after her, but could not catch her—I afterwards returned to Dover Street, and the scuffle was still going on—I am quite sure Leary is the person who took the watch from Jones.</p>
