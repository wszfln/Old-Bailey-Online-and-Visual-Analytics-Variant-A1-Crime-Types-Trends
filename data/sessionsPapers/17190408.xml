Another deposed, that he told the Deceased if he would be Friends with Pitmore, he would spend half a Crown upon him; that he reply'd, No, G - d D - n him, I'll not be reconcil'd for he is a Rogue.

That Smith set Holiday, Williams and Cheshire to rob the Bristol Male, and that Mrs. Holiday going to Smith's House in Black-Horse-Alley near Fleet-Bridge to inquire after her Husband betimes that Morning, he came while she was there and said to Smith, we have done it; who reply'd, Have you by G - d? That she went with Smith to the House where the Letters were forting; that he told them they must separate their Horses or they'd betray 'em. that being desired to go up and help them he refused, whereupon one of them said G - d - d - n him, now he has set us on and drawn us in, he will betray us. The Counsel would have called many more Witnesses to have proved the Matter against Smith. But there having before been a Great deal of time spent in hearing the Counsel on both sides, the Court would not let them, saying there was no Occasion; and that it plainly appeared that Carrent had a very just and probable Cause for prosecuting the said Smith on the former Indictment of abetting, consulting and procuring Williams,&amp;c. to rob the Bristol Male.
