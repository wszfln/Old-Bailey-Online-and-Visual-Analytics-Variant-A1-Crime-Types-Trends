I live at 24, Windsor Terrace, City Road, and am a tailor—on Saturday, 28th December, I went to rest about 1 o'clock in the morning, leaving the house locked securely up—I secured the lower part of the house myself; the windows were fast and the area door bolted—my attention was called by a lady in the first floor front knocking at my door—I went down stairs, opened the area door, and let the policeman in who was knocking—we went into the back kitchen, and saw the prisoner stand<lb/>ing in the middle of the back kitchen with two chemises, a pair of drawers, and a shirt on his body—these are the things—the two chemises were on his body over his shirt—he had no coat on—three panes of glass were broken in the area window, and a Christmas tree had been shifted from the window sill—the hole would enable a person to get his hand in and open the window—it had been secure when I went to bed—the policeman took the prisoner into custody—he said, "What brought you here?"—the prisoner said, "I don't know"—the things were hanging on the horse the night before—I think he was sober—I did not know him.</p>

I am house-physician at Westminster Hospital—on 22nd December, about 12.30, I examined Harris, and found him suffering from a tri-radiate wound on the forehead—it was tolerably severe—it went to the bone—it was done by a blunt instrument—I do not think it could be done with a leather apron—it would require considerable force to make it.</p>

Harris came to me in the Horse-ferry Road, with blood running down his cheeks from a wound in his head—he took his hat off to show it to me—I went after the prisoner, and just as I was going up stairs a man shut the door in my face, and immediately afterwards the prisoner lifted up the window with a poker in his hand and said, "You b----, if you attempt to come here I will knock your b----y brains out with this""—I said, "It is not your poker that frightens me"—I tried to get in, but could not—he said, "I shan't come down"—I said, "I don't suppose you will"—I saw Davis standing at the top of the street, and sent for him—I advised the prosecutor to go to the hospital, and went back to where the prisoner was—there was blood near the gateway—he lives over the gateway.</p>

Gold &amp; Co., have premises; they divide the premises between them—I subsequently took Barker into custody, and Aslin, who was the person who had the control of the granary—they were both tried and convicted here—after taking Barker I went to Hyams—I found him in Messrs. Gold's stables; he was doing up the stables—I asked him if there was a man named Barker there—he said "Yes"—I asked him if he had given him any oats this afternoon to take to Messrs. Gold's—he said "No"—I asked was he aware that he took any oats—he said "No"—I told him that Barker was in custody for the unlawful possession of corn, and that Barker had told me he got it from him—he said he knew nothing about it—I never saw him after that—I don't remember saying anything to him about coming to the Mansion House—he did not come to the Mansion House—I was not able to find him afterwards—I went in search of him, but I never saw him again till he was taken into custody recently.</p>

Rathbone's granary—there is a wooden partition between them in the loft, consisting of single boards—on examining them I found that a board had been sawn through, so that it could be removed and replaced, leaving an aperture big enough for a sack of corn or a man to pass through, and when that board was replaced there was some dirt and dust and cobwebs put over the crease, so as to conceal it—the corn was in Messrs. Rathbone's place, directly on the other side of that board—I had a warrant for the prisoner's apprehension, but I was unable to execute it—I could not find him.</p>

I live at 2, Upper Tachbrook Street, Pimlico, and am a doctor of medicine—on Tuesday, 24th December, I saw the prosecutor about 11.15 or 11.20 in the morning—he sent for me—I found him suffering from four incised wounds; one on the front of the shoulder bone, one on the top of the shoulder, one a little lower down, on the upper arm; the last was lower down, considerably outside the arm—the first-mentioned wound was the most dangerous, it struck the shoulder bone—I did not probe it, because I could see the bone; it cut into the bene—the lowest wound was the deepest, the other two were merely superficial—there was a considerable loss of blood—if the first wound had been a little lower down it would have penetrated the lungs—I should say the wounds were inflicted by such an instrument as this knife—from the position of the wounds, I should judge they were not self-inflicted, nor likely to have been received in a struggle to get possession of a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner's hand on 27th December—there was a wide open wound on the back of it—I can't say whether that would be caused in a struggle—I don't believe the wounds the man had could have been accidentally caused—the blows must have been given direct—the wound furthest from the front was as far back as you can reach, a little above the tibia, it was a cut in and downwards.</p>

I had a pair of old blue trousers and some hats, boots, and a piece of old sacking, and I seem to have put on this young man's socks instead of my own, which are exactly like them, and my own were left under the bed, so that there was no necessity for me to take them. The policeman ought to have taken the bundle from me, and then if they had been stolen they could have proved it. He selected various articles from the room, and said, "He had these, and he had these," when it was entirely impossible for him to tell what I had. I have been in the army thirteen or fourteen years, and have held situations of trust, and paid the troops, and never was charged with dishonesty. I had simply my own things.</p>

I am house-surgeon at King's College Hospital—the deceased was brought there on the 7th—his breath smelt of spirits—there were nine scalp wounds on the left side of his head, some of which com municated with one another—they could not be the result of one blow, they must have been the result of many blows—one wound ran into another—there were six different fractures of the skull, which must have been the result of at least six different blows—there was a wound over the left ear and a cut over the left eye—they were all on the left side, except a cut on the right thumb—two blows would have made the wounds over the left ear and eye—they were all clean cuts—there were nine scalp wounds visible—I did not remove the scalp to see them—he got worse in the evening, and the visiting surgeon removed some pieces of bone that were pressing on the brain—this was on the 10th—he lingered till the 13th and died—I made a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I have been his wife twenty one years, and the mother of his eight children. I have been a very good mother, but I am sorry to say my husband behaved a very great brute and a very great drunkard to me. I had to take my child in my arms and go in the street of a night from him. I have been always in and out of the workhouse with them. My husband turned me out, and kept me in the streets. This last accident that took place he was all the week drinking, and he left his work. He drew the last of his money on the Wednesday, and came home that evening drunk, and in a very bad temper. He asked for some dinner, and I gave it him. He seemed all the evening in a very bad temper. I tried to amuse him all I could. Between 5 and 6 o'clock a man named Dwyer came and asked my husband to assist him with some pota toes into his cellar. My husband was sitting by the fire drunk. He turned round and said, "What brought Dwyer up here?" I said, "He came for your assistance with some potatoes. "My husband said, "No, he did not;" and he said he came for a very bad purpose. Many words passed between us, and he got up and beat me round the head. I cried out very loud, but no one came to me. He kicked me with his naked feet; then he dressed himself and went out. I went out afterwards, and I went and told Dwyer what my husband had said. I did not go into my room again except when my husband was out. He was all the week drunk up to Saturday; he lay in bed with his clothes on. On the Sunday morning he took a lamp and other things to sell. He did not come home till late. He got up early on Mon day morning, and said he would not be home till late; he came home in the evening between 6 and 7 o'clock, and I left the room I was with my children all day. He worked on till Friday night, five days of the week. He came home on Friday about 9 at night; I went out, and a little time afterwards my husband went to the public-house; my third son followed him there, and asked for some money to get bread. After that my husband sent a child to me for two pawn-tickets, and I sent them to him He went up stairs to Kay's room and sent for drink, and he remained there till the public-houses were shut I called my children at 5.30 on Saturday morning to go to their work; my husband was in the room in bed, and I was afraid to go in. Between 10 and 11 o'clock on Saturday morning I saw my hus band washing himself in the room; he sent the boy for some coals; he gave him no money for bread. When my husband went out I went up to the room. After that I went to look for my husband, and I found him in the Yacht public-house having rum and water. I went next to Twyman's, in Wild Street, and there I saw him sitting down with the woman Twyman. I asked him if that was the way he was going to treat me; he laughed at me, and got up and took me to Callaghan's. Six months ago he took this woman up to my room and sent my children out. After leaving Callaghan's we went home, and my husband lay on the bed in his things. I sat down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187301130030"/>
               <p>and went to sleep; when I awoke it was dark. I went to the room where my husband was, and he beat me round the head. I got from him and went to Bow Street police-station and saw the inspector, and asked him to send for my husband; he took no notice, and I went back. My husband said, "You have been to Bow Street, as usual, and I'll give you cause to go there. "He drew me from the door towards the fender: this chopper was against the fender. He said, "I'll do for you now;" he picked the chopper up. I threw myself on his arm, and I wrenched the chopper out of his hand. He dragged me towards the door, and I hit him twice on the head. I saw him bleeding, and I went to Mr. Beale's, the deputy's, place. I gave my husband a month's imprisonment about eight months ago."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brick-maker, and live in Brickfield Cottages, Hendon—Thomas Prince, the deceased, lived next door to me—the prisoner lodged in my house, and on 28th December, before 10 o'clock, he was there—I had requested him to leave my house for a reason, and I accompanied him to the door, and saw Prince come by with a mug with a litte beer in it which he had taken in for Christmas—Prince said "Go to work Holling shed"—he said "What has that to do with you?"—they had a little bit of a scuffle and a fight—the prisoner hit Prince, but I cannot say where, it was nothing of a blow—he struck at him—the beer was knocked out of his hand, and then they had the fight, and Prince hit Hollingshed very heavily several times—there was a struggle between them, and Prince caught hold of the prisoner and threw him very heavily—they fell twice, and the prisoner was underneath each time—as soon as they got up Prince went into his own house.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at Hendon—the deceased's brother called on me, and told me that he had retention of urine, and wanted something for him—I did not see the deceased, but my partner saw him next morning—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he had suffered from severe <hi rend="italic">peri tonitis</hi>, caused by a rupture of the bowel on the right side, from which faecal</p>

               <p>matter had exuded—in the case of such a rupture forty-eight hours generally passes before death—it might have occurred from a severe blow, or from the man falling on some prominent point, such as the knee of the other man, if the bowel was in a state of distension at the time—he was in other respects healthy—the <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi> was occasioned by the rupture of the bowel, it was set up as a consequence of the rupture—the faecal matter being exuded, would set up <hi rend="italic">peritonitis</hi>, and the man would die in about forty-eight hours.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I attended the deceased on Sunday, the 29th—I found him in a state of partial collapse—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem—peritonitis</hi> was the cause of death, and that was caused by the extrusion of the contents of the bowels—that was quite recent, and must have been caused by some sudden blow—it could not have been the result of disease, as the viscera were healthy, and there was no indication of chronic disease—it might possibly be caused by a struggle, and falling on the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I suppose it must have been either by a blow, or a kick, or a fall. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or the man's body must have been in a state of tension at the moment he fell on some prominent object—there is nothing to show that it was not done by a kick, and it is quite consistent—it is consistent with either—the probability is that it was not from a kick, because there was no external mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could it have occurred from throwing a man down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think it possible—it could not have occurred in a mere struggle unless there was some projection—there must have been two factors; the man's body must have been in a state of tension, and there must have been some projecting object, such as the knee or some projecting stone on the floor; I do not think it could have been done by merely throwing—I understand that the prisoner was underneath and the deceased on the top, therefore it would be more likely for the knee to have done it—I think it quite possible that death might be produced in a struggle—whether the deceased was under or above would be quite immaterial; both those positions would be consistent with death being produced in the struggle.</p>

It was stated that the complainant is the sole executrix of the will of Thomas Baylis, the deceased father of the parties, and in connection with this fact the offences charged were alleged to have been committed. Mr. Farquhar, of Abergavenny, instructed by Messrs. Buckler, Millard, and Cayley, of London, appeared for the complainant, and the defendants were also represented by a solicitor. The evidence went to show that the defendants broke fifteen panes of glass in the windows of complainant's house, thus effecting an entry, and then committed the assault complained of, which resulted in the complainant having a black eye, scratched face, and broken tooth. Attempts were made on the part of the defendants to settle the matter privately, but these were positively declined by the complainant, and the Magistrates convicted the defendants and levied a fine, which was paid by Mr. Powell, the husband of one of the defendants, who was present in court during the trial.")—I was present at Abergavenny when my wife and Sarah Baylis were charged before the Magistrates—the Magistrates ordered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. damages to be paid for breaking the window, and he fined Sarah Baylis 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; at the same time he said he regretted very much that such a case was brought before them—there is not a word of truth in saying my wife was ever summoned for assault—there was no charge of assault against my wife, and no evidence given—I saw Mr. Burden, a pupil of defendant's, in court—the defendant is the brother-in-law of Mrs. Bebb, who was complainant in the summons at Abergavenny—MR. Burden was busy taking notes in Court—the defen<lb/>dant is a shorthand writer—I was present at the Clerkenwell Police Court when the prisoner was committed for trial—the defendant admitted that he was the author of the paragraph, and that he would take the entire responsibility of it upon himself—I withdrew the summons against Burden—MR. Baylis, my father-in-law, died in May—at that time Mrs. Bebb resided with me—my wife was living with me, and so was her sister, sarah Baylis—my attention has since been called to copies of the paper contain<lb/>ing the paragraph directed to other persons in my immediate neighbour<lb/>hood—I have seen copies with a black mark surrounding the paragraph.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 40, King's Road, Peck<lb/>ham—on 28th December, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was outside London Bridge Station, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling outside the Turkish Bath—the prisoner made a bolt across to a new street—I seized him, and the police were called—I saw a ball in his hand, and corresponding balls to it on the prosecutor's chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a teacher of music at Percy Circus, Pen<lb/>tonville—on 28th December I was walking a little behind the prosecutor, who was going along in an inoffensive manner, and just by the Turkish Bath the prisoner seized him by the fez, and clutched his hair at the same time, and with the other hand he grasped at his chain and broke it—they closed and grappled, and rolled in the mud together—the prosecutor then seized the prisoner by the throat, and they went down again—I then got up to them, seized the prisoner by the collar, and Mr. Nash seized him on the other side—in a minute or two two policemen appeared, and we gave him in custody—the prosecutor wrenched his hand open, and a gold ball was found in it—he appeared to have been drinking, but not to excess—he knew perfectly well what he was about.</p>

"If you did not intend to rob him, how did you become possessed of this ball?—I found on him at the station a half<lb/>pint bottle of rum six rings. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a ticket for North Shields.</p>
