             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Public-office, Hatton-garden: I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday, the 22d of June, at his master's shop, as he was sitting at work on the shop-board; I searched him; he was very unwilling to have his left hand breeches pocket searched; I directed my brother officer to hold his hands while I searched him, and pulled out this key; it is the key of his master's door, as I understand; he used to have one, and his master the other; I asked him what he had got else; he said, nothing else material to me; I put my hand into the same pocket, and there I found the scutcheon belonging to the door that had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of that scutcheon? - A. Yes, he said he picked it up against the door as he came in on the morning, or some part of the day, I cannot take upon me to say exactly; I searched him the same day; he said he picked it up, and I think it was the morning; I found a little key in the same pocket; I asked him how he came by that key; he said it was a trifling thing, I might throw it away, he had picked it up in the street at the same time; I told him I would not throw it away, it might be of service hereafter; I took him into custody; he told me he lodged with his mother, I think the place is called Ship-yard; I went there with him, and enquired of the mother if he lodged there; the mother said, yes, he did; I thought he did not from some circumstance that occurred; I searched the house, and found nothing there; I then took him to the Office, and he was committed for re-examination on Wednesday. On Tuesday morning, I received information from the prosecutor and another witness that there was a box at a house in Great Shire-lane belonging to the prisoner; I went there, and saw it, at No. 14 I believe; I tried this small key I had found on him, and it fitted the lock of this box, and all these things were in the box; the prosecutor and Stantiford were present with me; and as a convincing proof that this box belonged to the prisoner, I have had him in custody before, and the master agreed that he should be sent on board the Tender, and the master, instead of doing what was proper, kept the indentures; he should have cancelled them; and here is his discharge from on board of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the house where you made this search? - A. I do not know the person's name, it is a chandler's shop; the woman behaved very civil indeed; she shewed me the box, and said, if she had known that he was such a kind of a person, he should not have come there to lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a lock has that box? - A. It appears to be a common one by the key, it is very strong.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Look at these articles, and see which is your's - do you know these articles? - A. The clothes and boots were in my possession; the clothes I swear to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Lake.) Look at these boots? - A. I can take my oath they are Mr. Hookamfreer's property, I was to take them to the Minories to be stretched; I am servant to Mr. Fraser, but my sister-in-law and brother live with Mr. Hookamfreer; the boots are perfectly new, and his name is inside of them, and there is not one boot in a hundred that has such a strap, it is a brown webb strap; they generally have a white one, but this was made for strength, as I was informed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that you left them at Mr. Wells's shop? - A. I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is my first crime that I have committed, and I hope you will have a little mercy.</p>

I produce the saws, I have had them in my possession ever since. (The saws identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Court. Q. At what time on Saturday night? - A. About eleven o'clock when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you number the guineas? - A. From one, two, so on regularly to sixteen; the first eight I put in a purse, and the other eight loose in the drawer, on Saturday the eighth of June.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That was last Saturday month? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any other gentleman an accompting-house adjoining that parlour? - A. Mr. Turner; it is separated by a partition only.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a clerk of the name of Tagg? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire Mr. Tagg to take a view of what was doing in your accompting-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person, by making a hole in that partition, see what was doing in your parlour? - A. Yes, the back of the person would be towards the hole, if they were doing any thing at the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. The drawers were on the opposite side from that hole? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon the next morning did you receive any information that induced you to come down stairs? - A. About a quarter before eight on the Sunday morning.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Turner, of 'Change-alley? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information from Mr. Blake, did you look through any hole? - A. Yes; previous to that I heard this young man come to Mr. Blake's door, it was then about a quarter before eight; I was standing behind the wainscot of the shop, in Mr. Turner's accompting-house, and heard the prisoner ask for John Row, the apprentice of Mr. Blake's; the boy answered that he was up stairs; the prisoner at the bar desired him to call him, he said he wanted to speak to him; I heard the lad go up stairs; then I immediately applied my eyes to the hole which we had prepared for the purpose of perceiving the prisoner's motions, which commanded a full view of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the prisoner do any thing? - A. I saw the prisoner in the parlour; I immediately applied my eye to the hole; he appeared to have come from the shop to the parlour at the moment I put my eye to the hole.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He could not have got into the parlour but by the shop? - A. No other way; I saw him take something out of his pocket (his back was towards me,) with that he got the drawer open, either by wrenching or picking, I do not know which; he took something out of the drawer, in doing which he dropped a paper that was in the drawer; he put something in his pocket; then he stooped, and picked up the paper, and replaced it in the drawer; then he immediately shut the drawer too, and returned momentarily into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think this took up? - A. I do not think it was more than five minutes, he went into the shop before the lad came down again; immediately upon the prisoner leaving the parlour, I went out of the accompting-house to meet the lad who called the apprentice, and sent that lad for a constable in a slow whisper; the boy went immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you speak to Mr. Blake's boy? - A. At the bottom of the stairs; there is a communication from my accompting-house to Mr. Blake's shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had Row come down by this time? - A. He had; the constable was some time before he came, I suppose near a quarter of an hour; the prisoner was at that time in conversation with Row. In consequence of the lad being so long gone, I was fearful; I went out, and met them; I told the constable the circumstance, and I came back to the house with the constable, the prisoner was then in the shop; the constable went in before me; I communicated to the constable what had happened; I saw him searched, he found nothing upon him; I said I saw him go to the drawer, and take something out, in the prisoner's hearing; upon which Mr. Blake replied, you saw him go to the drawer, did you - if you are pretty clear, I will go and see what he has taken out; Mr. Blake went immediately in the presence of the prisoner, the constable, and myself; he said he had taken five guineas only now, the time before he took four; the prisoner did not say any thing. The constable then said to the prisoner, it is of no use denying it, come here, I will strip you, for you must have money about you; the constable stripped him to his shirt, but found nothing upon him; the constable then looked round the counter, and found five guineas, and said, here are the guineas; they were upon the shop work-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their being found, what did the prisoner say? - A. He requested that Mr. Blake would not be hard or harsh, it was in a slow tone, I am not sure which; he did not say any thing more; but cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the five guineas? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that they were marked? - A. I did not, because it required a magnifying glass; I took down the numbers that were missing when Mr. Blake counted them; that was all that passed.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a City constable? - A. Yes: On Sunday, the 9th of June, I was sent for to Mr. Blake's; I went there, and found the prisoner at the bar in the shop talking with the apprentice, 
               <persName id="t18050710-3-person82">

            . The moment I went into the shop, he turned round, and said to the other apprentice, good morning, John, I will bid you good by; I said, stop, you are not going yet; I took him by the arm, and turned him round towards the shop-board, and said, I must know what you have got; I waited a few moments before I searched him, till Mr. Blake came and gave me charge of him; I proceeded to search him, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched him, had you observed him to do any thing? - A. I observed him to go to his master's shop-board, and put his hand to a dirty cloth that was there; I did not hear any thing jink.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had searched him, did you go and look under that dirty cloth? - A. I did, and found five guineas there under the same dirty cloth which I had observed him put his hand on.</p>
               <p>Q. You took possession of them - have you kept them ever since? - A. I have; they were examined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100007"/>in the prisoner's presence; he did not say any thing all the time he was there till I was going to take him to the Compter; he begged for mercy of his master; I produce the five guineas, they are the same; I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>


               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) You have examined those five guineas with the magnifying glass? - A. Yes; there are three of them visible without a magnifying glass on, No. 8, 5, and 15.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What age is this young man? - A. I believe now he is near twenty-two.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the person that pays the rent for this house? - A. I am the householder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the constable coming into the shop, I immediately bid my fellow-apprentice good morning, on account, as I thought, that the constable was come on business; he immediately said, you cannot go; he turned round to me, and said, I shall want you, let me see what you have got in your pocket; I said, you are very welcome to see what I have got in my pocket; he took from my side pocket a pocket-book, which contained the copy of my freedom; he went to the shop-board to look over the pocket-book; I then followed him to the shop-board, and said, be so good as to take care of the things that are in there; O yes, said he, they shall be taken care of. By that time Mr. Blake came down stairs, and after he came to the place where I stood, Mr. Tagg said that he saw me go to the drawer; the constable turned round to my master, and said, I have searched him, and he has got nothing in his pockets; then he said I must strip myself; immediately I pulled off my clothes, one by one, and stripped myself properly; he searched my clothes, and found nothing upon me; he said to Mr. Blake, there is nothing upon him; Mr. Tagg said, I do not care what there is upon him, he has got it; then they searched about the shop, and in the course of a little time they found the money on the shop-board, near the place where Mr. Blake was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch; I described it before I saw it; I know it to be mine, I bought it the same day; the hour-hand is broke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming through the Strand, just by the back of the New-church: this man passed me, and put his hand on my shoulder, and asked me where I was going; I told him I was going home; he told me I should go with him to his rendezvous; he pushed me up a court; I had told him I would not go up the court; he told me he would give me his watch if I would, and he did. On Sunday morning, I was going up Oxford-street, I had the watch in my hand, and a gentleman said that I had stole the watch; he immediately charged me with a constable, and they took me on suspicion; I kept the watch, and never offered to make away with it; I said to the serjeant, when he came to me at the watch-house, I have got your watch.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Were you perfectly sober? - A. I had been drinking a little liquor I do not deny.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you were in such a situation that you could not feel it taken - how long had you been up the court with her? - A. Not above five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the chest locked? - A. Yes, and the money was in a bag in that chest; there were thirteen guineas and a half, seventeen dollars, and a great many new shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you found the chest broke open? - A. Between five and six o'clock on Friday evening, the 24th of May; about three o'clock on that day, she asked me to let her go to her mother's and fetch a bundle; I gave her leave, and told her not to be long gone; while she was gone, I had occasion to go up into that room where she slept: I could not find the key of that room any where; I went into my own room, and I saw her unlock that door with a bundle in her apron; in consequence of information from my niece, I went into the room immediately; I saw the screws of the lock of the chest had been forced; I opened the chest and looked at the bag which contained my money: I found the string put carelessly round the bag, but not tied in the manner which I used to do; as soon as I opened the bag, I knew something had been taken out, I missed ten guineas, two English crowns, two Spanish dollars not stamped, and several shillings and sixpences; I cannot tell how many; I locked the door, and came down stairs, and went after an officer; I came back again and could not get one; as soon as she found that I had discovered the robbery, she went to the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she discovered it? - A. She seemed very much frightened and was going away without having any tea, and I suspected she was going to her mother, as she put down the pots she was washing of, and went out; I followed her as far as Mr. Whitbread's brewhouse, Chiswell-street; I told her to stop; she asked me what I wanted; I told her, I would tell her when she came back; I told her I had been robbed; she told me, she knew nothing at all about it; at seven o'clock, Mr. Ray, the officer came, he searched her, but found nothing on her that belonged to me; he took her into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. The box which contained this money was in the prisoner's bed-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the key kept? - A. In the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not they get the key as well as this girl? - A. If they came into the bar they could; I did not let any of them come into the bar.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am assistant to Mr. Ravenhill, linen-draper, Beech-street, Barbican.</p>

I know them very well by sight; they both came to Mr. Ravenhill's shop, on the 24th of May, in the afternoon, to purchase some check gingham for a gown and a shawl; the younger one paid me for them, she gave me a guinea and I gave her a shilling; they came to twenty shillings exactly.</p>

On the 24th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, they both came in together to take out articles of wearing apparel, which chiefly belonged to the mother, to the amount of about two pounds, the mother gave me a guinea in gold, two Spanish dollars, a seven-shilling piece, and the rest in shillings and sixpences; they tried to pay me without the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the change that they offered to give you? - A. The mother said she had new shillings and sixpences; there appeared to be four or five new shillings and sixpences together with other silver, but she had not enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles pledged? - A. A gown, a petticoat, and a shift, which I returned to them.</p>

               <p>Q. How did it appear to have been broken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100009"/>open? - A. By a small chisel, or something of that kind, or a turnscrew.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) After they were in custody had you any opportunity of hearing any conversation between them? - A. I had; Mr. Ray took me up to where they were to hearken to their discourse in the Irish language; I understand that language, they could not see me; I saw the mother once; she said to the daughter, I hope you have not owned any thing; the daughter answered, no; that is right, said the mother, stick to what I told you; the daughter said to the mother, have they found any thing upon you; the mother answered, no, they have only found half a crown; if you do not stick to what I told you, they will hang us both; the daughter asked the mother where the rest of the money was; the mother answered, never mind, they have only found half a crown, the rest is safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about any boy? - A. Yes; the daughter said to the mother, I told you to put those other things away, they will hurt that poor boy; the mother said do not tell where he lives, they cannot hurt him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. Why all this conversation might have related to any other money as well as your's? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that it was your money that they were talking about? - A. I cannot; she was in custody at this time, and it was after her examination.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutrix.) Look at that bed-gown? - A. It is my little girl's.</p>

After I had took hold of the prisoner, I touched Mr. Stennett on the shoulder, and asked him if he had lost a handkerchief; he put his hand in his pocket, and replied he had; I produce the handkerchief. (The handkerchief identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

I did not like him to go down into the kitchen by himself; I looked in the shop, and found his two hats, he had gone out without a hat; I went down stairs, I did not miss any thing; I did not miss the box till my wife came home; he took two razors with him that were not in the box; his indentures were in the box; they were taken out of his breeches pocket when he was taken prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your property since? - A. Two gowns; the pawnbroker has got them; I found one razor out of the two.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. There was another woman that was with her that told me where to come to; I had been drinking with her all the evening; it is well known that nothing else than girls of the town live in the court.</p>

He said he was very sorry for what he had done; he wished me to let him go; I went and searched his box, and I found that letter which I have delivered to you.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What state was the padlock in when you saw it? - A. It had been knocked off the door, it was bruised at the side, as though it had been hit with a hammer; he got the padlock off by drawing the staple; the staple was put in again; I found the staple quite loose.</p>

She is a cousin of mine; her brother is a sheriff's officer, his name is Holmes; she had not been out two minutes when I saw this man standing with her; I sent that woman to a tailor with a pair of breeches, and when I came home she was behind me with the breeches in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your cousin appear against the prisoner on his examination? - A. She was at Guildhall, but she was not asked any questions.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you for some time past known the prisoner at the bar? - A. About a twelvemonth past.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he come to Messrs. Pengree and Grenfell for this last twelvemonth past? - A. Yes, he has been in the habit of coming there about four times a week.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To purchase copper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you remember his coming there on Saturday, the 15th of June? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing you had before observed, did you conceal yourself that day for the purpose of watching him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conceal yourself in a place where he did not see you? - A. It is possible that he might have seen my head.</p>
               <p>Q. You took good care he should not see you? - A. I did; I saw him go to the shelf upon which some copper was placed, and take as much as he could grasp in his hand, and put it underneath his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any person by to observe him at that time? - A. There was a man in the warehouse, he was employed; the prisoner's back was towards him; he was watching him as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person so employed that the prisoner had reason to believe he was not observing him at the time? - A. Yes; on perceiving this, I went and fetched a constable, his name is Cummins; when I came back with Cummins, the prisoner was in the warehouse; he had got four pounds of copper, which he had looked out by way of purchasing it; I gave charge of him to Cummins; I told him that I had seen him steal the copper, he had it then under his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable search him? - A. He did not give him leave; the prisoner directly put his hands under his waistcoat, and hauled out the copper; he appeared very much agitated; he said it was the first time, and begged that we would forgive him; the copper was put into the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not you at your desk in the warehouse at the time I came in? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. As to your attempting to say you concealed yourself is a falsity? - A. Immediately upon his entering the warehouse, I left it, and went into the place of concealment.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How did you conceal yourself? - A. On the top of the stairs leading to the floor above; I looked over.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is possible he might have seen you? - A. I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you any reason to think he had robbed you before? - A. I think he had.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a tender question to ask.</p>
               <p>- CUMMINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On Saturday, the 15th of June, were you sent by Garland to take the prisoner into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100013"/>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any thing out of his waistcoat? - A. Yes, that copper; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Garland.) Are these the pieces of copper you saw him put under his waistcoat? - A. These are the pieces of copper that he put under his waistcoat; they are saucepan bottoms, they are worth twenty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. They are the property of Messrs. Pengree and Grenfell? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in the habit of coming to that warehouse upwards of a twelvemonth; I have purchased a great many bottoms exactly as them, and amongst some of them are the bottoms that I have purchased.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Prove it - were they purchased that day? - A. No, that day I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard what the witnesses said - you were seen to take it, and put it under your waistcoat, and the constable saw you take it from under your waistcoat? - A.

               <p>Q. Is he a soldier? - A. Yes, I knew he was a soldier; on the 20th of June he was employed in cleaning windows and taking down the beds; in the evening, about eight o'clock, Mrs. Ireland took up his hat, which was lying on a secretary in the first floor, and found it was very heavy; she asked me whose hat it was; I said it was the prisoner's; the lining was drawn close up; I opened the lining, and found three pair of stockings contained in it. I then went out, and fetched a constable on purpose to search him, he was then cleaning the outside of the first floor windows; I took the constable up stairs, and called the prisoner, Voss, in; the first question I asked him was to inform me how the stockings came in his hat; he replied he did not know; I observed to him, they could not walk in, they must be put in by somebody or other; I called the constable to come forward, who was then standing on the stairs, to search him; I asked him if he had any thing else about him; he said, no; I saw the constable take the other stockings from him.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, and found three pair of stockings concealed in his hat crown; eight pair I took from him between his shirt and his skin, on the right side of him, and one pair I took from the waistband of his breeches; these are the dozen pair of stockings; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (Looking at the stockings.) They are ladies' stockings, they are my property, they have my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please you, my Lord - My mistress was one that liked a little liquor, and she sent me out several times of the day to get it; she wished me to treat; I told her it did not lay in my power to stand treat, I had a wife and child to support, I could not afford it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. To treat your mistress? - A. Yes, I went out several times in the day to get liquor for her; she told me if I liked to take some stockings to pledge I might; she told me to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bid you to put them in your hat? - A. No, I was to take them unknown to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness to prove that - have you any witnesses of any kind? - A. I can get witnesses where I fetched the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you ever pledge any stockings before for her for liquor? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Turner. On searching him, I found two shillings in halfpence in his pocket, which he said his mistress gave him; his mistress had paid him that, it was his day's wages, he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What had he to say for himself? - A. He never made that defence at the time, nor did he call his mistress; in taking him to the Compter, he attempted to make his escape from me in Newgate-street.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing of this woman? - A. I never saw her before she was brought to Bow-street; on the 30th, I think, I went to Bow-street; on the 25th day of June, very near five in the afternoon, I was coming up stairs to my chambers in the <placeName id="t18050710-12-crimeloc78">Temple</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was that? - A. I think it must be taken near half past four in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at it - Do you know it to be your's? - A. I have not the least doubt of all the articles; my name is on the tea-tongs, the spoon, and the cream-pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through Covent-garden market, I met with a young man; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him, I did not care; I walked on a little, while he felt in his pocket, and said, he had no money; he pulled out a spoon, and I went and pledged it; he said, it was the third spoon he had pledged that day; we walked on a great way, and he took this milk-pot out from under his jacket, and the sugar-tongs, he asked me to take them home, as he had got to go to Blackwall that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to conceal it between your legs? - A. The constable knew I had got no pockets, and I carried it in my hands a great way, and then I tied it to my garter.</p>

Yes, I had not been there many minutes, before the prisoner at the bar came in company with another man, the prisoner asked Mr. Capper's man, what answer to the bill; he informed him, that there was a gentleman, pointing to me, would inform him respecting the bill; I then addressed myself to the prisoner, and asked him how he came by the bill; he told me that he had it of the other person that was with him, I asked the other person how he had obtained it; he informed me, that he found it; I asked him if he found it singly; he answered me, no, he found it in a pocket-book, in Bow-common fields; he pulled these two books from his pocket together, which I produce.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the other man? - A. Yes; I then asked him, where the bills of exchange were; he told me, in the book; I turned round to look in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100016"/>the book, and he took the advantage of that, and whipped out of the shop in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go after him? - A. I went to the door after him, but quite lost sight of him; I saw him no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner was apprehended? - A. I came in and found the bill for 180 l. was wanting; I asked him what became of it; he told me that it was at Mr. Gray's, in Billiter-square; I asked him to go with me to Mr. Gray's; he consented very readily to go with me; he went with me then and I found the bill there; and Mr. Duce followed me with an officer, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. The other man that delivered the pocket-book ran out of the shop; I believe the reason why you did not take him was, that some of the Royal Family were going to the India-house, and he got into the crowd? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You then asked him where the other bill was, the 180 l. and he very readily told you, and he went with you to Mr. Gray's? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To the prosecutor.) That pocket-book that you lost was in your coat pocket? - A. Yes, and here are my letters in it, and this is a memorandum-book, they were both in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Jackson.) Look at that bill for 180 l. is that the bill? - A. This is the bill, I have no doubt of it; Mr. Blundell is the accepter of it; I believe it to be his hand-writing; it is signed

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I met a man, and he told me he had four bills; and he told me, he wanted to buy various articles, and he would give me something handsome for my trouble, if I would assist him in buying the articles that he wanted; I went first to Mr. Gray's, and next to Mr. Capper's; I did not know that the notes had been lost or stolen; and the last time I went to Mr. Capper's, the man was with me, he had the two other notes in his pocket-book, and he delivered them up to Mr. Capper's man; I have a large family, and I thought I should get something by it, perhaps a shilling in the pound, or so on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the chesnut gelding that stood in Brown's livery stables? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen that in the possession of the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he came to Messrs. Dallat frequently with it; I believe it to be the same horse. The first time that I saw the horse was in the beginning of April or May, I think it is about a twelvemonth back; he used to come to our house with it in a cart to buy goods there; I noticed to him that he had a good horse; his mane was not hogged then, but he had a short tail the first time I saw him; he said he had bought it cheap, for he had given only ten pounds for it; he said he should alter the horse, he did not like to be much about with him for fear of being known; whether it was on account of his being a private soap-maker, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the horse which you saw in his cart is the same horse that you saw at Mr. Brown's? - A. I have every reason to think so from his general appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Dallat, they live at Putney? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. They had a manufactory in Back-lane, Clapham? - A. Not as a soap manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed there as clerk, or at Putney? - A. At Putney; Mrs. Dallat is a tallow-chandler, she has a manufactory in Back-lane, Clapham.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any seizure having been made of five hundred pounds weight of soap some little time ago? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the seizure was made was it that you charged the prisoner at the bar with stealing this horse - was not he taken up the very same day? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not know when he was taken up? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first attend the Police-office, in Worship-street? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day the seizure was made? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not recollect? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you do not recollect your taking up a man for horse-stealing - that is a remarkable occurrence, and you not to recollect the day? - A. I cannot tell the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when he was to be a witness, and attend at the Court of Exchequer as a witness? - A. I heard he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him there - look at this gentleman, do you not know him? (pointing to Mr. Bentley.) - A. Yes, I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you see that man and speak to him at the Court of Exchequer? - A. I do not recollect seeing him there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known the man a long time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been a long time in the service of Mr. Dallat? - A. I never knew him as a servant, I do not think he was a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a clerk to Mr. Dallat? - A. I believe near five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not know that he was employed in any capacity for the last year and a half? - A. I believe he was not, I have delivered goods to him.</p>
               <p>Q. A person carrying on a soap manufactory and a shop-keeper in the country, very frequently use carts and horses - Mr. Dallat has a cart? - A. Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know your master's handwriting? - A. I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Mr. Dallat is - is he in Putney now? - A. He has lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he is? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether that is his hand-writing? - A. That looks like his hand-writing, I take it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, sir, whether Mr. Dallat did instruct the prisoner at the bar to buy a horse for their use? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him pay fourteen pounds<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100018"/>for a horse which the prisoner said he had purchased for him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner used to be riding along the road with this horse in the cart? - A. Yes, I have seen him with this horse in the cart, I think, from April to June.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said that the prisoner told you he paid ten pounds for the horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Dr. Hayes - did not you ever tell him that he gave four pounds for the horse? - A. When I found that the horse was in the hands of Dr. Hayes, I said that Morgan told me that he gave ten pounds for the horse, and Jackson told me that he gave but four pounds; I believe that such a conversation passed between me and Mr. Brown, and there was a conversation passed between me and Dr. Hayes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to Mr. Brown that he gave four pounds? - A. I do not recollect but there might such a conversation pass between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to Mr. Brown, in whose possession the horse was found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Brown it was not the horse that was the object, but it was the getting the prisoner out of the way, who was to be a witness on the part of the Crown? - A. I do not recollect saying that; there was a discourse about the horse, he was charged with coming dishonestly by the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, whether the horse was not the object, but that you wanted to get this man out of the way, who was to be a witness for the Crown? - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect how long ago it is since you were at Mr. Brown's? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not say that? - A. No, because in conversation it might have passed, but I do not think that any such conversation passed between me and Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect that expression, that he was to be a witness for the Crown against Mr. Dallat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Brown at all? - A. On the 27th of last April, Mr. Dallat had a horse owned belonging to Mr. Heale, a quaker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go at all to Brown about this business? - A. Yes; Mr. Corder, a quaker, came, and said it was a stolen horse; we were summoned up to Worship-street to give evidence against Staples about that horse; Mr. Corder told us there were nineteen horses missing round Chelmsford, and counting over the horses he mentioned a horse like that which Morgan had; from that the inquiry was made, and it was proved to be the horse, and from that Morgan was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he apprehended at the instance of yourself and Mr. Dallat? - A. I believe Mr. Corder was the principal man at Springfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this horse being mentioned was merely accidental? - A. Yes; I was there upon another business concerning a horse that was stolen from Mrs. Dallat's.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you speak pretty near as to the time when you first saw that horse? - A. About February, 1804; he told me that he bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever employ you to work it in any way? - A. Yes, to cart with it, and he has often told me not to stop with it on the road, but to take care of the horse, and let nobody see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse in Brown's stables? - A. I saw the horse at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak with certainty that that is the same horse? - A. Yes, his mane was taken off, but I knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been employed by the prisoner, and you have frequently gone out with the horse and cart in the night-time, as well as the day? - A. Never but once at night, and that was with Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you your hire when you went out? - A. Morgan; I first took the place for half a guinea; he never paid me more than fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you would go to Mr. Dallat, and ask him if he did not allow the prisoner a guinea a week to pay you? - A. I am sure I never said that; Morgan paid me; I do not know who I was employed for; he employed me in Parson's Green-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that that place belonged to the Dallats - how often have you seen the Dallats there - were they not there two or three times in a day or night? - A. I never saw him there of a night, and whenever the Dallats came there I absconded.</p>

             sworn. - On Friday, the 21st of June, I, Bishop, and Vickery, executed this warrant on the prisoner; he was then at work at shoe-making, in King-street, Golden-square; we took him to the Office, and the horse was produced at the Office by Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Harris is wrong in what he says; he has worked in the place, and has gone backwards and forwards to Dallats' manufactory, so has Carpenter; Carpenter took the soap from the private works, and took it to Clapham; Carpenter was sent by Dallat to me, and shewed me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100019"/>the place, and he has gone in the road in the cart frequently. He says in the month of May the horse was brought to him, whereas I took it home to Mr. Dallat in the beginning of January to get my money which I paid Richards for it; Richards in the mean time went over to Dallat for the money, he being a man that Dallat had employed; he had bought horses for him before. I took the horse to Mr. Dallat; he said he would give me fourteen pounds to pay Richards; he met me at Richard's, and there he received the fourteen pounds; he gave a seven pound note, a two pound note, and a five pound note, to pay for the horse. At that time the horse was at work, and after the seizure took place I kept the horse for a matter of a fortnight; I asked Dallat what I was to do with this horse; I said, I have no money, I cannot keep the horse any longer, do you mean to keep it, or to sell it; he said cash was short, I might sell it; Staples came over to me, and said he had got a man to buy it, and he would bring him to me; I was out when Mr. Brown came, as Mr. Brown says; I took the horse to Mr. Brown, and there I sold him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Brown.) Q. Tell us what it was that Carpenter said to you (the witness that has been examined,) when he was speaking about the horse? - A. It was on Friday, the 14th of June, that Carpenter came along with another man; he went into my stable to see this chesnut gelding; he would have taken the horse out of the stable, saying it was a stolen horse, had it not been for my servant saying he was not at home; the next day three of them came, Mr. Carpenter, Mr. Corder, a quaker, and Mr. Dring.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Dring? - A. He is a tallow-chandler and dealer in soap; I had shifted the horse, thinking I would not give him up except they gave me a description of him; I understood from them that it was the quaker's brother that had lost the horse, and that he was a bay horse; I told them that description would not answer; they told me that I had no occasion to let them see the horse, for the horse was not the object, - that neither I nor Dr. Hayes should be any loser, or be disturbed, or to that purpose, for the person that I bought him of was Morgan, who was a principal evidence in the Court of Exchequer, and they believed that he had bought him of a man of the name of Richards for four pounds, who was implicated with the evidence in the Exchequer. This conversation was about the brown horse, and when I came to shew them this horse, it was not the horse that Morgan had in his possession; after that Mr. Corder found an owner for the horse, and it was from that partly that this horse was claimed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you attend as a witness last week at the Court of Exchequer? - A. I attended the Court of Exchequer by order of the Court of Excise, but not as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar there? - A. I did, he was attending as a witness.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was this? - A. On the 9th instant, the day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the witness, Carpenter, there? - A. I did, he was very near to him; the prisoner passed very near to him, twice I am certain of; the prisoner passed Carpenter in custody of the turnkey of this prison in his way to be locked up, where the witnesses are generally locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing whether they made any observations one with another? - A. It was my particular business to do that; I was to keep the witnesses apart by order of the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the witness took any notice of the prisoner? - A. I observed him to look very hard at the prisoner more than once or twice, and at his wife and children; I am certain that he saw him, he looked extremely hard at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me when the seizure of the soap was made at Clapham - was it before or after this man was taken up for horse-stealing? - A. Before the prisoner was taken up, I should imagine, four or five days.</p>

               <p>Q. You bought a horse of the witness, Brown, which turns out to be a stolen horse - do you recollect having any conversation with the witness, Carpenter, about the horse? - A. He told me that the horse was certainly stolen, that, in fact, Morgan had given him to understand so.</p>
               <p>Q. Morgan was not present at this time? - A. No; Mr. Brown was present; he said then that Morgan gave but four pounds for the horse; he added that I might judge from that whether the horse was honestly come by or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you that ten pounds were given for the horse? - A. No; Mr. Brown produced a receipt which was signed by Brown, shewing that he purchased the horse, and observed that it was a very hard thing to lose the money; Mr. Carpenter replied that neither Mr. Dallat, nor Mr. Corder (whom I afterwards saw, who is one of the people called quakers,) would desire Mr. Brown or me to be a sufferer, because Morgan was an important witness in a trial impending, and that it was material to remove him on account of his evidence; he afterwards said there had been an information laid against the Dallats.</p>
               <p>Q. He used the term in the plural number then - there had been an information against the Dallats? - A. Yes, and they were likely to be fined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100020"/>to a heavy amount; this is all that passed on that particular topic.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not mistake what passed, you are certain to the conversation? - A. I am certain of it, that he said, that Morgan gave four pounds for the horse, while we were in Worship-street.</p>

               <p>Q. You in consequence of that applied to Mr. Maslin, the owner? - A. I found the horse on the 13th of January, 1804; I went before the Magistrate and swore the horse to be my property, and in consequence of that the horse was restored to me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. I believe you are a coach-master at Chelsea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that passed between one of your servants and the prosecutor, he made a claim of a gelding that you had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you state to the Court how you came in possession of that gelding? - A. Mr. White, who keeps the White Horse inn at Chelsea, informed me that there was a brown gelding for sale, in the possession of Mr. Salmon, for trial.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a brown gelding in the indictment, and the other witness has stated it to be a bay gelding.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. The horse is a very old horse? A. Yes; I purchased the horse of the prisoner at the bar on the 5th of August, 1803.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you purchased it of the prisoner? - A. I am sure of it, I paid him the money myself, and had a receipt from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that receipt? - A. That is the receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner state to you when you purchased the horse? - A. He gave it a good character; he said it belonged to a person in the country, a friend of his, who was in the smuggling line, and the poor man was so unlucky, he was turned up. The same horse was sent to me for sale, which Mr. Salmon had on trial; it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100021"/>not suit him, he thought it would not be heavy enough for him in winter; the horse was sent down to my stable, and I agreed with Mr. Morgan for the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for it? - A. Seven guineas, and he gave me the receipt; I did not see him write it, he gave it me out of his own hand. After that I set the horse to work once a day; he never went into any other hands after I had him; I put him regularly to work, day after day, till owned by Mr. Ellis on the 13th of January, 1804.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that is the same horse that you bought of the prisoner? - A. I am sure it is the same horse.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner was afterwards taken up, and you appeared about this horse? - A. Yes, at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated there what you have stated today? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There was a man of the name of Salmon that had this horse - whose horse did he state it to be? - A. The prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. For sale; and the prisoner said he had it from a man that was turned up - The man that he bought it of was a man that was sent on board the hulks, did he not tell you so? - A. No, he did not say that, nothing of that passed.</p>

               <p>Q. This horse you worked from the time you got him to the time the owner owned him, half a dozen times a day, as business required? - A. No, only once a day.</p>
               <p>Q. He was always exposed on the road? - A. Always.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no concealment of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor? - A. I never knew him till he owned the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse was worked publicly in the road while you had him, so as to be seen by any body that passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to tell me that a brown horse is a bay horse? - A. There is a very little difference between a dark bay and a brown horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not a brown horse different from a bay horse? - A. A brown horse is merely similar to a dark bay.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not call a brown horse a bay? - A. It is a dark bay, and nearly brown.</p>
               <p>Q. You know more about horses than I do, what do you call it? - A. I call it a dark bay horse, and another person might call it a brown horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. Do not horses change their colour very much? - A. Yes, this is a very old horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A dark bay and a brown are of very little difference, one person might call it a dark bay, and another person a brown horse.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. You apprehended the prisoner - do you know Mr. Yardley's hand-writing, the chief clerk at the Office? (shewing the witness a paper) - A. This is Mr. Chamber's writing, and Mr. Yardley's is underneath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That is not evidence - you were at Bow-street, and Messrs. Dallat's attorney attended there to manage the business? - A. I never saw that gentleman before at any Public-office, I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Maslin.) Q. You are sure that the horse that you purchased of the prisoner is the same horse that the prosecutor claimed? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This horse, when I bought him, was a bright bay, and full of saddle-marks, and from a blow on the off eye he had got the skin quite over the off eye; I do not know whether he is quite blind, he has been grazed on one knee, and there is a knot on it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say that the horse was a broken knee'd horse? - A. When I sold him to Mr. Maslin, I do not say it was a broken knee then; the hair was only a little rubbed off.</p>
               <p>Maslin. I did not perceive that any was rubbed off when I bought him first.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Maslin:) Q. You do not call him a broken knee'd horse, unless the skin is broken? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had this horse; I was employed by Dallats' people to get a horse for a poor relation of theirs that wanted one to go in an errand cart, that used to go to the fishmongers at Billingsgate to Chelsea. The first time I saw this horse was in a cart, and the name of Rickets was on the cart; I wanted to deal with the man for the horse, and the man would not sell me the horse at that time; I looked at the horse a good while, and we were joking with the man a good while, seeing the white marks down his withers; the man said he was a good old servant, and a better horse there never was. I saw the horse afterwards two or three times, more or less; I saw the horse, I suppose, for a fortnight or three weeks after that; the man came to me one day, and said he had met with a misfortune; the words were never expressed by me as Mr. Maslin has said; he says that I said he was seized upon by smuggling; he asked me if my friends were suited, and I said they were not; he brought the horse the next day to me at eleven o'clock, and I took it over to Mr. Dallat's, and they told me they did not want it, - they had either furnished themselves with a horse, or a friend had. I was in the habit of going to Mr. White, and I was telling him that I had such a horse, and that I was disappointed with the person that wanted it, and that I must take it to Smithfield; he said to me, Mrs. Salmon wants a horse to go in her cart;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100022"/>I said, it would suit her very well; he then said he was going out to-morrow, and he would inform her; I was to give six pounds six shillings for the horse to the man; he said to me, make what you can, I don't care so as I have my own money; I wanted to part with the horse, he had eat near a truss of hay; Mr. White informed Mrs. Salmon of it; and the first time I saw the horse after that was in Mrs. Salmon's cart; we could not agree about the price, and Mr. White said she should not have it; I did not see the horse again till I saw it in Mr. Maslin's stage; Mr. White went up to Mr. Maslin to know if he liked the horse, and the answer was that he liked it. I was one night at Mr. Knight's, and Mr. Maslin was there; he said, Morgan, I may as well pay you for that horse; I said, if you please: he asked me into the parlour, I do not think there was any body present but Mr. White; Mr. White said we should spend a shilling a piece, or half a crown, and Mr. Maslin paid me seven guineas for the horse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you hire her? - A. I believe it is about six or seven weeks back; I knew nothing of the robbery till Friday the 28th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out the robbery? - A. I was very ill in bed, and did not get up from the 17th to the 28th; I was forced to keep my bed eleven days; on the 28th my daughter came up to me, and said, father, I am sorry to see you so bad; says she, you want some clean sheets; I said, you will find some in the drawer; on her searching, she found that every drawer besides one, and every box in the room, there were some things gone out of; I had seen my things in my boxes and in my drawers before the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your drawers, in your bedroom? - A. No, in a private room where my wife died; I always keep the keys under my pillow; while I was so ill, I lost my senses, and I could not tell what became of the keys; I did not suffer any one to go into that room.</p>


               <p>Q. While you were ill, you were light-headed? - A. I used to have one or two fits of a day, but, thank God, I have not had any for this fortnight; I was not able to get up on the Friday, but on the Monday following I got up, and went and got two search-warrants to search two houses, and the first house that was searched they found more than one half of the things that were stolen; on Tuesday they searched the other house, and found what they could not find in the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it since your wife died? - A. She died on the 3d of March, five minutes before five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been acquainted with the prisoner before the decease of your wife? - A. She never slept in my house, she only came backwards and forwards as a chair-woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you intrust the prisoner with the keys? - A. I would not trust even my own daughter with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sorry you should have suspicion of your own daughter - in point of fact, the question is whether you intrusted the keys with the prisoner? - A. I never missed the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you ever intrusted her with the keys? - A. Never in my life, nor no person in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you gave your wife leave to dispose of her property? - A. No, I mean to keep it as long as I live, except I want to make away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. It had not been given to your daughter? - - A. No; I gave her my wife's wedding-ring, and what she died in; I would not trust my daughter with the keys, except somebody went with her.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Bow-street: On the 1st of July,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100024"/>I went to execute two search-warrants in company with Doyle, first to No. 4, Little Green-street, Kentish-town, and there I saw the prisoner at the bar; I told her I came upon a disagreeable circumstance to search her house to find some property of Mr. Cantell's; she said, very well. In the house I found two pillow-cases, and a white apron; her daughter came in, and I told Doyle to stop her, as she wanted to go out of the house, till I had searched the house all through; Mrs. Hartley could not swear to the pillow-cases, the marks being taken out; then I said, I shall by no means take them; I said to the mother and daughter, you have got another house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the pillow-case? - A. I left them and the apron, because she could not positively swear to them; then the prisoner at the bar, Mrs. Hartley, I, and Doyle, went to her house in College-lane; I followed them up stairs, and the prisoner at the bar and Mrs. Hartley went into a back room; I heard the prisoner, as I stood and listened at the door, desire Mrs. Hartley to shut the door, and not to let me in, and she would give up the property; I forced myself into the room; she was then taking the property out of a cupboard on the left hand going into the room, and I took it out of her hand. I produce a tablecloth, a white silk hat-band, a piece of lace, and a pair of sheets, that is what I took out of her hand; I took her into custody, and took her to Bow-street. Sir

             desired me to keep her in the watch-house till I could find the rest of the property; I went the next morning to No. 4, Green-street, and there I took the two pillow-cases which I had left, and one pair of stockings and a shift; I found that the next morning; here is some more of the property which the prisoner's daughter returned to Mr. Cantell the next day - a cap, a pocket, two pair of stockings, and a handkerchief; he produced them to me the next morning. (The property identified by Mrs. Hartley.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) What may be the value of these things? - A. Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The house is your own, you pay the rent and taxes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Cantell gave me all these things out of his own hands from his drawers.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. We will ask him that question - Cantell, did you give her all these things? - A. Never, as true as God is in heaven; I never gave her any more than paid her for her labour, I did not know that they were gone till I missed them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, on Saturday, the 9th of March last, seeing the prisoner at the bar? - A. I cannot recollect the prisoner exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day? - A. Yes, on the 9th of March, Saturday evening, about half past nine, a woman came to buy two pair of shoes; I served her with the shoes; she said, she had nothing less than a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the shoes to come to? - A. Twelve shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce to you a five pound Banknote? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that Bank-note that she tendered to you? - A. I took it into the parlour where Mr. Baddeley was; Mr. Baddeley told me to go back to the woman in the shop who had brought me the note, to desire her to write her name upon it; she said, she could not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that what did you do with the note? - A. On receiving that answer, I took it back into the parlour to Mr. Baddeley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Baddeley and you return back into the shop? - A. He looked at the note and compared it with another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Baddeley came to the prisoner and you with him? - A. Yes; he asked her where she took that note; she said, she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. Mr. Baddeley told her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100026"/>he did not think it was a good note; then she gave him another which was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the note that she first gave to you? - A. He kept that in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the other being tendered by the woman what then? - A. He returned that, the good one, and with respect to the bad one, he said he should keep that.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that Bank-note in your hand and tell whether that is the note? - A. It is the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. Yes, I am quite certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it to be the note that you received? - A. I wrote the name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all you know, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her afterwards at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you write the name upon it? - A. When she stood in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mr. Baddeley saying that he should keep that note, the bad one, what was said more to the woman? - A. He told her, he would enquire if it was a good one, and for her to call again on Monday, and for me to write my name upon it, that we might know it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come again on Monday morning. -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She was to come again on Monday to have the note? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She never did call on Monday? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing during the time that she was in the shop - Did you observe any thing with respect to the manner of her conduct? - A. She was very joking, and seemed as if she was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have said very honestly you do not know the prisoner? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a shoe-maker living in the Strand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness Smith, the journeyman, bringing you a Bank-note, on the 9th of March? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that Bank-note - Is that the Banknote that was brought to you by Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into your shop, and see any woman in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round to the prisoner at the bar, and tell my Lord and the Jury whether that is the woman? - A. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the shop did you keep possession of that Bank-note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any particular reasons that caused you to be more positive to speak to the identity of the prisoner, from any thing that had happened to any part of her? - A. Her hand; I saw as she held her pocket-book in it, had one of her fingers cut across, I saw it as she opened the pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was not cut by opening of it? - A. No, it was an old sore.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She took this other Bank-note out of her pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon her taking the other Bank-note out of her pocket-book, which was a good one, you looked at it? - A. Yes, I thought it was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the tendering of the good Bank-note, did you give her the good one back again? - A. Yes, I told her, I would keep the bad one and take it to Bow-street or the Bank, on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire her to come again on Monday morning? - A. I only told her, she should have either the note or the change on Monday morning when I got the answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come on the Monday morning? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her again till you saw her at Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At Bow-street when you did see her again, did you observe the cut on her finger which you have described? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after she was at your shop was it that you saw her at Bow-street? - A. I cannot say; it was when I was sent for by Mr. Bliss, about a month or two after she had been at the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed at Bow-street that cut in her finger which you have described? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was desired to stand up, had you any doubt from that circumstance or from the whole appearance of her that she was the person that came to your shop? - A. No doubt, not any doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. No doubt then? - A. I had no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. After you saw the cut on the finger, was it from that cut that you were positive it was the prisoner? - A. I knew her face, I had observed her features.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of her person and features satisfied you that she was the same person, and removed all doubt if ever you had any? - A. I had not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire the last witness, Smith, to put his name on the back of that note? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I shewed you the note(the note handed to the witness)? - A. That is the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was in the early part of March that the woman was in your shop? - A. It was on the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said it was about two months after that you saw her at Bow-street? - A. I cannot rightly tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100027"/>Q. Then I can tell you, it was on the 7th of June, that is three months after the time that you say a person came into your shop; she was then in custody; you say you had been always positive about her - did not you express some doubt at Bow-street, which induced the Magistrate to point out the hand to you? - A. I was going to tell Mr. Carpmeal I knew her by her face and by the cut on her finger, and when I came out I had the additional evidence there was a cut on her finger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Should you have had a doubt if you had not seen the finger? - A. Not any.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bosanquet. Q. You are one of the Bow-street patrols? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner's lodgings in company with Mr. Bliss? - A. Yes, I searched, in company with Mr. Bliss, the prisoner's lodgings, No. 9, Tower-street, Westminster-road; I found this gown there.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner seen that gown since you found it? - A. She has, she acknowledged it to be her's; this bottle of lotion was in the cupboard; Mr. Bliss took it, and gave it to me; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Cook.) Is that the gown, and is that the bottle? - A. It is one like it, and such a gown as that the woman wore.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What you mean to say is, that the gown resembled that, it was such a sort of a gown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. The same sort of lotion you sold to other people, you have no mark of your own on the bottle? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. That is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prisoner.) You have heard the evidence that has been given against you; your Counsel can examine your witnesses if you have any; he cannot make any speech for you, therefore if you wish to say any thing you must say it yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a very remarkable person, it is very odd they cannot give a description of me; I have a particular cut on my hand, as well as on my finger; in the next place I have but one eye; that has not been observed by any of the witnesses, and as for the Gowland's lotion, a gentleman made me a present of it, and the shawl; I am an unfortunate girl.</p>

            ? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know respecting the prisoner at the bar - when did you apprehended him? - A. We apprehended him outside of the Court here one day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - A. Ray was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. I have got a memorandum made on the same day; it was on the 3d of June, last month; we apprehended him just outside of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing of at that time? - A. He came out from that door (pointing to the door that the prisoners are brought in,) from that side of the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He was discharged in consequence of a bill being thrown out against him, and these officers were waiting to take him after the discharge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see him before that time since he was ordered to be transported? - A. I saw him at the Office in Worship-street, he was taken up for stealing some unfinished mahogany goods.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill was thrown out against him - how long before the 3d of June was it that he was taken up? - A. I think a fortnight; some time in May I think it was.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew nothing of him before that time? - A. Nothing at all before that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100033"/>Q. You are certain this is the same man? - A. This is the same man I saw brought to the Office by Ray.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Vickery, the Gentlemen of the Jury have heard that the prisoner was taken up upon a charge of stealing some mahogany, and that afterwards the bill was preferred against him, and upon that charge the Grand Jury threw out the bill? - A. I certainly understood it so at the door of the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. When this man was about to be discharged on the regular call over day of the Sessions, you were waiting to take him up upon this charge? - A. Yes, upon information that we received.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was of being at large - he coming out of this Court to go into the yard to be discharged, you took him? - A. That was all certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this conviction perhaps you know there is a twenty pounds reward? - A. Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you will be entitled to a share, if the Jury should be of opinion that the man was convicted? - A. Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Ray.) Q. You know nothing more of this business than you were with Vickery at the time he apprehended this man? - A. I apprehended him on Saturday, the 18th of May, first; I found him then in Banner-street, St. Luke's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to apprehend him then? - A. For robbing his master; he was imprisoned and discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his master's name? - A. Darge, a cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the charge against him? - A. Darge.</p>
               <p>Q. Darge lived in Banner-street, did he? - A. He did, and does now I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know where the prisoner lodged at that time? - A. I did not till I apprehended him, I went in company with his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find his lodging to be - what was he? - A. He kept a chandler's shop in Old-street-road; I took him from his master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he shewed you the place where he lived? - A. Yes, and there he attempted to make his escape; I followed him about two hundred yards, and then I took him again.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how many of each? - A. I do not recollect the quantity; I put then in the till-box in the drawer in my desk, where I usually keep all my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark all of them the same? - A. No, there were different marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that accompting-house in Eagle and child alley? - A. Yes, it is a room in the printing-office, it does not join the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you put the marked money there? - A. About a week before the 20th of June, when I first received the information; on the 21st of June, at five o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by one of my apprentices; I got up immediately, and went into my accompting-house, I found the only four drawers that had locks taken out, the locks had been forced, the till-box on the floor, and all the money gone, and the papers that were in the drawers scattered about.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any trunk there? - A. Yes, that was broken open, the staple was broken in two; it contained books and papers.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of finding this what did you do? - A. I went to Trott.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To what amount was the money in the till? - A. Somewhere between one and two pound were gone, I am sure there was more than 1 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Where was Trott? - A. He was at his lodgings in Hatton-wall.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave information to Trott, and went with him to Stanton, the other officer, what then? - A. Then Trott and Stanton went into a cellar at Brooke's-market, Holborn; I waited in the street about two minutes, and then I went into the cellar, and there I saw Osland; I waited while they searched the cellar; the cellar did not seem to communicate with the house; I saw them find some crows and some picklock-keys and two papers of bad money; there was a woman and a man and a girl about eight or ten years old, all in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with Osland to the watch-house with the officers? - A. I went with the officers to the office, at Hatton-garden, and there they lodged Osland, and the man and woman too in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the little girl? - A. They left her in the cellar to do as she pleased. We then went to a court in the neighbourhood of Mutton-hill; I waited in the court, and the officers went in a door at the end of the court; in about two minutes one of them put his head out of the window, and said, that he had taken Molton; I then went in and saw Molton and the woman dressing, and a little boy, and the girl that we had left in Osland's cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the space of time, between the time that you had left the little girl in Osland's cellar, and the time that you were at Molton's? - A. Half an hour, I am not quite sure; they took Molton, the girl, and the boy, in custody to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing that was found there? - A. One of the officers shewed me a crow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe you did not know the prisoners before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not been in your house nor about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the office did you deposit the marked money? - A. In the accompting-house, on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked your money - I suppose you suspected some of your workmen? - A. No, I had information.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected somebody from information that you received from the officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How late before this morning when you found your accompting-house had been broken open, had you seen any of this marked money? - A. I saw it every night before for a week to the best of my recollection, I am sure I saw it the night before, on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How many half-guineas had you marked? - A. I had marked more than one half-guinea, I had marked some silver, and there was one shilling marked; I left the accompting-house on the 20th, about nine at night; I examined the money before I went, and locked the accompting-room myself.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp, I am an officer belonging to Hatton garden Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Mr. Taylor previous to this robbery being committed? - A. Yes, about a week before; Mr. Taylor came to me about half past five in the morning, on the 21st, I then proceeded with Stanton to Brooke's-market, to Osland's cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is that cellar? - A. The corner of Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a cellar that is used for a habitation? - A. It is a habitation; when I unbolted the door in the cellar that communicated to the house, I knew some of the people in the house to be honest people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Osland before, whom you had found there? - A. I had seen Osland several times before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Tell us exactly what past when you got to this cellar? - A. I saw Osland in bed with a woman, in the cellar, and a little girl in the same bed, and an old man sitting on the side<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100035"/>of the bed; I told Osland, he must get up and dress himself, we were officers, and were come to take him into custody; he got up, and I tied his hands; I then struck a light, there was no light in the cellar only from the door; while I was looking about one part of the room, I saw the woman get out of the bed, and go towards a rabbit-hutch, she was stooping down, I asked her what she was going to do; she said, she was going to feed the rabbits; I pulled her away; sometime after I saw Stanton pick up a bag, I looked at it, and saw two iron crows, and several skeleton keys in the bag; I searched all the house, and every person in the cellar, and found nothing that was suspected to be Mr. Taylor's property. I asked Osland how the iron crows, and keys came there; he said, a young man that was gone to sea left them there sometime back, I searched Osland, I found nothing on him; I found a great quantity of bad money that had not long been in that state; he said, the same young man had left those sixpences there; we took them all to the Office, but the little girl, and locked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the old man? - A. Yes, I searched them all and found nothing on them; then we went to a court in Vine-street-hill, near Mutton-hill; I went to a house up one pair of stairs, and I met Molton on the top of the stairs without his stockings and shoes; Stanton was close behind me, I told him to return into the room, I was going to take him into custody; I saw him come out of the one pair of stairs room, he begged I would let him put on his shoes and stockings; I told him, by all means; I found his shoes and stockings were in that room, I then searched him, and in his watch-pocket I found a half-guinea, a French half-crown, and I think there were four shillings altogether, one of which is marked, the half-guinea and the half-crown are marked; he said, oh dear, do not take my money away, it belongs to my wife; I told him if it did belong to his wife, I should take it; there was a little boy in this room, and his wife, the boy was laying on a box on the left hand side of the bed; I turned my head round and saw Osland's little girl sitting on one side of the room with a bonnet on, knowing her, I told my brother officer not to let her go down stairs, till I had searched the room further; I sadly wanted the woman to get out of bed, she was very unwilling, she put on her under petticoat, and sat on the bed: I saw her doing something with one of her hands between the bed and the sacking; I went and pulled up the bed and there lay this crow wrapped up in this cloth; I then locked them up after I had taken them to the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Mr. Taylor's house with this crow? - A. No, Stanton took the others, they were broken open with the other crows.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the little girl at the other place did you take her into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce to Mr. Taylor that money you now produce? - A. I did, as being found on Molton: I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You found nothing at Osland's but crows? - A. Nothing but crows and skeleton keys.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went with Osland to this cellar? - A. I did; I produce the crows and the skeleton keys I found in this bag, very near a rabbit-hutch in this cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman near the rabbit-hutch? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. These two crows appear to be fitter for drawers than doors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They appear to be fit for the inside of the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some keys in the cellar? - A. I found all in that bag. (The keys handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These keys are for the inside of a house not for doors? - A. They are; I tried these small crows to Mr. Taylor's drawers in the accompting-house, three or four days after the prisoners were taken into custody; they were broke open with an instrument of a like width, they corresponded with the dents, Mr. Taylor was present when I tried these crows.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Did they fit with the dents in your judgment when the officer tried them? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was that one of the half-guineas that you saw the night before in the till-box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the half-crown and the shilling? - A. These were also part of the marked money that I had put in the till-box; the shilling and the French half-crown and the half-guinea I am sure of, (the money shewn to the Jury) the half-crown is marked on the edge with a waved line, the half-guinea has the dot between the C and F cut off, the shilling has J P on both sides and a fleur de lis, those are the marks I observed on the shilling the night before, and the nights preceding, since I had the information; there were marks on the drawer of a large crow as well as the small ones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Had you parted with any of that money that you had marked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- GUNNER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an apprentice to Mr. Taylor; I came out of the dwelling-house about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning; I unlocked the office, and went into the accompting-house, and I observed the drawers were broken open.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the sash had been up? - A. Yes it was up, it is on the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100036"/>Q. Could any body get in there but through the assistance of a ladder? - A. I do not think they could; the workmen had been at work, and the ladder and scaffolding were about the premises.</p>
               <p>Osland's defence. All that I can say, I went to-bed that night between ten and eleven o'clock, and in the morning, about seven, Mr. Trott and Stanton came and called me out of bed; I got up, and went with them; they took that bag, and those things which were left with me (I do not disown) by a man that went on board a ship; they took me and the woman, and the man that came out of the hospital the day before; he met me; I asked him to come home with me, he had broken ribs; they took the mother of the girl, the girl did not belong to me; the girl did not know where to go, and as this boy and girl went to school together, she went there, as far as I know, to Molton's.</p>
               <p>Molton's defence. I have got to say, as I came home from work in the evening, I purchased a couple of mackerel; I had no change; I gave a one-pound note, and that is the way I came by the money; I know no further about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What did you do? - A. I struggled to keep it from him as much as I could do; then he pulled me from the box, and put his knee on my throat; he kicked me on my face; I called for assistance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your neck - where was it, upon your neck, or upon the side of your head? - A. Upon the side of my head.</p>

               <p>Q. What were there in the purse besides the notes? - A. A dollar, three shillings, and a bad sixpence, and the key of my chest; when he had got it from me he ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you went directly to the engine-house, and made your complaint there? - A. I did immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any moon, you say it was a very fine night? - A. There was no moon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Old gentleman, was there no moon that night? - A. It was moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. You just now told me there was no moon? - A. I felt his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you what you felt, I ask you whether there was any moon? - A. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock at night was it? - A. A very few minutes before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. This was last Saturday week? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell the Magistrate before whom the prisoner was taken (Mr. Storey,) that you knew the prisoner's face? - A. I know him well.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no answer to my question - when you were before the Magistrate, it does not appear that you said any thing about the man's face? - A. Oh, I knew him by his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell the Magistrate so? - A. I knew him by his face, and his smock-frock, and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came not you to acquaint the Magistrate? - A. I told him, as far as I could, the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, when you were examined by the Magistrate, did you tell him you knew the prisoner's face? - A. I knew his face very well.</p>
               <p>Q. That is no answer to the question; why did you not tell the Magistrate so; I have got your examination before me, you did not say a word about the prisoner's face then, only of having felt his hand and he wanted two fingers, why did you not tell Mr. Storey so, that you knew the prisoner's face as you have been telling me now? - A. I know it well.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you what you know, why did not you tell Mr. Storey? - A. I am telling the truth before God and man.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what reason you had to know him - did you see the prisoner's face so as to know his face? - A. I did, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Mr. Storey that you saw the man's face, or any thing like it; I want to know how it is that you came to mend your evidence now; state when it was that you felt his fingers were missing? - A. I felt his fingers were missing when he took hold of me first in the watch-box.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you feel it with? - A. I felt it with my hands, and saw it too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the place where they were wanting; this is further too, did you feel it with your hand, or on the side of your throat? - A. I felt it with my hand and on my throat, I felt it every way; he never spoke a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you could see the place where the fingers were wanting? - A. Yes, I could see and feel them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that at the time you were pulled out of the box, whoever it was that pulled you out, that you saw that that man wanted two of his fingers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you light enough to see that? - A. Yes, I always felt it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you what you always felt, I ask you what you saw - Do you mean to swear, that at the time you were pulled out of the box, that you could see there were two fingers wanting on the man's hand that pulled you out of the box? - A. Yes, the moon shined.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you a lodger in the house? - A. Yes, Mr. Fisher was master of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In the beginning of June last, do you remember being with Mrs. Fisher, drinking tea with her? - A. Yes, it was on the 3d of June, on Whit-Monday, I was drinking tea with Mrs. Fisher in the front parlour, it was about five o'clock when I first sat down.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Fisher was not with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come at the time that you were drinking tea? - A. Yes, as I supposed it to be him, I did not see him, he came to the front parlour-window, the shutter of which was put to to keep the sun from her; I saw one of the shutters pulled back, when instantly was broke a small pane of glass, we supposed it to be Mr. Fisher that did it; I did not see him.

            , had bolted the door of the shop; Mr. Fisher, as I supposed came to the parlour-door and asked for the key of the shop; I knew his voice; Mrs. Fisher just opened the door enough to give it him, she shut the door and bolted it again; I heard the person go out into the yard and go up stairs, then he came down stairs to the parlour-door again, and said, will not you let me in.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was it that said that? - A. Mr. Fisher: she answered, no; then the deceased stood against the door, he tried to force the door open, and instantly he went from the door, I heard the back window go up; Mrs. Fisher, the deceased, then went from the door into the back parlour to prevent him from shoving the window up; I only saw her leave the door, she said, he should not come in; I heard fire-arms go off instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said? - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon hearing fire-arms go off what did you do? - A. I instantly called her three times, and no answer was made me; I then thought she might have hid herself under one of the beds or in one of the beds; I looked inside of the room and saw the blood flowing down on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman? - A. No, I never saw the woman after she left me and went out of the room, I instantly got out of the front parlour-window and went into the adjoining house, to call assistance, and nobody came to my assistance; I fetched the doctor afterwards; that is all I know of the affair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I wish you would try and recollect yourself - Do not you recollect that she made use of some expression in the course of the afternoon, that she would have no devils in there? - A. That is what she said during the afternoon, not at that present moment; I looked upon it that she meant the prisoner, I took her meaning as such, and that was her expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard her say that she did not mean to have any devils in there - You had been lodging there sometime? - A. About sixteen months as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give us any reason why she used the word devils? - A. He had been seen apparently deranged at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen frequent? - A. Yes; frequent in the dead of the night, I have seen different transactions going forward.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you observed that before this fatal accident took place? - A. About a fortnight before this took place.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What took place about a fortnight ago? - A. He went up and down stairs in the dead of the night, singing and tearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by tearing? - A. Going about singing and going into the rooms and tearing the lines down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did the conduct that you have been talking about, namely, singing in the night, continue during the whole of the fortnight? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100041"/>Sometimes it was once or twice a week, and sometimes it was two or three times a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the whole of your observations with respect to his conduct at different periods, it did not appear to you that he had the right possession of his mind? - A. I do not suppose that he had.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was his general conduct sober? - A. I cannot say any thing with regard to that, I never noticed whether he was sober or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you looked in the back-room, was there any smoke in the room at the time you heard the report of fire-arms? - A. The place was full of smoke apparently, which I took to be from the fire-arms that went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it smell of gunpowder? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from where the prisoner lives? - A. About thirty yards; on Whit-Monday, I was alarmed by a child that Mrs. Fisher had been killed; I went to Fisher's house, I saw the prisoner sitting in the corner of the front parlour; I then went to the back-room, where lay the deceased, the wife of the prisoner, about two yards from the window; her left eye was forced out of the socket and laying upon the left temple, and a great quantity of blood had issued from her head; she appeared to be apparently dead. I went a little way from the prisoner's house, where I met Mr. Rice, an officer, whom I informed that Mr. Fisher had shot his wife; he requested me to go back with him, and he would take the prisoner into custody; I went back with him, the prisoner was then sitting in the same chair as before; I then went to the back-room and saw the deceased, and came to the front room and asked which was Fisher; upon being informed, he was requested to stand up to be searched: I then went afterwards to the back shop to look for the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched? - A. Yes, he was; and a large knife and a small one was found on him; a man of the name of Lagan, said, Fisher, I never thought you would have done this; the prisoner replied, he had done it; I then went to the back shop to look for the pistols and could not find them, I was coming from the back shop and I met Mr. Wood the officer, I went back with him again, and on the second search, Mr. Wood found two pistols at the further end of the shop, in a barrel of scraps of old iron; one was apparently discharged, the other was not, it appeared to be damp, and it was black at the muzzle and there was some blood on the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Fisher sober at the time? - A. He appeared very much agitated, his eyes were darting from one subject to another in the room; he looked very wild, he did not appear to be intoxicated.</p>

             sworn. - I am a neighbour of the deceased; I went into the back parlour and saw her laying with the blood about her near the door where she died; the prisoner was sitting in a chair in the front parlour; I asked him why he had done such a thing; he made me no answer at all; I staid till the surgeon came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you known this man? - A. I have lived in the neighbourhood nine or ten years; I have known him as a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observations that you have made of his conduct did he appear to be a man in his mind or not in his mind? - A. I cannot say much about that.</p>
               <p>Q. What you can say about it I should like to know? - A. He has been at times not as if he was right, that I do think.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been once or twice or frequent? - A. Very frequent indeed within this five or six months back he has not been so clever as usual; I have heard his wife say when I have been in the house that she could bring twenty people that would bear witness that he was a madman; that I have heard her say with my own ears; I only know from what I have heard his wife say.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How did he appear to be that day? - A. He appeared to be very much agitated for what he had done I suppose.</p>

             sworn. - I was sent for by the Overseer to go to the prisoner's house; I was in the room at the time the shot was found that was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have known the prisoner? - A. He has been at our watch-house a great many years since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the state of his mind? - A. I have often thought that he talked like a deranged man at the time he was there; he talked very much at random, and sometimes very sensible; I think this was about eight or ten years ago, I have seen him at different times since.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How lately have you seen him previous to his wife being shot? - A. I think it must be six months before.</p>
               <p>- ARMSTRONG sworn. - I am assistant to Mr. Mariner, a surgeon; on Monday evening, the 3d of June, on my arrival at the house of the prisoner, I was taken into the back parlour, where the deceased laid on her back, surrounded with blood; I perceived the left eye was lacerated in the socket by a ball or some such thing; I perceived that it was a ball which had entered the inner angle of the left eye; I then put my hand to the back part of the head, and felt the bone at the back part of the head was fractured between the skull; I took hold of the hand of the deceased and felt there was no pulse, she was perfectly dead; I then stated to the persons who were in the front parlour, that Mrs. Fisher was dead, and desired them to come in to assist me in raising the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open her head? - A. Not at that time, I did on Wednesday morning, at the request of the Coroner; I discovered no more than the back part of her head was fractured; a ball had entered the inner angle of the left eye and had fractured the bone, and that was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the ball pass the brain? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Through my sons and my wife frequently I have been past my senses by their ill usage; she has put me in prison; we had a separation, she would not let me go one way or the other, my wife got me to take my two eldest sons into partnership; that would not do, she would have the agreement made, that they should have part of the tools, part of the stock, and part of the houshold furniture, and the lease of the house, and all the book debts outstanding to have an equal share; I agreed to all these considerations, and yet it would not do; they then wanted to separate from me, and take that part to themselves; the agreement was not strong enough, I always considered the business was to be done at No. 13, Mount-pleasant, and no where else, in consequence of which she wished them to go away from me and likewise herself, and because I would not agree to that, they were always upon me, which drove me beyond my senses at times.</p>

               <p>Q. You now live at Woolwich? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever an apprentice to the prisoner? - A. Yes; I was bound to him in the year 1783, I continued with him ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went to him was he a quiet inoffensive good master? - A. Yes; quite so far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been with him when did you discover any difference in his conduct? - A. Not till such time he received a blow with the sledge hammer on his head, which was about five or six years after I had been with him; Plumley was making a plug for the barrel, as we call it, Mr. Fisher was standing at the work stooping, and the man was striking above him on the tool, it was done by accident, the hammer struck him so violent on the head as to fell him to the ground; he was laid up for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what you observed of his conduct after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100043"/>he received this injury? - A. He used to go through the shop and give orders, and after that come and ask what I was about, who gave me the orders; I told him he had; he would contradict it, and tell me to do other work; that sort of conduct continued down to the time I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him since you left him? - A. Yes, about two years ago, and then his discourse varied very much; he did not appear to have a found mind.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you served your apprenticeship to the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did; I was with him about fourteen years altogether, at different times; I have observed him to work hard of a morning, from six o'clock till nine at breakfast-time, and then I have seen him walking for two or three hours together, not speaking a word, and he has started up at times and looked wild; he has let the heats be in the fire till they were spoiled; I thought he was really out of his mind; sometimes he was singing, and sometimes talking of Moses and Aaron and Jacob, and then he would look as wild as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him do any thing respecting money? - A. Yes; once when he had a bill to a large amount to take, I went to look for him up at Piccadilly; he had been to a master that he worked for there; coming home, I met him in the King's Road, he was standing at a post with a great many guineas in his shoes; I went up to him, he knew me, and he said to me, Tom, is that you, do you want any money; I said, no; I put on his shoes time after time; he at last took the guineas home in his shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole of the time that you have known him, have you considered him as a man in his right mind? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. At the time that the money was in his shoes, was he drunk or sober? - A. He was in liquor then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon after you came to be his apprentice did you observe that he acted in this extraordinary way? - A. It might be a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue so to act at times during the remaining six years of your apprenticeship? - A. He did, and for the remaining time that I was with him at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took orders for the business, and made out the accounts? - A. He generally took orders himself; I believe he chiefly carried on the business, so far as I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell whether you observed any thing with respect to his mind? - A. I always thought that he was a real madman; when we took a heat out, (that is a piece of iron out of the fire to make it into what we wanted it for,) he would turn away, and talk as hard as ever he could, and let the iron cool, and stare as bold, quite like a madman; on the Monday that I left him, he made me draw a ball, which was two men's work to do; it was horse-nail stubs drawn into iron, and when it was done, he threw it down, and went away.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was he sober? - A. He was as sober as ever a Judge in the world was; I never saw him disguised in liquor but three times, all the time I worked with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say he made you draw a ball, which was two men's work to do - what ought to have been done with it? - A. Instead of putting in the iron again to make it hot, to make it fit for what he wanted, he threw it down, and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he went to? - A. No, I kept in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him that day when he came back? - A. Yes, I parted with him at a public-house between two and three o'clock, and we had no more than two pints of beer - him, me, and my wife; I did not see him after that till after five or six o'clock, it was all settled at the Office then.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar? - A. Four years, I live next door to him; I have had an opportunity of frequently seeing him, and if ever a person was insane Mr. Fisher is; my wash-house faces his work-shop; I have seen him standing and talking to himself, and singing, and muttering, when no one has been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an industrious man when he was perfectly right? - A. Perfectly so, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you saw him a very short time before this unhappy offence? - A. I did; he came to my lodger twice for a candle, about half after four in the afternoon; my lodger was out; he came to me, and said his wife would not let him have one; I said, I am sure she would; he looked in a deranged state, in a cross manner, which he had looked before, when he was in a deranged state.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by saying he looked in a cross manner, as he had before when he was in a deranged state - Did you ever know him confined on account of insanity? - A. Never; it was my opinion that at times when he has been in a cross refractory way that he was in a deranged state.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was not right in his mind? - A. I cannot say he was not right in his mind.</p>

               <p>Q. During the time that you lived with him, did you observe what his conduct was? - A. I thought at times that he was not in his senses by the manner of his behaviour to his men and his apprentices; when the men were at work in the shop, he would go and throw their heats back, and order them out of the shop; and when he and I were at work together, he would take the heats up, and walk up and down the shop like a man that was out of his senses, and would walk up and down the shop with his arms folded; he was always muttering; he would be up and down the house all night sometimes, and call me down to help move the things out of their places in the middle of the night; this conduct continued on him at different times till I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him after you were his apprentice? - A. Not till Saturday previous to the Whit-Monday; I went then, and knocked at the door, and a little girl answered the door; I told her I wanted her uncle; he came, and I asked him if he wanted any body to work for him; he said he did not know, he had work enough.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in his senses at that time? - A. No; he sat himself down in the chair, and folded his arms up for two or three minutes before he made any reply again; he then got up, and said he must go into the shop, and bid me good by; he was then just the same as when I left him, like a man out of his senses.</p>

I have known him about sixteen years; I always conceived he was a man very much out of his mind, as he was frequently talking to himself, and making songs out of his own head that were nonsensical and disagreeable to hear.</p>

I have seen him frequently run up and down the street where I live in that mad state; the last time I saw him run past my house, he roared out, and bit his lips till they bled; I always fastened the door when he ran past, I was afraid of him; he was always called Mad

Twelve years; my husband is dead, he was a barber; I carry on the business; the prisoner has been a quarterly customer to me for these twelve years; he never paid the quarterage himself, his wife paid it; the prisoner often came backwards on a Sunday at my house; my husband died in the same delirious way, which made me very much frightened at him; the prisoner would sing, rattle, and roar, in much the same way as my husband did in his madness.</p>

On the 7th of June, between nine and ten o'clock, I left the room with a number of men's coats hanging there; when I returned to the room, I saw the prisoner there with a bag in his hand; I stepped back, and locked the door, and locked him in, and called for assistance. The prisoner broke a square of glass, put his hand through, unlocked the door, and ran out into the court; he was brought back, and taken into custody; he left the bag behind; I asked him if the bag was his; he said it was; there were five coats in the bag belonging to different gentlemen, and a coat belonging to my son; he had unlocked the door, and went in, and when I left the room the coats were all hanging up.</p>

I told them to keep their distance, and I passed on as far as the pastry-cook's in St. Paul's Church-yard, when they both came up again; by the light of the window I saw them distinctly. I made stop when I saw them; they said nothing to me then, but passed on, and when I got on Ludgate-hill, I was turning up Sun Tavern-court; I mostly go up there, and take half a pint of porter; there was a loose woman (as I supposed her to be) at the corner; she pushed me on the back, and said, aye, wicked, and left me directly. Then the prisoner at the bar, and another young man with him, seized me; the other man seized me by the arm, and the prisoner at the bar made an attempt to take my watch; when I found that he had snatched, as I supposed, my watch, I pursued him, and about twenty yards down the Old-Bailey I seized him by the flap of his coat; when I seized him, he said, pray let me go; and he dropped my ribbon and my seal, and said, here is your watch; the watchman took him in charge to the watch-house; I was asked if I had lost my watch; a gentleman who saw the circumstance said, it was only my ribbon; I being in a perspiration the watch was left in the fob, he had snatched the string and the pendant from the case, by the violence of the pull.</p>

                  <interp inst="t18050710-30-crimeloc174" type="placeName"

               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at home? - A. Not when I first went in, his wife then said he would be in in a few minutes; I found him at home on Thursday morning the 13th of June, about nine o'clock; I asked him if he had got any of these things; he knew what I meant; he asked me whether I wanted any half bulls, as he called them.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew what half bulls meant? - A. Yes, bad half crowns; he asked me how many I wanted; I told him I had only cash for a couple at present, which is two shillings worth; I asked him if I could have any more if I called the next day; he said I might have what I liked; I appointed to meet him on Friday the 14th, at two o'clock; I went, and he was not at home, his wife told me if I came at three o'clock I should find him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to the next morning? - A. I went and communicated this to the officers; and we appointed to meet at the Castle at Moorgate the next morning, the 15th, between eight and nine o'clock; there Mr. Rogers gave me half a guinea, it was in a seven shilling piece, and 3 s. 6 d. in silver; Mr. Rogers marked them in the presence of me, Brown, Oliver, and Mr. Clark; he gave them me, and I put them in my pocket, I had no more money about me; then I went to Bray's in Paul's alley, about nine o'clock, the officers waited at the bottom of the alley; I went into Bray's, he asked me how many I wanted, I told him I would have half a score, with that I gave him a 7 s. piece and 3 s. for them; he pulled them out of his left hand breeches pocket, they were wrapped up in paper with a great many more, but how many I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There were many more than what you bought? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. After he had given you the ten bad half crowns, what did he do with the remainder? - A. He wrapped them up, and put them into his pocket again; then when I had done that, I came out; I was to give a signal to the officers, which I did, and we returned into the house immediately; I went in first to make some apology, and Brown came in directly, and laid hold of Bray, the other officers came in, and they searched him and the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ten half crowns that you had bought? - A. The City Marshal found them in my hand, and took them from me in Bray's house; I told him that I had them from that man pointing to Bray.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were bargaining with the prisoner, was there any other man in the shop? - A. There was a man a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation about that man? - A. I told him, when he was getting the things for me, that that man took notice; he said, never mind, he is up, meaning that he knew what business he carried on.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that Clark took the half crowns from you, what became of the marked sixpence? - A. I had it then in my pocket, they searched me, and I believe Mr. Rogers, one of the officers, took it from me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What shop does the prisoner keep? - A. It is a kind of a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is it not a green grocer's shop? - A. No; they do not sell greens, they sell bread and butter, and things of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Your name is Coleman; the prisoner keeps this chandler's shop - how long have you been acquainted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100047"/>with Bray? - A. About a twelvemonth or more.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, entirely for the sake of public justice, you went to make this purchase, you had no other motive in view, you meant to discover his abomination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A wire-drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. They tell me that is a very good trade? - A. Yes, but when it is flat.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean now it is a bad business with you, I call this wire-drawing; you never served your apprenticeship to wire-drawing? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When have you worked at this trade? - A. A good many years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you worked at wire-drawing within a month past? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. No. 1, Steward's rents, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the master that employed you in the month past? - A. Mr. Brown, in Love-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. He has the misfortune to have your assistance in the wire-drawing way - how long have you got your livelihood by working for him? - A. I do not get my livelihood by working for him; as I am a working man, I work at what I can get, sometimes I work at my own country business making of lace.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since you yourself were taken up for smashing, for putting off bad money? - A. I was once taken up about a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since you were taken up before this? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to get out of prison because of this prosecution? - A. I was ashamed entirely of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was doing the public more justice in this way? - A. I thought it was a blackguard and scandalous thing; I got out of prison without this.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in prison for smashing? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said there was a person in the shop at the time you were buying this bad money? - A. There was, and I asked him if he had any of those things, he knew very well what I meant, he said I might have what I liked.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid him how much? - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And that person was a stranger to you? - A. He came to me on one side of the shop and asked me in a whispering manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell us that when my friend asked the question: then he was attracted by your pretty face, he came round the counter and spoke to you, and then you asked him for those things, you are sure that was your expression; now attend to me, sir, I ask you, upon your oath, did you not ask him for those things which you had left with him yesterday? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you, upon your oath did not you say to the prisoner, I will thank you to give me those things I left here yesterday? - A. It is wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to persist in that answer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been to the man's shop the day before? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You had bought the two half bulls the day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had committed an offence the day before, why was it necessary to lead him into another offence the next day, if you wanted to do it for the benefit of the public? - A. I was but one, and that was not sufficient evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, you mean to say your evidence nobody would believe? - A. I had no marked money to correspond.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you been in prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been dismissed from prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you dismissed from prison before you charged the prisoner with this, and before you charged two women? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you gave information of any body else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you at large now? - A. There was no bill found against me.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been in prison? - A. Never but that once in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. That was for smashing, and that was the only time you have been charged by any body; do you know Mr. Turner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever taken up upon any charge of robbing him - whether you have not been in custody before you have said you have not; I ask you, were you not in prison upon a charge of robbing Mr. Turner of Little-Britain? - A. I was a month.</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the money was marked? - A. I was at the Castle at Moorgate; I saw Mr. Rogers mark the money, he gave it to Coleman; upon Coleman giving the signal, I followed him immediately; I saw Bray behind the counter in his shirt sleeves, I immediately laid hold of him by both of his arms; Mr. Clark came in immediately after me, and when Mr. Rogers came in, I brought him from behind the counter, and Mr. Rogers searched him; I saw him find in his breeches pocket twenty-four counterfeit half-crowns in paper, and in his waistcoat pocket he found a counterfeit half-crown and a counterfeit dollar; he found a seven shilling piece marked on Bray, and three marked shillings; Mr. Clark searched Coleman, and he found ten counterfeit half-crowns; Mr. Rogers searched Coleman further, and took from him the marked sixpence which had been given to him before; then Mr. Bray mentioned some circumstance, and said the old b - r had done him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope this conspiracy will come out before you go out of Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100048"/>Court. Yes.</p>
               <p>Brown. We then sent Oliver away with Coleman; Mr. Clarke, Rogers, and I went with Bray to the Compter, and as we were going in the coach, Bray said, that old rascal knew where he had them from as well as he did; that they came from Birmingham, and the value of them was no more than threepence a-piece, but before he would tell who it was, he would be hanged himself; I searched Bray's house, and upon one of the shelves I found this melting-pot.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You might find more very often.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is a crucible? - A. (Brown.) Yes, he said he did a little in that. It is plate melted; I fancy that he meant he was a fence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. A fence is a cant term for receiving stolen property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner said he had done a little in that way, you have given us the interpretation, that he was a receiver of stolen things; who was in the coach with you? - A. Mr. Clark and the other officers.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was foolish enough or led away by your appearance, to tell you that he did a little in that, meaning, that he was a receiver of stolen goods; and that they came from Birmingham, and he would be hanged before he would tell who the person was he had them from? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was all voluntary on his part? - A. Yes; and he said he could not have more than a twelvemonth for it; he knew his punishment.</p>
               <p>- CLARK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer of the City - Did you go with the other officers to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes; I searched Coleman, I took from him ten half-crowns and a sixpence; I produce them; I saw Rogers take the money from Bray.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the last witness Brown, with Bray to the Compter? - A. I did; he said he had purchased these articles from Birmingham, and he had charged a shilling a-piece to Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing else that Bray said? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I have the same opinion of you as I always had - You do not mean to put any false colouring upon this business; I understood you to say you never heard him say he would lose his life before he would tell who was the manufacturer? - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard Brown swear it by wholesale? - A. He did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then now you and I a little differ - You recollect it now I put it in your mouth? - A. I did not recollect it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that coat on when you took him in custody? - A. No; if I came after you I should not have it on; I knew him twenty years ago.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer; I marked a seven-shilling piece, three shillings in silver and sixpence, at the Castle, in Moorgate; upon the signal being given by Coleman, I went into Bray's house; Brown was close by Bray.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Bray before? - A. I had heard of him; I searched Bray's pocket, I found, I think, twenty-four pieces resembling the half-crowns that Coleman had shewed me before, they were folded up in paper so as not to work off the colour; I found this dollar; he said, it is good; I think it is counterfeit, and this sixpence which I believe is good; when I made further search, I found a seven-shilling piece, and three shillings of the money in his pocket which I had actually marked at the Castle, at Moorgate; I said to Coleman, you have not given me all the marked money; said he, I have not given you the sixpence; I told him to give it to Mr. Clark; I looked at it and found it was the same sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Bray say any thing? - A. Bray said, the old b - y rogue had done him; I went into the coach with him to the Compter, and Oliver went with Bray; I produce the whole of the counterfeit money and the marked money; I marked the money in the presence of all the officers; (the marked money identified by Rogers, and shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You, sir, are employed by the Mint; I will give you first the ten half-crowns that were found on Coleman - Are they all counterfeit? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they correspond with each other? - A. They are of two dies, six of one die and four of another, they certainly correspond with each other.</p>
               <p>Q. Now have the goodness to look at these, these are the twenty-four that were found on Bray, and the dollar? - A. These half-crowns are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there of them? - A. Thirty half crowns, they are all counterfeit, of the same dies as the other, and the dollar is a bad one.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. In the repairing of her, when bolts are pulled out, if they are found serviceable are they made use of again? - A. If they are fit to be drove in again they are used.</p>
               <p>Q. If they are unserviceable they are returned to Government - had any copper bolt been drove out of the ship for the purpose of repair? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he employed on the Powerful? - A. He had been, but not at the time of this transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. On last Monday evening, in consequence of any information, did you watch the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did; a little after seven in the evening, I was walking round the Powerful of seventy-four guns, I observed his brother and him at the stern of the Powerful; I walked towards the head of the ship; soon after I saw the prisoner go on board the seventy-four.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any business to go on board of her? - A. None at all; I immediately went to the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the gate out of which the prisoner must go to get out of the yard? - A. Yes; I stoped at the gate to watch and to stop him; I stopped there a very few minutes; I saw the prisoner at the bar coming towards the gate, and as soon as he saw me, he ran back again; I made towards him, and ordered him to be stopped; immediately he pulled out a bolt from his breast and put it down a cellar window; he kept on; I desired the other people to stop him, he being still in the dock-yard, he was stopped; I saw Mr. Willis pick up the bolt, and I immediately returned and took the bolt from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that the bolt you saw Mr. Willis pick up was the bolt that the prisoner threw down? - A. Yes; I took the prisoner before Mr. Wells; he asked him, what he was going to do with the bolt; he answered, that the people had not paid him his wages for the last month and he had taken this bolt to make up his money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. His Majesty's ship the Powerful is under repair in Mr. Welis's yard - What is the name of the firm? -

L. and if it was his own J. L. this handkerchief is marked T. H. Birch, No. 3. in full length. (The silk handkerchief produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

             sworn. - I live at Willsden, I am the parish-clerk: On Sunday, the 26th of May, I locked up the church, and left it as I usually do; I left a bible and a prayer-book on the Minister's desk, and a prayer-book on my own desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they left there when you locked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100051"/>church up? - A. Yes, I locked the church up at one o'clock at noon on Sunday; on Tuesday morning I was called up at five o'clock, and when I got to the church, I found the door was open, it was unbolted, and the window was broke by the side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the door that you locked? - A. It was not; that door was at the chancel, at the north end of the church, and the door that unlocked was the south door.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a window was this by the side of the chancel-door? - A. A casement, with two upright and two cross iron bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this door bolted when you left the church? - A. Yes, I bolted it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window whole or broken when you left the church? - A. The window was whole, and the bars were all in their places; when I saw it on Tuesday morning, one of the upright bars was drawn out of its place, and one of the cross bars was bent to the bottom, so as to admit any person in, and the glass of the window was pushed into the church; I went into the church, and missed the Minister's bible and prayer-book, and my prayer-book; I did not miss the keys then; I missed several other prayer-books.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time in May last see the prisoner at the bar in that neighbourhood? - A. Yes, on Monday, the 27th of May, about half past five o'clock in the afternoon, he was walking by the side of Willsden church, in the church-yard, against the window under the wall; I saw him, and a woman at a distance from him under the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing afterwards? - A. I saw him turn back; he turned back to the north door, and he peeped into the window under his hat, which he held to keep the fun from his eyes; he came to me while I was putting some hay in a cart, and asked me the way to Harrow, after he had looked into the church; I told him I did not rightly know; I shewed him the church at a distance. Then he asked me if there was any public-house near; I told him there was; I directed him to the Six Bells at Willsden; he had a bundle under his arm in a green curtain, or something that was green.</p>

On Tuesday, the 28th of May last, about twelve o'clock, he came to my lodgings at No. 12, Broad-street, Bloomsbury; he asked me if I would purchase some books; I asked him where they were; he told me at his lodgings. I accordingly went with him to a court in Chick-lane (Wright's-alley, I think it is,) and there he shewed me two folio prayer-books, and one folio bible; I agreed to give him one pound seven shillings for them; I took some books with me at the time; he asked me to purchase them; I told him I had not money enough to spare, and he said he would take some books in exchange; I took with me as many books as came to thirteen shillings and sixpence, and I gave him three shillings in silver, and I promised to give him the half-guinea more in the afternoon, if he called on me for it. He called, and I told him to call in the evening again, as it did not suit me to pay him at that time; I had suspicion that these books had not been come honestly by; I had dealt with him six months before; he said he would call again; in the mean time I went to the Magistrate, and enquired; he came to me in the evening, I was not at home, I was at Bow-street; and the Magistrate ordered two officers to go with me to his lodgings; I left the books at Bow-street; I went with the officers to his lodgings about half past ten o'clock on Tuesday evening.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Bow-street; I produce a bible and two prayer-books, I received them at Bow-street: On the 28th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went with the last witness to the prisoner's lodgings; in searching his lodgings, I found this bunch of keys lying under his wife, between the mattress and the bed, he was in bed with her; his lodging is in some court in Chick-lane, I believe the name of it is not Wright's-buildings; I went by the order of Mr. Bond to Willsden, to try the different locks in the church, and they all fitted the locks on the different pews; there was a particular lock on one pew, and this key opens it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rich.) Are these the books that you took of the prisoner, and took to Bow-street? - A. They are the books that I agreed to give twenty-seven shillings for; I left them at Bow-street.</p>

I, having a little money before hand, came up to London to see if the trade was any better here; finding it not so, I laid my money out in publications, and for the last two years I made a practice of travelling from fair to fair, coming to London in order to buy publications that would suit the country. Coming up this time, I lit of a man in High Holborn as I was going to see my mother-in-law in Oxford-market, his name was

            's, near Smithfield; I had been there about six weeks; I paid him two pounds in notes, and ten shillings in money for them; I went out to get a pot of beer, and in the mean time I was out, my wife said he gave her these keys to take care of them till he returned; I never saw them, this is the truth, and nothing else but the truth. Accordingly, when we parted, I went to Mr. Rich, between eleven and twelve o'clock; he was not at home; his good wife had been lying in; she told me that he would be in in about half an hour, and when he came in, said I to Mr. Rich, you were speaking to me about a bible, I have purchased one of a man that lives near Uxbridge; he told me he was short of money, but he would go down with me to my apartment; I said he should have the bible at one pound four shillings, the new prayer-book at eighteen shillings, and the other at eight shillings, provided he would let me have publications for return of money; he said he could not do that; as we were in a friendly habit of buying I should let him have it at about a pound or so, a guinea or so on, and he would let me have books to make a return: I told him I could not afford them at all at that price; he then stated to me, he would give me books worth 13 s. 6 d. they were new just as they came from the press, and 3 s. 6 d. he paid me in money; some of the books were twelve shillings which he let me have at two; accordingly, he said, if I would go to his house he would give me the remainder; I went to his house about four o'clock, he asked me to come again at six; I went about seven to his house, his wife and the good lady who had taken care of her in her lying in, said, he was not at home, I must call on the day following and they would pay me the money, accordingly I went home and went to bed with my wife, and between ten and eleven o'clock, up comes Mr. Rich; he said, Midgeley, I said, what do you come so late for; I want you, he said; I said, is it necessary to get up; no, he said, it will do in the morning; there were four men laying in the room; one of the officers went to another bed; Mr. Rich said, this is the man that sold me the books; the officer tied my hands; I came along with them to Bow-street with the greatest pleasure; Mr. Rich said, you have brought me into a hobble; I did not know what they took me for; I had no suspicion at all about these books: they put me in a place all night; in the morning they took me to Fulham, and these books along with them; there was a church broken open there; they did not know me or these books to be their property. I came back to Bow-street, then they heard another church was broken open at Willsden; and they sent the books there; I knew nothing of the robbery; I asked them to let me go along with them, they would not give me the opportunity; I have no one to speak in vindication of my cause but myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you told so before you hired her? - A. Yes, by her mistress that she had lived with.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner herself of her being with child? - A. I told her, I had only one objection to her character, and that was on account of her mistress saying she was pregnant; she told me, that the mistress stated that circumstance to prevent her going into any other situation as she wished to keep her herself; she denied being with child; I told her, I would not engage her in my service without she suffered the doctor, that attended my family, to examine her, she said, she had no objection whatever, provided I would take her; I hired her without having her examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing that? - A. I meant to have it done some time after she had been in my service if she encreased in size; she being willing to be examined it removed my suspicion; as such I took her into my service, and she continued with me about two months, during which time, she appeared to have encreased very much in the size of her person; I questioned her concerning it, she constantly denied it; I told her, if she would make me her confident and friend I would do all in my power about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this during the period of the two months or at the end of the two months? - A. During the period of two months; in requesting of her to make me her confident and friend, she at last said, she could not say to the contrary to me that she was not with child; I then made enquiry of her who the father of it was; she said, he resided at Highgate, at Parson-hill, he was a waiter; I told her I would try and get her a letter for the hospital, and after I consulted my friends about it, they thought I had better decline it; I told her if she would go to the parish, I would take her into my service after she got well, and I would do what I could for her: she made me answer, that she had lain in there once before, and she would never do it again if she lay in in the street; at the expiration of two months I was very unwell myself, and the doctor attended me; I begged him to examine her, and I asked his opinion of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the doctor? - A. Mr. Bailey of Salisbury-square; I then called her into the room, he examined her no further than putting his hand on her stomach; I was present, he said that was sufficient; I told her what the doctor's opinion was after he was gone, that she was at least five or six months gone; she said he knew nothing at all about it; she was considerably further gone than that. On Tuesday night, the beginning of June, she was very ill the whole of the day, (she had complained to the people in the house, I knew nothing of it till afterwards); the next morning when she got up, she was very bad indeed, and appeared very languid; at nine on the Wednesday morning I saw her, I told her from her looks I apprehended that there was something more than common the matter with her; she told me she had been very bad all night, she had gone through a great deal; I told her that she appeared very different in her person, and hoped she would not deceive me, but tell me candidly if any thing had happened; she said, no, certainly, there had not, and she certainly was not with-child.</p>
               <p>Q. You told her that she appeared very different in her person? - A. Yes; and she answered she was very much reduced in her size, so far that she could slip through her stays; I then told her that I was certain something particular had happened to her; she begged that I would not disturb myself on that account, for there was nothing particular had happened to her; she continued poorly the whole of the week, and on the Thursday morning I went up into the attic story, there I saw she had washed some sheets, they were hanging in a room on the same floor where we are accustomed to dry in. I asked her what was the reason that she washed her own bed linen, when she knew it was always put out; she made no reply whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any more on that day? - A. I observed her bed not in a very proper state; it appeared as if some one had been in labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the beds to see if they were the proper sheets? - A. I did not look any further, it was not very pleasant to look at, I only turned down the cloaths. On Friday night, about half after eleven o'clock, she went out, I did not see her go out, but in ten minutes after that I heard the street door bell ring, and I rung the parlour bell to enquire who went out, and no one answered; I repeated the ringing of the bell, and asked who it was that rung the street-door bell, she answered it was herself; I desired her to come in to tell me where she had been out to; she would not come in, she said she had been out for some beer; with that I reprimanded her, and told her it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100054"/>not a usual thing in my house for a servant to go out of a night without acquainting me with it, nor would I suffer it; this was on the Friday night; on the Saturday morning she was so bad that she could not get up, at eight o'clock she desired the apprentice to come and tell me; he brought me word that Sarah was very bad, and could not get up. I was very certain that she had been in labour; and as soon as I arose, I went to the prisoner, she was very bad in bed; I then asked her what was the matter with her; she said she was swelled to that degree, that she could not move; I looked at her, she threw the bed-cloaths off from her bosom, and her arms were quite extended, her breasts were quite up to the top of her neck, with the milk that was in her breasts; I told her I was very certain that she had been delivered; she spoke rather impertinent to me, and said, she was quite surprized at my suspicions; with that she removed the bed cloaths, and asked me if I saw a child there. I told her I did not, but I was very certain that she was not delivered on the Saturday; it was on the Tuesday night that she was delivered, I knew the time from the appearance of the things; I then told her she must have murdered the baby, and concealed it. I insisted upon immediately knowing; she answered me there was no one saw her do it, and no one could sware that she did it. I then told her I should send for a medical person, he should be satisfied respecting the delivery, as well as myself; with that she got up, and wanted to go out of the house, we detained her; I sent for Mr. - , he examined her, and said there was every appearance of her being delivered.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon: On Friday the 10th of last June, about a few minutes after eleven o'clock in the evening, a watchman came to my house, upon which I immediately went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you proceed to examine the body? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any warmth in the body at that time? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the child could you judge whether it was a full grown child or no? - A. It appeared to me to be of its full growth; there were no marks of violence upon the body of the child as I could discover.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from appearance that the child had been born alive? - A. It had every appearance of being born alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the state of the lungs? - A. No, I did not conceive it necessary, my attention was drawn entirely to the navel string; I observed the navel string had not been tied as is usual, but that it had been divided by some instrument or other, about four inches from the body of the child; from that I infer, that there might have been an hemorrhage from thence; the extremities of the child were covered with blood, but whether it proceeded from the child or the mother it is not possible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. To what do you impute the cause of the child's death? - A. If the child was born alive, there is no doubt but the child got it's death from the navel string.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say the child was born alive? - A. The child might have died in its birth very probably; death may and does happen by leaving the navel string untied; the child must inevitably have lost a great deal of blood, but whether it died through that, it depends greatly upon the quantity of blood which the child lost, because the hemorrhage might have stopped before the child bled to death.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it not have been an easy thing to have tied up the navel string by a person in her situation? - A. She might do it, but it would not be very convenient.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons in that situation are very frequently in so debilitated a state, and the mind so far affected as to render them incapable of doing it without assistance? - A. True.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a sort of delirium attends labour sometimes? - A. It is the case most frequently after the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately afterwards? - A. No; the child had the appearance as though it had lain in one position for some time; I do not think that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100055"/>tying up the child these things, for a short time, would make it have the appearance that it had; I conceive that the mother might not be conscious that it would produce death to the child by dividing the tunica.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was with child, I was only three or four months gone; I was taken very ill, I was sitting on the water-closet, and something came from me of a great substance.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How was it broken open? - A. It was entered by a pane of glass, which was partly broke in the sash window.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room? - A. In a room attached to the house, a lower room were we kept sundry articles, carpenter's tools, and other things that we had use for; the room was built against the end of the house, it had no internal communication with the house, it was used occasionally for the parlour. On the 4th of July I was sitting up late, I heard some person come past the house between eleven and twelve at night; I heard the gate open, which had been previously bolted, I immediately ran out, and heard footsteps, my sister ran out, and being alarmed by her noise, I could not hear the steps so as to pursue the person it being dark. The next morning the prisoner was brought to our house by a person who is present, with the articles in a cart.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 3d of July had you been in the room? - A. On the 3d of July I had been in the garden adjoining this back room about three o'clock in the afternoon; I then looked in the window, and saw it was shut to.</p>
               <p>- BEGG sworn. - I am a farmer, I live at Hendon: On the 4th of July, about five o'clock in the morning, as I was going into my yard, I saw the prisoner; he had a basket, and a quantity of tools; I stopped him, and took him into my house for about two hours, and his brother came, I sent him down with the tools to Mr. Mutter's, in care of his brother.</p>

This man was taken up on the 5th of July, he told me he had taken them, and if I would go with him, he would go and shew me where he had deposited them; he then led me up the lane, and took the pistols from a hedge; from there he took me to a dunghill, and scratching it about a foot deep he produced a great number of articles in two sacks; I then asked him for the screw-winch, he took me two fields from our house, and took it from a hedge; I asked him the meaning of depositing them in so many places; says he, I was overloaded, and I intended, when I had got sufficient, to have gone to London, and brought a cart and took them all away. I asked him where he lodged, he said in Chapel-street, Tottenham-court-road; I went there and found an axe, which is a different axe to the other, and this saw, they were in his workshop; I found these duplicates on a shelf under a stone in his workshop.

               <p>Q. She went away and left you did she? - A. Yes, she went up the alley and I went after her, but there was no such a person lived there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. At that time I was in St. Clement's workhouse; Mr. Alcock let me out and let me in again; I had only been out to buy a pennyworth of tea.</p>

               <p>Q. How could you send a big girl like that to the workhouse, she is able to get her bread - what business is your husband? - A. A Shoemaker; her father has learnt her to close shoes lately.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On Tuesday night, the 11th of June, me and Bishop went out on duty in the streets; we were in Shoreditch about two o'clock in the morning returning home; on Wednesday morning, the 12th, as we were coming just past the turnpike-bar, within about thirty yards of the bar, I saw the prisoner riding this said horse, it is a bay or a chesnut, I am not a judge of the colours of horses, it was a gelding; he was riding it without a saddle, with this cloth buckled on it, it is a piece of an old horse rug, with an old sirsingle, made of a piece of leather belonging to a coach bridle; he got up to the turnpike-gate, and the bar was shut; I then with Bishop went up to him, I asked him where he was going with that horse; he said he was going to take it into the Borough; I asked him whereabouts there; he said, to Mr. Huggins, at the Catherine Wheel inn; I asked him where he had brought it from; he said, from Kensington; I then asked him from whom at Kensington; he said he could not tell; I told him he must come four miles out of his road to come from Kensington through Shoreditch to the Borough; he said he did not know; I asked him which way he had come; he could not tell, he pointed out some different roads that I did not know the names of; I then asked him if he had any turnpike-tickets that he had passed through to come from there; he said he had, he produced me this ticket; on this ticket is Old Road toll, Ball's Pond, No. 619, with a one on it; one penny it appears to be.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the direct road, supposing he came from Stoke Newington? - A. It is the direct road from the field into town from where these people have told you, and within about four hundred yards distance from the field, and this gate is but a little more than a quarter of a mile from the field. I then told him, without he gave me a better account of it, I must detain him; I then took him to the watch-house; I took the horse to a livery-stable right facing the Office, and left it in the care of the head ostler there. On the next morning I took the prisoner before the Magistrate, and before he was brought to the Office I saw him in the public-house adjoining; I said to him then, Buckman, have you any better account to give of this horse to-day; Bishop was then standing by me; he said, I will now tell you the truth, I met a man at the Catherine-Wheel inn, in the Borough, last night about five o'clock, (meaning on the Tuesday night, this was on Wednesday morning I was asking him,) and the man desired him to go to the Queen's Head, in the Green-lane; he went there, and waited till eleven o'clock; the man did not come while he was waiting, but as he was coming from the house, at a small distance, the man met him, and the man desired him to wait in the road, and he would go and fetch him a horse; he went away from him a little while, and returned to him with this horse, and desired him to take it to the Catherine Wheel inn, in the Borough, to Mr. Huggins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he walked there, or rode there, to the Green-lane? - A. His stockings were so clean, I did not think he walked there; I asked him if he had ever seen him before; he said, never till that day; I asked him if he knew where he lived, and he said, no; the horse was kept three or four days in the stable where it was first put; the officer and we were making inquiry about it, to hear if any body had lost a horse; Mrs. Crawley's foreman inquired first, and when Mrs. Crawley came, the horse was in a square stable, with eight or nine stalls in each angle; there were thirteen or fourteen, or more horses in it; she knew the horse perfectly well, although its tail had been cut considerably since she saw it, and when she called him Jack, he turned his head to her; from the appearance of the horse's tail it had been cut with a knife, by the haggled appearance. I asked the prisoner where he lived himself, and he said, at the Black Horse, at Stockwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he was? - A. He said he had been a post-boy; I asked him what road he had drove, and when I put that question to him, he did not answer me; he said that he came out of Kent formerly, and that he had lodged at this house two years and a half; I then told him I should go and inquire his character; I went there, and could not find him out.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the same horse that you shewed Mrs. Crawley? - A. Yes, the very same.</p>
               <p>- BISHOP sworn. - Q. Do you know any thing more? - A. No; I assisted Vickery in taking him into custody, I heard the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutrix.) The horse that you were shewn by Vickery, are you sure that it is your horse? - A. I am quite certain of it, I could tell it from five hundred.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100059"/>and called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see the note again? - A. On Monday, after the prisoner was examined at Marlborough-street, I made an inquiry, and traced the note to Mr. Watts's, Berwick-street, New-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day was this? - A. The robbery was on Sunday, and on Monday I traced the note and received it of Mr. Watts, in change of another; I produce the note; I always take the number and date of the notes, and when I part with any I scratch them off; the number is 12,480, on the 9th of April; I have them all in parcels; the notes came from the Bank, I am a Treasurer in the East-India House; that note was in the secretary, and the only one that was left; when I get change I have a quantity of notes of following numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not disposed of this note? - A. Yes; I went to my drawer, and took three notes away - two two's and a one; I know I had not disposed of this, by its being the last of the parcel of my own list; I have the list now in my pocket, I mark them off when I pay them away; the mourning ring is a ring of a near relation of mine, it was in a drawer adjoining where the door was broken open.</p>

               <p>Arnold's defence. I have had a slight acquaintance with this young man for some time; one day about three weeks before this robbery occurred, I happened to be going along St. Martin's-lane, I met him, we fell into conversation, and we had two pints of beer together; he told me, he was very glad to see me as he had got something very good in his head, and he would be very glad to see me any day, at that public-house, at his dinner hour, as he was in a hurry then; in the course of two days I called at that public-house; I found him there: he took me then almost to the shop in the Strand and appointed to meet me there about nine o'clock at night, at the time he was shutting up the shop; I went to a court near there at the time appointed to wait, and after he had shut up the shop, we joined company together, and went to a public-house and drank together; then him and me went to his home and fetched two bags, as he said, he had every thing convenient, and he was sure there was no danger; we went back to the house in the Strand, and he by the assistance of a key, went into the house, and being dark, he pulled me in, as I was to stand in the passage while he opened the shop door; there being a padlock and another lock to the shop-door; when he had proceeded so far as to open the padlock, I heard very distinctly some one or other coming down stairs, and I saw a kind of a light upon the stair-case; we both came away and went and drank together; before we parted, he said, he had left the padlock on a ledge in the passage; he hoped it would not be found out; with that, he said, call and see me soon, then I shall be able to let you know what my master says; accordingly, I called in the course of a few days at the same public-house, where I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100062"/>again; he told me, that things went on very well, there was no particular noise made to him as the young ladies were very ignorant and very careless, that he did not suppose they had the least suspicion about it; they were afraid of letting their father know, for fear of getting anger for being so careless in leaving the padlock off (as he imagined they thought that they had left the padlock off) if I would call again in a day or two he would try again; I did call again the next night at shutting up the shop time; we went after the shop was shut and drank together, and then we went and got the bags from his apartment, and he put the key in the door, and there appeared over the door a light, like unto a lighted candle; he pulled out the key, and we ran away and went and drank together; and I said to him, certainly those people have some suspicion, and I am very sorry I ever came to you to do any thing in it; I advised him to let it alone; I parted with him, and did not see him till the Thursday before this affair happened; I certainly called at the house to see him as usual, he told me, there was nothing particular that happened, and there was a better opportunity than ever for the lodgers in the house had gone away, and there was not a soul in the house, and one of his master's was gone out of town; by his persuasions, he advised me to meet him again at night; on the Friday night previous to this robbery, I met him at the usual time when the shop was shutting up, which was the third time, and when he had shut up the shop we went and drank together; he said, he thought it was too soon; I went home with him to his room, and we had some supper there, and we sat there till past ten o'clock; he got his bags and we both came to this house; he opened the outer-door, and the shop door; he desired me to stand where he placed me with the bag open, and receive the things from him; when the bags were pretty well full, he said, there was some money in the till, and he would be d - d but he would have that; he opened the till, and said, there was no money in there but a bad shilling, which he threw away; we went away, and took the goods to his room, he gave me one of these bags and he took the other, and we looked over the goods, there were twenty pair of boots, and fourteen or fifteen pair of shoes, I think; I staid in his room all night as he recommended me, and then he said, he should go in the morning to work as usual, left there should be any suspicion, notwithstanding, he thought it would be unsafe to leave the things in his apartment; he recommended me to take a part away and he would take another part to a friend's to sell them for him, he told me to take them where they were safe or to sell them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take him? - A. No, not then; there were three or four with him; one of them came up to me with a stick half as thick as my wrist, and hustled me up against a hoard, and would not let me pursue any further; I immediately holloaed out stop thief; the second one came up, and there was a person pursued him, seeing how I was used, who had seen all the transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the other man do? - A He caught hold of me by the left side of the collar, and said, I have got him, here he is.</p>
               <p>Q. He caught hold of you? - A. Yes, as the thief, and said, I have got him; there were two that hustled me up against the hoard of a building; this was the third man; there was another close to him, and he stood against me in case I resisted.</p>

               <p>Q. There were four in all? - A. Yes; says I, if this is the case, let me see where the property is; then I turned back to the trunk, and the person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100063"/>who crossed the way and pursued the prisoner brought him back; the prisoner is very remarkable, having his legs turned out, and being knock-knee'd; I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>- FINDLEY sworn. - On Saturday, the 22d of June, I was returning from Portland-street; I saw three fellows, one of them seemed very much intoxicated; they were all reeling to and fro in the street, particularly Harrison; he passed Howland-street, and came to a trunk-maker's; I saw him go into this shop; I had great suspicions of the fellow from his appearance, I took particular notice of him; he went into the shop, and came out in about a minute or two afterwards; he went on some paces to his companions, and after he had spoken to them he returned and went a second time into the shop; he went in a third time, and stepped on the threshold of the door, and when he stepped down he walked to a trunk that was out of doors; he put his right arm round it, and walked off with it; the man came out of the shop, and went after him; the fellow looked half round, he did not drop it then, but when he found the man was coming very near him, he dropped the trunk and ran down Berwick-street; he was laid hold of by somebody, and brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the man that did it? - A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming down Oxford-street on the day that gentleman mentions, but I never went into Mr. Wyer's shop at all; I heard a hue and cry of stop thief, and I ran like the rest; in consequence of which I was laid hold of by some gentleman; I know no more of it than that gentleman does of being high priest in a Jew's synagogue.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were they lying when he came into the shop? - A. They were in the glass case when he came into the shop; I had taken them from the glass case, and shewn them to the woman; they were lying on the counter when he took them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, he has lodged with me in a fictious name about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he come with? - A. He came with the name of Franklin.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know which is his real name? - A. Before the Magistrate in Marlborough-street he gave the name of Fountain, and on a letter that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100064"/>came to him it was addressed Fountain; I lent him two shillings to pay for the postage of that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take the money from? - A. Out of the till behind the counter; I left the key in the drawer, and when I let the postman out of the shop, I went to my sister to let her know that she must take care of the shop while that man was there while I was out; as I was going out, and while I went to call her, the prisoner was in the shop, and he took the money out of the till, it was in a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you there which he took in your purse? - A. Five guineas, six half-guineas, and seven seven-shilling pieces, and thirty shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the money since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that nobody else came into the shop in the mean time? - A. Nobody else could come in, I had bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came into the shop did you find the purse was gone? - A. In about ten minutes, the prisoner was then in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain in the house after you had missed it? - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any steps to secure him? - A. No, I was not positive it was gone, I thought I might have left it in another place; I did not think he would have the assurance to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are not quite sure that you left the money in the till? - A. I was not at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be more sure of it now that you were at the time? - A. I was sure of it in a quarter of an hour afterwards that it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that it was there at all? - A. Yes, I did, by taking the purse, and giving him two shillings out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the purse to see what was in it, when you gave him the two shillings which you had taken out of it? - A. No, I knew what was in it before; I was certain of the money, because I had it to go and lay it out in shop goods.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the prisoner apprehended? - A. The Monday after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The day this man lost his purse I was absent; on the Monday following he had me taken up; I have lodged with him about three weeks, I was in the parlour talking to his sister at the time he went out to get the warrant to take me up; I am as innocent as the child unborn; he took me up on suspicion, he searched me, and found no money on me.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know that she had got in? - A. A neighbour in the next room told me; she had fastened the door with this poker, and when I got in, she told me to do my best and my worst, I should find nothing on her; I found her sitting in the room with a piece of my bed-gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your things? - A. They were outside of the door on the landing-place; my neighbour rapped at the door, she would not let her in; I went to my landlord, he got in at the window, and let me in.</p>
               <p>- COOMBES sworn. - On Saturday, the 29th of June, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was fetched to No. 22, Back Church-lane; when I went up stairs, I saw the prisoner in Messenger's room, and this bundle was on the outside of the room on the landing-place; the staple of the door had been drawn out, and it was lying loose on the floor; I took her down stairs, and searched her; she had nothing on her but this ribbon and this thread rolled together down her bosom; she said that the woman that was with her had gone away with the rest of the things; I produce the things that I found - a pair of shoes, a hat, a piece of check cloth, and a ribbon.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About half past three o'clock, I came from Milk-street with an acquaintance; she said to me, Mrs. Clarke, will you come along with me, and have a cup of tea; I said, no, I thank you; she said, about a quarter of an hour before she went up, she should be obliged to break her door open; I said, I will not come up; she said, you may come up; I went up and sat down, and she took a piece of coarse cloth off the table, and said, I am going to buy two mackerel; she said she would not stay long, for if her husband came up, he would kill me and her; says she, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100065"/>will kick you down stairs; I staid in the room till she got down stairs; there was an alarm made, and they kept me in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a young woman with you? - A. Yes, she went out of doors at the same time; I counted my money up, and put it in my waistcoat pocket, and put it under the bed; while they were gone, the woman came in, and Mrs. Wayland directly after her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the girl? - A. She was along-side of me in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you? - A. Half a pint of gin and half a gallon of beer; I had a drink of beer, then I told her never to mind me, but to help herself; I laid on the bed, and Mrs. Wayland came to the bed looking for something; I asked her what she wanted; she said, never mind me, child, mind yourself; I turned to the girl alongside of me, I never had any thoughts of her taking my money till about eighteen minutes afterwards; then I started up in the bed, and looked for my waistcoat and my money, and neither could be found; I challenged her for my money, and I demanded my money of her, and no money could be found, but a deal of abuse; she went to the bed, and sat on it; I searched for my waistcoat, and my waistcoat was found where she was sitting; she sat up all this time with a great coat on; I never found my money nor my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the young woman that was lying with you? - A. She could not take it.</p>

Finding her hand had been in the right hand pocket, I suspected that it also might have been in the left; I put my hand into my left hand pocket to see if it was gone, and she had taken it; when I put my hand there, I found what I thought to be the half-guinea and the shilling, but I did not take any notice to her; then I walked away with her, and I gave her in charge to the first watchman that I met, which was in Dean-street; he took her to St. Ann's watch-house, and she was searched, and nothing was found upon her but the bad sixpence which I had had in my pocket seven or eight days, and that which I supposed to be the half-guinea in my pocket was a bad farthing, which had not been there before.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure now that you have lost the collar? - A. I saw my master put it on one of Mr. Johnson's horses on the 22d or 24th of June; Mr. Johnson is a farmer in West-garden, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the collar? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; the man is here that made it for us; I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Can you swear to it? - A. By that hole there, and by two little pieces here; I know I have had the collar in my hand several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not other collars that are used that have these particular marks? - A. I have had the collar so often in my hands that I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. They are two different transactions, we will take that the last - you found that by a duplicate? - A. Yes, in Sims's lodgings; we missed this saw about three months ago; we took Sims up first; on the 2d of July we took Sims at the public-house, and then I went with Chapman to search the lodgings; we found this duplicate of the saw; Sims said he was very sorry he had so many duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lodge with him? - A. Yes, Watson; they both denied any knowledge of the saw when we charged them with it; I found the saw by the duplicate found in the lodging of the prisoners at the top of Hatton-wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was this saw your partner's property, or the property of yourself? - A. The property of my partner and myself.</p>

He told wrong of my taking it out of the shop; when I took the saw I was working in Kentish Town; I wanted money, he never came nigh me the next day; I worked all day, I thought he would come to assist me, and he never came; I took one of the saws, I thought it proper, to get me a bit of bread; I bought myself a quartern loaf and half a pound of butter, I can take my sacrament oath on it; my wife died, and he buried her, I paid him ten shillings a week out of my wages.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that lead you to look after the prisoners, Collett and Frewin? - A. Yes, on Saturday morning, I found them at the Buffalo's Head in the New Road; Spencer was with me; we were waiting outside of the house; they both came out together, and Collett had Marcham's hat on his head; on our endeavouring to take them, Frewin ran away; Spencer pursued him; I laid hold of Collett, he struggled very much and dragged me across the road; he pulled a knife out, and he stabbed at my face several times; I drew back and he stabbed me in the sleeve; I nevertheless secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut you at all? - A. No, he cut at me with full vengeance, I let go of him, I drew back and he ran the knife against a brick wall, and broke it; and with the assistance of

             I took him and brought him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any message you received from Collett did you go to the prisoner Lander? - A. I went to Lander on the 17th of June; his father told me, he would tell me where the things were if I would go with him.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a father coming; I do not like to introduce a father; it is not the nature of a father to go and give evidence against his son, unless he thought his son would be benefited by it; here one man makes a promise, and then that man is not a witness, and the other witness makes a confession who is a father; the prosecutor ought to produce that man who heard the original confession from the prisoner who is not a father; we will not make the father the instrument to convict his son.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you present when Collett was brought to Marlborough-street office, the day after he was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Collett said a search warrant was taken out and Lander's premises were searched? - A. Yes, and at Lander's apartments, No. 11, Compton-street, St. Giles's, I found two snaffle bridles and a chaise bridle; I asked him if he knew any thing of buying two saddles; one of the saddles was with spring stirrups, and it had got W marked on the buttons, and the other saddle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100071"/>had new stirrup leathers; he said he knew nothing of any saddles; I looked over the room, it is up two pair of stairs, I suppose there were twenty saddles there; he went to Marlborough-street office with me; he was discharged that day to come the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you any thing that day? - A. Yes; at the Marlborough's Head he asked me to have something to drink; he said, I shall get up in the chaise and ride with you, and as we were riding together, he said he recollected very well the saddles, he sold them to one Mr. Williams, he lodged at the Black Horse in Little Rathbone-place; he recollected buying them of a little short man.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that, did you go to Mr. Williams? - A. Yes, he had sold them to a gentleman's coachman; Lander went with me to him, and there I found them; the next day Lander came to the Office, and Collett was brought there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with Shurety to the lodgings of Lander, and find these bridles? - A. Yes; and Shurety asked Lander if he knew any thing of the saddles; Lander said, he knew nothing of the saddles; I received the saddles from Shurety.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Shurety). The hat that was left in the stable, did it belong to Collett? - A. This is the hat I found in the stable, I gave it to Lovett, I noticed it the night before on Collett's head; he had a sore ear, and there is on the side of it the blood that came from it. On this saddle there is W on the buttons; Lander told me he sold the saddles for 3 l. 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. First he told you he had bought none? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. He did not recollect it then; afterwards, instead of putting them out of the way, he produced them to you? - A. Yes; he said he recollected who he sold them to.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you hear Lander say what he gave for the things? - A. He said he agreed to give 25 s. Collet said he never had more than five shillingsworth of halfpence for the whole lot.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Williams). Did you buy any saddles of Lander? - A. Yes; I gave Lander 3 l. 5 s. for them, I sold them for 3 l. 15 s. I delivered them to Shurety.</p>
               <p>Collett and Lander left their defence to their Counsel.</p>
               <p>Frewin was not put on his defence.</p>
               <p>Lander called five witnesses, and Collett one, who gave them a good character.</p>

Yes; we supposed that the people that took the lead could not be far off; we searched the summer-house from whence it was taken, and we searched the wood adjoining, and in the wood the prisoner and his wife were found sitting; at the time that I came up they had got the prisoner; I looked round and saw both the sacks of lead.</p>

Yes, the prisoner looked very hot; I asked him, what he did there, and whether he had been walking with that woman; he said, he had; I said, if he had he could not sweat so, the woman was cool sitting in the wood, he said did you never sweat so.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this wood from this summer-house? - A. Not a quarter of a mile, it all joins; the prisoner was sitting between two parcels of lead, one was three yards off, and the other was five yards off; I apprehended him.</p>

Yes; there were several pieces lost at different times; on the 16th, I searched the building all over, it had been a heavy rain in the morning; in the afternoon between one and three, I got out of the building; I followed the footsteps into the wood, and there I met with the prisoner, Bowman, at the bottom of the wood, I knew him, and he gave three whistles; there were two more men in the wood putting lead in the sacks, they climbed over the pails and got from me; I gave the prisoner into custody; I went and searched for the other men, I could not find them.</p>

This seems to be a most unfortunate building - you did not see the prisoner in company with the other men, and they were the persons that had the lead in their possession, they were putting the lead into the sacks, he was not doing any thing with the lead; they ran away; you thought you had better take somebody than nobody to bring to your master? - A.

            ; I asked her if the watch belonged to her, and she said it did; she told me she had had it for three weeks, and she had brought it with her from Chatham. A young man that was standing in company with us told her she had stole it in the course of the night, and had picked some young man's pocket of it; her answer to that was, were you in our place you would do the same; upon that I stopped the watch, and I immediately went to one of the officers belonging to Marlborough-street, and he told me to bring it to the Office by eleven o'clock in the morning. About eight o'clock on the Monday morning, the owner of the watch came with one of the girl's mother and one of the officers of Queen-square; he owned the watch, and the mother of the girl wanted to give me five shillings, and to take the property out of my hands; I told the officer, no, I would not give it up till I gave it up before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that passed between you and him, did he go home with you that night? - A. Yes, he slept along with my fellow-servant at Lady Holland's house; we had a dance.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out in the morning? - A. About a quarter before seven in the morning; we went then to the Horse and Groom at <placeName id="t18050710-80-crimeloc447">Twickenham</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. You asked him to look at the watch? - A. I will not be sure whether he asked me, or I him; he put the watch in his pocket after looking at it, it was engraved on both cases; I said to him, Gardner, what do you put it in your pocket for, why do not you give it me, it is nonsense to put it in your pocket; he said, I will give it to you, do you think I want to keep it; then we walked up the garden, and went to the Three Tuns; I called for a pint of beer, and paid for a glass of gin a-piece, it was fair-time; he got up, and said, I shall go out, I will be in again in a minute; he never returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How long after that was it before you saw him? - A. The next morning, his master brought him to me about eleven o'clock; I said, Gardner, where is my watch; he said to me, I do not know, if I had it I lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you find it again? - A. No, I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you both drunk then, or only one of you? - A. We had had only sixpennyworth of liquor in gin and porter at the Three Tuns, that would not make any body drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you at the Horse and Groom? - A. We did not drink any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return to Lady Holland's house? - A. At half after two; she was out when we had the dance, and gave us leave to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get leave of the Lady to bring home people to sleep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did very wrong; I think you deserve to lose your watch - whether this man is guilty, or no, that is another thing - was it a silver watch, or a gold watch? - A. A silver watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came out of Mrs. Dyner's house, did I not give you the watch in the lane - I am conscious that I gave you the watch again? - A. No; I asked you for it at the public-house before you went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you come over to me, and say, if I would sign a paper, you would not take any further notice - you said if I would only put my own initials to pay you at six months? - A. That was when you came to me on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What night was it when you had the dance? - A. On Friday night the 24th of May; on the Saturday I lost my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why did not you take him up when he came to you on the Sunday? - A. I did not wish to take him up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the man known to any of your fellow servants? - A. I do not know that he is known by any of them, he was partner to one of the young men in the house that night.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. The prosecutor applied to me to recover his watch on the 5th of June; I was engaged at the time, and could do nothing for him till the 10th of June; I went to his lodgings, I found him at home; the prosecutor was with me; I took him to a neighbouring public-house; we had agreed to go there to see Mr. Minitt, as the prisoner said he would agree to settle every thing as Mr. Minitt should settle the affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Addison charge him with having taken the watch? - A. Yes, the prisoner denied it; he said if he had the watch, he must have lost it, - after he left the Three Tuns, he fell asleep somewhere, he did not know where. The prosecutor told him he was perfectly sober, and insisted that he had taken it away, and the prisoner insisted that he had not made away with his watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor called on me two or three times, and wanted me to pay for the watch, or if I would sign a bond for four pounds, he would be satisfied; I would not do it, as I knew that I had not made away with it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose the articles mentioned in the indictment? - A. Yes, on the 1st of June; the man that took them away carried my box, and I followed him; they were in my possession till I employed him to carry them home for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round - is that the man at the bar that you employed to carry your things? - A. He has got his appearance, he is not now drest in the same way he was then; it is not possible for me to say, but he is the size of that man, it may be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he is the man, or is not? - - A. I cannot say; I was in search of a lodging in the dusk of the evening, and being a stranger in the neighbourhood, I asked the man if he could inform me of one; he said he would take me to his house, and he carried my trunk for me; my clothes were in a large trunk, and a great many more things in it than is expressed in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to the man, or the man to you, seeing you with a trunk? - A. I applied to the man; he was going to take me to his house, and he carried the trunk before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it you saw the man to whom you entrusted these things - was it near the workhouse? - A. No, not very near there.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go before you missed him? - A. I cannot say; I missed him at the turn of a corner, I never saw him again till I saw him at the Public-office; he did not tell me where he was going to take my trunk to; it was a week, or several days, before I saw him again at the Public-office, then he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of your things again that your trunk contained? - A. Yes, some of them; I knew them when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the value of those things? - A. I cannot say the value of those things; the best of my things were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Are they worth twelve shillings? - A. Some pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect the person of the prisoner when you saw him at the Public-office - was his hair cut off them? - A. No, I could not say with certainty then; it might be the man; he has altered his dress every time that I saw him.</p>
               <p>- PARSONS sworn. - I am a butcher, I live in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that woman? - A. Yes, I saw that woman on the Tuesday after the robbery; on Saturday night, the 1st of June, about half after ten o'clock, the watchman came to my house, and brought a large trunk with him; I told him to take it to the watch-house, and while he went there, I was passing by the door of Mr. Levi, he keeps a clothes-shop; I looked into the shop, and I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100078"/>some clothes lying on the counter, and the prisoner standing at the counter by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend to what was passing between the prisoner and Levi? - A. No; I went back to my wife, and told her what I had seen; she told me to go to Mrs. Levi's, and tell them not to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went into the shop, and cautioned Mrs. Levi not to buy them? - A. Yes, and Mrs. Levi said to the prisoner she thought he had not come honestly by the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the clothes then lying on the counter? - A. Yes, and they were women's clothes; the prisoner answered, they were his Peg's, he sold them as he wanted to bury her decently; he was going to take them off the counter, and I prevented him, I told him if the clothes were his, and he could bring people to prove that the clothes belonged to him, he might have them, not else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go away then? - A. Yes, he went out, and never came back again; the things were left at Mrs. Levi's till the prosecutrix was found out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present afterwards when these things were produced before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, the prosecutrix claimed them; she said they were some of the things that were in her trunk; the Magistrate censured my conduct, as being head-borough of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. You behaved honestly, though you did not behave knowingly - have these things that was produced to Levi been kept separate from others? - A. (Coombes.) I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never mentioned those words the witness has said.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you agree about the price? - A.

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, by passing up and down our place; he said, she was dead, he sold the things as he wanted to bury her decent; the prisoner said he would go and fetch a witness to prove the truth of what he said.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Saturday evening, the 1st of July, it might be about eight o'clock, I went to Mr. Davis's, the White Swan; I commonly go there every night when I have done my work; about half after nine o'clock a man came into the house with a bundle of clothes under his arm, apparently to me he was a soldier; he asked me whether I knew of a place where he could sell these clothes; he said, they were his wife's, she was deceased, and he had come out of the country; I told him I had lived in the neighbourhood a great many years, I was not accustomed to selling clothes, I never did sell any clothes in my life; he asked me to take them and sell them for him; I took them to Mr. Levi's, and during the time I was there, Mr. Parsons came in, and he said there was a trunk found, and that these things were stolen; I told Mr. Parsons I had them of a man who was waiting for me at Mr. Davis's; I had leave to go and fetch the man; I went back to Mr. Davis's, and brought the man out with me, and lost sight of him just by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Parsons.) Did this man, in your hearing, say that he had received them from a man to sell? - A. I never heard him say any such thing till Saturday week, when he was before the Justice; I am sure he did not say so in Levi's house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Norris.) Did he say at Levi's that he had got them from a man to sell? - A. He said that he came to sell them as his own deceased wife's.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you give any information against the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did to the officers at Shadwell, to Rogers, Brown, and others.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information that you had given against the prisoner at the bar, on the 12th of June, what did you do? - A. I went to the prisoner's house on the 12th of June, in Norwich-court, Fetter-lane, under the direction of the officers; the prisoner was at home, and her husband was with her, he was cleaning his boots; he is a post-boy; I asked her if she had got any things, meaning bad money; it is the general term we use; she said I might have plenty; she asked me how many I wanted; I told her I had not got much money to purchase many now; but in the evening, if she would produce me a half piece, I would purchase them; they call half a piece twenty; and if you buy half a piece they give you twenty-one for it: I appointed to meet her in the evening at seven o'clock for the half-piece; I told her they were not for me, but they were for one of the Brentford coachmen: her husband asked me if I knew several of the Brentford coachmen; I said, yes, I told him several of their names; he then said, I know they do something in that way; I asked her if I might have them at the time, and she said I might; I left her, and then went to Mr. Rogers and the other officers, and told them what I had done; we all appointed to meet at seven in the evening. We then met at the Tweed-side-house, in Middle-row, Holborn; there we went into a private room; Mr. Rogers marked some money, which was four shillings, in the presence of Brown, Oliver, and myself; he delivered them to me; I put them into my pocket, I had no more money; he said, if I could bring her down to that house, it would be much better; I told him I thought I could; I went then to her apartment, leaving the officers at the Tweed-side public-house; she was at home by herself; then I asked her if what I came for were ready, she said they were; I asked her if she would step to a public-house just by, the person that I wanted them for was there; she said, she would, she would not put on her cloak; she went with me just as she was; we went to the Tweed-side-house, and when I went into the tap-room, I said my friend is not here, we will have a pint of beer, sit down; she sat down, and we had a pint of beer; I said, as he is not here for the half piece, I will have a few for my own use; she asked me how many I would have; I told her I had money enough for eight, which was four shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did you first learn what was the price of them? - A. When I first learned the trade, I knew the price of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at all agreed with her what should be the price of them? - A. Yes; I had bought of her before; sixpence a piece was the common price of them; she made some little scruple of dealing in the tap-room, because there was a person or two there; I told her they would not know our business, with that she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a paper under the table, and produced eight, and I gave her the four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those the four shillings that Rogers gave you? - A. The very same; she said she could not stop, she got up to go out, because the coachman did not come; as she was getting up, Brown laid hold of her arm, and said, madam, please to walk this way; Brown saw all the transaction, he came in as a stranger, and called for a pint of beer, and did not sit ten yards off; he laid hold of her, and put her in the private room, where the other officers were, and myself along with her; there they searched her, and I saw them take more than twenty from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one search you? - A. Yes; they searched me, and found the eight I had received from this woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose you have told all the truth, and nothing but the truth? - A. Yes; I do not know that I have said any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you did tell the prisoner every thing but the truth, not one lie or stratagem to get hold of her? - A. If I had told her what I had come about, she would not have let me had a shilling; I told her a falsehood in the first place, the coachman did not want any, and in the next place I did not want any for myself, I only wanted to convict the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You told two falsehoods for one purpose, to convict the woman - what are you to get for it? - A. I do not know that I shall get any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never get any thing for prosecuting any other person? - A. I never got any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect something? - A. As I am a working man, I expect something as wages, I leave it to the generosity of those who employ me.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you are to be paid as you do your work; so much if you convict, and so much if you do not; you say you do not know what you are to be paid - is that one of your truths? - A. That is the truth according to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to tell me what you are, what sort of a journeyman you are? - A. I am a wire-drawer.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100080"/>Q. Do you earn any thing at all at it now? - A. At times, when there is any thing to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not had any lately? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The wire-drawing business has been a slack business lately? - A. I can maintain myself by sitting at home.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish I could do that? - A. I cannot get so much by sitting at home as I can by going abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that is a truth - how long is it ago since you worked at the wire-drawing trade? - A. Less than a month past.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have not got your livelihood any other way? - A. I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not suppose me to be an old acquaintance - you have come here now again to day, I ask you have you done any thing else to get a livelihood? - A. I am a thread lace-weaver.</p>

               <p>Q. Am I to suppose that you have got your livelihood by that, or worked at it by way of amusement - who do you sell your lace to? - A. I sell it to people in the neighbourhood, and to my own acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you deal with any shop-keeper? - A. The quantity is so little that I make, it is not worth the notice of any dealer.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have us understand you got your livelihood by that? - A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you work for in the wire-drawing business? - A. Mr. Oliver, in Love-lane, Wood-street; I could work for him to morrow if he had any to do, I worked for him less than a month past.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you yourself been taken up for doing any thing in the smashing way? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what the smashing way of business is, the Jury do not understand it so well as I do? - A. Buying bad money of those that make them and pass them on the public.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have been getting your livelihood when you were abroad in passing bad money on honest tradesmen, you are not ashamed to tell me so? - A. I am ashamed of it and determined to leave it off.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - A. I am fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. High time to leave it off - have you been in custody for smashing? - A. I was for eight or nine days; they could find no bill against me, I had only one bad shilling against me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many more did you accuse afterwards besides this prisoner? - A. Two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe in God? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the 9th commandment, Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour; and the 8th, Thou shalt not steal; you knew that before you used to pass bad money? - A. Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew it then when you went to this woman's house, when you told her that a coachman was the man that you wanted this half-piece for, that was not true? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officers search you? - A. I do not know whether they did or not, they might rub me down, I do not think that they put their hands into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the money was marked in your presence, do you know for what purpose the money was marked? - A. They desired me to look as well as the others, and for all of us to be particular to know it again when it was found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of giving confirmation to the evidence, do you know that the fact was so? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You cannot get him to swear to a purpose of theirs? - A. I am not an officer, I do not know their business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Whether you did not give her that bad money which the officers found upon her, with a view that it should be found upon her? - A. I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Q. So you would have me to understand you cannot ascertain what you are to have for this prosecution? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Has any body promised you any precise sum towards what you have done? - A. Not a halfpenny, not a promise of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You expect they will pay you? - A. Yes, for my time and trouble.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer belonging to Shadwell? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand that you and the other officers employed Coleman for the purpose of going to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes, we did so. On the 12th of June, I, Brown, Oliver, and Coleman, all met at the Tweed-side public-house, and in the parlour there I gave Coleman four good shillings; I marked them and shewed them to all the officers and to Coleman: in order that they might be satisfied afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire Coleman to go to the prisoner's house? - A. I did; and we waited at the Tweed-side house till we got further intelligence.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see Coleman? - A. In a few minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour, I did not see him come back, I was in the parlour; I desired Brown, when I understood he was come, to go into the room and have a pint of beer, because he was not so much known as I was; in a very short time, Brown came to the parlour-door with the prisoner, and delivered her into my possession, and Oliver brought Coleman to me he being out of the parlour sooner than I was; I laid hold of the prisoner and I conceived there was something in her hand; in a piece of paper that was in her hand I found twenty-one pieces of bad silver; I then searched her pockets, and found in one of her pockets, two bad shillings in another piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100081"/>of paper, all resembling each other in my opinion; I searched the other pocket and found the four marked shillings which I had previously given to Coleman; I saw Brown take eight shillings from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. They were bad shillings were they? - A. Yes; I asked Coleman how he came by it, in the hearing of the woman; he told me, that he received them from that woman; I asked her was it true, she said, all the money she had she received from Coleman, good, bad, and indifferent; she spoke generally; she said, I received all from that man; I then asked her particularly respecting the marked money; she said, the four shillings as well as the other money she had from Coleman; I asked Coleman if he got the eight shillings which Brown took from him of the prisoner; he said, he had; I asked her if that was true; she gave me no answer; we then took her to the Office; I produce the money, I have kept them all separate in paper, and marked the papers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This fellow, Coleman, you have known for some time? - A. No, very shortly; he was no acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. I am very glad of it - you did not search him? - A. Indeed I did not think it was necessary, he had no money about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not in the tap-room at the time this woman was there? - A. No; Brown was; I found the twenty-one shillings in her hand; she said, she had it from Coleman just before.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the money in her hand which might have come from Coleman, it was not found in her pocket? - A. I cannot say any thing to it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are likewise an officer of Shadwell? - A. I am; I remained at the Tweed-side house till Coleman returned with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from them while they sat in the tap-room? - A. Something closer than I am to you; I was in a different box and sitting right facing of them, just within the door.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was very near them? - A. Yes; just room enough for one person to pass; I saw the prisoner at the bar and Coleman having some conversation together; I called for a pint of porter while I sat there; I observed Coleman and she had passed something between them at the edge of the table.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was it at the edge of the table or under the table? - A. Rather under the table.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. At that time you could not tell what they were passing? - A. I could not; I saw Coleman take his hand from her, and he clasp it up in this way; Coleman got up and she likewise, they both came out from between the boxes, and as she was coming out I took hold of her hand and called for Rogers, and Oliver to come; I took her to the parlour-door and gave her to Mr. Rogers: Coleman stood close to me, I took hold of his hand and these are the eight shillings I took from him; I said to Coleman, when I took hold of his hand, what have you got there; Coleman answered, that is the money I got from that woman; the woman said, that she knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At the first, when Coleman said the money he had got, he got from the woman, what was the answer that she made? - A. At that time she made no answer; she said afterwards, that that man gave her all the money that she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she was searched by Rogers, you say she gave some answer, do correct yourself and let us know what passed? - A. The words that passed were these, when I took the money out of Coleman's hand, I asked Coleman how he came by it: he said, that he had it from that woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say if she did say any thing? - A. She did not say any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When Rogers searched her did she say any thing then? - A. She said, she had the four shillings that Mr. Rogers found upon her from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she said any thing to Rogers, did she say any thing else? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. She described that she had all the counterfeit money from Coleman, and the four shillings marked money? - A. She did; we took her in a coach and brought her away to Shadwell-office; I have had these eight shillings in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mr. Brown, who employed you in this scheme? - A. Mr. Coleman came to me, he gave the first information.</p>
               <p>Q. And you concerted the plan with Coleman and the other officers? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask you what you get in cases of this sort? - A. I have nothing to the best of my knowledge; I have not received any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you expect? - A. I do not expect any thing but what they please to allow me.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have been employed by the Mint for a great number of years - look at these eight shillings that were brought with the four? - A. They are all counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear to be of the same manufactory? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the twenty-one which were taken out of the hand of the prisoner? - A. They are all counterfeit, and all of the same manufactory, and these two are of the same description which were taken out of the woman's pocket. (The money shewn to the Jury.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you employed by Rogers and the other officers on the 13th of June at the Red-Lion, to go to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Rogers, or any of them mark any money and give you any money? - A. Yes; they marked five shillings in my presence at the Red-Lion, Red Lion-street, Whitechapel; Rogers, Oliver, and Brown, were there; I went to the prisoner's house in <placeName id="t18050710-85-crimeloc471">Old Castle-yard, Whitechapel, or Old Castle-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did the officers go with you? - A. Yes, to the door, as near as they possibly could, without being perceived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner then? - A. Yes, she was at home, and her servant, who is somewhere about thirteen or fourteen years old; I asked her if she had got any goods; she said, yes; this was in the back room, she keeps a chandler's shop, but she has not opened it yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Goods is a cant term for shillings and sixpences? - A. She knew what I meant perfectly; she asked me how many I wanted; I told her; she then asked me if I had seen any of her crooks, meaning sixpences; shillings she called shans.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew crooks meant sixpences? - A. Yes, I knew what she meant; she pulled a great quantity of sixpences, which were in paper, out of her pocket; I told her I would have eight crooks; she said they were threepence a-piece; I told her I would have two shans.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she deliver you six sixpences and two shillings? - A. Yes, and I gave her three shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were these three shillings a part of the five that Rogers had given you? - A. They were; I had no other money about me than the five shillings that Rogers had given me; when I was coming away, she asked me if I did not want any seven-shilling pieces, (they call them spangles); I told her I did not; she said they were very good ones, they would come as high as four shillings a-piece, they were such as nobody would refuse; I asked her then, if I called to-morrow, if she should have any more; she said she should.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew you had not bought all her stock then? - A. No, only she had so many customers; I came out then to the officers who were waiting in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any signal to them? - A. Yes, I returned back, and Brown followed me in immediately, and the rest of the officers; Brown ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100083"/>up to her, and laid hold of her hand in my presence, and asked her what she was about; he began to search her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing? - A. She gave no answer to Brown's question; I do not justly know what passed then; they searched me, and found eight bad sixpences and two bad shillings, and the two marked shillings that were left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I had your character last night - I think you told me that you was a wire-drawer, a lace-maker, and a smasher? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the prisoner's house for the purpose of buying bad money - had you been acquainted with the prisoner's husband? - A. I had not seen him above once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen him often enough to get into his debt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not purchase a table-cloth of him? - A. I never bought any thing of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care, Mr. Coleman, did you never buy a table-cloth of the prisoner nor her husband? - A. I never saw one in the possession of them, only when the house was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they search the house when they searched the prisoner? - A. Yes, and they found a tablecloth; I do not know that I should know the husband, if I met him in the street; I never saw the husband above twice, that was when they lived in Rosemary-lane; I have seen the woman several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to her house the first time, she was not at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time, how many persons did you see there? - A. A little girl and her.</p>

               <p>Q. It was on the ground-floor adjoining the shop? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. It is altogether a little place, so that you can hear what is said in the shop or the parlour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. Between five and six in the evening, it was quite light; I cannot say there was not any body else there, but I did not see any other woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot see very well, I suppose - will you swear that there were not two women in the shop at the time? - A. There was not a soul in the shop or the parlour as I saw but the prisoner, the girl, and me; the shop-door was a-jar.</p>
               <p>Q. When you go to people to buy articles of this sort, as you are acquainted with the trade, do you generally deal in public or in private - you, I should suppose, wish no person to be present? - A. Except it is some in the trade, and they do not care if there is half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever buy articles of this sort before servants? - A. Yes, because they are privy to it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the servants are as bad as the mistress? - A. The girl saw what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then openly before the servant this woman, you would have me to understand, exposed herself to the danger you brought her into? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask the woman to keep a parcel for you, and you would call again, and give her three shillings as part in payment, and give her all the bad money in the paper? - A. I know nothing at all of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. You, together with Brown and Oliver, went to this Red Lion public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark any money, and give it to Coleman? - A. I did, five shillings, in the presence of the officers; I shewed the marks to the officers and to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go and station yourselves about the house of the prisoner? - A. I stood at a distance; the other officers went nearer the house than me.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had stationed yourselves about the house, how long afterwards was it that Coleman gave you a signal? - A. Not many minutes; Brown went in first, and when I went in, Brown had hold of the prisoner's hands; I desired him to search what she had in her lap; he searched her apron and her pockets, and he gave me the marked money which I had before given to Coleman; I desired him to take care of the bad money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he taken any bad money from the prisoner? - A. Yes, at that time he had taken a great deal of bad money himself from her; he kept the bad money; I then applied to Coleman; I said, what have you done with the remaining part of the five shillings; said he, I have got them in my pocket; he gave them to me immediately, these are them, and these are the three marked shillings that Brown took from the prisoner, (producing them); Oliver took some counterfeit money from Coleman; I asked him where he got that from; he said, I got it from that woman, Mrs. Camel; I then said, do you hear what that man says; she did not immediately answer me; I again said, Mrs. Camel, you see I have got some money here from Mr. Brown, where did you get that money; she said she got it from Coleman; I asked her where she got all the counterfeit money, and she made the same reply.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her where she got the marked money? - A. Yes; then she replied generally she got all the money from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to her, where did you get all that counterfeit money? - A. Yes, and then she said she got it all from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a girl by at the time? - A. Yes; I took her into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100084"/>Q. Did she say any thing in the presence of the prisoner about the money? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the girl did not say any thing? - A. She might have laid something to the other officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say that Coleman gave the prisoner all the bad money? - A. She did not say so in the house, nor I did not hear her say so afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girl say any thing of that sort any time in your hearing? - A. Yes, before the Magistrate, but she never said so before, nor at the time she was in custody, till she was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl and the woman were confined together? - A. No, we kept them separate; the girl was discharged on the second hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you took these two people into custody, you kept them separate, so as they could have no communication together? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when they were brought before the Magistrate, the girl said the money was given to the woman by Coleman? - A. She did say so before the Magistrate, but not before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the girl present when the prisoner said that Coleman gave her the money? - A. Yes, she heard the woman say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. It was about two o'clock when you gave Coleman the marked money, and then he had the marked money in his possession before he got into the house where the woman was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched him at the time you gave him the marked money? - A. I did not, I knew he had no other.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time till six o'clock he had an opportunity of doing what he pleased with it? - A. No, he was in our company constantly; he had no opportunity, we were watching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow him to that house the first time he went? - A. Mr. Brown followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as he told you the trap was set, you jumped in and caught the mouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never let him be out of your view, the first time, nor the second time? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer of Shadwell; we have understood how Coleman was employed - you went into the house first? - A. I did; as soon as I went into the house, I saw Camel sitting in a chair; I immediately took hold of both her arms, the girl was then in the shop, almost close to the door; there was nobody else there then but the girl and Mrs. Camel; I saw that Mrs. Camel had a quantity of money in her apron; I took hold of her apron, and in it there was a hundred counterfeit sixpences; they were done up in paper, and in each paper there were twenty sixpences, and likewise there were forty-four counterfeit shillings in her apron; I searched each of her pockets, and found one other counterfeit shilling, with a quantity of good money, and among the rest I found the three marked shillings, part of the five that Rogers had given him in our presence; I knew they were the marked shillings from my own recollection; I picked them out from all the rest.</p>
               <p>Court. How much good money did you find in that pocket? - A. I cannot say exactly; I believe it was half a guinea, a seven-shilling piece, some silver and halfpence, to the amount of a pound or more; I immediately took my knife out of my pocket, and put a second mark on the three marked shillings, and I gave them to Mr. Rogers; I then asked Mrs. Camel how she came in possession of this counterfeited money found in her lap; she told me that she had picked it up in Whitechapel; I asked her how she came by the marked money; she said then that she had it from Coleman, pointing to the person of the name of Coleman; afterwards she said that she had it all from Coleman. I saw Oliver take from Coleman eight sixpences and two shillings, all counterfeited; I then saw Mr. Rogers take from 
               <persName id="t18050710-85-person814">Coleman</persName>
             the other two marked shillings; Coleman said that the counterfeit sixpences and shillings he had, he took of the prisoner; that was after the prisoner said she had all the money from Coleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner make any answer to that? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner told you she picked up the money in Whitechapel? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of, you heard that distinctly? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When the woman said that she had it from Coleman, what was it that the girl said? - A. When I went in, the girl sat close to the shop-door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the shop, who was there with the girl? - A. There was nobody in the shop but the girl; the girl ran out of the house immediately when I took hold of Mrs. Camel.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what she said? - A. She did not say any thing, but ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she taken at? - A. She came back afterwards, and another woman with the child; in about two or three minutes she were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? - A. We did not ask her any questions.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not say, as the woman said, that she had it from Coleman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She never said that, to your knowledge, at any time, or any where? - A. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the girl was taken into custody, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100085"/>you did not ask her one single syllable? - A. We considered her as a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination before the Magistrate? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations were there? - A. A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended upon both examinations as a witness - upon the oath you have taken, did not the girl say before the Magistrate that the woman had the money from Coleman? - A. She did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say so when I asked you whether she said so at any time -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She said the same as the woman said before the Magistrate - did she hear the woman alledge that she had it from Coleman? - A. Yes, before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When the woman was taken, did the girl hear the woman say that she had it from Coleman? - A. No, the girl was out at the time; I produce the money.</p>
               <p>DANIEL OLIVER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were one of the officers on this occasion - have you any thing to produce? - A. I produce eight counterfeit sixpences and two counterfeit shillings, which I took in the prisoner's house from the left hand of Coleman, and a bad shilling I found in a chair, and a bad sixpence on the floor.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Will you have the goodness to take these into your hand - these are the eight sixpences and the two shillings? - A. They are all counterfeit; they seem to be of the same manufactory, they have never been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will put in your hand the sixpence and the shilling which the last witness found on a chair and on the floor? - A. They are both counterfeits, they have got the mark of the blacking upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now here are the 144 shillings and sixpences found in paper in the prisoner's apron? - A. They are all counterfeit, they have the mark of the blacking upon them, they have never been in circulation since they have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rogers.) Tell me whether those are the same three shillings, and the two that you delivered to Coleman? - A. They are the same marked shillings that I delivered to Coleman.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 10th of January you saw the Maria, you searched her, and afterwards you went on shore? - A. Yes, I landed at Selin; I searched the Maria cutter lying close to the land's end at <placeName id="t18050710-90-crimeloc499">Selin Cove</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Between six and seven o'clock, on the 10th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure what you had seen a-stern? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go on shore in search of smuggled goods? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you and your boat's crew landed? - A. Sometime after seven o'clock when I landed with the first boat's crew, which consisted of six men, and afterwards when the other boat's crew landed I had sixteen men.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your landing did you discover any goods? - A. I did, just below high water mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these goods? - A. About an hundred ankers of brandy, rum, and gin, I saw at first.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened upon your going to take possession of these goods? - A. There were several musquets fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the figure of any of the persons firing? - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it you saw any persons? - A. It might be about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you suppose there were that you could see without telling who they were? - A. There were several people come down off and on in the course of the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said, as you approached the beach there were several musquets fired? - A. Yes, after I had made seizure of the hundred ankers about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the hundred ankers that were lying just below high water mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. When you had taken possession of these did any thing else happen? - A. I went up the beach with the cutter's crew and seized the remaining part of the seizure which were piled up on the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at this quay, having seized the first part of the goods, describe to my Lord how far distant they were from the first? - A. They were at a little distance, the quay is close to the beach.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there? - A. Three hundred ankers of spirits and some tobacco; I seized them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to you or the crew at the time you were taking possession of them? - A. No, nothing; we were fired on just as we were going up the beach, we cleared the beach.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you call that nothing, attend to the question and do not give such strange answers; the question is, whether any thing happened to you? - A. We were fired on, and we drove the men away.</p>
               <p>Q. What men? - A. The smugglers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you see any men? - A. Yes, we saw some men behind the corners of houses in the village.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them come down to you then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You having seized these two parcels of goods, when was it that any interruption happened? - A. There was no interruption happened till one o'clock in the morning after the first part of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with any body during the time after you had made the seizure and before the latter end of the night? - A. There was a man came down about ten o'clock after I had made the seizure on the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak positively to the person of that man? - A. Not positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Look to the man at the bar and tell me whether you know his person or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe to me as particular as you can the dress, size, and appearance of the person who held this conversation with you? - A. I was standing on the wall on the quay close to the seizure, a man came up to me, I did not particularly look to his dress, but to the best of my recollection he was dressed in dark coloured clothes; I thought he had boots on and I believe he had a whip in his hand; he asked me to sell him twenty or thirty ankers of spirits or spare them, but to the best of my recollection it was to sell them, and then he would give me an order for ten more kegs; I asked him what he meant by an order; O, says he, you know very well, and then he made a kind of a laugh and jeer, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you saw that person? - A. I will not be positive, there was another person came down, he left me; there was a man came down to me at half after twelve, he stood against the side of a door and I was on the other side, he talked with me a considerable time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100088"/>Court. Q. What door? - A. There is a house built on the quay; he came and talked to me there, the whole conversation was wanting me to give up half the seizure; he said, to give and take, or words to that effect, he insinuated with me to give up half the seizure, he said, live and let live, give and take, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words? - A. He said you have got a good seizure, you may as well give and take, live and let live, he did not say immediately will you give me up half the seizure, he only insinuated by those words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Now the person that held that conversation with you was it the same person that held the conversation with you at ten o'clock? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe upon that occasion, do you think that it was or that it was not? - A. I think it was, it was just such another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of that person, be he whom he might, in the course of that night? - A. Not afterwards, I saw him no more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you say to him when he said, live and let live, give and take? - A. I did not make him any answer; I told him that it was worth more than my commission to give up any part of the seizure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What began then to be the conduct of any of the people there? - A. Soon afterwards they gave three cheers, the smugglers did I believe, it was in the village from a number of people assembled there, and there might be twenty or thirty people come down in a body immediately after the three cheers; then we were fired upon, and stones were thrown by some of these people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this firing all at once or repeatedly? - A. It was repeatedly for an hour or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the stones thrown once or the whole time? - A. The stones were kept continually throwing the whole of the time the firing was, for an hour or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part of your crew receive any injury? - A. They did, there were five of them wounded with slugs or swan shot with the firing.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, tell as near as you can recollect when this sort of cheering and attack upon you was after this person left you - A. I cannot speak exactly, it was from five to ten minutes after the person left me that it began.</p>

Yes; when I got up to the top of the quay they all fled; I called to Mr. Wren, the officer of the jolly boat, I could not find him; I turned back and I walked down towards Mr. Parry; then there was a man fired a musquet over my head; he said d - n me, this will scare all the cutter's men to hell flames; I saw the musquet in his hand.</p>

Mr. Parry sung out, young men, come here; I sung out to Mr. Parry, that there were three or four hundred kegs there, and Mr. Parry immediately came up and placed sentrys at each place, and told us that we should flash; the people of the jolly boat came to us, then we were fourteen in number; we then carried the goods that were on the beach up to the quay, and hauled our boats up out of the way of the surge, and kept sentrys over them.</p>

Yes; I do not recollect what time it was when the man came down the first time; when I saw him the last time, I think it was nigh one o'clock; he was a stout man, he had a blue surtout coat on, he had a dark beard high up, and I thought he had a stick or a whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any man in a dark blue coat that spoke to you? - A. Yes, he shook hands with me as he walked off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that the same man that stood with Mr. Parry? - A. I am not certain it was the same man; it was about one o'clock, he shook hands with me; he said to me, men, be honourable; I said to him again, if you behave honourable, we shall; with that he walked off; he had not gone a great distance before he sung out, one and all, d - n him who turns Judas.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100091"/>Q. Are you sure that the man that made use of that expression was the man that shook hands with you? - A. I am sure of that; he then went towards the mob of people, and they gave three huzzas, and they began to heave stones; I only saw him go towards them, I could not see him join them.</p>

               <p>Q. About what time did you see him there at night? - A. To the best of my knowledge I saw him there first about nine o'clock at night; he was close to the landing-place in the Cove, he was with the other men.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men might there be with him? - A. Three or four; Mr. Parry had seized the goods at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he then from the place where Mr. Parry had seized the goods? - A. About thirty yards; the second time I saw him was when my brother was speaking to me; at that time there were about thirty or forty people.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other man that was dressed like the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing the matter with his eyes? - A. He is blind with one eye; I went down to Mr. Parry, and told him the country were going to rise upon him; then I saw the prisoner leaning his arm against the north-east side of the door, and Mr. Parry was close by him; the man called away Mr. Parry to speak to me, and then the prisoner turned his back; he went away from that place, and went northward and eastward to the places where the people were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of the night might that be? - A. To the best of my knowledge between eleven and twelve, I did not look at the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him was about nine o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing when he went away? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go towards where there were any other people assembled? - A. Yes, he went away to where the rest of the mob were.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that he went away towards them was there any disturbance? - A. Instantly three huzzas were made, and stones were thrown; I did not see the prisoner reach the men; they immediately took me as a prisoner; I did not see any thing more of the prisoner that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Your wife likewise was there? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew him before, have you any doubt? - A. I have no doubt, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did Mr. Parry take you as a prisoner? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Surely he did not make such a mistake as to take you as a smuggler? - A. Perhaps he thought so at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite astonished that he thought so of you? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He took you as a prisoner - why how near to the beach is your public-house? - A. About three quarters of a mile from Selin Cove.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how soon afterwards was it that you for the first time mentioned that Mr. Pollard was among the smugglers? - A. That night, to the best of my recollection; I spoke of it directly afterwards to many people; I told Mr. Arndle of it a few days afterwards, and I told Mr. Parry of it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mr. Parry that while you were a prisoner? - A. No, before I was a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Explain that? - A. Mr. Parry thought I was one of the combined parties of the mob; he kept me to tell who the people were, he thought I knew all the people that were there.</p>
