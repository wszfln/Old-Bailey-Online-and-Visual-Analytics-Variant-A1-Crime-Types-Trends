"The other <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> gave it me"—after I got him to the station, I went back and looked over the fence and found this pocket book and watch chain—at the station I asked the prosecutor in the prisoners' presence what he had lost—he identified this property—he was the worse for drink—the pocket book contains army discharges—in the prisoners were all admitted to bail—the other man, Friedman, has absconded.</p>

We were going through the court when he asked me to have a drink. I said I would rather have something to eat. He said, 'Very well.' As we went, Friedman spoke to me and Collins spoke to me, and asked me if I was with him. I said, 'Yes.' The next thing was that he took his coat off and I heard his whisky bottle break. I got rather frightened, and if I had seen a constable I should have spoken to him, but I did not know the detectives; I did not know these men were following me up. I know nothing about the robbery. I am innocent. I have no witnesses." <hi rend="italic">Collins says:</hi> "We did not assault him."</p>

Miss Taylor, and a lady customer were there—I asked him where he got it—he said he took it in the City—I passed it over to the manageress, who told me to fetch a policeman—the prisoner heard what she said, and as I went out into the street I saw him running out of the shop—I ran after him. and caught him up at the corner of Newman Street—he said, "I want my change"—I held him by his collar and took him back to the shop—he said nothing on the way. but directly we got to the shop he said, "It is not <hi rend="italic">me what</hi> gave you the five shilling piece"—I asked him why he ran away, and he said. "I have not been in the shop"—I remained with him and sent for a policeman—when I told him it was bad, he gave me back the parcel, which he had put in his pocket—I did not lose sight of him at any time—he was running when I caught him up at Newman Street.</p>

"How did you get this?"—he replied, "I am a crockery dealer; I do not know how I get bad money"—he made a dash for the door and went down the street—I saw the assistant run after him and bring him back about three seconds afterwards—when they got into the shop he said.

"I believe be<lb/>tween eight and nine"—I know these men by sight, and have known them for about six weeks—I know the man by sight who got away also.</p>

I am a provision merchant, of 3 and 5, The Broad-way, Stratford—I have known Oliver since he was a boy—he has been in my employment about live months—I have missed goods from my premises for the last two or three years, more particularly latterly—I called in the police, and they kept observation—on February 19th I received a communication from the police and went to the West Ham Police Station, and there saw three boxes of butter and about 12 lbs. of bacon, which I identified—I recognised the butter by the mark on it and the bacon by the brand on the rind—the value of the goods was £3 1s., 5d.</p>

I received instructions, and with Detective Marshall kept observation about 6.15 a.m. of February 19th, at the rear of 3 and 5, The Broadway—about 8.15 I saw Oliver go from the rear of the stables to the window of 3, Burton's Court, which abuts on the prosecutor's yard—he gave a loud cough, and immedi<lb/>ately Jones opened the window—he stepped back and then forward, and I saw that he had two boxes of butter in front of him—he put them in the window, and Jones received them from him—he stepped back and she evidently went a yard or two from the window, then came back and closed the window almost to—Oliver went away for a few seconds and then returned—Jones appeared to be looking through the glass, waiting for him—he got near the window, she opened it, and he immediately handed her another box of butter—I immediately ran round and told Oliver I was a police officer, and should arrest him for stealing a quantity of boxes of butter which I had seen him take to the woman Jones and hand in at the window—he said. "I am very sorry. Sir; the woman has led me away; I am very sorry for what I have done"—I handed him over to a uniform constable and immediately ran back to the window—Detective Marshall ran to the front of the house—I got through the wiudow—we searched the front room and found the three boxes of butter and about 12 1/2 lbs. of bacon and about 1 1/2 lbs. of loose butter—we took Jones to the station.</p>

I bought the stamps to put in a letter. I have been out of work for six weeks, and what am I to do?"—I searched him at once, and found 2 1/2 d. on him—I took him to the station, and on being charged he said, "That 2s. 6d. was given to me by a lady when buying a bunch of violets at Lordship Lane last evening."</p>
