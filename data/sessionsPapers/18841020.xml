I am a solicitor and joint clerk to the Brentford Justices—I was present when Robert and William Girdler were charged on 1st July, 1884, before the Justices with assault—the prisoner, Charles Hall, a police constable, was then examined as a witness—I administered the oath and took this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of his evidence—the case against the Girdlers was dismissed by the Magistrates, and subsequently a summons for perjury was granted against the prisoner—that was duly heard, and he was committed for trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Magistrates present were Messrs. Halkett and Mackintosh when Hall gave his evidence, Colonel Clitheroe may have been present—the Magistrates sometimes interrupted when the witness was giving evidence.</p>

Last night about 9.30 I was on duty in Hibernia Road, Hounslow; a woman came to me, and from what she said I went down Hibernia, Road. I saw a number of men rioting, as though fighting. When I got there and before I had a chance to ask what they were doing I received a severe blow under the chin, at the same time I received a severe kick in the ribs as I was falling. I could not swear who did it. On recover<lb/>ing myself I said 'If you don't stand away I will draw my truncheon.' I drew my truncheon. There were some in front and some behind. I received another blow at the back of the head, I don't know who from. William Girdler was in front of me at the time. Another man struck me gain, and the prisoner, William Girdler, struck me on the chest as I was going to strike him on the arm with the truncheon, it caught him on the head; the others ran away. Police-constable Vagg came to my assistance.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188410200004"/>
               <p>I took William Girdler to the station. On the way to the station they tried to trip mo up, Dawes tried to trip mo up.") I have prepared an official copy of the depositions.</p>

I am a labourer, living at 4, Albion Road, Hounslow—Monday night, 30th June, I was out of employment—I went to the Gladstone beerhouse in Hibernia Road about 5 o'clock—a few minutes to 9 o'clock my, brother Robert came in, and we were there together talking—the landlord was serving, and there were several persons there in front of the bar—I had had a little beer, but I was sober, and knew what I was about-my brother in an abstainer and was quite sober—the prisoner came in, I never remember seeing him before—he was a constable in uniform-Vagg came in with him—that was about 9 o'clock-one of the constables, I don't know which one, asked if any one was going to give him any beer—one of the men at the bar spoke and handed Hall the pot to drink—he drank and handed it to Vagg, who drank—one of the constables said "There is no beer in the pot," and then one of the constables said that they would run any one in the bar for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I heard no disagreeable words; I heard no words with Hall or with the other constable—shortly after I and my brother went out of the bar together, leaving the prisoner and the other constable in the beer-house—we went about 20 yards from the beerhouse talking together—I did not see the constables till I turned round and saw them close on me at the back—I saw no one in the road at that time, only me and my brother and the two constables—the constables came up to us—Vagg pushed against my brother—Hall pushed me and then struck me with his trun<lb/>cheon—my brother said "Don't push against me," or something to that effect, and then the prisoner drew his truncheon and pushed me with his left hand and struck me with his right with the truncheon, hitting me a severe blow across my temple—it knocked me to the ground insensible—I laid on the ground bleeding and faint—up to that time there had been no noting or disturbance, or anything more than I have described—I next remember being taken to the Palmerston, a public-house in the neighbourhood almost 100 yards from the Gladstone—when I came to my senses I found myself in the custody of the prisoner and was then being taken to the police-station—a charge was made against me, I was locked up—a doctor was sent for, who dressed my head, and the next morning I was taken before the Magistrates and the charge was dismissed—after that I was seven days confined to the house and 14 days under treatment; I feel the effects of the blow at this present moment—it is not true that there were a number of men rioting as though fighting—no person in that road struck the prisoner, neither a severe blow under the chin, nor on the back of his head nor was he kicked in the ribs, no violence was used to him of any kind or sort—it is untrue that I struck him on the chest and that he aimed a blow at my arm and struck me on the head—there were no other persons present to run away—Police-constable 316 did not come to</p>

               <p>his assistance, he was there at the time; they were both at the beer-house together—there were some women at my back, not near enough to take part in the matter—I know Mr. Harris's cottage, it was just opposite his gate that I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When we were in the public-house we and the constables were quite friendly together, and nothing more was said that I am aware of till I got a blow on the head with a truncheon—I had only gone about 20 yards from the public-house when I was struck—I know Dawes, Harmer, and Hinge—they were charged next day with trying to rescue me, I believe—they are here—it was a few minutes, or a quarter past 0 when I was struck—Hibernia Road has only a few labourers' cottages on each side—there are several gas lumps—it is about 600 yards long—I went to the public-house about 6 o'clock and was there till 9, sometimes having something to drink and sometimes having a look at the paper—I drank but very little—I could not say how much money I had in my pocket when I came out of the public-house or when I came to the police-station—I had no <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> in the public-house—I had conver<lb/>sation with the constables there—each man paid for his own share—I oould not say how many pots I had to drink between 5 o'clock and 9—I think I had pints—I was sober and sensible, I did not stagger in the least—I don't know if a number of people were following me when I got to the police-station—I had a slight recollection when I got to the Palmerston—the Palmerston is only 100 yards from the Gladstone and 250 yards from the station—I have no doubt there was a crowd—the Gladstone is about the middle of the Hibornia Road—I don't know what happened at the top of the Hibernia Road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Albion Road, Hounalov, and work at the soap factory—I am a teetotaller—on Monday, 30th June, I went into the Gladstone beerhouse, Hibernia Road—my brother was there—I called for gingerbeer—I saw the prisoner and another uniform constable at the bar drinking—I and my brother left the public-house together about 9 o'clock—when we got a little way from the public-house we stopped and began to talk—two constables came down; Vagg pushed up against me—I said, "Where are you coming to?"—he said, "It is as much your fault as it is mine"—Hall pushed my brother, drew his truncheon, and struck him, and he fell bleeding to the ground—I was picking him up—the constables went away a little, came back, and Vagg said, "Go away"—I said, "I won't go away"—he said, "If you don't go away I will take you too"—I said, "If my brother goes I will go too"—another constable came up—Hall had my brother, and close by Vagg had hold of me by my collar—he tripped me up and jerked me forwards, and then pulled me back and tore my shirt all off my back almost with the jerk—the inspector saw the state of my shirt when I got to the station—I had had no intoxicating liquors during the day—I resisted the constables in no way—it is not true that before the assault on my brother there wore a number of men rioting and fighting, or that the constable received a severe blow under the chin or some kicks in the ribs, or that my brother struck him on the chest—he drew his truncheon and deliberately struck my brother on the head and cut his head open.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hibernia Road, and am a market gardener—my cottage is a few doors from the Gladstone and on the same side of the road—on the evening of 30th June I was sitting at my front window about 9 o'clock; the window was closed—I saw two constables in uniform coming down the road; they made a stand opposite my garden to light their pipes, and just at that time I saw they were very staggering drank, I am certain they were drunk—they were going in the direction of the Gladstone; after lighting their pipes they went on and into the Gladstone—about 10 minutes after I saw two men who I know now as the two Girdlers leave the Gladstone together and come in the direction of my house, almost immediately afterwards followed by the two constables—the two men made a stand nearly opposite my house, and as they did so the two constables overtook them—Vagg pushed against Robert Girdler, and Hall pushed against William Girdler and almost immediately at the same moment took out his truncheon and struck him across the head and felled him to the ground—he then waved his truncheon over his head and said, "Bring out five or six more of your b----mates and I will serve them the same"—up to that time there had been no blow struck and no rioting or fighting of any kind—at that time I saw three women in the road a few yards off, they were quiet—when I saw this I got up and walked through my house and round it and came into the front garden and to the front gate—when I got there William Girdler was still lying on the ground as if dead—Hall, the man that struck the blow, was there—Robert Girdler was coming from the direction of the beer-house—several people had collected—William Girdler was taken off somewhere in the prisoner's custody—I could not swear whether they took Robert in custody, they all went away together—I had heard screams a second or two before the constables came out of the house; they were nothing but ordinary screams such as children would make, nothing to lead me to suppose there was any bother or anything amiss—I was fetched to the Town Hall, Brentford, and gave evidence the same day on behalf of the prisoners—I had never peen the Girdlers before nor the constables that I know of, they are no friends or acquaintances of mine whatever.</p>

               <p>when we got near the Gladstone beerhouse I saw the two Girdlers come out—I did not know them before—they crossed the road and turned in the direction of where I found afterwards was their home—they were walking together—two constables came out of the beerhouse and followed them in the same direction—I did not know the constables—I should not have known the prisoner was one of them if I had not seen him next day at Brentford—I now know that Hall was one of the policemen, and Vagg the other—I noticed they staggered—as they got near to the Girdlers one of the policemen pushed young Girdler, and he turned round and said "Missus, did you see that policeman push me?"—I gave him no answer, but in the meantime the other constable pushed the other Girdler with his left hand, and drawing his truncheon with his right, he hit him on the head, and he fell to the ground—I screamed out "Shame, police<lb/>man!" and ran a few steps—I called him a brute—it was a deliberate blow, and knocked the man to the ground—up to the time of the pushing there had been up rioting or disturbance—I saw no one in the road but those four, I, my daughter-in-law, and a young woman going down with us—the police were not struck by anybody—when the man was knocked to the ground the policeman said "Fetch out your b----mates, and I will serve them the same, "flourishing his staff about—the police staggered—I took them to be tipsy—I did not see Girdler taken off the ground; I was too frightened, and left him still lying on the ground—my daughter-in-law said "Stop a minute, let me go and take their numbers, for they ought to be punished"—I did not see a crowd of people come up—I heard the younger Girdler scream "You have killed my brother, you have killed my brother!" as I hurried along the road, for I was frightened—I did not go to the station—I went next day before the Magistrates of my own accord—I thought it was cruel, and went to speak for the young men—they asked if they had any witnesses, and I said "Yes"—I was called as a witness on their behalf.</p>

On the road to the station Robert Girdler said if his brother went to the station he should go to. He was told to go away, but refused to do so. He took hold of the prisoner William Girdler.

I am a bookbinder, of 2, Playhouse Yard, Barbican—on Saturday afternoon, 13th August, I was going along Long Lane from my house of business, with my son, to the Snow Hill Railway Station—on entering the railway carriage on the platform my son got in first, I was following, but I was enclosed in an instant by one man on my right, another on my left, and another at the back of me—I could not get into the carriage, they prevented me—I looked round and saw Florence behind me—I put my hand to my breast and felt my chain dangling and the watch gone—I felt something touch my breast—my watch had been in my upper side pocket—the value of it was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the station was dark but I was able to see the faces of the people near me.</p>

               <p>the other man behind Mr. Freeman with my right—immediately Mr. Freeman said "That man has got my watch," pointing to Florence—I said "Yes, I know that," or words to that effect—I kept hold of Florence; the other man got away, leaving his hat behind—with the assistance of one of the railway officials I took Florence to the station—just after I had got him to the station Cross came in with Holt, and then he had his hat on—I thought at first it was the other man I had held, but when I looked again I saw it was not, it was a man very much resembling him—I am positive Holt and Florence are two of the men I saw following Mr. Freeman—I searched Florence and found on him a third-class railway ticket from Snow Hill to Blackfriars—I also found on him a ticket for the Conservative Saturday afternoon at Hatfield.</p>

In August, 1882, I was lady's-maid at East<lb/>bourne, and met the prisoner when I was taking charge of my mistress's luggage—he was a porter at the railway station, and from that time he commenced paying me attention—he asked me if I would write to him—I asked if he was engaged—he said that he was not, and about June, 1883, he asked me to be his wife, and asked if I would wait for him till after the winter, as he did not wish to make any change till after then—I had no objection to that—I had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left to me, which came to me while I was at Eastbourne, and I told him about it—about 16th March I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This was from the prisoner to the witness, addressing her as "My darling Pet" asking her to lend him </hi>100<hi rend="italic">l. to complete the purchase of a house, and suggest<lb/>ing</hi>

                  </hi>. The defendant is my brother—I was working under him up to the time of his petition—he had three places of business and a private house at Hornsey Park—I remember this post-card coming with the words, "Give us a call, we shall esteem it a <hi rend="italic">great favour</hi>"—my brother made no statement to me after going to Bromet's, he was not it the habit of doing so, he only said that some goods were coming in—the rope was part of the first delivery and there was some paper—no more rope came in on the 14th—36 or 37 hundredweight of goods came, which were placed behind the door on the left-hand side, and never went out up to the time of the official receiver coming—the rope was of very inferior quality indeed—this letter is my brother's writing: "May 15th, 1884. Dear Sirs,—Your rope is very bad, very little better than <hi rend="italic">c. gunny.</hi> I am sure you cannot have seen it; we are now opening it, and cannot give a penny more than 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it is dear at that, &amp;c."—there was good ground of complaint against it, and that was to prohibit any more being sent—it laid there from May 5th to May 15th exactly as it came in, and we looked more closely into it before the letter was written—the price in the pencil memorandum is 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we offered 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this answer was</p>

               <p>sent to my brother—we never had any more rope—I remember writing this letter of May 19th and posting it; it never came back through the Dead Letter Office. (<hi rend="italic">This requested Messrs. Bromet to fetch the rope, as it kid there at their risk and was in the way.</hi>) We got no answer, nor did they send for it—it was properly addressed to their place in Corbett Court—of the items in this pencil memorandum 35 hundred weight of rope was delivered at my brother's place, but only a little of the common bagging—we did not send for the rest, but I think we sent for the paper—we only got a little of the one ton of clean gunny, we had no more because it was so bad—we got this post-card after the first delivery, which included some gunny. "7th May: Kindly send for the remainder of the goods by to-morrow, certain, as we must have them out by to-morrow"—we never did send—this delivery note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came with the bagging, but it is for the paper, they have made a mistake—I was never with Fairweather, it was my brother—I did not see young Bromet about 20th September—he came to Settle Street, where I was in business, to ask for my goods, and said that he hoped having a little bother would not prevent us doing business—a summons was issued against him, but he said that he had no ill-feeling—I said "You must have"—he said "What will it do to him?"—he said "It may hinder his discharge and prevent him getting it altogether"—he said that he would not let the matter drop but said nothing about money—that was the last time I saw him, but I went to his warehouse and bought goods afterwards.</p>

At 8 o'clock on the night of 18th September I went to 20, Leinster Square, Bayswater—I inquired for Thomas Herbert, and saw him—he said "I know what you have come about, I have been expecting you"—I told him I held a warrant for his arrest, and read it to him—he said "Yes, I know there has been several things pawned, and I helped to pledge them for Whalley, as he said it would be all right"—I took him into custody—on the way to the station, in a cab, he said "I should not have pledged these things only that Whalley assured me that they would be redeemed within a week or so; I have helped to live upon them, like Whalley; I have been to Boulogne, but I did not want to be arrested there and I came back I intended to have enlisted in the morning." On 30th September I went to Boulogne, and there found Whalley in custody, detained under an extradition warrant—I told him that I was a police officer from London and that I held a warrant for his arrest—I read the warrant to him—he said "All right; what prison are you going to take me to?"—I said I was going to take him to London—on the way back, on board the past, he said "Have you a warrant for Fraer?"—I said "No"—I had not said a word about Fraser up to that time—he afterwards said "Sup<lb/>posing this matter goes against me, what term of imprisonment do you think I shall get?"—I said "That is a question I cannot possibly</p>

He said "You don't know anything about it, do you?" I said "No," and I went to the station and they charged me with highway robbery with violence. The constable must have told the prosecutor my description or he could never have picked me out.</p>

I am a porter living at; 39, Tachbrook Street—on 18th September, about 10 at night, I was in the Vauxhall Road; I was a little the worse for liquor—I treated two women, Young was one of them—I went into, two public-houses with them—I was with them two hours or a little more; I then went with them to Queen Ann's Gate—they tried to hustle me, they had hold of my arms, I could not get away, and the male prisoner and another man not known violently pushed me from behind with all his force, I was sent rolling—I fell on my hands and cut my hands, it was a mercy my face was not cub, or that I was not stunned; my coat was buttoned up tight—they de<lb/>liberately put their hands in my coat, they almost lifted me up, tore the buttons clean off, extracted the chain and left the watch through having an India rubber ring on, and a gold swivel attached to the chain and locket was taken—the male prisoner was the one that opened my coat and tore my button off—I immediately got up and ran after them, crying "Stop thief"—a constable stopped them at the end of the street; the violence was committed at the top—the two prisoners were stopped, the others got away—I have not seen my chain since; the value of it was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the chain was broken off; they left the swivel behind—I had seen it safe in my pocket before my coat was torn open—I did not notice Wormald's face till I got up and turned round—I am sure he is the man.</p>

About halt-past 12 on the morning of 19th September I heard shouts of "Stop thief" in the direction of Queen Anne's Gate—I saw the two prisoners running down Catheart Street—I stopped Wormald and held him till the prosecutor came up, who was running after them—just as the prosecutor came up Wormald said "What are you taking me for? I have done nothing"—Butler, the other constable, brought up the woman—on the way to the station she said it was not her that done it, it was the man—the prosecutor was the worse for drink—he said they had robbed him of his gold chain, that they were two of the persons—he was quite sensible, he knew quite well what was taking place.</p>

               <p>loudly as I could—I then got my revolver and went downstairs—it was not loaded—I put the cartridges in my pocket—I went to the front door, opened it, and saw Gray, he was quite sober—he said "What did you mean I was trying to get into this house? I was quite sober; you know I am watchman here; for two pins—"—he had something in his right hand, which was down at his side, and he made a kind of half rush at me—I took the revolver out and said "If you touch me I will put a bullet through you"—I told them from the window "If you get into this house you will get shot"—while talking to Gray, Clasby was standing in the next door porch, No. 6, an unoccupied house where Gray sleeps—I know him only too well—he said when Clasby came to the gate "It is a nice thing to be charged with burglary while one is acting as watchman"—I said "You are no watchman, you have no right to be on my premises at half-past 1 o'clock in the morning"—it was just at that time he put his hand to his side in a menacing way—I asked a young man to fetch a policeman, and Gray said "I have just left the police, I know where to find them"—the two prisoners went away, and then Gray came back<lb/>wards and forwards two or three times, and then went away again—he said he would let me know who he was—Clasby came back with three policemen—I told them in Clasby's presence what I had heard and seen—they detained Clasby—I believe I saw Gray run round the corner when they came—I saw Gray come out of No. 6, and he was taken into custody—when he came out at the front gate he had a sword-stick in his hand—my parlour window looks into the garden—I examined it after this and found it was all cut away under the catch of the casement—there were a few pieces on the window-ledge, and a match or two—I took those to the police-court.</p>

It is the custom of builders to have a night watchman where the place is not fastened up and a lot of things are lying about—when a house is finished and locked up we don't keep a man about, I never knew it done—if there was a watchman it would be his duty to go round and see that the houses were fastened up—I never gave my watchman instructions to see that the house doors and windows were all right—I have never known persons instructed to see that inhabited houses were all shut up; it would not be an extraordinary thing, but I should not like to give instructions to watch tenants' houses without their knowing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Crispin, a master cabinet-maker, and live with him at 30, Lwyton Road—we have been married twenty-five years, and have nine children—on Wednesday, 20th August, between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, Miss Rayner came and told me some<lb/>thing, and shortly afterwards Mr. Rayner brought in the prisoner, and in consequence of what was told me I made a search to see if anything was missing, and I missed a gold watch and guard—it had been kept in several places, sometimes on the dressing table—I left it on the dressing-table on this day, lying open—that was my room upstairs—I was in all parts of the house that afternoon—between 3 and 4 I was in the w.c. with a sick child on the ground floor—besides the gold watch and chain I missed a silver watch and steel guard; that was my son's, it</p>

               <p>was in the bedroom, the next room to mine, that was the room my son occupied, it was either lying on the mantelpiece or hanging up—I did not say anything to the man then—I said to Mr. Rayner "The wretch has got my watch"—he said "Tip it up sharp," and he produced from his pocket the gold watch and chain—I went to the station and charged him there, and the silver watch and chain was found—on the previous day I was near Stepney Chruch, I pruchased three pair of boots there, and as I was coming out of the shop the parcel came undone, and I then noticed a person looking at me in a particular manner; at Leyton Police-station I recognised the prisoner as that man—I had no conversation whatever with him that afternoon; with that exception I had never seen him until I saw him in the custody of Mr. Rayner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The watch and chain were stolen between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—in order to get into the house the prisoner would have to pass through the door in the garden wall, and then in at the wash-house door—no one could see him from the windows—the garden door is generally open—on 19th August I went by Stepney Church—I had a dark-blue velvet hat on—I live five or six miles from where I saw the prisoner that day—I returned home by train from Bow Station at ten or twenty minutes past 6 o'clock—he did not follow me to the station that I know of—all I saw of him was seeing him look at me for a moment—I had no conversation at all with him—I did not go with him to any house—I never went with him to 86, Sidney Street, Mile End—I do not know Mrs. Gibson (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Gibson was called into court</hi>)—I do not know her, I have never seen her before—I did not make an appoint<lb/>ment with the prisoner to come to my house next day—I never spoke to him—after I had charged the prisoner his wife and a Mrs. John paid me a visit—the wife asked if I was going to proseeute—I said "Certainly"—she said "You require merey yourself, show mercy to him"—she said if I did prosecute she would have a good solicitor who would soon pull me to pieces—she also said that she did not know what he could have done it for, it must have been the devil that tempted him—she did not ask how I accounted for a man who did not know the house walking straight up to my bedroom, nor did I reply "I don't know, my dear"—I did not say "The fact is, it must have been the devil that tempted us both"—I was not very excited—I did not say "Go to the House of Detention and see the poor fellow, and see if anything can be done to save him"—I did not express myself exceedingly anxious to save him, or do anything in my power to help him—I called Mr. Rayner in—I did not leave the room before that and go into a room and see him, and then come back and say "Mr. Rayner says 'You two must be bad womed'"—nothing of the kind—no one came in with Mr. Rayner—a lady friend was with me, Mrs. Simpson, or Langton; she is here—when the women left I did not shake hands with them, or ask them to come again next day—I went to the police-station the morning after the watches were taken by my husband's direction, and I asked for the watches by his direction—I did not get them—I only went once—I had a converasation with an inspector, not the one that had the charge—I asked him his opinion—the prisoner said, in presence of the policeman and inspector. "Why not say I was with you yesterday all the afternoon, and the that I came down to-day by appointment?"—Mr. Rayner and Mary Rayner were present when that was said—I replied "My God, no."</p>

On Wednesday, 20th August, about 4.15, the prisoner was brought to the station by Police-constable Draper and Mr. Rayner on this charge—he was searched, and this silver watch and chain were found in his trowsers pocket, also some seaman's dis<lb/>charges, ten years old, and a railway return ticket from Leyton to Bow Road, and a few halfpence—he was charged by the prosecutrix with stealing these two watches and chain—he replied "did not I meet you in the Commercial Road yesterday?"—she said "No; I never was in the Commercial Road yesterday"—he said "Remember, where did you buy your boots yesterday?"—she answered "In Church Passage"—looking at him she said "Oh, yes; I remember, you are the man that I saw that passed me twice while I was doing up my parcel of boots on the footpath," and looking at me she said "I thought he was after my purse"—then, speaking of the boot shop, she said "I have dealt there these 23 years"—he then said "Tell the truth, did not I meet you in the Commercial Road, and come down here by appointment?"—she immediately replied "My God, no; I never saw or spoke to you before in my life"—I asked her if she meant to say that she had really never known him before, it being rather a peculiar position—she said "No"—he then said "Did not you give me the watches to raise money on?"—she said "No, certainly not"—that was all that passed—he was then charged, and put in the cell.</p>

I live at 86, Sidney Stree, mild End—it is a house of accommodation—on 19th August, between half-past 2 and 3 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house with a middle-aged lady—to the best of my belief Mrs. Crispin is the lady—I believe she had on a hat, a dark one, I think, trimmed with lace, as much as I can recollect—I could not exactly say how she was dressed; she was dressed different to what she is now, because she had a hat on—I did not take that notice of her dress, the only thing I noticed was being a middle-aged person in a hat—to the best of my belief that is the woman, and the man I can swear to—I am able to fix the day because it was two or three days before I was confined, which was on the 5th of August—they were not very long in the house—the gentleman gave me a shilling—they had to wait in the passage while I put the room straight; that is why I know the gentle<lb/>man so well.</p>

I know the prisoner's wife, not very well—I also know the prisoner—I went as a friend with the prisoner's wife to call on Mrs. Crispin after the prisoner had got into difficulty—Mrs. Crispin was there, nobody else—when we went in Mrs. Crafford told her what business we came on—she said "Quite right, my dears, come inside"—we went into the front parlour and there we were talking—she said Mr. Crafford must have gone through her back gate up into her bedroom—I said "What-ever could have possessed him to go right through the gate straight up to your bedroom?"—she said "I don't know, my dear, I don't know what could have tempted us, it must have been the devil that tempted us both"—I am quite clear that she mad use of those words—she was in a very excited state—she threw her arms about and said she should go mad before it was finished she said she would do anything in the world to save him, she ahve already been to the Court to get her property back and the officer in charge refused to do so—she said she would pqwn any<lb/>thing to save him—there was a knock at the side gate, and she left us in the parlour for three or four minutes; and she came back in a more excited state and said "What shall I do, you are two women, can I confide in you? Mr. Rayner came to the side gate and said I was not to take notice of you two women, that you have come here on a blind, that you are nothing bu two bad women"—when she came back into the parlour she brought a neighbour in with her, and she said "This is a neighbour of mine"—she did not give the name to me—I said "You had better fetch Mr. Rayner," and she did so; and when he came into the parlour I said "I don't think we look much like bad women"—he said "I don't know anything at all about the case, all I know is that I am the one that collared him and brought him back to Mrs. Crispin and told him to tip it up sharp"—we then left—we came away very friendly, Mr. Rayner and Mrs. Crispin shaking hads with us on the best of terms—she told Mrs. Crafford to go next day to her husband to ask him what she could do to save him.</p>

I hope you will be lenient"—Mrs. Crispin said "I shall have to press the case, it is in the hands of the police"—the wife did not become very abusive and say "I will have a good solicitor who will soon pull you to pieces," no such thing, I can swear that—I am quite positive she did not say that in the presence of Mrs. Simpson, they were on the most lenient terms—Mrs. Chrafford did not say "It must have been the devil that tempted him, it was not because he was hard up," I will swear Mrs. Crispin said "I can't think what made me do it, the devil must have tempted us both"—that was not in the presence of Mrs. Simpson—we were talking and asking her how he came to get into her house, and she said he must have come straight through the house and got into the bedroom—Mrs. Simpson was not there then, she came in just after Mr. Rayner knocked at the gate—the prisoner's wife again asked if she was going to prosecute,</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Galley Hall, Great Baddow, Essex, and am a farmer—at the end of January this year I saw an adver<lb/>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi>, Manager wanted for a Poultry and Dairy Farm, apply to W. Edger, of Bow—I wrote to the address given, and received a reply signed Percy Robinson, asking me to call at 43, Lom<lb/>bard Street. (<hi rend="italic">The letter stated that the farm was one mile from Wimbledon, that it was 320 acres in extent, and would be leased by the Premier Dairy produce and Cattle Breeding Company, then being formed, from the present holder, Mr. Kevil, who required </hi>6,000<hi rend="italic">l. for the stock and valuation in the farm; that the salary would be </hi>2<hi rend="italic">l. to a good clear, or a much larger sum to one able to take the management; that the amount required to be invested would not be more than </hi>25<hi rend="italic">l., and would be returned with interest within three months, and that if he was prepared to pay </hi>5<hi rend="italic">l. on account of the </hi>25<hi rend="italic">l. on Friday he could arrange the vacancy for him.</hi>) The letter enclosed this prospectus of the Premier Dairy Produce and Cattle Breeding Company—I went to 43, Lombard Street, on 1st February—I saw Robinson—I said "I have come on that business about the dairy," and he said "Oh, very well"—he said it was going on flourishingly—he said the farm was at Wimbledon, within six miles of London, and it would be handy to get the produce into London—I was to be manager—he asked if I was prepared to pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit, a sort of guarantee, as there would be a great deal of money passing through my hands belonging to the Com<lb/>pany and I was required to pay 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down—I said I would pay him next week—he said that would do if I paid it by Wednesday—I had a small farm of my own at that time at Harrinsate, near Rickmansworth—I said I should have to part with that if I took the situation—he then wrote this out, and I signed it. (<hi rend="italic">This was on note paper headed "To the Directors of the Premier Dairy Produce Breeding Company;" stated that having seen Mr. Robinson about the sole management of the Company, he felt satisfied the vacancy would suit him, and that he agreed to accept the position, and to invest</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for a short time, providing he was paid at the rate of</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per week, and lived on the farm rent free; and he agreed to pay a deposit of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on Wednesday, and the balance as required.</hi>) I then went back home, and on the following Tuesday sent 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner Robin<lb/>son</p>

               <p>—I received back a receipt in the same handwritting—"February 6, received of Thomas Alexander Sproat, of Ingleby Cottage, Herrinsate, the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be advanced to secure the manage<lb/>ment of the Premier Poultry Farm at Wimbledon. Official receipt with stamp to be forwarded to-morrow. Yours faithfully, Percy Robinson."—I then received a letter from him in reference to my own farm. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Robinson had written to a gentleman about Sproat's farm, and requested him to send particulars of it</hi>)—I sent him the particulars, and then got this letter (<hi rend="italic">Dated February</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">enclosing a receipt for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">stating that he could dispose of the farm to advantage, requested him to send another</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">of the balance</hi>, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">per return, as they had expenses to pay in connection with the Company on Saturday, and that they would arrange with him in</hi> 12 or 14 <hi rend="italic">days, signed Percy Robinson</hi>)—I learnt from Robinson that Mr. Keevil was the occupant of the farm—after I got that last letter I put myself into communication with Mr. Keevil, and having done so got two letters from the prisoner, dated 12th and 14th—they both arrived the same day—I went up on Saturday and saw Robinson, who asked me if I had got his letter—I said "No, I left home before"—he told me what was in it; he suggested I should pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and have a new agreement and a fresh receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that the rest would be paid when I was installed in the place—that would be on account of the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said the directors were to meet next week, I think, to arrange about the farm, and then he would write me about 10 days after that—he said they were going to employ a great many hens, about 2,000, on the farm—he said they might not take Levill's farm, they had heard of a cheaper one—I then paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he drew up this fresh agreement (<hi rend="italic">This was dated February</hi>, 1884, <hi rend="italic">and was between Percy Robinson and Co.,</hi> 42 and 43, <hi rend="italic">Lombard Street, on behalf of the Premier Dairy Farm and Breeding Company, and Thomas Alexander Sproat, the Company agree sing to appoint Sproat as manager of their farm or farms at a salary of</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">including coals and a free home, and Sproat agreeing to pay</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">down and the balance</hi>, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on instalment, that sum to be repaid with interest</hi>)—he gave me a receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I went home—I waited for 10 days of a fortnight and then wrote him again—he put me off again by letter, saying it would be a few days yet before I could take up the situation—about 7th May I went by appointment with Robinson to see a farm at South Benfleet, Essex—he showed me a plan of the farm and an agreement (<hi rend="italic">The agreement was a draft for letting Sayers' farm</hi>)—I went over most of the farm—I saw the house which Robinson said was where I should be and where the directors would meet once a fortnight—I told Robinson I would have to leave my own place at the half term on Saturday—he asked me to ask the party who was going to take it if I could not let I stand for a few days till the middle of the week or so—I put off the persons coming into my place till the Wednesday, and I then removed with my furniture to this farm at Benfleet—I did not find it ready for me, the occupant was still in possession; he did not allow me to come in, and I had to take my furniture away again and store it—I then wrote this letter to Robinson: "You have led us a nice dance throught your representations. I find when here that the whole thing has been a hoax from the first. I called at your office twice to-day before the train started, and found it shut. I wanted an order from you to go the farm. Not having got one I went out and found you had done nothing in the matter. I shall have</p>

I shall write all the directors whose names you have given me. If I can get no redress in that way I shall immediately take steps to have you punished"—I received an answer, which I have looked for and have not got, and after that came twice to the office but could not see Robinson, he was not there—I wrote this letter to the chairman of the direction, the Hon J.F. Erakine (<hi rend="italic">This letter was found at Robinson's when he was taken into custody. It stated the particulars of the transaction with Ribinson, and that the witness con<lb/>sidered himself entitled to compensation, and would be glad to know what the chairman was prepared to make it. A letter from Mr. Erskine to Robinson, found at Roboinson's house, was also read, dated 13th May, and expressed the writer's surprise to see by the enclosed that he had been represented as chairman of the Company when he had twice written declining it, and that he had written Mr. Sproat, as he was no party to engaging him as manager</hi>)—I did not see Robinson—I never succeeded in getting any of my money back from him—when I parted with my money to him I believed his statement and the prospectus, I believed my money would come back—I believed the statement made by Robinson about the Company.</p>

I was not introduced to Mr. Harrison, the solicitor to the Company; Robinson did not ask me to see him—he did not tell me that untill the solicitor had prepared the necessary agree<lb/>ments I could not get into possession of the house on the farm—I visited the farm in company wiht Robinson, no one else—I did not see the owner of it, I saw the man managing it for him—he did not confirm Robinson that negotiations were being carried on for the purchase of that farm—I did not tell him why I went there—he knew Mr. Robinson had an order from the agents to view the farm with a view to purchase; I saw him show that order to the occupant—he said he went there with a view to negotiating the purchase, and he wished to show me over it and take my opinion as to purchasing it—I advanced 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Robinson with a view of procuring the situation of manager—I did not advise Robinson that that or any farm would be a desirable speculation, I did not advise him anything about it—I went there to look over the place where I was going to live—we had a talk over its suitability—I thought it was a desirable place to take, and that by paying 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

(<hi rend="italic">In this Percy Robinson agreed to employ Alfred Tidmarsh as manager of the company from 31st March at a salary of </hi>200<hi rend="italic">l. a year, payable monthly, Tidmarsh to pay </hi>10<hi rend="italic">l. on signing the agreement, and </hi>50<hi rend="italic">l. on registration of the Company.</hi>) I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on signing the agreement—on Easter Monday, 14th, April, Bank Holiday, Robinson called on me at Woolwich and said he had come in respect of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on that day, and that the Comopany had been registered on the Saturday previous—I paid him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he gave me a receipt, which I have mislaid—he had also given me a receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that I mislaid—I had a doubt and called on Harrison, and two days after I went and saw Robinson at an address in Bow—he was partly or quits intoxicated—I told him I found the affair was not registered, and pre<lb/>viding he did not register it at once, I would give him in charge—I went with him to Lombard Street—I afterwards attended several times at Robinson's office—there was no business going on there—I saw a room half full of the prospectuses of the Company, all ready to post, but with no stamps on—I attended nearly every day at the office, and could get no satisfaction, and then I went down to Stretton Colliery and found it was not in the hands of the Company at all; there were about four men at work there—when I parted with my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Lindsay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be received, official receipt to-morrow. Percy Robinson"—that was before my brother-in-law had moved down with his furniture—I made an arrangement to see Robinson next day in order to have an agreement drawn up and executed—I called four or five times, nobody appeared—on Saturday, 10th May, I met Robinson by appointment at the solicitor's Mr. Harrison's, offices, 57, Chancery Lane—Mr. Harrison was engaged in the Law Courts I was told by his clerk—I then proposed to Robinson to go to a solicitor, a friend of mine, in John Street, Bedford Row—Robin<lb/>son agreed and went with me—when we got there the principal was not there, but his managing clerk was; he said he would like to know all about the affair—Mr. Robinson said "I deal only with prin<lb/>cipals"—I told him "This gentleman has quite the confidence of the principals, and has discussed with me before"—he said he would have nothing to say to him—we then returned to Mr. Harrison's office, and I made another appointment to meet Robinson at Harrison's on Monday, 12th May—I attended that appointment, Robinson never came—I don't think Mr. Harrison was there—I waited an hour or two, he never came—I moved with my brother-in-law on the Wednesday to Benfleet—I met him at Fenchurch railway station, and we met Robinson coming down the platform from another train—Robinson spoke first, he said "Hello!</p>

               <p>Percy Robinson I was speaking of—I said it was, and went back to the police station—this was about 10 on 9th August—I believe Robinson had been arrested on the 8th—I afterwards received the letter 15th August from Bodington—after I heard Robinson was arrested I was satisfied that the whole thing was a swindle, and sent the leters with all enclosures to Inspector Wildey—I wanted Bodington to unbutton his coat that I might see if he was dressed as a director should be.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 57, Chancery Lane—I became acquainted with Robinson in april, 1883, by bringing an action against him for a client to recover money for advertising the Blue Ribbon Beverage Company—I signed judgment on behalf of our client, and put an execution into 43, Lombard Street—we got nothing, as more rent was due than the value of the goods there—after the execution Robinson called on me and introduced to my notice the Permanent Syndicate Company—he said he could not pay the judgment debt, but in this Permanent Syndicate Company all the shares had been subscribed, and the matter was complete except for registration, and he requested me to prepare the memorandum, which was sent to Counsel and returned to me on 13th June; it was never signed—some time after he called and showed me a printed prospectus of the Permanent Syndicate Company—I obsered my name on it as solicitor—when he had showed me the prospectus and mentioned certain contracts of which I was ignorant, I said "This must not go out," and he assured me it was a proof, and I kept it thinking it was—I never authorised the issue of this prospectus with my name on it as solicitor—I registered the Stretton Coal Company—the only portion of that was paid by a cheque in favour of Mr. Tidmarsh which Robinson handed me—Robinson handed me that to pay for the registration with Tidmarsh's consent, who was with him at the time.</p>

               <p>a few minutes after she brought up a jug of what appeared to be ale, and put it on the table and left the room—I produced out a glass of it and drank about half of it—I felt a burning sensation in my throat and a coppery taste, and I commenced to vomit immediately—I vomited in a chamber utensil—I then held the remainder of the beer in the glass up to the gas, and for the first time I noticed it was of a bright green colour—before the vomiting I went to the prisoner's bedroom on the landing and said, "Mary, what have you put in the beer? I am poisoned"—she said, "I put nothing in the beer"—at that time she was quit dressed—I said, "Come to my room and look at it"—she came into the room, and I pointed out to her the half-empty glass with the beer of this greenish colour—she poured it from the glass into the jug, and took the jug and glass in her hand to take downstairs—I said "Leave it where it is"—she put the jug and glass down—I sent for my neighbour Mrs. Player and Dr. Mitchell—Mrs. Player came immediately and acting on her advice I took some mustard-and-water—she remained with me till the doctor came—I continued to vomit the whole time; I still had a burning sensation in my throat; I frequently used the basin besides the other utensil to vomit in—Dr. Mitchell gave me hot water and salad oil, and I gave him the beer in the jug—he poured it out into two clean bottles—the jug and tumbler remained in the bedroom till next morning, the prisoner then took them away—there was no beer in them, it had all been poured out, and I then found the jug and glass washed quite clean—the vomit was put in a spare bedroom adjoining mine; that was an unoccupied room, no one slept there, it was not part of the prisoner's duty to go in there and empty slops, no one slept there—on 30th Sep<lb/>tember she emptied the slops in my room and then went into the spare room, and I saw her come out with the utensil containing the vomit—I told her to put it back and not to touch it, and it was subsequently given to Inspector Butcher—all Tuesday night I suffered from pains in my stomach—I afterwards found a dishcloth hanging on a bell in the scullery, and an old newspaper spread over a box, and a pocket-hand<lb/>kerchief on the copper; on examining all these I found green stains upon them—I also found a small piece of soap in the sink stained green—all these things were taken away by the inspector—we had two vases in our room made of copperas under glass cases on a stand—it is a very brittle material, and can easily be broken off—I had always warned the prisoner not to touch them, I told her they were of a poisonous nature; I always cleaned them myself—in moving them from one house to the other some pieces had come off, which I put in brown paper on the top of a cabinet in the dining-room—on Friday evening, 26th September, I cleaned the glass shades and stand and dusted inside the shades—they were all right then, there were no chips or pieces—on the Wednesday I noticed some crumbs of the sulphate inside the shade, fresh done—about two months before this my husband broke off a piece from the vase about the size of a pin's-head and dissolved it in hot water for the purpose of putting on a child's scratch—the prisoner was present at the time, and she asked my husband if Tommy was to drink it would it kill him, and my husband answered, "Yes, and you too."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite certain that the prisoner was present on that occasion—I had a satisfactory character with her when she came to me, a written one—during the time she was in our service she has not</p>

               <p>shown signs of violent temper, she was quiet—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the vases; it is very brittle—no one else could have been in the house on 29th September without my knowing it—it was about half-past 4 in the afternoon when I had the first beer—it was in the evening that I was dozing for a time—I think I dozed about a quarter of an hour as near as I can say—I had drunk about half a glass of the beer—it would be the prisoner's duty to empty the slops unless she was ordered the contrary—she did not endeavour to get away after the police came; she was in the house on the next morning doing her duty as usual.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Catford Bridge—on 29th September, about 11 at night, some one came to me—I went down and found the prisoner there, and asked her what was amiss—she told me her mistress had been taking some blue water or something in her beer—I at once went with her to Mrs. Browning's—I found her upstairs sitting in a chair vomiting, and complaining of pain in the stomach and bowels; she was suffering considerable pain—I administered hot water and salad oil, and treated her for that pain—I examined the vomit; it was of a greenish colour mixed with food, I smelt a coppery odour—I saw on the table part of a glass of beer, quite half a glass; it looked quite green—I tasted it and found it tasted coppery and very acid—there was a jug on the table with similar stuff in it—I afterwards put the liquid from the jug into clean bottles—I gave Rittman one of the bottles; the other one Mrs. Player had, and it got broken—I afterwards went downstairs and saw the prisoner—I asked her where she got the beer from—she showed me the beer barrel—I at once drew some of it and tasted it; it was perfectly good beer, there was no coppery smell or tste—the key was in the tap—I saw Mrs. Browning next day—she was not in quite so great pain as the day before, she was feeling sick—I examined the vomit that day—I put a knife into it and it gave it a coppery colour and a deposit of copper on the blade; that is the test of copper—I took charge of some of the vomit and put it in a bottle and gave it to Butcher—I was afterwards shown two vases in the dining-room—they are crystal, sulphate of copper; it would dissolve more readily in hot water if broken up—I have dissolved some of the copper in beer, and it turns the beer green—Mrs. Browning afterwards gave me a dishcloth, and I found it was green; that also appeared to be from sulphate of copper—it is not decided what would be a fatal dose of this stuff if retained; taking a quantity of it in beer would endanger life—vomiting soon afterwards would bring it away—notwithstanding the vomit the pains continued on the Tuesday.</p>

On 30th September, about half-past 4, the last witness handed me a bottle of fluid—I got the beer-tap key and went to the house; the prisoner opened the door to me—I drew from the barrel some of the beer—I examined it; it was perfectly clear and bright—I corked it up and took possession of it; it was perfectly good beer—Mrs. Browning spoke to me—the prisoner was sent for, and Mrs. Browning made a statement to me in the prisoner's presence. (<hi rend="italic">The state<lb/>ment was here read:</hi> "At half-past 10 last night I sent the prisoner to the cellar to get beer for supper; she brought it upstairs; I poured out a glass and drank about half of it. It felt very ill, and commenced to vomit.") I told the prisoner she would be charged with administering poison to Mrs. Browning—she replied "I did not put any poison in the beer"—on Thursday, 2nd October, I went to the house and took possession of some of the vomit in a bottle, and I took this bottle containing the beer and vomit and some of the beer to Dr. Dupre—I also took possession of a cloth, handkerchief, and newspaper, and piece of soap; they had all green marks on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of chemistry at the West<lb/>minister Hospital, and one of the analysts to the Home Office—On 3rd October I received from Inspector Butcher two glass bottles, a jar, and a paper parcel—one bottle was labelled as drawn from the barrel of beer—I examined it; it was sound beer, nothing the matter with it—another bottle contained a greenish liquid—I weighed it; there was 5 1/2 ounces, about a tumblerful, in it—I found 39 1/2 grains of sulphate of copper; copper does not smell—I also examined the bottle containing some of the vomit; I found it contained very nearly 7 grains of sulphate of copper—sulphate of copper, if taken in a sufficient quantity, is a poison—it depends very much on the health whether it would kill—perhaps in a healthy person 39 1/2 grains, when in beer, might not, but in a person already ill it might be very serious—it produce pain and vomiting; it seriously endangers health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 39 1/2 grains was in a tumblerful of liquid—the effect of sulphate of coper is at once to produce vomiting; as a rule, it does not stay upon the stomach any time, it is generally rejected at once—the 39 1/2 grains would represent a size as big as the topof the little finger—I think one of these pieces put into a tumbler of liquid might have done all the mischief—I don't think the use of a dirty cloth in wiping out the beer jug would account for his.</p>

On 20th September I was fetched to Mr. Deacon's shop, and as I arrived at the door I met the prisoner just coming out—I stopped him—Mr. Deacon was behind the counter—the prisoner was charged with the unlawful possession of two napkin rings, which were shown to me—before I took him I asked him if he would give any account of how he came by them—he said that he did not feel disposed to tell me, but they were his own property, and if I liked to go with him to 46, Gabel street, I could see his wife—I went towards 46, Gable Street, with him, and on the way he said that he did not like to go with me, it would be such a <hi rend="italic">show up</hi>, and he would wait at the corner of the street for me if I would go—when we had got a few yards he ran away for half a dozen yards, but I caught him, and told him I should take him to the police-station and charge him with the un<lb/>lawful possession of the two rings—I did so—the charge was read over at the station, and I searched him, and found on him five napkin rings, a caddy spoon, one cruet-stand, four spirit lables, one portrait case, a seal, and a pencil-case; the flat portion of the cruet-stand was under his Guernsey—these articles were identified by Mr. Lushington—I also found some pawntickets, two of which related to rings, and one for a coat—he was taken back and recharged with having all the other property upon him—the inspector read the charge to him, he made no reply.</p>

I was very tired, and laid down to sleep; I had walked all the way from Portsmouth. I was not on the property, I was on the high road. I was never seen nearer the place than some hundred yards. I tried to pawn the property, and that is where I have done wrong.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in Wandsworth gaol for a month for striking a woman who the prisoner was cohabring with—I may have told him before our marriage that I was in the family way, I do not recollect it—it is false that upon that he consented to go through, the ceremony of marriage with me; I had left him two or three months, and he followed me about and wanted me to come back, but I said that I would not live in adultery any longer—after that we were married.</p>

About 20 minutes past 12 on the morning of 3rd October I was called to the stop of the last witness, who told me in Fleming's presence that he had tendered a counterfeit shilling in payment for some fish—I said to Fleming, "Have you got any more about you?—he said, "You can search me"—I did so in the shop, and found two sixpences, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bronze—the last witness declined to charge him—I afterwards met Leat, 69 <hi rend="italic">L</hi>. and spike to him—I saw the three prisoners leave the last witness's shop together immediately—they went along Lower Marsh together—I followed them, and in consequence of what I saw I laid hold of Thompson—I was in uniform—I said, "I intend to search you to see what you have about you"—he resisted and said, "I have nothing"—I put my hand in his right trousers pocket, and amongst other money found sixpence in silver and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze, and two counterfeit shillings and this broken one—he said nothing—I told him I should take him to the station—on the way he said, "You have got me fair set," and immediately ducked and tried to slip out of his coat, but I was too quick, and took him safely to the station—in the meantime Leat and another constable had taken the other two men there—I went back to the prosecutor's shop, and he came to the station and charged them and gave me one piece of the broken coin, the other piece he had lost—at the station when the prisoners were charged the prosecutor took one of the bad shillings found on Thompson and broke it.</p>
