               <p>Q. What did you see ?</p>
               <p>Foster. Please you, my Lord, she was sitting at the Foot of the Bed, with her Child sucking at her Breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the Night was this ?</p>
               <p>Foster. It was about a Quarter before five in the Afternoon; I sat just facing of her; it was up two pair of Stairs, on the 9th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Husband?</p>
               <p>Foster. Her Husband had been a board of a Ship for a Fortnight or three Weeks. He comes up; as he got up half way the Stairs, he cry'd, Hollo ! before he came into the Room; he cry'd, Hollo ! two or three times, Are you all dead or alive? So he came immediately into the Room with an empty Quart-Bottle in one Hand, and a Pistol in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he came in ?</p>
               <p>Foster. He never said another Word, but shot her dead; she was dead directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no Reason why he did it?</p>
               <p>Foster. He said nothing. As soon as ever he had shot her, he said, Lord Jesus Christ have Mercy upon me. I have killed my Wife accidentally !</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point the Pistol to her ?</p>
               <p>Foster. He pointed it to her left Breast directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this Man before?</p>
               <p>Foster. My Lord, I believe I know'd him better than eight Years; his first Wife lodged in the House where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any Quarrel between them ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140003"/>Foster. If they quarrell'd, they made it up again: She wanted all Necessaries both as to wearing Apparel and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Man before this seem to be in his Senses, or out of his Senses?</p>
               <p>Foster. When he was drunk, he was very nonsensical as others.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he when he was sober?</p>
               <p>Foster. I can say nothing of his being out of order.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Foster. He was drunk. After he had shot her, he went down Stairs, and resign'd himself up to this Man

               <p>Jefferys. I can't, my Lord. Then I immediately ran up the Court, and saw the Prisoner come down with one of his Hands bloody, but which it was I can't say.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say, how, or why he did it?</p>
               <p>Jefferys. He said he did it accidentally. He said, I have shot my Wife dead, dead. I said, if he had done such an Action as that I should not part with him. He said, I will surrender myself to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem much concern'd?</p>
               <p>Jefferys. No, my Lord, not much concern'd; he seem'd something in Liquor. I told my Servant to take care of him while I went and got an Officer. I ask'd him, What Business he had with that Pistol? And he told me, that the Mate of a Ship had set him on Shore with it, to have a Rammer put to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any Thing else?</p>
               <p>Jefferys. He told me, that he had try'd to let it off two or three Times, as he came along, but it would not go of.</p>

            , Surgeon. At the Time the Coroner's Inquest sat, I was sent for on the Saturday, and I found the Wound just above the left Breast penetrared into the Thorax; and I found another where the Ball went through. I apprehend the Pistol I was clapp'd close to her Breast, because the Skin was burned for about two Inches round the Wound; the Skin was like a Parchment.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Attorney-General. Give my Lord and the Jury an Account, when you saw him.</p>
               <p>Gosling. On the <rs id="t17471014-2-cd8" type="crimeDate">26th of September, 1746</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17471014-2-off7 t17471014-2-cd8"/>. I saw the the Prisoner at the Bar, in Company with several others, arm'd with Fire-arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What Number were there?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I believe about eight or ten. The Prisoner was arm'd with a Brass Gun, and a Brace of Pistols. They were all on Horse-back, and had several drove Horses; they had with them several Half-Anchors and Oil skin Bags. I believe there might be eight or ten drove Horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what Gang it was?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I can't tell. He had People that he used to harbour in his House, which they used to call his Gang.</p>
               <p>Q. What are Oil skin Bags made use of for?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Oil-skin Bags are made use of purely to put Tea in. They are generally thrown on the Horse's Saddle, one on one side, and the other on the other side.</p>
               <p>Solicitor-General. I ask you, Whether Tea, that comes over run in that manner, is not generally put up ready to be thrown upon the Horses.</p>
               <p>Gosling. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Tea brought over by any other Persons in that Ways ?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole Gang arm'd?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who makes use of these Half-Anchors ?</p>
               <p>Gosling. The Smugglers chiefly. They are flung on both ones of the Horse; and they sometimes contain Rum and sometimes Wine.</p>
               <p>Q. About what Size might there Cases be?</p>
               <p>Gosling. They might be, to the best of my Knowledge, about four Gallon.</p>
               <p>Attorney-General. I think they can't be imported by Act of Parliament in those small Casks; they can't be imported under sixty Gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Merchants, or fair Dealers, import their Tea in Oil-skin Bags?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Never in my Life.</p>
               <p>[Cross Examination.]</p>
               <p>Council. What are you?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I am an Attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the Manner of Merchants bringing Goods?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I am unacquainted with the Manner of Merchants bringing Goods.</p>
               <p>Council. This Fact you speak of was in September was a Twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Gosling. It was the 26th of September 1746.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give an Information against this Man for Smuggling?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I can't say, it was a little before the last Assizes.</p>
               <p>Council. Then it might possibly be in August; how can you recollect particularly September 1746, now you can't give an Account of the Day or the Week?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I know it was before the Assizes; I think it was some time in August; he was committed to Maidstone Goal in June; I charged him with the Fact before.</p>
               <p>Council. Why did you not charge him before?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Because I had been in the North of England, I did not dare to do it till there was a Party of Dragoons down.</p>
               <p>Council. I think you charged him upon something of your own Prosecution?</p>
               <p>Gosling. He was acquitted of that by the Act of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140005"/>Q. Had you never a Dispute, or Law-suit, with him? Did you not declared Mr Merchant, that you borrowed some Swords in order to kill Tickner?</p>
               <p>Gosling. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you buy these Swords of?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Of one Barthalomew Thompson.</p>
               <p>Council. I ask you, upon what Day was it you charged this Prisoner at the Bar to be enquired after ?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I gave an Information to Mr Cook for robbing of me, as well as riding thro' the Parish of Hawkhurst.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. I should be glad to know, whether the 26th of September was the only time?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I saw him the 4th of August before; I have seen him at divers other times before, but I can't take upon me to lay any particular Day.</p>
               <p>Attorney-General. Then you did not dare to give this Information till you had a Party of Dragons?</p>
               <p>Gosling. I liv'd at Hawkhurst for some time, and was forc'd to quit the Parish and leave my Business, for I was in Danger of my life.</p>
               <p>Attorney-General. Had you the Assistance of any Dragoons, of Foot Soldiers ?</p>
               <p>Gosling. There was a Party of Dragoons down about Goudhurst and Hawkhurst, and he was taken up by that Party of Dragoons, and what they call the Militia.</p>
               <p>[Cross Examination.]</p>
               <p>Council. You are upon Oath; I would ask you, whether you had not a Quarrel; and whether you had not Sheep and Oxen, from time to time, when you was pleased to command them?</p>
               <p>Gosling. The case is this, if I must relate the whole Story. When I first came to settle in the Parish of Hawkburst, the Prisoner employed me to sue one Sorrel, who was indebted to him four or five Pounds; I sued Sorrel to a Writ of Enquiry. Before I could take him up, he was committed to Maidstone Goal upon the Account of Horse-stealing, and I did not care to proceed any further. When he came out again, Tickner required me to pursue it; upon which I desired my Money, which was ten or a dozen Pounds; I ask'd him several times for my Money: I knowing the Man's case, offered to take it at ten Shillings a time as he could spare it; he promised me he would. After this, he brought me a Sack of Wheat, and a Hog, or two Bushels of Wheat, and a Hog; that is all I had: Upon his bringing these Things, he gave me a Note of Hand for eight or nine Pounds. I had divers times asked him for this Money; he would say, he would pay me this time and that time, and at last, that he would never pay me; he said, if I ask'd him for it he would whip me, or Horse pord me: With that I said, I would not ask him by Word of Mouth. After this, he rod after the Officer, with a drawn Sword, thro' the Parish of Hawkhurst.</p>

               <p>Council. When was this Affair of all this Law?</p>
               <p>Gosling. It was a matter of six Years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the nineteen Lambs ?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Last July, or August after, I had got a Judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. What Dealings had you with him between 1744 and 1746?</p>
               <p>Gosling. No Dealings; but endeavoured to get my Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a Pair of Oxen and a Stear, and nineteen Lambs and Sheep?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Yes; these I had in July last.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this did you give this Information?</p>
               <p>Gosling. He was in Custody, and in Goal; when I had these Goods of him; says he, If you will let me loose, I will pay you the nineteen Pounds? I said, Peter, if you like well to pay me the nineteen Pounds, or give me Value for it, you may: I will, says he, if you will give me a Release? I said, Peter, I will do you justice, if you will do me justice.</p>
               <p>Council. How came he to pay you when he was in Custody?</p>
               <p>Gosling. Because he thought to make a Friend of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me, if I would pay him eighteen Pounds, nine Shillings, he would release me. I told him, I had not Money: He told me, If I would pay him, he would release me, and I should be the sooner Home to my Family.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say any thing to him of that sort?</p>
               <p>Gosling. No, I never did say so.</p>
               <p>- Buckler. I have known the Prisoner three or four Years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live?</p>
               <p>Buckler. In Saunders.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him smuggling?</p>

               <p>Buckler. I saw him last September was a Twelve-month.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner? Give an Account to the Court of his Behaviour, when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Hepbourn. I was ordered upon a Party to take the Prisoner for smuggling; as we had Information we went, about four o'Clock in the Morning we came within sight of his House.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day was it?</p>
               <p>Hepbourn. It was of a Sunday last June; accordingly a Party of our Men went down to the Front of his House, and I and another, that knew him, went down backwards; accordingly as we were down in the Field I happen'd to see the Prisoner making his Escape with nothing but his Shirt on from the Backdoor; accordingly I stopp'd him, and bid him to stand, or else I would fire at him; accordingly he ask'd me, What I wanted with him? The other Man, that was with me, knew him, and said, it was Rough Tickner. I said he was rough enough, and he should go with me; Upon that I said he should go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140007"/> to the House and put his Clothes on. He went up and put his Clothes on, and we had him before the Justice of Peace. We were told, if we did not make half we should not light of him. When I took him he had he was going to case himself. I said, he need not to so far to case himself.</p>

               <p>Luller. I have known him for about three Months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you privy to some Actions between Gosling and Tickner?</p>
               <p>Luller. I never saw Tickner in my Life; but Gosling sent for me to buy some Stock, and while I was there Mrs Tickner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gosling say whose Goods they were?</p>
               <p>Luller. He said he had the selling of them upon his own Account. The Wife of the Prisoner was present in the Room. I bid Money for them, and Gosling said the Stock was aside over to him; so I bought the Stock of him, and paid him for it. He promis'd that he would be a Friend to Mrs Tickner, and get her Husband out of Goal as soon as possible. I paid him six Pounds for them. He promis'd Mrs Tickner to meet her at Mr Cook's, and get her Husband out of Gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day of the Month was this?</p>
               <p>Luller. The 2d of July.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. Did he promise to get him out of Gaol?</p>

               <p>Council for the Defendant. This Act of Parliament is against those that are arm'd with Fire-Arms, in order to be aiding and assisting in running and carrying away uncustomed Goods. This is laid to be uncustomed Goods. For my part, I don't know what uncustomed Goods are. Here's nothing appears that there are any Goods. Here's carrying something in Bags: Because Smugglers carry Tea in Oil-skin Bags, it therefore must be Tea. The Attorney General takes Notice of this extraordinary Point of Law, and submits it to the Court. This Evidence given to the Court and Jury is not sufficient to maintain the Indictment, because 'tis required by Act of Parliament, in order to bring a Person within the Description of this Act, that they go arm'd to the Number of Three or more; but the going arm'd alone is not sufficient to bring him within this Act of Parliament; but it must be in aiding and assisting in running and carrying away uncustomed Goods. Now, though 'tis fully prov'd, that the Person did thus appear with Arms, and some Goods, yet it does not appear they were uncustomed Goods.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. I readily grant these Things must appear to the Satisfaction of the Jury. It must appear to the Jury, that the Prisoner was armed, and that is proved by two Witnesses uncontradicted, and among seven Witnesses produced, there is not out of them produced to shew, whether he was not concerned in that Transaction with Arms and Fire arms mentioned; and there is not one single Word said by way of Objection, by Witness, or Council at the Bar. What is the next, in order to be assisting; in the first place, this is matter fact, which the Jury are to judge of; but, say they, it must not depend upon presumption, but by a Person seeing the Tea; now there is nothing more certain that that Fact is not necessary the Witness seeing of it, any more than seeing a Man kill another in the dark; if this kind of Rule is to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140008"/> laid, no one could be convicted, because no Witness saw him; but the Law knows otherwise, this Court knows otherwise, this Jury knows otherwise; that is the case here; it is not pretended that they saw the Tea taken out of the Bag, neither need that be proved; Circumstances are sufficient to prove to the Jury, that this was uncustomed Goods, it appears that they were just in the manner that all uncustomed Goods are; this has been proved by the Witnesses, which the known Experience of Mankind see it to be, and this is the only Commodity brought this way; the Witnesses have proved it to be so, and have the Gentlemen attempted to give an Account how this Man came to go with eight or nine Persons armed in a lawful legal Trade; let an Account be given, if possible, how eight Men, going in this way, with driven Horses, and Oil skin Bags; thus with respect to the Tea, the other with respect to Brandy, that they carry in these small Casks, made use of in all smuggling Ways, as being small and portable; and the Law itself has taken so much Notice, that Brandy in small Casks so imported, is forfeited, Ship and Goods; the Law has not made it necessary, in orde r to prove Persons guilty of this Crime by the Witnesses that saw the Goods unpack'd; the Law is made, upon this presumption, that by the Help of their armed Force they might prevent their being stopp'd; if it wants any thing, it is a negative Evidence on their Side; let any one of their Evidence be examined with respect to his Character; 'tis the strongest presumptive Evidence in the world, that the Man does not bring one Witness, to say, that they do not believe him to be a Smuggler.</p>
               <p>The Jury could not credit Gosling's Evidence, therefore the Prisoner was <rs id="t17471014-2-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

Accordingly he was laid hold of by a criminal Prosecution, and he is now indicted upon a Statute made in the Second Year of his present Majesty, for the Benefit of all Mankind, to secure them against such Villains. Forgery was always, by the common Law of Nature, as well as the Law of this Country, a very great Crime indeed; but the Common Law did not punish it, as in some other Cases, with Death; and 'tis more material that it should be subjected to such a Punishment, because 'tis a Crime of that secret clandestine Nature, that it becomes extremely difficult to find it out; and therefore to prevent these Crimes, it becomes your Province to do Justice to the Publick, where the Fact is prov'd as 'tis charg'd. - it is enacted, '' That from and after the 9th of June, 1729 '' in case any Person shall falsely make, or counterfeit, '' or aid and assist in falsely making, forging, '' or counterfeiting any Deed, Will, Bill of Exchange, '' Promissory Note, or any Acquittance, for '' Money or Goods, with an Intention to defraud '' any Person; or utter the same, knowing it to be '' false and counterfeited, he is to suffer Death, without '' Benefit of the Clergy'' He stands indicted by this Law, and in two Respects, upon the Foundation of this Law: The one is, as the Forger and Maker of this Deed; the other is, that he has publish'd this Deed, knowing it to be forg'd; both of which are made Death, without Benefit of Clergy. So that the Fact we are to prove to you is. Whether that Deed we are to produce to you is a forged Deed? And in the next Place, whether this Person did forge or assist in the doing of it; and then, whether he did not utter it, knowing it to be forged and counterfeited?</p>

Mr Clap fill'd up the Bill of Sale, every Thing in order, all but executing, which the Prisoner said he would go that Day and get the Son to do. The Prisoner took the Bill of Sale, and the Probate along with him. In three or four Days he comes to ask me, if I had got an Answer from Portsmouth? I said, I did not care to buy the Thing. I told him I had no Answer. I did not say a great deal about it. So on the 23d or the 22d he came again, and I told him I had got a Letter from Portsmouth, and the Answer was, that the Ticket was in the office at Portsmouth, belonging to Hugh Price, and the Sum of Money was mention'd. Then I thought it was all safe. Then he produc'd the Bill of Sale, and the Administration, sign'd George Price. As he said, sign'd by

               <p>Attorney General. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. The Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted upon an Act of Parliament made in the 19th Year of his present Majesty; and 'tis for a Crime that you have heard, and have had several Prosecutions founded upon that Act of Parliament, which makes the Crime a Felony, without Benefit of the Clergy. You know too well the Consequence of that Law, to make it necessary for me to explain the Nature of it to you. The Prisoner stands indicted for a Breach of that Law. The Prisoner liv'd at Hawkhurst in the County of Kent, a Place famous in the News-Papers for great Riots, great Disorders, committed by a Gang of Smugglers, and the Prisoner is one enlisted in that Gang, whose Business, together with the rest, is putting the Laws in defiance. About the Beginning of August last the Prisoner at the Bar, with a great Number of other Persons, all of them on Horseback, arm'd with Fire-Arms, the Prisoner particularly, among the rest, with a Carbine or a Blunderbuss, together with the rest, was on Horseback; and they were then accompanied with several drove Horses, and upon the Horses they rode, as upon those they drove, they carried great Quantities of Tea in Oil-skin Bags, and Half-Anchors, peculiar to those Sort of People; a Peculiarity it is which no Goods besides is carried, in order to elude Justice. In this Manner they came, thus arm'd, thus accounter'd; they came to a Place call'd Lyn, in the County of Kent, from thence they came to a Place call'd Appledore Road, there, contrary to Law, protecting themselves in this illegal Practice: I doubt not, but our Witnesses will give you Satisfaction of the Reality of the Fact he stands charged with, and I hope you will do the Prisoner justice.</p>

               <p>Attorney-General. Will you give an Account to my Lord and the Jury, when you saw the Prisoner with a Gang of Smugglers ?</p>
               <p>Wills. I have know him from his Infancy, tho' I never knew that he abused his Neighbours, or common People, but I have seen him among a common Gang of Smugglers. The last Time that ever I saw him was the 5th of August, 1746. with a Carbine on his Shoulder, and a Couple of Oil-skin Bags underneath him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many People were there in Number?</p>
               <p>Wills. I believe twenty; and there were many drove Horses; they were loaded with some Tubs, and Oil-skin Bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine it was Tea in the Oil-skin Bags?</p>
               <p>Wills. Yes, because it was the general Way of Loading.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be in those Tubs?</p>
               <p>Wills. Either Brandy, Rum, or Wine; each Tub holds about four Gallons a-piece.</p>

               <p>Solicitor General. Which Way was the Gang going?</p>
               <p>Wills. They were going Appledore Road; that is, towards Old Rosmary, not towards New Rosmary.</p>
               <p>Solicitor-General. Then I ask you; whether the usual Carriage for the Smugglers Tea is not in Oilskin Bags? Do you know of any other Commodity carried in that Way?</p>
               <p>Wills. No, Sir. Dutch Brandy is generally carried in whole Anchors, French Brandy in Half-Anchors.</p>
               <p>Attorney General. Did you ever see any Brandy, or other Goods, carried that way, if not smuggled ?</p>
               <p>Wills. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was understood by the Hawkhurst Gang in the Country?</p>
               <p>Wills. We understood they were a Sort of People that committed many Outrages. I can't say that I ever saw the Prisoner commit any Outrages. I have seen him twenty Times.</p>
               <p>Solicitor General. How many were armed?</p>
               <p>Wills. I did not see any one of them unarm'd; they were all arm'd, some with Carbines, some with one Pistol, and some with two.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Horses might they have besides what they rode?</p>

               <p>Sollicitor-General. Had they any Horses besides what they rode upon ?</p>
               <p>Wiseman. There might be thirty or forty drove Horses. They had Half-Anchor Calks and Oil-skin Bags. I imagin'd they had Tea and Brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they full?</p>
               <p>Wiseman. They were full of something.</p>
               <p>Sollicitor-General. Explain to the Jury why you think those Bags contain Tea.</p>
               <p>Wiseman. The Reason why I think so, because they never carry in any other; but I don't know, I did not see the Bags open'd.</p>
               <p>Sollicitor-General. I suppose you did not dare to ask them that Question?</p>
               <p>Wiseman. They would have shot me dead if I had presum'd to ask them. Some of these Bags contain Half an Hundred and some a Quarter of an Hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. During the seven Years you was in that Country, did you ever see any fair Trader, or Carrier, go with Goods in that way. Are these Gangs grown so notorious that the Country know them.</p>
               <p>Wiseman. They are got so notorious we can't live in our own Houses. That very Person himself, the Prisoner, came to my House, and insulted and abused me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this Gang go by, did you know them enough to know what Gang they where?</p>
               <p>Wiseman. Some of them belong'd to Goudburst, and some to other Places, but they are call'd the Hawkburst Gang.</p>

            . I am an Officer in the Customs. I have lived in Kent as an Officer in the Customs at Hawkhurst, and I have lived in Sussex.</p>
               <p>Sollicitor-General. What is the Practice of Smugglers in carrying off their Goods?</p>
               <p>Walker. Such time as I have been an Officer, which has been ten Years, I never took no Tea in my Life upon Horses, but what was in Oil-skin Bags. Wherever I had a Suspicion, and found Oil-skin Bags, I always found Tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How many may you have found?</p>
               <p>Walker. Thousands of Bags; when they are in a Hurry, and taken from the Sea, they are in Oil-skin Bags; but when they carry them up into the Country, they carry them in Sacks; there is never a Gang that comes from the Sea-side, but rides with something upon their Horses, unless one that is got from a Plough-boy to be worth about 4 or 5000 l. Drove Horses carry 100 and a Half, and sometimes 100 and a Quarter.</p>
               <p>Attorney-General. In what Casks is Wine run, or Brandy, carried?</p>
               <p>Walker. 'Tis generally in Half-Anchors; I have known six or seven Half-Anchors upon a Horse; a Man will ride upon four very well.</p>
               <p>Sollicitor-General. Do you know in the Smuggling-Cutters, whether Tea comes over in these Bags, and Liquor in these Casks?</p>
               <p>Walker. There is, first, a Bag that is made of a sort of Stuff, that they make their weak sort of Sacking of, and they put the Oil-skin to keep the Wet out; there is a slight sort of Cloth that is put first, then the Oil-skin is put over that, because it should not take wet. I have known your fine Tea double-cased, but I never saw any Tea but in an Oil-skin Bag.</p>
               <p>Sollicitor-General. You have said the Tea comes in Oil-skin Bags; now as to these Casks the Size is generally Half-Anchors, can any Quantity of Liquor be entered in Half-Anchors, what is the smallest Size Cask that any Liquor can be entered in?</p>
               <p>Walker. Sixty Gallons.</p>
               <p>Sollicitor-General. Did you ever see any others carry Things with an armed Force?</p>
               <p>Walker. I have challenged People upon the Road, but it is your Duffers who carry your Spitalfields Goods instead of Run-Goods, they would pretty near imitate the Smugglers.</p>
               <p>Sollicitor General. But do these Duffers go with an armed Force of ten or twenty ?</p>
               <p>Walker. They have went two or three together, but never with Arms.</p>

The Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted for a Crime pretty much of the same Nature of that which you tried but just now, but indicted upon another Act of Parliament, which has not made the Punishment so great; by that Act of Parliament which was in the 9th of his present Majesty, it is provided, That if any Persons to the Number of three or more, assemble with Fire-Arms, in order to be aiding and assisting in the running and landing uncustomed Goods, and Goods liable to pay Duties, upon a Conviction for that Offence they are to be judged guilty of Felony, and to be transported for seven Years.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Prisoner at the Bar is indicted for his being guilty of the Crime mentioned in this Act of Parliament, which is, for his being assembled and armed with these Persons, or upwards, in the manner therein mentioned, in order to be aiding and assisting in running uncustomed Goods. Gentlemen, the Prisoner is one of those Persons we shall prove to you by the Testimony of two Witnesses, both of them who were present at that time, who were aiding and assisting at the same time; if he is found guilty, the consequence of which will be, that he will be transported for seven Years.</p>

               <p>Tye. At the Parish of Sheverton the Prisoner was armed with a brace of Pistols; the most of them were on Horseback; he was aiding and assisting in the carrying away Tea and Brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantities?</p>
               <p>Tye. There might be three Quarters of a Hundred; I saw some of the Tea opened, but I did not see his opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Tea run?</p>
               <p>Tye. They took it from on Board of a Cutter. I saw it run.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Brandy come out of the same Cutter?</p>
               <p>Tye. Yes, Sir, and the Cutter was within a Mile of the Shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Tye. It was by Old Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did all those People come there for?</p>
               <p>Tye. To receive uncustom'd Goods, Tea and Brandy. They came to wait for that Vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might there be landed at that Time ?</p>
               <p>Tye. There was fifty Hundred Weight landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that fifty Hundred Weight all carried away?</p>
               <p>Tye. All carried away. It was in Oil-skin Bags first, then put into large Sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the usual Way?</p>
               <p>Tye. Yes, Sir, always when I was concern'd.</p>

               <p>Tye. And he might have two Anchors of Brandy, or one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what Day of the Week it was?</p>
               <p>Tye. I can't say, but I rather think it was on a Sunday; it was the latter End of June. There were two Companies of Smugglers together.</p>
               <p>Q. How many might this Gang consist of?</p>

            , who in their publick, as well as private Capacity, are certainly the greatest Traders in Europe. You will find in the Progress of this Trial the Necessity the Company is under, in putting a Stop to the Progress of these Practices. Generally speaking, this Tea, when it comes to be landed, is put on Botolph Wharf; and 'tis necessary to put their Tea into Carts, to be carried to the Company's Warehouses; and 'tis necessary to employ Porters and Carmen. And I think, Gentlemen, on the 14th of September there was a Discovery made of a great Fraud upon the Company; the Fraud was this, the Carmen, when they took the Tea in order to carry it to the Warehouses, they considered how much Money it produc'd, they bored Holes in the Chests; one saw another do it; at last it became universal. The Prisoner, he is an Apprentice to one

            , a Master Carman, he had seen the Carmen playing their Tricks, and he bored a Hole and shook out about half a Pound of Tea. This will be prov'd to you by one of the Accomplices. As soon as he had got this Tea he carried it to a Person that he thought it would be very welcome to. The Indictment is against this particular Person. We will call our Witnesses, and prove the Fact, and you will see it necessary, in order to preserve the Property of the fair Trader, and to do Justice to the Company, you will find no difficulty to prove the Prisoner guilty.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the Day did you lost it?</p>
               <p>Kemp. I can't say directly the time, but I believe it was about two o'Clock; there were two People came into my Shop; I have seen the Prisoner several times, and the Person that was with her, as far as I know, upon the same Errand; while I was stepp'd aside, to change some Money for a Neighbour, in the interim, I apprehend, this Person conveyed this Remnant of Lawn under her Cloke; when I came back from the Cash, she was not gone; I received from her, and her Companion, two or three Shillings for Goods that they bought; my young Man was on the Stairs looking over them; he goes to the Desk and writes me a Line, that the young Woman, the Prisoner, had taken something from the Counter, or out of the Window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where she put it?</p>
               <p>Kemp. He said it was in her Pocket, or under her Cloke; when they paid me, I let them go out of the Shop, and I said, are you sure they have stole any thing? He said, I am positive they have; upon that I called her, and she came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her?</p>
               <p>Kemp. I got her into the Shop, and she dropp'd the Lawn at the Door; I did not see her drop it myself; I charged her with taking of it; she seemed at first to deny it, but afterwards confess'd it, and hop'd I would forgive her; she acknowledged she did take it, before several People, and this

               <p>Council. My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, This Indictment, against the Prisoners at the Bar, as it imports, upon the reading it, is nothing more than a common Felony; but when the Circumstances of this Case is laid before you, you will find it to be a Crime very uncommon, and very inhuman; 'tis for breaking open the Graves of the Dead, and stealing from thence the Leaden Coffins, in which they are deposited by their Friends. The most hardened at this Bar have some Remorse, some Awakenings, at the Sight of a dead Person; but these People were so far gone in their Villainy, that they attempted to break in upon the Graves of the Dead, and chose that Scene which to all other People would be Matter of Horror and Remorse. I suppose, they were tempted to do it, from that Thought, that the stealing from the Dead was a less Crime than stealing from the Living. They proceeded from one Theft to another, till at last they grew so barefac'd that their own Actions brought this Matter to light. The Defendant

You will observe, that Leaden Coffins required Assistance to move, therefore they were forc'd to apply to other People. As for Lamb the Sexton, he has the Command of four Persons in that Parish, who were the common Bearers, therefore he engag'd them in the Service, as being in the Service of the Parish; but that was not sufficient, they wanted more help, therefore Bilby was to take his Share, and he hires the two other Defendants

Though they have been, for some time, concerned in this Practice, they could not have many Opportunities of committing Thefts of this Kind; their only time was upon the occasion of Funerals, when the Vault was not closed up till the next Day; that was the time they took away these leaden Coffins. As this could not be very frequent, Lamb and Bilby together laid a Scheme how they might carry off greater Quantities; there was an Accident that gave them a better Opportunity for executing their Scheme: It seems some Water had drained into this Vault, Lamb thereupon applied himself to Mr Barton, Rector of the Parish, to have a Hole made, for this Drain to run off; Mr Barton gave no ear to him; he thought it improper to disturb the Coffins, therefore he refused it; Lamb made a second Application; upon that he sent for his Bricklayer to inspect into the Vault; and, upon his making the Report that there might be Means made use of, he did consent, and gave Orders to his own Bricklayer to make a Hole in the Side of the Wall for that Purpose, and the Hole was accordingly made; the Defendants immediately laid hold of this Opportunity; this Hole is but of a very short Date, in the beginning of September; upon this they frequently went to work, and through the Hole of this Vault, they dragged out the dead Bodies and the Lead; but it was soon discovered by the Constable, who seeing a Light in the Church in the Night-time, he began to suspect there were some evil Doings in the Church; therefore he resolved, the 22d of September, to go to the Church and enquire; accordingly, about one o'Clock in the Morning, he went to the Church; as soon as he came to the Door, Bilby the Grave-digger opened the Door but absolutely refused to let the Constable in, but let out the two Defendants, Chandler and Hooper,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140023"/> with Lead on their Backs. Tho' the Constable applied to Bilby, and told him his Apprehensions that there was something wrong going forwards; yet he absolutely refused his coming in, and gave him for Answer, that it does not signifie, that the Mummy was gone; the Constable was resolved to go in, and in a little time, three Persons concerned in carrying Lead, returned again to the Church; whereupon he took them up, and carried them to the Watch-house; the Constable kept them there, and the next Day they were carried before a Magistrate, and a Warrant was granted him to search the Houses of Lamb and Bilby, where they found Lead and Coffins cut up; upon which they were both taken up, and Bilby acknowledged they had cut up above fourscore Coffins. Gentlemen, if we prove these Things to your Satisfaction, I think you can have no doubt of those People's Design, in cutting up these Coffins and disposing of the Lead, it is impossible they could have any purpose in it but an intent to steal; the Sexton knew these Coffins were deposited there, and to remain there; the very cutting the Coffins to Pieces, is a plain Indication that their Intention in doing of it was the making Money of them; if you have any doubt of that, we can produce a Person to whom they sold this Lead of the Coffins to their own private Gain; if we can prove this, I make no doubt but we shall have your Verdict to punish such wicked Offenders, to make an Example of these Men, to deter others from committing the like Crimes.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The Punishment attending this Crime is not a Capital one; it is a Felony within the Benefit of the Clergy. But, Gentlemen, I can't help taking Notice to you, that in Lord Coke, almost the only Instance that can be found in Law-Books where this Felony was committed, and he had the Benefit of the Clergy: '' Thus, says he, he escaped the '' Sentence of Death, which he richly deserved for '' his Inhuman and barbarous Felony.''</p>
               <p>Council on the same Side. There will be no occasion for us, who are concerned in behalf of the Prosecution, to say any thing by way of Aggravation of the Crime for which the Prisoners stand indicted, the bare mentioning it must strike every one with Horror. I will therefore only add a single Word, in order to warn you from those Notions which some hard-hearted Men have imbibed upon this occasion, that as this Fact was committed on dead Bodies, which knew it not, and which were never the worse for the Robbery, it is great Mitigation of the Offence. But give me leave to assure you, 'tis an Offence and Robbery upon the living. The last Office we can pay to the Memory of a Father or Mother, or any near and dear Relation, is to furnish them with a decent Funeral, that their Bones may lie quiet and undisturbed; and for this we put ourselves to an Expence, and that Expence is often carried into Extravagance, and we receive a Satisfaction from the Thoughts of having so done; if therefore a Robbery is committed of those Things which we purchase at an Expence, for the Sake of this Satisfaction, such as Leaden-coffins, or the like, it is an Infringement upon that Satisfaction, and the Robbery is committed upon us. The Custom of decent Funerals has prevailed in all Ages, and among all Nations, and had it no other Recommendation than the bare employing such a Number of People in it's different Branches, as it does, it ought to be supported. And I am sure, did I want to aggravate the Crimes of the Prisoners, it might easily be done by putting you in mind, that they all of them had no other Way of getting their Bread, than by attending and carrying into Execution, those Rites and Ceremonies which the Decency and Solemnity of a Funeral must require.</p>

               <p>Council. Tell us what happen'd on the 22d of September last?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. Upon the 22d of September last, between the Hours of ten and eleven at Night, when I came to go down to the Watch-house there were a very great Mob before the Church-gate, and there were Lights in the Vault, and Lights in the Bellfrey of St Andrew's Church, Holborn. I dispers'd that Mob, and sent them about their Business. There was another, and I dispers'd that; and so the Third. Upon that I thought it was not upon a lawful Occasion they were there, and I try'd to get into the Church. One of the Watchmen told me, that he would give Bilby sixteen Pounds for the Share he would make of the Lead this Week. I try'd, my Lord, to get into the Church, by talking to Bilby, and giving him good Words, but I found I could not. I saw him go in and out of the Gate several Times. I saw Hooper and Chandler also come out.</p>
               <p>Council. You never saw Lamb.</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I never saw Lamb that Night. Bilby told me, he would let me in by and by, when it was proper.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see him come out of the Church?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I saw him open the Door. I saw Chandler, Hooper, and Bagwell, come out with a Load of Lead upon their Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Council. How great a Quantity might it be?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I believe there might at least be altogether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140024"/> on Hundred Weight, when they went out at the Church-gate. I met Bilby, and I ask'd him, if I might go in now? He said, Mr Chauncey, you need not go in now, for the Mummy is all gone.</p>
               <p>Council. Do you think it was Pieces of Coffins they carried.</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I am positive it was Pieces of Coffins. I said to Bilby, you have used me ill, now I will proclaim open War against you. So when these Men came back, Chandler, Hooper, and Bagwell, I took them to the Watch house; and Chandler and Hooper declared, they were employ'd by Bilby to carry the Lead out of St Andrew's Church into his own House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they at that Time say, whether the Coffins had been cut?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I did not ask them any Questions about it when I took them down the Watch-house. When I examin'd them they said, they were employ'd by Bilby. I went up to Bilby's House, and said to him, If you don't give me Satisfaction of what the Men have been about, I will commit them to the Compter. So Bilby said, he work'd under the Instructions of Mr Lamb; and he said, he would go and fetch Mr Lamb; and they came together down to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Council. About what Time was this?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. This was about two o'Clock; they came to pass their Words for these Men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take their Words?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. No, not at all. Mr Lamb then pretended, he had his Orders from Dr Barton, a verbal one. As I was about to carry these People to the Compter I was afraid of doing any Thing that was not right, I sent a Person to Mr Lamb, and he begg'd for God's sake that I would not commit the Men, but that he would take a Bottle with me, and make up the Affair. Alderman Gascoyne was busy, that I could not have a Hearing that Day; but the next Day we had a Hearing before Alderman Ironside, where they confess'd the carrying of the Lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all confess the carrying the Lead out of the Vault?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I can't say that Bil by did. Mr Alderman granted me a Search-Warrant, and I went into the House of Bilby the Grave-Digger; there I saw forty-four Pieces of Lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any Thing besides Lead?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. There was a few brass Handles, and as many Coffins cut to Pieces as would fill a common Rubbish Cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the Searching of Lamb's House?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. Yes, and I found in the House of Lamb the Sexton fifteen Pieces of Leaden Coffins, and two Coffin Plates with Inscriptions.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Lead, found at Lamb's House, was Coffin-lead?</p>

               <p>Chauncey. Yes, I am certain of it very well, for it stank enough to knock one down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the Examination of Lamb ?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. That was before my Lord Mayor at Guildhall; that was the Monday following; Lamb confess'd, that that Lead that was in his House, was Leaden-coffin, that was taken out of the Vault of St Andrew's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bilby say what became of their Bodies?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. He said, he paid 9 s. for the digging the Hole in the back part of the South-side of the Churchyard, where they put the Bodies after they had taken the Coffins from them.</p>
               <p>[Cross Examination.]</p>
               <p>Council. St Andrew's is in the Diocese of the Bishop of London is it not?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I am sure I am Constable of London, but I don't know whether that is in the Diocese of the Bishop of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take Lamb into Custody at the same time?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. I thought I could have him at any time.</p>
               <p>Council. Can you recollect what Authority he said he had for doing what he had done?</p>
               <p>Chauncey. He said he had a verbal Order for what he had done, but he did not say exactly what it was.</p>

               <p>Court. I desire to know what Lamb said when he came down?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. He did not speak a Word to any of us; I heard his Tongue as he came down, but I can't say what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done to these Leaden-coffins?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Where did you come at that Lead, did you break the Leaden-coffins open?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. It was doubled up, and laid to the Foot of the Arch, and there we took it up; I took it up by the Order of

               <p>Council. Are you sure you never saw a Coffin broke open?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. I never saw a Coffin broke up; I saw one cut after it was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you go to Bilby's House with Lead?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. I went four times, and one time I had a Load more than I could well carry; Bilby help'd us up with it often, and it was by his Order, and unto his House.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr Lamb all this time?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. He was in the Porch when they were carrying off the Lead.</p>

               <p>Q. What said Mr Lamb to Mr Bilby?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. He call'd Bilby a drunken Dog and the like, and said his Men did not work fast enough; they wanted Encouragement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Lead doubled up?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. No, Sir, I don't remember that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any body order him to do it?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. I can't say, the Body was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lamb by when the Body was taken out?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. Yes, as far as I saw, he was present at every thing.</p>
               <p>Council. By what Way did they get these Bodies, and Lead, out of the Vault ?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. There was a Place made on purpose that any Person might get through, a Hole, or Doorway, where a Man might walk to his full height; it was the common Door of the Vault that fronts Holborn, that was the Way the Lead was all brought out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bilby to Chauncey the Constable. Ask him whether I deny'd him going into the Church.</p>
               <p>Chauncey. He directly deny'd me at the Churchyard-Gate.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners Chandler and Hooper desir'd to know, How often he saw them carrying Lead away?</p>
               <p>Chauncey reply'd, He saw them but once a piece.</p>
               <p>Court to Bilby. Will you ask Bagwell any Question?</p>
               <p>Bilby. Ask him what Lamb said to me?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. He said you was a drunken Dog, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Chandler and Hooper desir'd the Evidence might be ask'd, What they had for their Night's Work?</p>
               <p>Bagwell's Answer. We had four Quarts of strong Beer, Bread and Cheese, and a Halfpenny I run in trust at the Alehouse, and I believe that Man had a Groat too.</p>
               <p>Q. How much Ale had you?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. We had four Quarts of Ale in all, besides two Bottles of small Beer, and some Bread and Cheese and Onions.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Bagwell. Please ye, my Lord, when we were charged with the Constable we had but a Trifle, and Bilby put his Hand into his Pocket, and gave us a Shilling; I think he gave it to Hooper.</p>
               <p>Council to Richard Dew. Have you any Office at St Andrew's, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Dew. I am a Bearer at St. Andrew's.</p>
               <p>Council. Has Mr Lamb, the Sexton of the Parish, any Command over you?</p>
               <p>Dew. Yes, Sir, he always has a very great Power over us, he and Bilby together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your being in this Vault on 21st or 22d of Sept.</p>
               <p>Dew. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From what Hour was you there?</p>
               <p>Dew. I was there from eight or nine at Night the 21st of Sept. till one or two in the Morning of the 22d.</p>
               <p>Council. During the time you was there, who else was there?</p>
               <p>Dew. The rest of my Partners Simpson and Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Lamb at that time, and Bilby, Chandler and Hooper?</p>
               <p>Dew. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose Order was you there?</p>
               <p>Dew. By Mr Lamb's Order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you for what Purpose you was to be there?</p>
               <p>Dew. To clean the Filthiness and Nastiness of the Vault, and to move some Coffins that wanted moving.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went first into the Vault did you see any Lead at that time ?</p>
               <p>Dew. We took some of the Coffins down, and some fell down.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140026"/>Q. ing the time you was there, did you cut any Coffins to pieces?</p>
               <p>Dew. Mr Lamb's Son did it, and I help'd him; we cut some to pieces that were whole one's before.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose Orders did you do it?</p>
               <p>Dew. By the Order of Mr Lamb the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of those?</p>
               <p>Dew. One part was carried to Mr Lamb's House, and the other to Mr Bilby's House, I am very sure of it, for I carried part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut more than one Coffin?</p>
               <p>Dew. More than two or three, but all were cut by Lamb and Bilby's Order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they agree about the Division of these Things ?</p>
               <p>Dew. No, a great many Oaths and bad Words pass'd about the Lead.</p>
               <p>[Cross Examination.]</p>
               <p>Council. Describe to the Court which Way you went into the Churchyard in order to go into the Vault?</p>
               <p>Dew. Mr Lamb had the Key of it, and he opened the Door and let us in?</p>
               <p>Q. At which Door?</p>
               <p>Dew. The Door next to Holborn, it was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Council. Pray how far is the Watch house from the Church-gate where you went in?</p>
               <p>Dew. About an hundred Yards, if not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the Watch was set when you went in?</p>
               <p>Dew. One Night it was set, and another Night it was not?</p>
               <p>Court. Was you in several Nights?</p>
               <p>Dew. Several Nights by Mr Lamb and Bilby's Direction, and cut Coffins to Pieces, and carried them off three Nights successively, before they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was in the Church, did one Candle do for you?</p>
               <p>Dew. We had a great many Candles; Mr Lamb brought a Pound or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of digging the Hole where the two Shells were carried to?</p>
               <p>Dew. I know nothing of digging the Hole till I went there and I carried something.</p>

               <p>Q. Where abouts was that Hole dug?</p>
               <p>Dew. In the Back-part of the Church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what Bigness the Hole was of?</p>
               <p>Dew. It was larger than some Graves are dug.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Did you hear any Person give Mr Lamb any Orders concerning the Vault?</p>
               <p>Dew. Yes, I was with him, and heard the Orders given the Friday before the Night.</p>
               <p>Council. Who was that Person who gave Mr Lamb the Orders?</p>
               <p>Dew. Mr Barton; I heard him order Lamb to take the Filth and Nastiness away, and put the old Coffins where Lamb and Bilby thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any Reason given for removing them?</p>
               <p>Dew. No Reason, only to clear the Shore that comes through the Vault.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you understand the Coffins were to be removed for good and all?</p>
               <p>Dew. No, to be sure, but till the Shore was cleaned that ran through the Vault, and then to be carried back again.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. When the Order was given Lamb, did not Lamb desire a Faculty to come into the Vault?</p>
               <p>Dew. No,</p>
               <p>Court. Do you believe the Bishop of London would grant a Faculty to cut Coffins to pieces ? Sure this is monstrous Behaviour, to throw Dirt on a Gentleman without any Sort of Proof.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. I must follow my Instructions, and will not go from them.</p>
               <p>Court. Let your Instructions be what they will, a Gentleman is not to be aspers'd without Proof: When you prove it I will believe it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Did not you hear Mr Barton say, he might take the old Coffins away?</p>
               <p>Dew. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear him bid him open the Coffins and take the Lead away? or, hear him say, He might take the Lead home ?</p>
               <p>Dew. No such Thing. He said, that as soon as the Vault was cleaned he should put the Coffins in their Places again.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you only understand this to be the Meaning of Mr Barton's Orders ? Or did you hear Mr Barton give the Order?</p>
               <p>Dew. I heard Mr Barton bid him put them in their Places again when the Vault was cleaned.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. You say, he told them to take the Coffins, and put them where Lamb and Bilby thought proper, and bring them back again. Then you don't know of any particular Place provided for them?</p>
               <p>Dew. Yes, there was a particular Place to be sure. The Vault was full. Bilby and Lamb both told Mr Barton the Wall was but a Brick and half thick, whereas it was three Bricks thick.</p>
               <p>Council. Had the Coffins you cut to pieces any Plates upon them?</p>
               <p>Dew. There was no Plate upon those I carried to Bilby's; but I believe Mr Lamb had a Basket that he put them in.</p>

               <p>Q. Who bid you go there?</p>
               <p>Simpson. Lamb told us to go there, to make a Movement in the Vault; to move Coffins to come at the Druin, that was stopp'd, in order to clean it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wooden Coffins, or leaden ones?</p>
               <p>Simpson. They were wooden, a great many of them, and many were rotten, and fell to pieces. I saw some of the Leaden Coffins cut to pieces by Mr Lamb's Son, which was by his Father's Direction. I saw three or four Coffins cut up. Mr Dew help'd to cut them up. The Lead was cut and carried to Mr Lamb's House. I carried some; he ask'd me to do it. All the Bearers carried some, and I carried some three Times. I never went but once of a Night, when we left off Work.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any Danger of these Coffins droping to pieces, if they were not cut?</p>
               <p>Simpson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any Quarrel between Lamb and Bilby?</p>
               <p>Simpson. There was Words arose between Lamb and Bilby about removing; Bilby said, he was robb'd of some of the Lead that he claim'd a Right to.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for the doing of this?</p>

I am a Bricklayer; Mr Barton sent for me on Friday the 11th of September, and told me, that he had great Complaint made by Mr Lamb of a Stoppage of the Drains in the Vault, so that it lay to the Mid-leg in Water; and that Lamb had told him, it could not be cleaned, without making a Hole in the Wall. Mr Barton directed me to go and examine it, which I did, and found it was as Mr Lamb had said, for the Drain which runs through the Vault was stopp'd, and I measured it, and found it was eighteen Inches deep in Water and Dirt, and that it could not be cleaned without removing some of the Coffins, and that it could not be done without making a Hole in the Wall; which he directed me to see done and gave me particular Orders that my Workmen should behave decently and soberly, and give no Offence.</p>

               <p>Robinson. A good Character.</p>
               <p>The Court, in summing up the Evidence to the Jury, observed to them, among other Things, That if any Thing could aggravate the Guilt of the Prisoners, it was their endeavouring to throw Dirt upon an innocent Man, who bore as good a Character as any one of his Function, or as any Gentleman in England. But as it generally happens to a Man of Honour, when falsly accused, there was not the least Proof to support these unjust Reflections; for it appear'd from the Evidence, that the Orders Mr Barton gave were necessary and right; and that he was so cautious, as to recommend it particularly to the Workmen to behave decently and soberly, whilst they were in the Vault.</p>

                        targets="t17471014-13-victim215 t17471014-13-viclabel67"/> Johns had received.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dead when you came?</p>
               <p>Grindal. No, he liv'd for two or three Days after. I found there was a Portion of the Sword left in his Body, about half an Hand's Breadth below the right Breast?</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of Wound had he receiv'd ?</p>
               <p>Grindal. A small Wound that was not big enough for my little Finger to go in; the Sword stuck so fast in, that it was with great Difficulty that I got it out. I imagin'd that it pass'd through the Liver, by the Symptoms he had afterwards, and I believe it be the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>Grindal. On Saturday in the Afternoon. I attended him twice a Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other Wound?</p>
               <p>Grindal. He had a small Wound upon his Nose but of no Consequence at all. When I took the Sword out it was nine Inches long, it was buried; we were forc'd to enlarge the Wound to get it out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came first to him, did you think him to be in danger ?</p>
               <p>Grindal. When I felt the Sword, I did conclude the Sword was within side of the Body, but without side of the Rib.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him, that he was in danger of Death?</p>
               <p>Grindal. He said he was not a bit afraid of Death; and he desir'd I would tell him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he thought himself in danger of Death, what did he tell you then ?</p>
               <p>Grindal. He told me, he was coming up Sandwich-Court between ten and eleven, and two Men, whom he imagin'd to be Jews, met him.</p>
               <p>Court. It was not light enough, I suppose, to see them?</p>

               <p>Grindal. He said, he could see the Colour of their Clothes and Stature. He first said, there was a Woman at the Corner of the Court, that ask'd him to give her something. He did not stay to speak to her: but when he came from the Woman they attack'd him, and took his Watch and Money from him. He let them go off quietly, but hearing some People coming towards him, he found he had the Prisoners between these People and himself, and he thought it proper to take one or both of them, and he cry'd out, Stop Thief. Upon which one of them return'd and gave him this Stab in the Body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe to you, what Man it was that gave him this Stab in the Body?</p>
               <p>Grindal. He told me, it was one of the Men that robb'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Grindal. There were Lamps light enough for him to see the Persons; and he told me, if he was to hear the Person speak again, he believ'd he could swear to the Man, there was something so particular in his Speech.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they brought before him?</p>
               <p>Grindal. They were, but I was not there.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant Lopez. Mr Grindal, did Captain Johns describe the Heighth of the Persons ?</p>
               <p>Grindal. Yes, Sir, he said one was a tall Man, and the other a short Man. I think, he said, a tall Man and a short Man, but I cannot charge my Memory with it, I am not positive to it.</p>

               <p>Love. The first Time was on Thursday Morning. I went four Times in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the other Time?</p>
               <p>Love. On Friday, my Lord; and I was twice with him on Saturday. The Occasion of my going on Saturday Morning was, as I was going by the Constable's Door he calls me into his Shop, and he said, that the Rascal had surrendered himself at the Poultry-Compter that we were in pursuit of. He said he could not go to the Compter, but I went, and when I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140029"/> there, I ask'd if any Person had surrender'd himself upon this Murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was this?</p>

            . When I was at the Compter he came to me, and I ask'd him, What he knew of this Murder? He said, he should know the Sword. I thought it would not signify for me to talk further with him, so I went and acquainted Captain Johns with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he should know the Sword?</p>
               <p>Love. Yes, he said he should know the Sword.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was with Captain Johns on Saturday Morning, how did appear to be?</p>
               <p>Love. He spoke very hearty, but he said, he believ'd the Sword had gone through his Liver; and he believ'd he should die. I told him, the Man that we had been in the Pursuit of, which I believ'd was the Person, had surrender'd himself at the Compter. I ask'd him, if he should have any Knowledge of the Man, if he should see him? He said, he believ'd he should. I ask'd him, If he was willing to see him? I stay'd a little after this, and ask'd him again, if he was willing to see him, now Alderman Rawlinson had been so good to examine this Person? So he said I might bring him to him. When I came the Marshal had taken him. When I came, to Youell I sends both our Beadles to Alderman Rawlinson, and he came presently. When he came there Mr Chattam, Clerk at Guild-hall, he came along with him. When we came up Stairs into the Room, the Alderman there, and every Thing was still, the Alderman ask'd Captain Johns, if he knew the Man? He look'd at him, and says, That is the Man that stabb'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did he look at?</p>
               <p>Love. There was only Youell there. Lopez was below.</p>
               <p>Court. When he said so, I suppose he gave some Reasons for it.</p>
               <p>Love. He was ask'd, if he knew the Man? And he said, that was the Man that stabb'd him. The Alderman walk'd to his Bedside, and said, You are a dying Man, I hope you will have a Regard how you speak. He said again, he is the Man that stabb'd me. With that Youell look'd

               <p>Q. Was he in his Senses?</p>
               <p>Love. He was in his Senses as much as any one in this Court. When Youell came down, before the Alderman, he declared he was not the Person that committed the Murder, but he was within twenty Yards of the Place when the Robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect Youell?</p>
               <p>Love. On Thursday Morning I heard of this Robbery committed so near me, I was going along by the Corner of the Dolphin Gate there was a Crowd of People, and a Woman in the midst of them; and they said, there was a Woman there that knew the two Men that had committed the Robbery and Murder, so I ask'd the Woman -</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know her Name?</p>
               <p>Love. Her Name is Eliz Delahughes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you ask her?</p>
               <p>Love. She was in Liquor, but I saw the Constable just by, and I charg'd the Constable with her, and had her to the Compter; this was on Thursday Morning. After we had her kept two or three Hours in the Compter she began to come to herself, and she said, she knew their Haunts, the bad Houses and Places where they use to reside. She said, she saw Lopez come into the Court at that very Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say nothing of Youell?</p>

               <p>Chattam. No, I was not with him the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what the Deceased said to Youell while you was there?</p>
               <p>Chattam. I ask'd the Deceased in Bed, if he knew the Prisoner that was before him? and he said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140030"/> was one of the Men that robb'd him, and one of the Men that stabb'd him, as I took it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this once or twice ?</p>
               <p>Chattam. He said it two or three times over; he said it to me when they were all gone out of the Room he desired me to stay.</p>
               <p>Court. The other Witness says, that Alderman Rawlinson put him in mind that he was a dying Man, and he desired him to mind what he said ?</p>
               <p>Chattam. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did he say any thing ?</p>
               <p>Chattam. Yes, my Lord, he repeated it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Prisoner say any thing ?</p>
               <p>Chattam. The Prisoner said in a very hasty manner, Are you sure I am the Man ? he answered, You are the Man. I ask'd the Deceased, How he was so positive to the Man? he told me, There was a Glimmering of Light from the Lamps that he could see pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by when he said there were Lights from the Lamps?</p>
               <p>Chattam. This Witness, Love, was gone down then; and he said, he could know him from his Voice too; the Deceased took hold of my Hand, he found he should not live long, and he desired this Man might be brought to Justice; and if his Watch was found, that it might be given to a Person that was then in the Room; then I went down to the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down, what did Youell say?</p>
               <p>Chattam. When he was told that the Captain was dead, he was struck with Horror, and desired to be admitted an Evidence. The Alderman asked what he had to say? He said, he was not the Man that stabb'd him, that did the Murder, but it was one Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he know of it did he say?</p>
               <p>Chattam. I don't know whether he quite confessed he was guilty of the Robbery, but wanted to be admitted an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lopez never up with the Deceased?</p>
               <p>Chattam. No, my Lord, they described him as a tall Man; and he said the other Man that was concerned with Youell was about his size, therefore the Deceased would not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr Love in the Room when he said that?</p>
               <p>Chattam. I believe they were all in the Room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Sword found?</p>
               <p>Chattam. It was found in the Court where the Captain was stabb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the other Piece, does that tally with it?</p>
               <p>Chattam. Yes, my Lord. [both were produc'd in Court.] When the Sword was shew'd to Youell at the Inn, he was then Handcuff'd, and he desired they might be taken off before he would speak; he was ask'd if that was not his Sword, and he look'd at it, and prevaricated pretty much, and said that his Sword was a little thicker and blacker; I believe that was all that he said.</p>
               <p>[Cross Examination.]</p>
               <p>Q. You say he prevaricated pretty much, so I presume he did not own it was his Sword, Did he deny that it was his Sword?</p>
               <p>Chattam. No, nor he did not deny it, but said that his Sword was a little thicker.</p>

On the Friday Morning before this Gentleman was stabb'd, I was going to my Work between six and seven o'Clock, and as my Master and I were talking, Youell comes by with that very Sword, he stood by me and play'd with it, he had abus'd a Gentlewoman just before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure or not sure that Youell had that Sword in his Hand the Friday before?</p>
               <p>White. My Lord, I took particular Notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk with him?</p>
               <p>White. Mr Ballard did talk to him; he said What, young Man, are you upon your guard; are you afraid the Constable will serve a Warrant against you for abusing the Woman? Then he said, Why do you carry that Sword? then Youell said, I want to have it made into a Tuck.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you had Talk with him about the Sword a pretty while; on Friday you saw the Sword, and on Wednesday Night the Fact was committed; had you any discourse with him after the Fact was committed ?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, on the Saturday Night.</p>
               <p>Court. That was after the Gentleman was dead?</p>
               <p>White. I had some Discourse with him after he came down from the Gentleman; I tax'd him with the Thing; I was left Centinel over him at the Dolphin.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>White. He said he was not the Man that stabb'd Mr Johns, but he said he was within twenty Yards of the Place, and a Dutch Boy had the Gentleman's Watch, that is, Hart the Jew, a Dutch Boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who it was that stabbed the Deceased?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140031"/>White. He did not say he stabb'd him, or the Dutch Boy stabb'd him, but he said the Dutch Boy had the Watch, and he was within 20 Yards of the Robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the Sword?</p>
               <p>White. When they told me of this Murder and Sword, I heard this Sword was dropp'd in the Court, and I went to see the Sword; the Gentlewoman had it that belongs to the Pork-shop where the Gentleman was carried in.</p>

               <p>Council. Was you at any time in the Bail-dock with the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>White. I went Yesterday just within the Door.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you not say, That if he, or his Mother, would not give you a Guinea, you would swear away My Life; and was you not turned out?</p>
               <p>[ The Prisoner said that White should say, he would swear by his Life, unless he would give him a Guinea Abraham, one of the Servants at Newgate, was call'd into Court, to know if he did not turn out White the Witness, from the Prisoner? he answered that he did, but he did not mind what Words pass'd]</p>

             the rest came, my Lord; and when Yo uell came into the Room, the Captain ordered the Curtains to be undrawn, and view'd him very narrowly for some time before he spoke; then, with a good deal of Resentment, he said, You barbarous Villain, you are the Rascal that stabb'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner spoke?</p>
               <p>Richardson. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Youell say?</p>
               <p>Youell the Prisoner. Sir, I will make my Affidavit I was elsewhere at the same time.</p>
               <p>Richardson. Capt. Johns said, Turn about, Friend, and flap your Hat, and put it on; now, says he, say, D - n your Eyes! says the Prisoner, I never could swear such an Oath in my Life; so I desired he would, for the Satisfaction of the Captain, repeat that Oath, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What said the Captain then?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I should have told your Lordship, there was something to do to make him talk; I made him talk as much as I could; when he had said, D - n your Eyes, the Captain said, You are the Villain that stabb'd me, I am positive on't.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put down his Hat and flap it ?</p>
               <p>Hogskins. He did before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Youell give him any Answer when he said, You are the Villain that stabb'd me?</p>
               <p>Hogskins. He said nothing. Captain Johns said, I declare he is the Man; I know him by his Stature, I know him by his Habit, and by his Voice; this was about an Hour and a Half before Captain Johns died; he might die about half an Hour after five; about an Hour after this first time, Alderman Rawlinson came down; then he had another fight of him; he then declared that he was the Man. Then I ask'd him about Lopez, and whether he would see him. I told him that we had got a tall thin Man that was much suspected: He said he would not, for the Person who was a Confederate with him (Youell) was of his Stature, rather broader set than the Prisoner at the Bar; he said, I will not see that tall Man, for I am sure it was no such Person. After Alderman Rawlinson had taken the Examination, one told me, that Youell desired to speak with me in private, and that he would speak with no body else; I went to him, and we went into a private Room together, and Youell burst into Tears, and said, For God's sake Mr Marshal, use your best Endeavours to take

Hart, says he, was the Man that gave the Blow, and for my own part I was forc'd into it: I was forc'd to assist in the robbing; he ran after me with a long Knife, and threatened to stab me if I would not go a robbing with him. Then I went down with him to the Alderman, and there he did prevaricate; he said he was within twenty Yards? Word was brought down that Captain Johns was dead; then I suppose he thought there could be no Evidence against him. My Lord, here is one material thing I ought to declare the Truth with regard to Lopez; I said, though we had not got Hart, yet if Lopez had the Watch, he might be some way concerned; he could say nothing to take away the Life of an innocent Man.</p>

            . On the 15th of September my Wife and my Boy stood at St Andrew's Church-Gate, and they call'd and show'd him to me. They said, he is the Person we suspect that stole our first Glass from us. I said to my Apprentice, go you out four or five Doors up the Hill, and stand at a Distance, and see if he takes any Thing. The Prisoner cross'd the Way two or three Times; and he comes to the Picture Shop, the next Door, there he stood and look'd at the Pictures, and peep'd if there was any Body in my Shop; presently afterwards he goes by the Door, and a Person in the Kitchen said Mr Ward, There is your Chap gone by the Door. Accordingly my Wife whipp'd pretty fast along the Shop, and look'd over the Window, and miss'd this Glass. She put her Head out at the Door, and she saw him put the Glass under his Coat. She ran out of the Door, and took him by the Flap of his Coat, and cry'd out, Thief, Thief. Accordingly I ran out and seiz'd him by the Collar, and brought him in.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to him, what was he doing?</p>
               <p>Ward. He was putting of it under the Flap of his Coat. When I brought him into the Shop, I said, Have I caught you at last? I charg'd him with the other Glass. He said, he knew nothing of the Matter; nor he did not design to steal this, but took it down to wipe the Dust off. Accordingly I sent for an Officer, and carried him before the Sitting Alderman at Guildhall. There he confess'd he took it, and he was committed to Newgate. He sent for me to Newgate, and desir'd me to show him all the Favour that I could. I said you had have got another Glass of mine, and how can you expect any Favour from me? He confess'd he stole another Glass the second of September, and sold it in Moorfields. The Value of this Glass was 7 s. and the Value of the other 25 s. that was unfinish'd. According to his Direction I goes to the Broker, and found the Glass, and I ask'd him the Price of it. He ask'd 20 s. for it. I said the Glass was my Property, and if you will not send it home I will get a Warrant. The Broker is one

When she did speak she declared, that when they were in the Field he threw her down upon the Grass, and stopp'd her Mouth with an Handkerchief, and it did appear that he had carnal Knowledge of her. She said, she cry'd out Murder several Times; and that there were People in the Field, but were at a great Distance, and none came to her Assistance. She was ask'd, how she could cry out if her Mouth was stopp'd? She answer'd, she got the Handkerchief on one side, and could cry out, and the young Child was playing about upon the Grass at the same Time. The Prisoner, she said, came home with her afterwards, and she never told her Mother of it for near a Month, for fear she should beat her, and then it was by Discovery the Mother had made of the Child's Disorder. It appear'd that this young Villain had given this Child the foul Disease; it seems he work'd all that Month, in the Yard where this Child and her Parents lived; afterwards she was ask'd, If he ever attempted any such thing afterwards? She answered, No. These being the Circumstances, it was not proved to the Satisfaction of the Court that it was a Rape; he coming Home with the Child: she making no Discovery of it, till she was forced to it; and his continuing to work in the Yard; on these Accounts the Prisoner, who richly deserved severe Punishment, was <rs id="t17471014-15-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

I did suppose she had stole them. I sent to Mr Forth, my Neighbour, to know if he had lost any thing; in the mean time she tore the Mark off, and went into Mr Wilson's to pawn them, and there she was took. She told me she dealt in them, and she went about the Street to sell them; I said there were Shopkeepers, I did not chuse to deal with such. She was taken before Justice Poulson, and she confess'd she took them out of Mr Forth's Shop.</p>

               <p>Mr Camden the Younger, the first Witness, the Amount of his Evidence was this, that he had left 600 l. in his Compting-house this Evening. The Compting-house is in the Sugar-house, parted with a slight Partition. He said, when he had to the Value of 100 l. he generally carried it to the Dwelling-house, and put it into an Iron Chest. Therefore it was thought a little extraordinary, that he should venture 600 l. there this Night. The Compting-house Door, it appear'd, by two or three Witnesses, was open in the Morning; but neither of them could say, they saw the Prisoner in the Compting-House, neither did they find any Thing upon him, &amp;c.</p>

I can't say I heard her go. There was none brought, but she went down directly, and we waited in the Room about half a Minute. After she was gone out I said, I will go out and see what is become of this Woman. We went down Stairs directly, and ask'd, Where was the Woman that came down Stairs? The Woman said to us, she did not know the Woman, neither did she belong to her House.</p>

               <p>Manly. The Landlady. The Woman of the House, I believe. My Lord, we went out directly. I put my Hand in my Pocket, and I miss'd my Money. This Man, that was along with me, said, we will find this Woman out. We went into another House facing of it, and there were several Women there; and I said, there was a Woman very like this Woman. Another Woman came with a Candle in her Hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174710140038"/> and said, Am I the Woman? So this Woman hearing this she run through a small Door and got off.</p>

               <p>Manly. No, another Woman. This Richard Davis follow'd this Woman, but that other Woman was gone. Just as I was coming out of that House facing this Woman's, where I lost the Woman, this Woman, that over-run us in that House, fell through a Skylight, and broke the Window down; we took that Woman upon Suspicion, but this Woman, the Prisoner, I was in Company with, and no other Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason have you for charging the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Manly. She was in Company with us, and because her Hand was busy about my Pocket; that is the Reason I charge this Woman.</p>
